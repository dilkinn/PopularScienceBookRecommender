We would meet in cafés in South Kensington or Holland Park to mull over the problem. THE ROOT OF ALL THE EVIL WAS CLEARLY SPECIAL RELATIVITY. All these paradoxes resulted from well-known effects such as length contraction, time dilation, or E=mc², all basic predictions of special relativity. And all denied the possibility of establishing a well-defined border, common to all observers, capable of containing new quantum gravitational effects.""In “Faster Than the Speed of Light” (p. 250) by João Magueijo.There was no “cause and effect axiom” in 1905. The two axioms from which Einstein deduced special relativity were the principle of relativity and the constancy of the speed of light. The falsehood of the second axiom killed physics, as suggested in the above quotation. Uhm…Come again?"

2,0738205257,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11153042-phiann,1,"This is the worst book I have ever read. Actually, I could not even finish it and I was trying really hard because I had promised a friend I would read it. (Sorry, DC...)The style in which this book is written makes me angry. What the author wants you to think when you buy or lend this book is that he is going to tell you about things in physics that he thinks marvelous. What the author really is telling you is how great he is, what a wonderful person, what a good physicist. And you... a reader... Who are you to be compared to a real scientist?As in almost every book on public science there are two parts forming parallel the content. The first is about the scientists themselves, a little bit about the times they were living in and -- in particular here -- about the events in the life of the author that made him write the present book. After the introduction of a scientist he will be called only by his first name. So reading another book again you would never recognize this scientist by his name. To me personally it seems right-away disrespectful.The second part speaks about cosmology. An author of a such book has to explain things right from the beginning. Actually, this is the only good thing I can say about this book, it is the order of the things to be explained, so far I can tell.* Unfortunately when it comes to explaining itself the author fails completely. The simpler things get a lot of text. The simpler the point the more text. The complicated matters are hardly explained or not at all. Such an example is the sudden appearing paragraph about a discussion about the Minkowski space. Of course, without any further explanation. (There have never been any notion about it before nor after -- at least not on the 30 pages later.*) It seems to me that the author do not want you to understand the theories. He wants you to admire him that HE does.If you are really looking for a book about cosmology to read you will do best to ignore the mere existence of this one. It will kill a mere wish to read another book about physics ever again.-----* See the second sentence of this review."

5,0738205257,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,1,"The speed of light in a vacuum is supposed to be constant in all time frames. That is the basis of the theory of relativity. Joao Magueijo is a theoretical physicist that supports the Variable Speed of Light (VSL) theory in this book. While the book is not about the theory itself, he does talk a lot about various aspects of cosmology to provide some background.So if the book is not about the theory itself, then what is it about? Faster Than the Speed of Light focuses on the bias of scientists and how difficult it is to introduce a dissenting theory. I imagine it would help if there was an experiment that a scientist could conduct to verify this theory, but if he mentions it in the book, I didn’t get that far.Basically, scientists have evidence that the Big Bang was the founding event of the universe as we know it. This is something that we all agree on, there is the Cosmic Background Microwave Radiation to back it up and there is the redshifting of the galaxies in the sky. So the idea is that space itself is expanding. However, in the early years of the universe, it is thought that the universe was opaque while the particles and matter cooled down to a state that light could travel through. So it was theorized that the universe underwent a period of rapid expansion. So Magueijo postulates that his VSL theory would solve some intractable problems in physics, and bring about a Grand Unified Theory.Even when I picked up this book, I didn’t expect this to be covered. From the title, I assumed it was going to talk about a theoretical method of time travel or maybe it would cover the Tachyon. I didn’t particularly like this book. It isn’t that the book isn’t charming, or that it doesn’t have any British Wit. No, the main problem is that he talks about how this theory is supposed to solve everything but doesn’t show what he’s talking about. It is more of a memoir than anything else since it mainly focuses on the history of the VSL theory. It sort of gets into science by talking about a dream that Einstein had about cows. I do understand in one sense; even though Einstein has become a household name and everyone is familiar with him, he was still a human being prone to making mistakes. So if this theory does hold water in some ways, then what is the problem? Maybe it is a generation too early. I mean, how much energy are we talking about when we need to see light have a different value for c? So in that sense, the book was frustrating. He never gets to the point and I couldn’t get into it."
6,0738205257,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"Personal & Spiritual Journey of a Cosmologist in the Discovery of VSL TheoryThis is a fascinating story of a young cosmologist who dared to challenge Einstein's most sacred laws of physics; the speed of light in vacuum is a universal constant. In human experience; space and time are perceived as universally rigid, but Einstein proposed that space & time; space-time could expand or contract but speed of light remains unchanged. On occasions many physicists have wondered, and debated that Varying Speed of Light (VSL) is an alternative explanation to inflation theory. A notable proponent is John Moffat who first expressed this idea to none other than father of relativity himself. Einstein responded by saying that ""Every individual has to retain his way of thinking if he does not want to get lost in the maze of possibilities. However, nobody is sure of having taken the right road.... myself least of all."" At another instance, Einstein said that ""We are standing in front of a closed box which cannot open, and we try to discuss what is inside and what is not."" The idea of VSL proposed by this author is not new, but he is one of those who made the theory a little more mainstream in physics. The first half of the book (chapter 2 - 6) discusses the current cosmological problems and inflation theory in layman terms, and in the second half, the author discusses his personal struggles in the pursuit of his controversial theory. He unleashes his mind and heart on any thing that matters; scientific bureaucracy, peer reviewing process, research-grant award mechanism, science administrators, and fellow scientists. The academic rat race is vividly explained along with his leftist and liberal leanings on political and social issues. He expresses cynicism against American and Russian scientists; a reflection of British educational system which refuses to forget 1776 and uncomfortable to admit scientific and technical superiority of another country. The horizon effect of earth is due to its curvature, but the horizon of the universe is due to two factors; a definite age of the universe (13.7 billion years) and speed of light is constant. A consequence of this is when the universe was one second old, when it is known to have started expanding; the radius of the horizon was 300,000 kilometers. This suggests that the universe at its infancy had regions that did not have direct contact with each other, and thus can not explain the observed homogeneity of the universe (horizon problem). The second puzzle in cosmology is the flatness problem; the fate of the universe due to the dynamics of expansion, which results in three possible shapes; spherical, hyper-spherical (saddle shaped), and flat surface. When forces of expansion and gravity of the universe are matched, then the universe will neither collapse in a crunch nor does it expand endlessly leaving the universe in dark vacuum. This balanced state of the universe is highly unstable because the two opposing forces are nearly matched, when the natural tendency is that either the force of expansion or gravity takes control of the universe to increase entropy (Second law of Thermodynamics). This seemingly peculiar state of the universe is not clearly explained by the current cosmological models which call for a reexamination and perhaps reconsideration of existing theories. VSL Model; at critical density of the universe, the density of matter that produces gravitational energy is equal to the density of matter producing expansion. In a closed universe (spherical shape), the mass density is above critical density, therefore gravitation supersedes; simultaneously the energy is lost due to a decrease in the speed of light under VSL model (correspondingly mass also decreases since E = MC(2)). Similarly for an open universe, energy is created (correspondingly mass also increases) from vacuum in the wake of expansion from an increase in the speed of light. Thus the universe gravitates to a flat universe in both closed and open situations but violating law of energy conservation (First law of Thermodynamics), because the total energy of the universe did not remain constant. VSL also explains the horizon problem. In VSL model; regions of the universe, which are denser will loss energy, whereas energy will be created in a sparse regions of the universe thereby maintaining homogeneity. One of the properties of the cosmological constant is that vacuum energy is not diluted by expansion in contrast to matter and radiation. It is gravitationally repulsive and the energy density remains constant upon dilution: Expansion dilutes the lambda energy, but tension created by expansion makes up for the energy dilution thus balancing the power of expansion and gravity and thus keeping the universe flat. Hence vacuum energy theoretically must dominate the universe during expansion, but VSL model suppresses that by converting vacuum energy into matter. Other predictions of VSL include that near black holes the speed of light is zero at the horizon, and it also predicts in an eternal universe with no beginning and no end. Since the cosmic expansion is accelerating and cosmological constant lambda is responsible for slowing the speed of light since a sharp decrease in speed of light converts vacuum energy into ordinary matter and this result in conditions for new Big Bang. The cycle of new creation begins all over again. The negative side of VSL is the violation of energy conservation, but it provides for converting vacuum energy into the matter. This model also favors infinite speed of light during Planck epoch in order to explain the horizon problem. It is proposed that the primordial speed of light would be 32 zeros added to the current value (an extreme scenario for the varying speed of light!). There are several versions of VSL including two alternatives from the authors work. Ultimately experimental evidence should favor one VSL model over all others. Although the author mainstreamed this theory in physics but his shabby literature search ignored the work of John Moffat who must get the credit for the discovery of VSL theory. "
7,0738205257,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10404161-alex-shrugged,4,"This is a book about challenging the scientific establishment and kicking them right in the backside, several times, to get them to do their jobs. Meanwhile we get to learn about science, the current thinking and alternatives to that thinking. It is written is reasonably understandable English. The author is Portuguese, and he needed a little help but I suspect not a whole lot. I've seen him on TV. He can handle himself.Any problems? He tends to kick the establishment in the shorts a little more than I would like to see. He takes it personally, and at times it is a little embarrassing. Nevertheless, he is correct. The scientific establishment is moribund. An modesty issues? Yes. He uses the S-word more often than I think is necessary. However he saves this for the last half of the book. He also quotes someone who uses the F-word. I've seen worse.I'd read this book again for it's look into how scientists stop science from happening mostly through incompetence or personal/professional jealousy."

12,0738205257,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20068424-helen,4,"Ok, so this book was extremely challenging, and, thus, I am extremely proud of myself for making it through the whole thing. The physics in this book was definitely difficult to comprehend fully. Going in, I hoped that because I am a generally science-minded person and took physics in college, it wouldn't be too bad. I'm sure if the subject matter had overlapped, that would have helped. However, this is definitely not general physics. It's not motion and forces and the arc of a thrown baseball. It is the physics of the universe as a whole.Here, I must give the author a great deal of credit. He explained some extremely difficult and meta concepts in a very down-to-earth, fairly easy to grasp with a little work manner. For the first time, I actually feel like I understand relativity. Even cosmic rays and the shape and expansion of the universe as a whole seem much easier to conceptualize. The author, thankfully, spent a great deal of time explaining base cosmology concepts fully - he even used cows and pictures! Not gonna lie, that part was really nice and was actually very useful. At the same time, the farther into the book one traveled, the new concepts he introduced received less and less explanation. So, those concepts became much more difficult to comprehend. As soon as he arrived at the discussion of multiple dimensions and string, loop, and M-theory I definitely started to lose him a bit. However, these concepts were less relevant to the overall focus of the book, so I fully understand why he spent less time explaining them.One of my favorite things about this book, though, was the author's hysterical personality. Some of the other reviewers touted this as a negative, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I even texted my friends various quotes that were just too hysterical not to share. Yes, the author is exceptionally anti-establishment and makes it known, but his humor is off the wall. Some of the analogies he uses or his rants were so stellar and random and out there I found myself bursting out laughing. As much as this is not the normal tone of non-fiction, academic books, I appreciated it in this case because the purpose of this book was not to teach physics concepts but to relay the story of this person's own theory. Thus, his personality and life are a part of the story. I felt like I definitely gained a good sense of the author and his own personal voice.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking to learn more about physics and cosmology. While it is not the most accessible thing I've ever read, it is definitely understandable if you go in willing to put in a little effort to fully comprehend what is being said. It's worth the work. Having finished the book, it was challenging and by the end I was ready for it to be finished, but I am also happy I read it and do feel like I have a much greater sense of modern cosmology. If anyone ever brings this subject up at a holiday/work/cocktail party, I will be fully prepared to wow them all with my knowledge!"
13,0738205257,http://goodreads.com/user/show/783966-malcolm,4," I love reading about advances in theoretical physics but it has to be a book by someone who can interpret this difficult and sometimes arcane subject for the layman. Joao Magueijo is such an author and he combines his training and research with great skill writing in a layman friendly way, and even combines a fair bit of insider stuff and humour about the world of theoretical physics.  In particular, he gives a nice overview of the problems and discoveries in theoretical physics from Newton until the present. Much of it focuses upon discoveries in the 20th century made by Einstein and his peers. The focus of the book is the authors long-standing idea that many of the current roadblocks and current problems physicists struggle with today might be explained if we realize that in fact the speed of light has not always been constant, and may not be constant even now under certain very special circumstances. The implications of this idea towards the goal of unification of the various forces into one grand design are profound.  It also suggests that in fact, we may be able to travel faster than light under special circumstances such as pathways adjacent to cosmic strings where the laws of physics are different. Inter-galactic travel may eventually be possible after all within human lifetime if he is correct.  We learn a great deal about the author and his love of Science from an early age.He is an original thinker who struggled for many years with sharing this insight about the speed of light as if flies in the face of several essential givens in physics. I read this book in two days and was sorry to finish. It has enough Science to engage and explain but not so much to drown us. The author uses metaphors and stories to illustrate Scientific points and this helps us make sense of the formulae.  I recommend this book highly if you love Science, Theoretical physics, Cosmology, as well as the inevitable politics and scuttlebutt in the world of Science.

14,0738205257,http://goodreads.com/user/show/334550-debbi-mack,4,"I was inspired to read FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT after seeing a special on the Science Channel in which Joao Magueijo explained his theory about the speed of light not being constant. He developed the theory that light may have moved faster when the universe was created than it does now, as a way of explaining certain paradoxes about the ""Big Bang"" theory that have confounded cosmologists (scientists who study the origins of the universe--not to be confused with cosmetologists) for decades. Since this theory contradicts one of the long-held tenets of Einstein's special theory of relativity (that the speed of light is constant), Magueijo's work was widely pooh-poohed and he was called quite a few bad names for his efforts--as I recall, words like ""moron"" and ""heretic"" had been tossed about.Needless to say, I was intrigued. I had to find out more.See, once upon a time (so long ago, it seems like another lifetime), I studied physics and even took a course in relativity. In fact, the idea of studying cosmology--understanding how everything was created--seemed incredibly appealing. I was ultimately done in by the math. It just turned out not to be my thing. Words are my thing. I turned to them instead.I approached this book with some trepidation, concerned that it would be far too technical for me to enjoy after lo these many years of not doing hard science. Turns out I had nothing to worry about, because this book is about more than just science. It's about the people who do the science: how they work; how they collaborate, clash and compete with one another; and the resistance they encounter from various quarters when they take their theories to the bleeding edge and explore strange and controversial new possibilities. In short, it's about the human drama associated with science, along with the theory Magueijo created.See my complete review at http://thebookgrrl.blogspot.com/2008/..."
15,0738205257,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24365393-vladimir,3,"I'm not an expert on the subject but as an engineer I understand physics and mathematics behind it in general. I opted for engineering studies instead of physics which was my first choice because I had a feeling that physics seemed to be spinning in circles rather than progressing. It appeared to me as overwhelmed by an infatuation for following the lead of ""beauty"" in the equations which are supposed to be a tool. Also it does not relate to real world problems nowadays as much as it used to. I might have been right or wrong, it was just my view. This book gave me another good insight into the current state of affairs in cosmology, which I appreciate. Second part is an intriguing outline of the prospects offered if one of the hard barriers in modern science, the speed of light, is allowed to vary under some circumstances, and explains where consequent mathematics has lead the authors. It opened up to them the world of possibilities, many of them beyond the technology available to many generations to come. Nevertheless, based on other books that I read I'm prone to believe that there may be a lot of wishful thinking in the theory, considering that we do not know why the speed of light is what it is and what else in the Universe must change if it changes. Nevertheless, science compels us to keep an open mind and I will be looking for news of any experimental feedback with interest. I should note that especially second part of the book is really unconventionally written, exposing some drastic views and attitudes towards the scientific establishment and unusual, passionate language, which may turn away some of the readers or change their perspective of the worthiness and seriousness of the underlying material. Considering my own view of the status quo in modern physics, there is room for criticism but I do not approve of the manner used here."
16,0738205257,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3471648-alana,3,"This is Magueijo's telling of how he dared to challenge Einstein on the constancy of the speed of light and confront physics by introducing a new Varying Speed of Light (VSL) theory. This is like breaking one of the ten commandments of physics, and his perseverance in the name of science is admirable. The background and details of the theory aren't too mathy and are conveyed in a manner that makes them accessible to the average reader, I'd say (though, I do have a background in physics, so perhaps I'm just out of touch with what the ""average"" reader might experience in this context). The main part of the story is not an explanation of the theory, itself, however; it's about the getting there, the ""fumbling in the dark, trying and trying and more often than not failing spectacularly, but always being madly in love with your quest."" Unfortunately, it's also about how incredibly dull a career in physics can be and how archaic the whole upper education system is with its red tape and its ""academic departmental dinosaurs."" Magueijo speaks liberally of his anarchist views and harshly criticizes the system at every turn. Though entertaining at first, I felt it became tedious and disruptive to the story. And though I am certainly not one to wince at the use of coarse language, I do feel his crass tone is at times inappropriate for a scientific read. On the one hand, it helps the reader to recognize that ""hey, physicists are normal people, too,"" but on the other, it detracts somewhat from his scientific credibility. Ultimately, I enjoyed the story, and if you're looking for a semi-casual telling of a remarkable scientific journey, then I would highly recommend this book."
17,0738205257,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1670648-lori,3,"Mainly an insider’s account of the politics of academia, this book describes the author’s struggle to develop and publish his varying speed of light theory (VSL) that, if correct, may explain two paradoxes that arise from the Big Bang theory, the “horizon” and “flatness” problems. The first half of the book provides an excellent foundational discussion of relativity, but second half fails to address VSL in any detailed way and instead deteriorates into an expletive-laced rant about the bureaucracy of academia, the stupidity of journal editors, and the herd mentality that permeates the research community. This is a good book for students interested in the inner workings of academia but look elsewhere for a scientific treatment of this theory."

TRY READING THISbook. I did and I'm not sorry.
I'm on page 65. So far there are some good explanations of Einstein's special and general relativity that I haven't seen elsewhere, and I've probably read a lot more physics books than the average non-physicist.--Not a bad book, but it wasn't what I expected when I picked it up. Magueijo does write about his theories, but he also gives extensive space to the politics of being a researcher. Some of the stories about getting articles into journals are pretty amusing. Magueijo's frustrations of dealing with publications and politics come through clearly. "

Simple enough for the non-physics oriented to follow, without losing the essential details.The second half outlines the development of the varying speed of light theory, focusing as much on the people involved as on the science. It provides a nice account of the actual scientific climate, complete with absolute scorn for publishers and imagined terrorist attacks on university administration buildings."

Read it to understand things you thought you already had the gist of — read it to go behind the curtain where “sweaty” thinking is both inanely tormented and lovingly pursued — read it because it’s damn good writing and goes brilliantly with a glass of wine, trip to Goa, long flight beyond the mundane."
