0,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549698-nathan,5,"The challenge of science writing is making an abstract description of the motion of water particles relevant to a monkey whose language evolved to tell other monkeys where the ripe fruit is. Pretor-Pinney has managed to do something I'd have bet was impossible: make clouds interesting. Before I read this book, clouds were a mess of undifferentiated Latin words and undifferentiated puffy shit in the sky. Now I look up and see physics made incarnate. It's like I've been given a superpower. Now *that's* science writing!The author pulls off this improbable task by finding a hook to hang each cloud from. None are as mind-boggling as the second chapter, cumulo-nimbus, where the hook is a pilot who had to bail from an experimental airplane ... through one of those monster thunderhead storm clouds. The conditions he experienced inside the cloud are the tangible manifestation of the physics behind the scenes.Ten minutes into his descent, Rankin should have been reaching the ground, but the enormous draughts of air that surged up the core of the cloud were retarding his fall. Soon the turbulence became much more severe. He had no visual point of reference in the gloomy depths but he sensed that, rather than falling, he was being shot upwards with successive violent gusts of rising air–blasts that were becoming increasingly violent. And then for the first time he felt the full force of the cloud.‘It came with incredible suddenness–and fury. It hit me like a tidal wave of air, a massive blast, fired at me with the savagery of a cannon…I went soaring up and up and up as though there would be no end to its force.’ Rankin wasn’t the only one being hurled up and down. In the darkness around him, hundreds of thousands of hailstones were suffering the same fate. One minute they were falling downwards, dragging air down with them; the next minute, they were swept back up by the enormous convection currents within the cloud.With this falling and rising, the hailstones picked up freezing water and grew in size, hardening layer by layer like gobstoppers. These rocks of ice pelted Rankin with bruising force. He was now vomiting from the violent spinning and pounding and he shut his eyes, unable to watch the nightmare unfolding. At one point, however, he did open them to find himself looking down a long black tunnel burrowing through the centre of the cloud. ‘This was nature’s bedlam,’ he said, ‘an ugly black cage of screaming, violent, fanatical lunatics…beating me with big flat sticks, roaring at me, screeching, trying to crush me or rip me with their hands.’ Then the lightning and thunder began.The lightning appeared as huge, blue blades, several feet thick, which felt as though they were slicing him in two. The booming claps of thunder, caused by the explosive expansion of the air as the enormous electrical charge passed through, were so overpowering up close that they were more like physical impacts than noises. ‘I didn’t hear the thunder,’ he said, ‘I felt it.’ Sometimes he had to hold his breath to avoid drowning from the dense torrents of freezing rain. At one point he looked up just as a bolt of lightning passed behind his parachute. It lit up the canvas, which appeared to the exhausted pilot as an enormous, white-domed cathedral. As the image lingered above him, he thought that he had finally died.With headings like ""how it feels to be a hailstone"" and a look at the Renaissance representations of clouds in art, he manages to take his subject seriously while never losing track of the mystery and wonder that causes people to look at clouds in the first place. Highly recommended."

Even now when I go back home (Utah), I'm amazed at how much more dramatic the sky often seems compared to where I currently live. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending upon how you look at it), Los Angeles seems to have rather boring skies - clear and blue, day after day after day. Except for those darn jet contrails...This was a very pleasant book that looks at 10 main cloud types. Pretor-Pinney discusses the different variations and how they form, and he does it all in a very casual manner - no stuffy textbook here! The book is loaded with anecdotes and amusing asides, which made it a charming read but also a little tedious at times. And he can find the silver lining of any cloud, even the heavy and oppressive nimbostratus. And yes, he even discusses those darn jet contrails, the man-made cloud graffiti on the heavens. In fact, he discusses it at great length; not just the environmental aspects and why they seem to linger longer than they used to, but he takes that topic down a rabbit hole about cloud seeding. Overall, a charming and pleasant if occasionally meandering book - the kind you want to own so you can pull it out every once in a while. (3.5 stars)"
2,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/226812-stephanie,5,"It's been a while since I enjoyed a book so much. I was initially attracted by the cover design; once I saw what the book was about, my interest increased somewhat, but was still on the mild side. Once I got a chapter or so in, I was totally hooked: Gavin Pretor-Pinney's passion for his subject is contagious, and he has written what could have been a dry scientific tome with humor and a fine eye for the right stories to tell. However, don't let all this distract from the factual information at hand: he gives easy to follow explanations for how various kinds of clouds form, and one page ""cheat sheets"" on each kind of cloud -- how to identify it, how do you know it's not another kind of cloud, and what the various varieties are. Though the pictures -- contributed by Cloud Appreciation Society members -- are mostly black and white, they amply illustrate the clouds and associated features. A science book that anyone can appreciate."
3,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2991985-fatima,5,"This book ranks high amongst those that have influenced my life. I am now constantly looking at clouds, trying to figure out what they are, how they were formed, where they are going, what weather they will cause. Beautifully written, Pretor-Pinney makes poetry out of clouds; he waxes eloquently on a subject he is clearly intensely passionate about. To make that passion so infectious is a gift. I am a geographer, also passionate about much of earth science, and have read many books on a range of earth-science related topics. This is one of the few that ranks as a literary work. It is a perfect mix of science, fable and wonder. Read it. Open your eyes and mind to the skies above."
4,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1892224-siri,4,"Hey, I finally finished this book! It's been my bathroom read for, what...one year?So *mild spoiler* on p. 261 of this paperback, there is a picture of a bunch of scientists from General Electric labs (circa 1946) peering over a cloud seeding chamber. One of them, the book casually mentions, is named Bernard Vonnegut. If you're like me, part of you continues reading, and the other part of your brain goes, ""*Bernard* Vonnegut?! And he looks like Kurt Vonnegut! I wonder if they're related!"" Well, this is the kind of author who tells you (six pages later) that oh yes, by the way, that was Kurt's brother AND Kurt worked at GE Labs for a brief time in the PR Dept. ...AND the chemical process in Cat's Cradle bears a strong resemblance to the actual process of cloud seeding that Bernard was working on. I was giddy with glee by that point. *end mild spoiler*This author goes off on many interesting asides, and interjects a lot of his own personal warmth and humor into what could be a very dry book on the wet woollies of the sky. And something tells me Gavin Pretor-Pinney would make an excellent quizzo player."
5,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2410849-juliet-wilson,5,"This book takes each cloud type in turn and gives the details of what it typically looks like, where and when it can found and what type of precipitation (snow, heavy rain, hail, drizzle etc) it gives rise to. It also outlines some tips on weather forecasting by describing how one type of cloud can become another.Alongside all the science the author makes it clear that clouds are to be appreciated for their beauty (apart perhaps from stratus, the low, dull, misty cloud that even the most ardent cloud appreciator has been known to describe as boring).He also has plenty of stories to share about clouds, including that of Lt Col William Rankin a US Air Force pilot who had to eject from his plane above a storm cloud and spent 40 minutes being buffetted by the weather as he fell through a storm.This is a totally fascinating book for anyone who is interested in our 'little fluffy friends' as Pretor-Pinney calls them. I think I'll need to read it a few times though before I can be sure of telling the difference between some of the cloud types let alone starting to forecast the weather!"
6,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2096397-book-soup,3,"Good stuff, but tricky to put down and pick up. If I had a solid chunk of time to luxuriate in this, I am sure it would be 4 stars. Great information interspersed with engaging stories connected to clouds. I am still plowing along with great satisfaction.--Caroline"
7,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2029794-sam-barry,4,"This is one of those books you didn't think you wanted to or needed to read, but once you have, you're glad you did."
8,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21201686-ganesh-ubuntu,5,"'The Cloudspotters Guide' reminded me about my childhood when I was reading fascinating books on science for children and teenagers. These lively books from a local library were a stark contrast to the boring, dry, and lifeless textbooks we were given in school. I sometimes wonder if there is a special selection process for the authors of school textbooks to make sure that the only people admitted to do the job hate both science and children with passion. Anyway, back to the review.'The Cloudspotters Guide' could as well be an example of how to approach creating a good school textbook that grabs student's attention and doesn't let it go until the last page. It is crafted in a very accessible language that is easy to understand and to remember, so by the end of it even the Latin names of the clouds are memorised and jump out any time I look at the sky. It never goes into the science dives for too long to get a brain tired and they are always followed by a historical or a cultural anecdote. Each chapter is sprinkled with humour and, while to my taste it wasn't funny enough to laugh, being of a quality of some ordinary dad jokes, it did bring out a warm smile here and there.I would not recommend this book for those people who are looking for a more technical and less fluffy description of the meteorological processes. 'The Cloudspotters Guide' is too light for that. It's target audience is not the meteo-nerds - there are enough books for those already. It is for the less serious of us, who just want to be a little bit more savvy at reading and understanding the sky. And after reading the book I am definitely exercising my neck way more often than I used to!"
9,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,4,"So, this is a book about clouds. Really. With a chapter each on Cumulus, Cumulonimbus, Stratus, Stratocumulus, Altocumulus...there's a lot of latin, actually. And a lot of dry humor. And not a few puns. This has got to be the all-time geekiest book I have ever read.Ok, so some of it is not quite as geeky. For example, the story of Lt.-Col. William Rankin, the only human to fall all 47,000 feet through a full-on, cumulonimbus thunderstorm full of rain, hail, and lightning, and survive. The part where he was looking down at his own belly and the pressure changes had caused it to swell up to look like he was pregnant, was a bit disturbing. But most of the book is a lot less dramatic than that.To be honest, the latin made my head spin. I found the black-and-white drawings of the various cloud types to be useful, but knowing that a cloud was ""cirrocumulus stratiformis undulatus"" didn't tell me much, even after I'd read the definitions. The fact that it was called ""mackerel sky"" by sailors also didn't tell me much. The picture helped a lot, though, and the story of the author wandering through a fishmarket in London trying to find a mackerel to compare it to was cool. The author is clearly a wingnut, and just my kind of person.There are some weird kinds of clouds out there, and he tells us about them. The most impressive is probably the ""morning glory"", which is a sort of cloud version of good surf, that hits the southern shore of Australia and which hangliders ride for miles.The author does a good discussion of clouds in Renaissance paintings, as well (Piero della Francesca did a good altocumulus lenticularis, and he approved of Correggio choosing to portray Jupiter - who impregnated the nymph Io in the form of a cloud - as a sort of dark grey cumulus congestus).The best part of the book, though, are the chapters wherein he talks about the relatively mundane clouds that we see every month, and (in his opinion at least) do not pay enough attention to. I admit, I cannot name the latin term for any cloud in the sky after reading this book. But I do look at them a lot more, and they are cooler than anything on your TV, including the clouds. Go look up at them. And take this book with you."
10,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1664750-connie-kuntz,5,"I started this four months ago in January. I checked it out from the library. I loved it from page one, but it was hard for me to (a) remember all the detail and (b) move on after I did learn the detail. I renewed the library book until I was no longer allowed to do so. I returned it and then whined about my loss for a week. Jesse then surprised me with my own copy of the book, which I now take with me everywhere I go. The author, a Brit, writes beautifully and scientifically about clouds. He includes many poets and artistic references, and uses graphs, lava lamps, and comics to help the reader understand clouds. He discusses which clouds are ""thunderclouds"" and the difference between snow grain and hail. Hint: snow grain doesn't bounce. (Tell me your pulse doesn't quicken after learning a little tidbit like that! It doesn't? Well, how about this: Fog and mist are actually stratus clouds! Tell me that doesn't make your heart pound. I won't believe it, I won't!Ahem and excuse me. It is still difficult for me to quickly identify clouds, but I am much better than where I started four months ago. I hope you find a copy of this book. It is filled with scientific and artistic insight into clouds and I highly recommend it. Signed,Why do altocumulus clouds always remind me of Jesse's dad? "
11,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10005512-frazzock-noir,4,"There aren't many books that cause you to behave differently after reading them. For me clouds were always a disappointing sight; they stood as a closing statement to an ecstatic run of beautiful Summer days, or a disappointing ceiling hindering my morning optimism. As soon as I saw them I chose to ostracize and disregard them until they had slipped away silently overnight, but just as ignorance causes us to be suspicious of those we know nothing about, my ignorance of the many forms of water going about it's daily business and disregarding it's poetic splendour stopped me from appreciating the skies above us. Now I understand and find myself watching the sky endlessly, with both scientific and artistic wonder. Even Constable and Turner paintings have a whole new meaning. Have a read, it'll change your outlook forever...and it's in such a nice sleeve as well"
12,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1069939-molly-christensen,4,This is how I wish ALL science books were written. Incredibly fascinating info with all the history and culture and the difficult science principles were explained very clearly. I only gave it 4 stars simply because it took me a really long time to read (had to think a lot more than usual!) 
13,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7289090-karthik-thrikkadeeri,5,"A few years ago, I got into birdwatching and other forms of wildlife watching. Apart from being a delightful and wholesome way of connecting with nature and losing oneself, there is something almost addictive about learning how things are classified and trying to identify the classifications. This thrill is not just about a whimsical hobby, it is deeply connected to human curiosity. And once I was introduced to birdwatching, I fell in love with the skill of looking deeply, of seeing things where others see nothing. And so it came as only a mild and ambivalent surprise when I first learned of plane-spotting. There were people who enjoyed the anticipation and thrill of seeking out, locating, spotting and identifying these huge man-made metal birds in much the same way as I did of actual birds. Later, I understood the meaning of the term ""trainspotting"" which I had earlier come across in a vague movie. I was amused on learning of the existence of these different hobbies which run on the same basic principles. Still, I struggled to draw this kind of passion towards these man-made objects. However, I remember being intrigued when a couple of friends had started talking about how there were different kinds of clouds! Imagine that! I went online and tried to look up how cloud classification worked, but I was discouraged not by the Latin names, but because there wasn't a single source with comprehensive information; I was getting bits and pieces from here and there, ending up confused. I recently remembered this out of the blue, and browsed Goodreads for a field guide of sorts, which is how I found this book. And, I fell in love! The book has everything that a beginner would need: from descriptions of the basic ten genera of clouds and their further classifications, to gripping explanations of the science behind their workings, to even detailed anecdotes and asides on interesting weather phenomena or incidents from the past that a cloudspotter can use to evangelise to his unitiated comrades! While my cloudspotting skills are nowhere near good, it is something that I will stay hooked to. There is something about activities that ""legitimise doing nothing"" (words of the author himself) that draws me to them. And as a student of ecology/wildlife, I feel that it is easy to focus on life forms and remain blissfully ignorant of the abiotic weather and earth. I sincerely thank the author for bringing this book to life and sparking a new passion in me. Like another reviewer mentioned, this is the kind of book that should be in every household!If not for the captivating science, at least give the book a read for the Renaissance paintings or the tale of the man who (barely) survived a Cumulonimbus, King of Clouds.PS: The only negatives were the black-and-white photos which didn't really tell much at certain times, and the fact that this is a relatively old book."
14,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101667-dirt,4,"""Clouds are nature's poetry, and the most egalitarian of her displays, since everyone can have a fantastic view of them,"" remarks Gavin Pretor-Pinney in the Cloudspotter's Guide. Pretor-Pinney is founder of the Cloud Appreciation Society and cofounder of Idler magazine. What better way to idle time away than looking up at the sky? This book delves in everything cloud related. The author explores how clouds have been viewed differently throughout history and across cultures as well as the science behind cloud formation. The writing does get technical at points and it can be difficult to wrap your head around the finer details, but that only makes you appreciate clouds even more. Thankfully the meticulous verbage is punctuated with Pretor-Pinney's quests to the fish market to find which mackerel is the ""mackerel sky"" and to Australia to see the rare and mysterious Morning Glory.Clouds truly are magnificent creatures that deserve our gratitude.[http://www.cloudappreciationsociety.org]"
15,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91540867-jje,4,Really enjoyed this one. A title I will keep on the shelf for future reference when I spot an odd cloud from the garden etc. Clouds are something that has fascinated me since I was a child and drooled over many times when looking at a sunset or sunrise. The contents of this book aim to simplify the understanding of clouds and how each formation forms. In the main this is done beautifully but I found you need to be in frame of mind to concentrate whilst reading this as some of the terminology though watered down is difficult to follow! The test section in the middle of the book is a natty idea and really fun to test yourself at the end to see how much you have understood.I find myself on my walks regularly looking at clouds now and trying to predict if I am going to get rained on or not which is good fun. It’s a great book with wonderful illustrations and the authors sense of fun makes a potentially mind boggling subject easily digestible.
16,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5869795-steve-mitchell,5,"This is a delightful little book that is written in such an enthusiastic fashion that anybody could enjoy Gavin Pretor-Pinney’s prose; not just members of the Cloud Appreciation Society. The science portions of the book are centred on humorous anecdotes tenuously linked to the subject matter so that any layman will not get buried in a landslide of facts, figures and equations. Some of the portions of this book are seriously laugh out loud funny. The format of the book makes it an ideal candidate for keeping in the smallest room or reading a couple of pages in bed before switching off the bedside light each night. If I had to criticise it, I would say that the black and white photos do not do justice to the subject matter, and not every single type of cloud mentioned within the text is illustrated; but that does not detract enough for me not to give this book full marks."
17,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16084522-drew-pyke,3,"This was an intense book, looking at each of the 10 clouds as separate chapters and in great detail but interspersing it with anecdotes about clouds in general and a few chapters in the end for more miscellaneous aspects (and a trip he made to Australia to see the ""Morning Glory"" cloud.Sometimes I got lost whilst others I was galvanised (especially when it came to the basics of cloud formation with land thermals reaching cool regions of the troposphere to form denser water droplets).I reckon you can quite easily remember just 3 clouds and you'll see then every day (""wispy"" cirrus, ""cauliflower"" cumulus and the ""blanket"" stratus) but that isn't too say the others are not interesting, I just personally found it too much to keep as excited all the wag through the 300 pages."
18,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/408190-sisterimapoet,4,"I took my time over this book because I wanted to savour it. I wanted to read it on afternoons where there were clouds in the sky, easier enough in England, but hard on some days to find some sky to go with those clouds.This book was given to me by a dear friend with scientific fascination. I can’t say now that I have finished the book that I can accurately identify all the different clouds. And I couldn’t tell you precisely how each is formed. But I have gained a great appreciation for their variety and personality. This is an informative but for me more importantly a delightfully poetic book about the nature of the sky above, which we so often underlook."
19,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6297140-lili,5,"Imagine you are me, just for a moment, rambling around Half Price Books looking for some new and exciting book to read. At the time I was in the mood for something science related, low and behold I find The Cloudspotter's Guide! This book is a work of sarcastic genius, it takes a subject that a lot of people probably don't care about and makes it really interesting. I love Meteorology, but do on many occasions get frustrated by dry, scientific, texts. This book combines the author's love of clouds, incredible wit, science, and history into a beautiful guide to the sky. I mean really, who actually needs sunshine when you have clouds?"

Gavin Pretor-Pinney writes humorous and metaphorical, making it much easier for the reader to remember all the details. As a paragliding pilot I found the chapters on cumulus, cumulonimbus and altocumulus clouds particularly interesting - not to mention the rare phenomenon ""The Morning Glory"", which is every glider pilot's dream. I would recommend this book to everybody - even those not particularly interested in clouds. Because this book will make you interested."

28,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65064444-kenneth,5,I was hiking in New Hampshire and I happened upon someone reading this and their response to my inquiry of the book was: “the book is just....wild; you have to read it.” I barely asked for elaboration of that description as I immediately bought the book.Pretor-Pinney takes a didactic structure of teaching us the different cloud types and turbo-infuses it with laugh-out-loud humor along with truly interesting tidbits of information and anecdotes (and pictures). I am amazed at how much knowledge I have now retained about clouds and I have found myself dispensing these delightful factoids to my friends and family. I cannot wait to lend this book to a deserving friend to enjoy as I have. This book shot up my favorites list and will probably stay there for quite some time as I unpack all that I just read. 
29,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1749371-erik,4,"Pretor-Pinney loves cloud and thinks you should too. There's a bit of science, some pictures, and some evangelizing, but basically this book is a long chat with someone desperate to share his love of clouds. The first ten chapters may each deal with one of the ten classifications of clouds--cumulus, cumulomimbus, stratus, stratocumulus, altocumulus, altostratus, nimbostratus, cirrus, cirrocumulus, and cirrostratus--but each is less of a lesson in classification than a chance to wax about the variability and beauty of each. And the wrap-up is halo effects and the Morning Glory off Australia, the glider's dream of a wave roll cloud. I'm definitely looking up more often, and visiting the website of the Cloud Appreciation Society, of which the author is, of course, the founder."

It is so clear that the author is passionate about the subject and not just going through the motions. The author dances so lightly across subjects as broad as science, mythology, politics, poetry, action, Kurt Vonnegut's family and fish mongers that you don't notice; you are at the beginning of a new love affair with the natural world through clouds. I'm not sure I've ever read anything like it. It was so enjoyable, I'm tempted to return to the beginning and start again straight away. Everyone should read this book."

I thoroughly enjoyed this book for the science, industry the impact on art and literature, great writing style and full passion the author conveyed.While some of the subject matter can be confusing including how to distinguish one class of clouds from another the author is as helpful as can be, and provides many tidbits of historical and artistic symbolism that impact the reader.Overall, super and comprehensive.

It's informative, but often derailed by some of the author's more bizarre tangents, like an awkward discursion into cloud-based erotica (specifically Correggio's ""Jupiter and Io"") and the use of Frankie Lymon's short and tragic life for a bizarre jumping-off point to explain why rain ""falls"" upwards in clouds.In other words, it's interesting, but the dude's a bit out there. Which I suppose is what you'd expect."

There were a few times in the second half of the book where it was hard for me to follow the concepts, but overall this was an excellent book. The science behind the clouds was explained very well and there were very interesting forays into other cloud related subjects that gave my brain a break. I learned a lot and now all I have to do is review the material, do a lot of cloud gazing and see if I can pass the test which is included as an insert the book."

I liked that there also some stories, myths, and folklores mixed in with the science. My only complaint would be that the black and white pictures made it very difficult to see nuances in the clouds that were being described, so I googled a lot. "

Part textbook and part memoir, this confessional and well-illustrated book is a handy entree into Nephology (the study of clouds).

267,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73453593-rafael-delcourt,5,"By far one of my favorite books! It’s amazing how the author mixed history, science and folklore in this book. I have change my mind about the sky."
268,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6228140-elecia,5,"Amusing, educational, fun in spots. Clouds are now quite entertaining."
269,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45473178-helena,4,Amusing and informative.
270,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72346504-rachel-mcdonald,5,"This is one of the greatest non-fiction books I have ever read and is now a favourite for life. It is so clear that the author is passionate about the subject and not just going through the motions. The author dances so lightly across subjects as broad as science, mythology, politics, poetry, action, Kurt Vonnegut's family and fish mongers that you don't notice; you are at the beginning of a new love affair with the natural world through clouds. I'm not sure I've ever read anything like it. It was so enjoyable, I'm tempted to return to the beginning and start again straight away. Everyone should read this book."
271,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20362268-david-howard,5,"EXCELLENT READ!!! I thoroughly enjoyed this book for the science, industry the impact on art and literature, great writing style and full passion the author conveyed.While some of the subject matter can be confusing including how to distinguish one class of clouds from another the author is as helpful as can be, and provides many tidbits of historical and artistic symbolism that impact the reader.Overall, super and comprehensive. Well done!!!I am now interested in reading Gavin Pretor-Pinney’s wave book."
272,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108421659-dan-seitz,3,"Pretor-Pinney knows far more cloud trivia and general cloud science than you thought could exist, and most of it is right here in this volume. It's informative, but often derailed by some of the author's more bizarre tangents, like an awkward discursion into cloud-based erotica (specifically Correggio's ""Jupiter and Io"") and the use of Frankie Lymon's short and tragic life for a bizarre jumping-off point to explain why rain ""falls"" upwards in clouds.In other words, it's interesting, but the dude's a bit out there. Which I suppose is what you'd expect."
273,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51724704-daniella,5,"This is the ultimate book on clouds. There were a few times in the second half of the book where it was hard for me to follow the concepts, but overall this was an excellent book. The science behind the clouds was explained very well and there were very interesting forays into other cloud related subjects that gave my brain a break. I learned a lot and now all I have to do is review the material, do a lot of cloud gazing and see if I can pass the test which is included as an insert the book."
274,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93514518-marcia-robinson,4,"This book was a lot more technical than I thought it would be, and I think that I will need to reread it several times to absorb all the information in it. I liked that there also some stories, myths, and folklores mixed in with the science. My only complaint would be that the black and white pictures made it very difficult to see nuances in the clouds that were being described, so I googled a lot. "
275,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61897733-sasha,5,"This was utterly delightful. Part textbook and part memoir, this confessional and well-illustrated book is a handy entree into Nephology (the study of clouds). At times poetic and at times scientific, I enjoyed the anecdotes about eating Barramundi fish while searching for Morning Glory clouds in Australia or turning famous Bierstadt paintings upside down at the Tate Modern in London. Highly recommend for avid and idle cloudspotters alike."
276,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75080271-skis,4,"I loved this book. The science communication was amazingly accessible, funny, and succinct. I feel like I learned a lot and I will never look at clouds the same way again. That being said I did roll my eyes at some of the humour, which was very Boys Own at points.However, I will definitely be reading this book again, and I hope to one day know the clouds as intimately as the author. "
277,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6269422-amber,5,"Who knew that clouds had their own species and an entire community set up just to appreciate them? This was an interesting book about something I think we all tend to overlook, our clouds. I appreciated the inter-disciplinary nature of the book as well as the love the author obviously has for the subject. I also really liked the discussion of contrails and cloud seeding, fascinating stuff. "
278,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19940217-ravi-singh,4,"One of the most enjoyable books I have ever read and still memorable to me. I even joined the Society!Clouds something I have always admired and looked to, encapsulated in an informative way, funny in places but always deftly dealing with the subject matter at hand in a serious way. Highly recommended, you'll never look at the sky in the same way again!"
279,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32044882-saurabh-kumar-singh,4,"Gem of a book. I always wanted to understand more about clouds. I always used to wonder why on an overcast, cloudy day there is no rain and a day starting with blue sky turns out to be wet towards eves. How weather is predicted, why indian rains are loud and noisy but British rains are so quiet. This book answers most of these questions and many more. A clouded sky is much more interesting now."
280,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38494412-kelly-stevens,5,"I loved this delightful book! Helps that I was in Iceland while reading and seeing amazing clouds. I've studied meteorology and knew much of the science but still learned a few things and appreciated all the history, anecdotes, and literature references in this book."
281,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4184524-megan,5,"This book is so charming. It treats clouds with the awe and amazement that they deserve. It definitely heightened my appreciation for clouds, which were already so beautiful for me. The author also has a great sense of humor, which really added whimsy to the subject. I highly recommend this book!"
282,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1819235-tim-street,4,"A lovely read that details the science and mythos of clouds – with a healthy, if unexpected, dose of sarcasm, wit, and irreverence. This would be a five star book for me, but it really lost steam (pun intended) in final chapters."
283,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58588168-stuart-champion,3,"Very interesting indeed. Earlier chapters were fascinating, but I did get a bit lost/bored in chapter 8-10. The contrails and Morning Glory chapters rescued it for me though, so overall a very good book.I already appreciated clouds, and this book helped me understand why :)"
284,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4781405-sarah-street,4,"This book was front-loaded with all the good clouds at the beginning so it became a little redundant and uninteresting at the end. However, taken as a whole this was hilarious and nerdy and legitimately informative. Loved it."
285,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41982954-bradford,4,Surprisingly engaging and stuffed full with fascinating asides. The author manages to put together an informative and entertaining tour through the troposphere. I feel like I learned this once before and had forgotten it. 
286,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5555051-shonna-siegers,3,"Great fun, although it took me awhile to get through it. This is mainly because I knew much of the information already. However, the authors sense of humor makes this a great read, especially for those who need more of an introduction to clouds. "
287,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95984797-tim-holcombe,5,What can I say? I love clouds and skywatching in general. This book pretty much rules. I enjoyed reading about some of the finer detail of cloud classification from an amusing British author. Cirrus and altocumulus are probably my favorites :D
288,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45117643-sylvie-helen,3,"3.5 ⭐I did enjoy this, I love a good cloud but something about this made it a slow read and it took me a while to get through - possibly just the fact that 300 pages about clouds doesn't have a lot of variation, even if the clouds are all different."
289,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43018726-adriana-mart-n-sanchez,5,"For this just being a book about clouds, it has thoroughly changed me as a person. I will no longer look to rainy days with dread but with much anticipation. Not only that, but I believe everyday of my life has now been changed as I will never forget to look up at the sky in search of clouds."
290,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18571740-juli-anna,4,"An excellent read for skywatchers and amateur meteorologists. I especially appreciated the little ""cheat sheets"" at the beginning of each chapter, which make for a handy quick reference for cloud types. I'll definitely be returning to this one occasionally as I learn the sky's moods. "
291,0399532560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27959301-gayle-garman,3,"Cloudspotter's Guide is nice, easy read that mixes useful details for identifying clouds with anecdotes. I found the book to be useful background for participating in the NASA Globe citizen science Clouds monitoring program. "
