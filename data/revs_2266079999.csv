A smart story crafted by a real space science guru

WE CAN'T BE ALONE
The universe is a pretty big place. If it's just us, seems like an awful waste of space.When I read this book, back then in 1997, I did it like a couple of months before of being able to watch the film adaptation. (And I am truly glad that I was able to get the movie in blu-ray, a few months ago in this year, 2014))This is truly great novel and it's written by one of the most respected scientist in the field about science of outer space, Carl Sagan.Readers who enjoy techno-thrillers in the style of Michael Chrichton, I am sure that they will find this book the same as enjoyable. Sagan is able to merge all his factual science knowledge with strong theories and very possible science fiction.If you want to read about a ""first contact"" with an alien intelligence in a form as ""real"" as possible, this is your novel.
THAT MESMERIZING DARK SPACE
For small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love.Sagan never compromised his credibility as a real scientist just to sell cheap action in this novel. This is a smart tale with many hard science, but also it contains great characters with exceptional developing.Since after all, only science can't tell a story, there must be people, and people has feelings, and you will perceive them.He knows what he is doing and you get a very realistic aproach of how you could expect the human civilization can deal with the impact of knowing that we are not alone in the universe anymore.If you are looking for flying saucers blasting lasers and the army fighting bravely against them, this is NOT your book. I have nothing against that approach, don't get me wrong. I like that kind of stories too. But, I think that it's fair to have once in a while a mature angle to craft a story about the first meeting with an alien intelligence.You have here a very intelligent story with a strong scientific background.Nevertheless, Sagan knows that a novel must entertain, and you will be entertained but in a very adult and plausible way."

Dissatisfied with a school lesson, she goes to the library to convince herself that π is irrational. In sixth grade her father and role-model Theodore (""Ted"") dies. A man named John Staughton becomes her stepfather and does not show as much support for her interests.

In the book, the heroine meets the aliens and is told that they have indisputable proof that the Universe was created by a Higher Power. When she returns to Earth, she has no immediate way to support her story - but she has been given enough of a clue that she knows how to find objective evidence, which she duly does. She also makes another surprising discovery.In the movie, she comes back and can't justify her story in any way... period. So she is forced to tell people that they need Faith. This is the opposite of what Sagan was saying. ________________________________For people who haven't seen the famous xkcd cartoon (I hadn't until this morning):________________________________I had not come across his letter until I saw it just now, but apparently Sagan told Warner Brothers straight out that he was unhappy with what they'd done to the movie.

4,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32532774-lisa,3,"Contact! Contact? No…To make a long story short: this is probably an excellent book, but I failed to make contact, to connect to the characters. Feeling sorry about that, I decided to read Sagan’s nonfiction instead, to give him another chance.The problem I had with the novel was similar to my experience with 2001: A Space Odyssey, but on a bigger scale. I have no doubt that Sagan’s visions and ideas on extraterrestrial lifeforms are much more erudite than other science fiction I have read, where technology and cosmology are (deliberately) left vague. But that was part of the problem. I never once had the impression that he was telling me a story, but rather that he was explaining his (fictional) findings. He even explained the characters’ thoughts and actions, rather than letting them act them out. Dialogues (especially the philosophical, scientific and theological discussions) were polite exchanges of positions and information. There was absolutely no sense of humour involved.What I learned from my most recent science fiction readings are two things: I do not want scientists to “fictionalise” their teaching. Neither historical fiction, nor speculative science fiction interest me as a rule, mainly because I prefer to read the nonfiction they are based on and make up my own mind on the topic. That was something I also experienced in Peter Ackroyd’s The Lambs of London, which I found to be a very weak novel. I have yet to discover his nonfiction, which I have heard is based on solid research and well-written. The exception to the rule is if science (or historical) fiction is written not with the purpose of explaining science (history), but to show certain character and plot developments that are relevant in our society, to tell me something about human interaction and behaviour, or to poke fun at our way of perceiving the future (or past). I would count Douglas Adams or John Wyndham into that category, for example. Many authors of dystopian fiction appeal to me for that reason as well, such as Margaret Atwood, Kurt Vonnegut, George Orwell and so on.I have a few science fiction novels waiting. I might change my mind. In the face of new evidence, that is what scientists would do. That much I learned from the novel!"

6,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"I really hate it when I lose reviews. Okay, take two.I was just reminiscing on my younger self's condemnation (or at least his valid annoyances at the plot holes and some of the straight story elements), or the fact that I was trying to compare this classic SF work with other classic SF works that I was making my way through at the time and comparing them unfavorably because I wanted a lot more of the psychedelic naked singularity stuff and aliens, not just a long-winded optimistic synthesis of science, religion, politics, and philosophy.But now, after having read a lot of so-so average SF, I can easily bump this one up because it balances everything on a good tightrope, including the story elements and the characterizations...And I'm gonna face it... I'm SERIOUSLY in need of good science and heavy optimism and reconciliations between disparate camps of philosophies. Whoa... was this novel exactly what the doctor ordered, or what? I rocked to all the good science. I jammed to the intelligent discussions, whether they were religious, political, or even the ethics of science. Of course, the novel is about aliens and whether or not we're grown up, too, but that's all part of the big package, and what a huge package!Sagan is rightly considered a god. :) I'm not alone in thinking he should have been writing tons more novels, either, and not just this single masterwork.So if I ever get the chance to travel back in time and slap around my younger self, I'll do it joyfully. Sure, the novel has a few plot and element faults, but overall, I'm rather amazed that so much was able to come out of the text. As a whole, the book itself is a synthesis, and not only its message.Oh, and other than that, I've seen the movie like a 10x24 times, as if each iteration was a point in pi, so it was also fun as hell picking out all the divergences between the book and the movie. I was always pretty amazed that not only the spirit was intact, but so was most of the pieces.Sure, she wasn't alone on her little trip in the book, but both ways were pretty great. Want visual? Or do you want extrapolation and discussion and theory? Pick one. Watch or Read. :) Good, either way. :)I can enthusiastically recommend this novel to anyone. :)"
7,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/972640-l-greyfort,3,"""Your god is too small."" The heroine makes this comment about 2/3 of the way through this novel. She is trying to get across the idea that, if your god cannot encompass the knowlege which humans have so laboriously amassed over the millenia (which is only about two teaspoons worth in comparison to the enormity of the universe!), then there is something wrong with the god you've made for yourself. A lot of what is going on in Sagan's book, it seems to me, is the attempt to explore and express the wonder that is offered by scientific investigation and knowledge.The story of the world cooperation to build the Machine to travel into the galaxies -- and the subsequent breakdown of that cooperation -- is a further examination of the conflict between humans who desire to get beyond themselves, and those who are too fearful/threatened/self-absorbed/power-hungry to embark on that journey. Sagan spends a lot of time in this book giving us an idea of the humongous extent of the universe, and thereby offering his own vision of the transformative possibility inherent in that investigation. The film of this novel cops out, of course; the film industry is too scared of organized religion to relay the story Sagan is actually telling: belief in something larger than yourself is easy - just look up, around, down, in. "
8,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84023-j-g-keely,2,"Sagan was a lucid and impassioned defender of rationality and clear thought. Unfortunately, his foray into fiction did little to increase the understanding of his philosophies, and much to muddy the waters of once clear thought. Inspired by Asimov and Heinlein, he decided that fiction was as good a place as any to explore his ideas on science, belief, and wonder.While we expect long, in-depth explanations from non-fiction, fiction readers want more than just a lecture from the author. They expect that the characterization, plot, and themes will build the author's case for them, and in a way that will engage the reader without getting bogged down in rhetoric.Sagan's characterization and plotting are unrefined, and he builds no suspense. His characters often fall into cliche, mere mouthpieces for Sagan to explore this or that view. While Heinlein and Card are known (and sometimes reviled) for lecturing the reader, they still returned to the story at hand, and Heinlein at least made sure his asides were directed to his text.The more complex the idea, the more difficult it is to show through character interaction and symbolism. Anyone familiar with Sagan's non-fiction work will immediately recognize the same arguments in Contact . Without this foreknowledge, the ideas become lost and muddled.Many religious readers come away from this book with the sense that Sagan is condoning faith. Sagan struggled in 'Contact' with the themes of 'wonderment' and 'the unknown'. They became so intermingled and vague that they do seem to suggest spirituality. In non-fiction, Sagan differentiated the minute points that separate his brand of rationality from religious faith, but floundered when he found himself in unfamiliar waters.When presenting an explanation for an idea, he can warn against pitfalls and refine specific points. Contrarily, presenting such ideas through a story requires that the symbolism of the story be extremely precise. The examples in the text must elegantly illustrate the point without leaving leeway for alternative interpretations. This is one of the hardest tasks any writer can set himself, and Sagan's inexperience with fictional construction showed through here.Sagan hoped to widen his audience, to increase discussion and the understanding of his philosophy. He wanted to ensnare the non-scientific reader by couching scientific ideas in an entertaining story, but in his inexperience, he chose ideas much grander than his story could support.This book is much more accessible than most of Sagan, simply because it is genre fiction. It is then doubly unfortunate that most readers will know Sagan primarily from this work, since it fails to communicate his ideas to new readers. This book is more likely to cause confusion and misunderstanding than to impart knowledge.The vagueness of the book leaves it so open for interpretation that both the rational and irrational can grasp onto it to support their own ideas. Sagan should have looked at the conflicts caused by similarly confusing symbolic books (like the bible) and stuck with the clear and concise writing that so often served him well."
9,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2457095-apatt,5,"As far as I know Contact is Carl Sagan's only novel. This makes him almost the  Harper Lee of sci-fi (though he did write boatloads of sci-fact books). Not being much of a nonfiction reader this is my first encounter with Carl Sagan's writing, I already feel like it is a shame that he only wrote the one novel; though I am sure the world is more than compensated by his other output.Contact piqued my interest immediately with a vivid portrayal of Ellie Arrowway, a two years old genius, figuring out how a radio works and fixing a tube by straightening a bent prong. The girl’s thought processes throughout this scene are very clearly described. From there we follow Ellie’s growth into adulthood and becoming the director of “Project Argus”, a radio telescope institute for research into SETI (“search for extraterrestrial intelligence”). One day a message ostensibly from the Vega system, 25 light-years from Earth is received. Initially, it seems like just a looping series of prime numbers, remarkable in itself but of no practical value. Later a careful analysis of the modulations in the transmission reveals hidden messages, making the broadcast a kind of space palimpsest. One of the hidden messages turns out to be a blueprint for a mysterious machine containing five comfy chairs. Well, nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!I was fascinated by the hard sf aspect of Contact. Sagan’s popular science writing skills serve the readers well here, the science expositions in this book are generally understandable and often fascinating. I also had a feeling that Sagan is enjoying the relative freedom of writing fiction, even though he clearly seems to have a preference for writing nonfiction. In any case, this novel is partly autobiographical in that SETI was an important part of Sagan’s career. He has clearly thought out the worldwide implications of humanity receiving a communication from an undisputed extraterrestrial intelligence. The hitherto impossible level of cooperation between unfriendly countries to use their radio telescopes to help pick up and compile parts of “The Message” received as the Earth rotates. The panic and condemnations from some religious leaders are all too believable. Contact is also a platform for Sagan to explore religion from his agnostic point of view. I really appreciate that he is not overbearing about his agnosticism, and it is just one aspect of this book of many facets. The diametrically different viewpoints between Ellie and a religious figure are articulately argued on both sides, but the agnostic view seems more convincingly presented (Ellie is basically a mouthpiece for the author at this point). It is interesting that Sagan seems to think that both atheists and Christians presume to know too much, taking their conjectures as fact. Agnosticism is presented as the happy medium.Even though I had a sense that Sagan enjoyed writing Contact very much, it does not mean that the novel is a romp or a hoot. It is mostly narrated at a deliberate, thoughtful pace, and only ramps up a bit when the alien designed Machine is activated and weird sci-fi-ness ensues. I thoroughly enjoyed and admire Contact, it is thought provoking, fascinating and even educational. I wish he had written a sequel._______________A word about the 1997 Movie AdaptationI remember quite liking the movie, and Jodie Foster is always great. However, while I enjoyed the movie for what it was, I was disappointed in it as a sci-fi movie. For the longest time, it dissuaded me from picking up the source material. Having just read Sagan’s novel it seems as if the filmmaker has somehow de-sci-fied it, making the movie rather ambiguous about whether the aliens really did send a message or Ellie is simply off her rocker. In a single brief scene the movie clearly implies that the aliens are indeed real but by then I think the damage is already done. The movie feels more like a fairly decent human drama than an intelligent sci-fi film. Carl Sagan was also not happy about the adaptation, though he passed away before it was finished.The book is overtly, spectacularly, unapologetically sci-fi."
10,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26876584-joe-valdez,3,"J.D. Salinger (The Catcher in the Rye), Harper Lee (To Kill a Mockingbird) and Sylvia Plath (The Bell Jar) all published one novel each. Another member of the First Novel/ Last Novel club is astronomer, Pulitzer Prize winning author of Cosmos and science communicator Carl Sagan, whose foray into fiction was Contact, published in 1985. I gave the book a lot of latitude, not only for Sagan's potential shortcomings with character and dialogue, but for hopes that the novel could live up to the engaging 1997 film adaptation starring Jodie Foster. I like the movie a lot more than the book, though the DNA of what made the film so emotionally compelling is still here, hidden like numerals in π.In 1999, Dr. Ellie Arroway--graduate Cum Laude from Harvard, with a doctorate in radio astronomy from Cal Tech--is director of Project Argus, an array of 131 radio telescopes in the scrub brush of New Mexico, studying quasar evolution, binary pulsars and the chromospheres of nearby stars by listening to radio emissions. Through public support for SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Life), the facility is also scanning the cosmos for alien civilizations. Ellie's graduate advisor, famed radio astronomer Dr. David Drumlin, lectures Ellie that she should be devoting resources to practical science instead of ""pandering to UFO kooks and comic strips and weak-minded adolescents."" Inspired by a radio astronomer from Cal Tech named Peter Valerian, Ellie remains fascinated by the challenge of detecting intelligent life beyond the stars. She considers resistance to the possibility of extraterrestrial life to be the domain of kooks. In absence of evidence, she has faith in the unseen.So why had we received no signal? Could Dave possibly be right? No extraterrestrial civilizations anywhere? All those billions of worlds going to waste, lifeless, barren? Intelligent beings growing up only in this obscure corner of an incomprehensibly vast universe? No matter how valiantly she tried, Ellie couldn't make herself take such a possibility seriously. It dovetailed perfectly with human fears and pretensions, with unproved doctrines about life-after-death, with such pseudosciences as astrology. It was the modern incarnation of the geocentric solipsism, the conceit that had captured our ancestors, the notion that we were the center of the universe. Drumlin's argument was suspect on these grounds alone. We wanted to believe it too badly.Argus receives a set of moving pulses transmitting at 9.2 gigahertz from Vega, a debris strewn system only twenty-six light years from Earth. Ellie and the technicians rule out malfunction, military or commercial interference or a prank. The signal is broken into a series of prime numbers which dramatically rules out celestial phenomenon. Ellie quickly shares her discovery with the world astronomical community, bypassing the National Science Foundation. In addition to Drumlin, who goes from skeptic to true believer, the multitudes who descend on New Mexico include the President's Science Advisor Kenneth der Heer and Assistant Secretary of Defense Michael Kitz.While Kitz remains wary of sharing the discovery with the rest of the world, Ken is supportive of Ellie. Working closely together, Ellie and Ken ultimately develop a romantic relationship. Drumlin decrypts enough of the signal to determine there's a picture there. The facility breaks down the signal and to their shock, find a television broadcast of Adolph Hitler speaking at the opening ceremonies of the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin. Summoned to the White House to debrief the (female) president, Ken explains that the German signal was the first television broadcast of moderate power transmitted from Earth and that the Vegans are simply acknowledging us back.Ellie advises the president that she's discovered blocks of non-repeating information coming in under the signal that might take decades to process. Due to Vega setting in other countries throughout the day, partnership with the world community--Australia, China, India, the Soviet Union, the Middle East, Western Europe--is vital. Arriving at New Mexico is Soviet astrophysicist Vasily Lunacharsky (""Vaygay""), a colleague of Ellie's. Also striking camp in the desert are the press and hundreds of spectators, hucksters and religious nuts, each with their own theories and expectations of what contact from extraterrestrials will portend for humanity. Zealotry, fanaticism, fear, hope, fervent debate, quiet prayer, agonizing reappraisal, exemplary selflessness, close-minded bigotry, and a zest for dramatically new ideas were epidemic, rushing feverishly over the surface of the tiny planet Earth. Slowly emerging from this mighty ferment, Ellie thought she could see, was a dawning recognition of the world as one thread in a vast cosmic tapestry. Meanwhile, the Message itself continued to resist attempts at decryption. On the vilification channels, protected by the First Amendment, she, Vaygay, der Heer and to a lesser extent Peter Valerian were being castigated for a variety of offenses, including atheism, communism, and hoarding the Message for themselves.While preliminary findings suggest that the Message may be instructions for Earth to build some sort of Machine and debate ensues on whether or not to build it, Ellie is contacted by Palmer Joss, spiritual advisor to several presidents, a populist theologian less interested in control of the Message than he is in the moral development of the scientists speaking on behalf of mankind. Young and charismatic, Palmer questions both religious doctrine and scientific research equally, but resists any attempt by Ellie to pry him from his belief in the existence of God, a belief Palmer can't possibly prove but accepts as an article of faith. As main characters go, Ellie Arroway can't help but be one of my favorites. With so much science fiction focused on the ""hassles"" of the WASP male, Ellie tackles challenges not only as a woman in a male-dominated field, but as her peer circle expands to include most of humanity, an atheist in a God-worshiping population. Her femininity and atheism are constants throughout. She's an astronomer that would make Carl Sagan proud, and while the novel doesn't pivot on personal confrontation in as dramatic a fashion as the movie, the author never disrespects Ellie by jettisoning her training or principles in the race to decode the Message. This character is a role model.There's a lot of philosophical conversation in the novel. They were adequately well written and provide ""equal time"" for a variety of scientific and theological beliefs, but very little of it was integrated into an exciting story. These scenes play like coffeetalk and in fact, most of the dialogue takes place on walks or excursions Ellie goes on between symposiums or meetings. There's an academic sensibility to much of the book, with elements like political machination, religious nuts or sabotage inserted in a way that seems like it was against the author's wishes. At best, the novel is resistant to corny thriller tropes. At worst, it's plodding.While the intellectual exchanges between highly skilled academics grounds Sagan's story in reality to a degree, the novel features a couple of stabs at futurism that feel unnecessary, some plausible (a female president), some less so (a no holds barred Babylonian pleasure theme park in New York). I think I'll take Prince's speculations on the year 1999 from the year 1983. The movie--adapted by Jim V. Hart and Michael Goldenberg and directed by Robert Zemeckis--would pare that away to take place during the Clinton administration, as well as bolster Palmer Joss' role and the threats to Ellie's work. It's a better science fiction film than the book is a science fiction novel, but this will do.With his novel, Sagan has turned me away from atheism and toward agnosticism. Contrary to what others might suggest, I find that ""I don't know"" can be as definitive a religious position as anything."
11,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1788674-jill,4,"Contact is not only one of the most religious science fiction books I’ve ever read but also one of the most religious books I’ve ever read, period. In Carl Sagan’s only work of fiction, the story is a mere backbone, a structure upon which Sagan can explore what he truly wants to explore, that is, the deepest questions of our existence.What is our purpose here?Can humans live without institutionalized religion?What are the dangers of extraterrestrial contact?How did we come to exist?Can science and religion be reconciled?Some questions remain unanswered, but Sagan provides fascinating solutions to some. He suggests that the Universe should be our religion. And even though I disagree with some of his conclusions, I appreciate such a philosophical investigation into these questions. Even better, the story and the characters behind these questions are fantastic. Sagan includes actual scientific explanations for the events, meaning you actually learn a bit about astronomy and physics while reading. His characters are among the most realistic I’ve ever seen. I have no doubt many of them were based on his own colleagues because only true people could inspire such realism. The protagonist, Ellie Arroway, is so impressive. She’s a wonderfully feminist character written by a man in 1985. As she struggles in the aftermath of discovering extraterrestrial intelligence, my love for her grew denser than a black hole and more infinite than a transcendental number. The plot itself is captivating, because it’s easily one of the best novel premises ever: what happens when humans realize they’re not alone? We all have a thirst for wonder. It’s a deeply human quality. Science and religion are both bound up with it. What I’m saying is, you don’t have to make stories up, you don’t have to exaggerate. There’s wonder and awe enough in the real world. Nature’s a lot better at inventing wonders than we are.Reading Contact I mostly felt joyous. Because I’m sitting here, right now. The most miraculous of miracles. I hear birds, I see the sun. Tonight I will see Venus, the Moon, and the stars. I don’t know why I’m here. When we marvel at these things, when nature evokes the numinous, let’s not fight about why or how or who. Because who cares? We exist. "

It is still about the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, and a complex message is received from Vega with instructions to build a machine and take a ride, but the telling is much more scientific, technical, political and religious in nature.While some of the characters are the same, their relationships, for the most part, are surprisingly different too, and then there are the last two unexpected communiques that I did not expect to complete the story. (view spoiler)[ (Ellie's mothers' letter divulging her 'true' father's identity, and the final message from beyond proving a higher intelligence antedates the universe.)

This book is thought-provoking, and absolutely beautiful to read. What can I say? It made my heart and soul sing.As a child I was fascinated by the stars and universe, and even asked Santa for Carl Sagan's COSMOS as a Christmas gift one year. He was a truly unique and gifted astronomer and astrophysicist, and I wish Mr. Sagan was still with us, but thankfully we are able to hold on to a bit of his wit and creativity through this beautiful work of fiction. It's his own little bit of eternity he's passed on to us, and no matter your stance on life, the universe, and everything (hey, I'm a Douglas Adams fan too!), you will find Sagan approaches both science and faith in this book with respect and dignity. Some of you may have even watched the film version of this book, which was released in 1997, and while the film was good, the book is far different, and i.m.h.o., much more emotional. Please find the time to read this book, as it will be time well spent.""For small creatures such as we, the vastness is bearable only through love.""~Carl Sagan"
15,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6449756-sonja-arlow,3,"This is an excellent thought experiment by a well-known and respected scientist on how contact with extra-terrestrials could realistically unfold. I say thought experiment because as a novel the book didn’t always work so well.I understand that real science is not like it is portrayed in the movies. It takes a lot of time and hard work to make a discovery, test the hypotheses, confirm the conclusion etc etc so its not really a surprise that this book’s pacing was much slower than most sci fi novels seeing that its written from the perspective of an actual scientist.Very often the dialogue between characters felt artificial. Certain concepts obviously need to be conveyed to the reader and the only way it could be done between two scientists was in the form of long monologues that felt like lectures. It was informative but not believable. Now I most definitely did not dislike the book, it left me with a better understanding of radio astrophysics, I found the part where the movie stopped, and the book continued excellent however the very last few pages were unnecessary.I was also left with a new desire to visit my local planetarium.There is no doubt this is an intelligent look at a concept that human beings have speculated about since the first star gazers. Perhaps if I had read this at another time when my life didn’t have as many distractions I would have rated it higher. "
16,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5138895-etherealfire,5,Read this book in the early nineties. Loved Ellie Arroway and loved this story. Then the movie came out and I loved that too! One of my most favorite female-centric scifi stories written by a male. 
17,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117399210-lu-s,4,"Sagan was a visionary beyond time. He understood the beauty of the universe by the laws of physics and how everything converged for them. And how human beings are part of this vast scenario, perhaps the only ones for whom the cosmos exists. He continues with this idea in Contact, although this is a work of fiction, more specifically, of science fiction. This work is science fiction of a different genre without laser beams or flying saucers or little green men. Eleanor (Ellie) Arroway is a unique child who was able to understand the time when she was three. Her mother is sympathetic to her, but her father, Ted, was the one who structured her personality. When he dies, a piece of Ellie seems to die with him. To become a renowned physicist, she focuses all her efforts on being a brilliant student. It is surprising to have started a relationship with Palmer Joss, a preacher of Christian renewal, whose religious views are entirely different from Ellie's coherent vision of the world. That's when she discovers something that can shake the world. Contacts with aliens have established, and now the world needs to prepare for something unexpected. Ellie's journey out there, as well as her inner journey, begins here. She will not only travel through the stars but to the deepest recesses of her heart, her memory and her existence. She also needs to understand the hidden message of God in the order of the universe. And the only thing that makes sense in the vast cosmos and its millions of stars is the message: for creatures so tiny that we are, is immensity endurable only through love? "

The only changes of any weight were in Ellie's relationships to the other major characters, and the removal of dated material relating to the Soviet Union.Sagan's forte is definitely in non-fiction science popularization, and it is on display even in this work of fiction, where I'm sorry to say, it doesn't make for particularly good storytelling.I was not surprised by the book's greatest virtue, the preponderance of wonder, a deep and abiding respect for nature and humility before that which science has not (yet) elucidated. That and myriad ruminations on the nature and likelyhood of far more advanced civilizations than our own inhabiting the universe. This is very well done, and I was gratified that Sagan's original writing expounded on these topics far more than the movie could convey."
19,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74816651-fran,5,"Following on the footsteps of many other scientists like Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke, Carl Sagan wrote a novel: Contact. Contact is an interesting mix of hard science and the exploration of the nature of faith and truth, that does an excellent job at showing us how politics can mess everything up. It’s also a favorite of mine.Dr. Ellie Arroway, an astronomer on a quest to find extra-terrestrial life, is the director of a group of scientists searching for out-of-planet signals. When a computer picks up a signal coming from the vicinity of the star Vega, which turns out to be a series of prime numbers, Ellie and the world get to confirm that there’s life somewhere out there.A big part of what I like about Contact is that it reads like a science lecture, albeit a better lecture than your average college class. As the plot moves along, Sagan goes into the minutiae of the science involved, explaining the origin of the SETI program and how the satellites work. He never treats us as idiots though, so you'll need to pay attention or risk his explanations flying over your head (and even so, don't worry, you can follow the plot without having to get well acquainted with all the science). The novel, written during the Cold War, shows the tension between the USSR and the US, since when the message is decoded, the nations come to an unlikely truce as they promise to share their information in order to build the machine as instructed in the alien message. What the machine will do, no one has any idea, and a lot of time is spent in trying to figure out if this machine should even be built in the first place.The other thing I like about this book is how strong Sagan's female characters are. Ellie Arroway is brilliant, strong and imaginative, and she knows it. As she has to fight her way into being accepted by the scientific community she doesn't take any bullshit from anyone, no matter what. And she does it without turning into a crazy harpy, remaining the levelheaded but passionate scientist she is. Sagan also makes the President of the USA a woman, but it's just a fact he throws out, never made into a big deal.This book is a brilliant look at humanity and how we look at the world and our place in it. It leaves you thinking, both about the world at large but also about personal and very private beliefs.One word of caution, don't expect a lot of action or craziness with this book —so don't worry, it's nothing like the movie—but an extremely well put together mystery that will surprise you more than once."
20,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4988481-peter-meredith,5,I love it when an author can get me to learn at the same time as entertaining me—Carl Sagan and Michael Crichton are the best at this(Though E. L. James is right up there with them. She taught me how to debase women and make them think that it's liberating in some way)
21,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,4,"Contact. The first contact with a non-human intelligence, beaming information at Earth from somewhere in the vicinity of the star Vega. I was reminded strongly of Arthur C. Clarke’s 2001, a Space Odyssey and also his Rendezvous with Rama. Sagan and Clarke were both very familiar with the political maneuvering that takes place in multi-institutional projects and could provide very believable back-room machinations.At first, I thought that Sagan’s main character, Ellie, was rather like Clarke’s characters—clinically removed from emotions, observing them more than experiencing them. But I came to realize that the book was also about her contact with those around her, letting her tendency to observe and analyze stand in the way of truly making meaningful personal contact—with her lovers, with her colleagues, with her mother and stepfather. After a painful realization—that she has been taken advantage of by one of her lovers—she has no close woman friend to go have a drink with, no one to agree with her that the guy’s treatment of her was shitty, or to commiserate.The book is also a thoughtful exploration of the complex relationship between science and religion—and the aspects of both where we can find “contact.” Because scientists do feel awe—who can stare up into the night sky, or think about the complexity of DNA, or hike in gorgeous surroundings without feeling it? But this book was written in the days before the militant atheists had claimed science as their territory and told religious believers that they couldn’t come in unless they recanted their beliefs.Much more than just a “first contact” story, there are layers and depths here that frankly surprised me. Scientists are not necessarily good fiction writers—but I guess that Sagan was an effective story-teller, so I shouldn’t have been so startled.Book number 196 of my science fiction & fantasy reading project."
22,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61486263-alberto,5,"Well, what can I say? This is a real hard science fiction book, because it contains a lot of scientific and up to date (at the time the book was written) information. I like that the author added some of his personal thoughts, like rationality, scepticism, the challenge of discovery, the problems in our society and the never-ending conflict between trust in what you don't have any proof about it or your personal beliefs (faith) and the real and hard facts that have been proven with lots of evidence (science). What I liked most is how Sagan described the situation in which all the nations of the Earth have been abruptly involved in cooperating with each other, and not thinking any more of the other nation as an enemy and neither as a friend (and then as a bystander), but as a group of people with which it's possible to have a conversation, exchange thoughts and share knowledge, seeing then the other (person or nation) as a neighbour that lives in the same area (the Earth).This is also the first Carl Sagan's book I've ever read so far and I will most likely read something else written by him. I would advice the other readers that this is a real book that always wants you focused, otherwise you wouldn't understand much the thoughts of the author, the rich scientific details and the evolution of the story, so it isn't a book you can drop and then continue reading after a while."
23,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/833700-kirsten,4,"I have always wondered why people say science and faith (or a belief in God or Supreme Creator) have to be two separate things. Everything I learn about the natural world and the universe proves to me that God exists, not the opposite. This book repeats back to me truths that I have I think I have always known. And it does it in the voice of a scientist, as written by the pen of a scientist. It points out the fallacies of religion, but not faith. It points out the weaknesses of government, but not humanity. We lost Carl Sagan far too soon. "
24,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8720943-stephanie-swint,5,"'Contact' deserved the Locus Award it won for Best First Novel in 1986.  Unfortunately, it is the only piece of fiction Carl Sagan wrote.  It, however, is not the only book he wrote.   Sagan wrote several works of non-fiction including 'Demon Haunted World.' which is great.  As an astronomer, cosmologist, astrophysicist, astrobiologist, and author he created many works that popularized and made science accessible to the general public.  With 'Contact,' you do not have to question whether the science behind the science fiction is credible.  I can see how the theorizing and long passages devoted to philosophy could be taxing if you're looking for action, but it is a big piece of what I love about it. The heart of this book asks what is faith and belief. Sagan proposes faith in a religion and having faith that life exists on other planets is not so different.  What is different is how people react to faith.  Scientists work to prove a thought or belief through analysis and experiment. If evidence proves them wrong they change the construct of their belief.  Religion does not rely on proof, believing faith does not require evidence. Politics is concerned with how to deal with or manage a result or the effect of faith. Sagan takes these strong black and white constructs and shows us how they overlap infinitely ...like a circle in the universe.Ellie Arroway is a scientist and astronomer.  Since she was young she did not accept answers she could not prove herself. She pursued her love of science and despite her step-fathers discouragement through school.  Ellie was going to college in the 70's and was frequently the only woman in many classes, lectures, and departments.  Instead of accepting professors ignoring her questions and statements she just spoke louder.  This brought her friends and enemies but Ellie wasn't bothered by other people's opinions.  She found those who she could relate with and didn't spend time on the others.  Ellie gravitated toward radio astronomy and Professor Peter Valerian.  In the academic world every professor was allowed an idiosyncrasy and Valerian's was the fascination with extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI.)  Ellie loved and fell for the romance of the possibility of life on other planets. As a result, Ellie chose the development of an improvement in the sensitive receivers employed on radio telescopes for her dissertation.It permitted her to continue her discussions with Valerian-but without taking the professionally dangerous step of working with him on extraterrestrial intelligence.""  She succeeded developing a ruby maser and improving radio astronomy to the level that she detected remnants of the Big Bang. I'd say that's not bad for a graduate student.  It put her in the position to manage Project Argus and oversee numerous radio telescopes in New Mexico - dedicated primarily to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). To keep funding they would take other projects and when Professor Drumlin gunned to end all funding for SETI, which he found a ridiculously romantic and feminine notion in Arroway, she found the signal.  A signal she sent to multiple nations astronomers to verify it.  The government was not keen on her involving them before they had control of the situation.  What ensued after was years of recording the signal, decoding the message, and building the specifications for a machine that is believed to transport them to the alien intelligence.Sagan's main focus is not on the science of the message or even in decoding it.  The core of the book is on how humanity relates and responds to the message.  Ellie, who has spent most of her life focusing on finding communication from other planets, is now a major voice in the political scientific community.  The message effects how countries interact with one another.  It could create war as easily as peace and is a landmine to be navigated.  Public interpretation must be carefully handled.  Is it to be controlled? Can the message be manipulated?  Will it be seen as a message from God or the devil?  Is it to be feared or welcomed?  Most importantly, what is the message and what is the intention of this extraterrestrial communication?Sagan wrote this in 1985 and takes place primarily in the 1990's.  Some ideas included are still science fiction but many concepts are surprisingly accurate to how time has progressed.  We haven't had a female president but in some ways feminism has come further than Sagan predicted.  We could take some pointers from Sagan in others.    He created an interesting character in Ellie Arroway.  He borrowed characteristics for her from colleagues and others from himself.  Sagan could be considered brash in shutting people down if their science or explanations did not make sense much like Ellie.  Also, like him, she became a public image for the scientific community and held atheistic beliefs that could create tension when dealing with highly publicized scientific questions.Sagan, studied potentials for extraterrestrial life, but held strong attention to physical realities and analysis.  Sagan seems to channel his own expectations through Peter Valerian's character because Valerian, ""...repeatedly stressed that speculation must be confronted with sober physical reality. It was a kind of sieve that separated the rare useful speculation from torrents of nonsense.The extraterrestrials and their technology had to conform strictly to the laws of nature, a fact that severely crimped many a charming prospect. But what emerged from this sieve, and survived the most skeptical physical and astronomical analysis, might even be true. ""  Sagan was a champion for discrediting pseudoscience which he felt hurt the relationship of the public to the scientific community and its pursuits.  During the 1960's and 1970's, when there was a public fascination for UFO's, he worked to prove and disprove information considered ""scientific evidence.""  People who have watched 'Ancient Aliens' on the History Channel would be interested to know that the night after Erich Von Daniken went on the Johnny Carson show, promoting 'Chariots of the Gods,' Carl Sagan made an appearance.  His connection with Carson and his scientific knowledge did little to help Daniken's theories of aliens visiting Earth in the ancient past.  If you are interested in Carl Sagan and his role in the study of extraterrestrial intelligence and fight against pseudoscience a good article by Keay Davidson is The Universe and Carl Sagan.The narration by Laurel Lefkow on audible is superb.  She handles multiple accents as well as interpreting Ellie Arroway wonderfully.  Whether you read it or listen to it I believe it is a fabulous experience.The beauty of Sagan's work in 'Contact' is his showing humanity working together to decipher what the message is and who is sending it.  At the end of it all he focuses on the ability of people keeping an open mind when working with one another - treating each other with love and respect in dealing with one another.  It is the heart of communication - whether it is on Earth or Vega.  He takes the word faith and presents it in its multiple definitions.  It is a beautiful study of humanity and who we try to be."

I read this once long ago in print & thought this version was pretty good, but I think I filled in a few gaps from memory.It's an excellent look at Sagan's baby, the SETI project, & what might happen if a signal is detected. It would certainly change our view of the universe. I really liked how he handled the religious, political & military sides. People had to adjust their faith somewhat, but not too much both in religion & science. Very well done. Politics & the military were understandable & often sad. There was some old tech, but the time is the late 1990s, so that didn't hurt it too much.Well narrated & highly recommended."
27,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56173179-ivana-books-are-magic,3,"I did enjoy reading Contact a lot. This SF novel has a lot going for it. The premise is interesting, the plot is well constructed and the ending isn't bad either. Perhaps the story drags here and there, but for most part Contact is an enjoyable read. The leading lady is a great character, human yet very strong woman. Eleanor ""Ellie"" Arroway is the best part of the novel in my opinion. The protagonist is well portrayed and quite likable. The writing is for most part intelligent and sometimes even surprisingly poetic. I still recall those passages about Eleanor driving through desert. Another thing I recall are the emotional touches that made Eleanor's character come to life. For instance, the descriptions of Eleanor's relationship with her father were quite touching. As the novel progresses, her childhood memories get entangled with her search for terrestrial life. I liked the way Ellie's past gets mixed up with her present. It seemed appropriate in the context of the novel. She is definitely the most fascinating characters in the book and the driving force behind it.Contact is a very good science fiction novel. It contains a lot of scientific detail that make it credible and realistic. I suppose you'd expect that in a novel written by a scientist, but still it is worth mentioning. In many ways, it is an educational book. Indeed, you can really learn some fascinating facts from this one. One question that asks (and answered) in this novel repeatedly is why we should search for life beyond Earth? What is our justification for spending all that money on something that might be a lost cause? Sagan seems to think that it is a worthy investment and I would tend to agree. The writer does make some good points about the worth of space exploration, but I can't say that I learned something new from them. I believe in the value of investing in scientific research, it is not as if I need someone to point it out to me. Still, there were some neat 'geeky' things I learned from this book. So far I talked about things I liked about this novel, now let's talk about some flaws. The pacing is a bit slow at times. At one points, the novel seems to stop and then it offers a deux et machina solution for the problem. Many things seem a bit too convenient. I didn't mind it terribly much, because this novel wasn't exactly thriller like and I was more interested in its ideas then in action as such. I didn't expect many twist and turns or great logic behind every thing that happened. Still, it is worth pointing out that some plot solutions were a bit lazy. Besides the novel being slow paced at times, I also didn't like the way most characters were portrayed. It was quite superficial and there were no interesting moral debates in this book. There are no interesting dialogues either. Sagan is very exclusive in his belief that all atheists are intelligent and all believers stupid. It never occurs to him that many early scientist were in fact priests. To completely disregard anyone who believes in God is a bit extreme. Sagan is good at understanding the scientific mind, but other more social and philosophical stuff? Not really. I don't blame him, but it makes the novel less complex. Sagan was probably traumatized at some point by the kind of people who are against teaching evolution in schools. Nevertheless, Sagan fails to see that militant atheism isn't a cure for militant religious fanatics. It seems to me that Sagan is not the most successful writer mainly because he's so exclusive in some of his views. Not surprisingly, the human, the social and the psychological side to novel is less than perfect.As I said, I partly get it. Who likes militant religious fanatics? They are a pain in the neck. So, yes it's often justified and understandable that Sagan makes fun at them. However, the fact that Sagan seemed to be something of a militant atheist makes it kind of ironic. Sagan takes his scientific ideology a bit too far, gets too involved in it, I would say. In this novel in particular, you can hear Sagan preaching atheism. The irony is that Sagan is more alike to them (the religious fanatics), more than he would have liked to admit. His atheism is aggressive at times and feels like an ideology in itself. That's the feeling I got. If you ask me, scientific thinking should be open. Scientist should not be afraid to say: “I don’t know.”. Using your book for promoting your aggressively atheist point of view is a tricky choice. It can backfire, it often does. Listening to someone preaching why there is no God is just as boring as someone explaining why his version of God is the only one. Live and let live, man. That being said, it really is a good novel. There were only a few things that bothered me and I've said enough about them, I think. I do get why Sagan would get frustrated with religious fanatics, but he was also guilty of being very exclusive and rigid in his views. It makes his characterization less rich. Were it not for such a great female protagonist, this novel would be a lot less enjoyable because the other characters don't have much going for them. What I noticed is when it comes to space, Sagan's mind is wonderfully open yet when it comes to understand human society and all its complexities- he doesn't do so well. To conclude, this novel has a wonderful protagonist, lovely ideas and an interesting story, but there are some minor flaws that made me enjoy a bit less. I did actually see the film and I can say that I liked the film version as well. It is not as good as the novel, but it's not bad. All in all, I did quite enjoy this novel and I can recommend it. It is not perfect, but it is quite good. 3.4 stars. "
28,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/733629-chris,4,"I can’t say enough good things about the writing of the late Carl Sagan. Previously, the only works of his I had read are his non-fiction works “Cosmos” and “Dragons of Eden”. I didn’t quite know what to expect of his fictional work, though I think I had a few good clues going into it, the first being the fact I’ve seen the film adaptation about fifty times (which I discovered is vastly different than this story, aside from the general, top-level plot) and the second being Sagan’s stated expectations/hopes/fantasies in his other works when he discusses the forthcoming ‘contact’ from another intelligent civilization which he firmly believes exists, somewhere. While I didn’t know if Carl could write a lick of fiction worth a damn, “Contact” still beckoned.	Much like the message that appears to be originating from nearby the star Vega in the book, Sagan's message penetrates the babbling background noise of commonplace life and I hope that every last one of his readers are glad they were listening with white-knuckled anxiety to that particular frequency. Carl Sagan’s best quality is his intelligent sensibility and incredible sense of wonderment and adventure; his writing and boundless appreciation for the infinite wonders this universe holds is unparalleled, and he’s sickeningly contagious; I dare anyone to read Sagan and walk away without seeing their own existence in a new light. At one point in “Contact” he draws a parallel between the humbling but awesome and enlightening religious experience dubbed ‘the numinous’ or ‘misterium tremendum’ in which the acolyte feels utterly insignificant but absolutely astonished through their epiphany; I was thunderstruck at how accurately he was describing my selfsame helpless reverence for his own powerful work.	One last digression before actually commenting on the book; I can’t imagine what a profound impact the loss of Carl Sagan was to our own exploration of the cosmos. When I think about what we are capable of, and what we are actually actively pursuing, I feel insulted as a human being begging for even a morsel of this knowledge. Astronomers and scientists ultimately blame public ignorance and pitiful government and private funding (with the widespread ignorance as the real culprit driving the budgeting decisions), but when presenting their concepts to the masses, the largest problem I see is that the eggheads just can’t effectively communicate their plans, I can only assume the response from most budget committees is “hey, thanks for completely mind-fucking us with your nth dimensional cosmic jargon and belittling our intelligence in the process of panhandling for a couple of million dollars. Feel free to erase that blackboard-filling-equation before pissing off and taking a flying fuck at a rolling donut”. With his ability to efficiently communicate these things to the layman, Sagan filled a much-needed niche, replaced now by a vacuum and a lack of connectivity between those who could finance such operations and those who dare to espouse these fantastic dreams. We also seem to have lost our balls somewhere along the way in our quest; I understand there is little glory in the Challenger and Columbia disasters, and that both of these tragedies are at the forefront of many minds when contemplating taking that next step in our progress, but seriously, we’ve lost a hundred times as many people in the process of sheep-shearing through the ages, and sure, there’s a major difference in the money lost in these ventures, but it’s time to grow up people. Besides, there’s a good chance we’ll find space-sheep capable of shearing themselves, let’s start looking forward to bigger and better instead of sniveling over past failures.	In “Contact”, Sagan hypothesizes on mankind finally receiving an indication from space that we are not alone. Eleanor Arroway is a radio astronomer bound to the tenets of science and grew up somewhat brash and confrontational due to a poor relationship with her step-father, the nefarious businessman John Staughton. Her 'true' father, a simple, loving, hard-working hardware vendor was taken from her at a young age, and a less-similar replacement than Staughton couldn’t be found in the Milky Way. Ellie’s studies are rooted firmly in the black and white world of science, which is considered uncharacteristic for a woman at the time, and Staughton makes sure to scoff and mock at her passions and desires at every turn, as she slowly gains acceptance and credibility as a radio astronomer. She starts accumulating some serious observation time at premier facilities where she is slowly brought into the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. A thorough skeptic, even Ellie isn’t convinced that SETI is a worthwhile course of action, with thousands of man hours a year spent (effectively) wasting time for little green men.	Until, of course, mankind finally receives a signal, which appears to be the real thing, on her watch.	In order to get confirmation that the inbound transmission from space is legitimate, she has to align the resources of international observatories in order to continue receiving it as the planet turns and to establish credibility from various sources receiving the signal. In two jiggle’s of a jackrabbit’s ass, the authorities swoop down to try to contain the situation, rather displeased that she felt the need to alert foreign agencies of this unprecedented event. The message itself is obviously of intelligent design, patterned around prime numbers with multiple underlying messages within the palimpsest. The first part to be decoded is a doozy, Adolph Hitler announcing the onset of the Olympic games in Berlin. Immediately, the government is less than amused; few things are less expected or desired than a space-faring Fourth Reich. The scientific community assures them that the Nazi broadcast is simply the first earth-bound transmission powerful enough to have reached space, and this is the aliens’ way of confirming that they received are message. The irony of Hitler as our first ambassador to space is lost on few. 	After much labor, the message is finally decoded, and it’s a schematic for building a machine, for purposes left unspecified. For the most part, the ‘big brains’ are convinced that the machine is some form of conveyance with which to go and meet this civilization, but the defense agencies of the planet understandably conceive that this thing may very well be a Doomsday Device, or perhaps a Trojan Horse of some sort, upon activation we can either expect that this thing will completely annihilate the planet or transport the Vegan army directly to Earth. These points of view cause quite a sensation, and this is before the religious fanatics begin jumping into the debate, unafraid to compare the Machine (as it is dubbed) to the Tower of Babel, as a blasphemous means to speak with God, and should we be foolish enough to attempt building it, punishment for our insolence is sure to follow.  	Naturally, construction begins on not just one, but a pair of Machines, setting in motion a great tale of fantastic adventure in the search for truth and man’s rightful place in this apparently barren universe, dredging up enough speculation to question or validate one’s faith, forging a bond of worldly brotherhood and a desire for a diligent and determined global community, and a moving reaffirmation of the things which make life worth living.  	I couldn’t recommend anything better if you have a scheduled week of daydreaming ahead of you, preferably on a sunny beach.	So jump on the bandwagon, find your voice, and cry for the construction of The Machine, or at least whatever the hell we can currently erect that helps us understand and visit the corners of this sprawling playground we were generously given to explore. We’re past the days of launching unmanned flights that contain a phonograph with a golden lp record blindly into space. Let’s face it, knowing our bum luck that thing is going to be intercepted by some amateur DJ on his way to his next gig in the Pleiades, and all he’s going to do is lift some samples from it when he’s scratching away for a hodgepodge of alien species. We can either get our asses in gear and make a mark of our own deliberate fashioning in the cosmos, or be poorly represented to the galactic community by the sweet sounds of frogs mating as some filler in some nimrod's hot 'mix'. Consider yourself responsible for helping make that call."
29,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35299502-george,4,"As a general rule I like Carl Sagan's writing, both fiction and reference.Resplendent with both fears of the new millenium and mid-1980s nuclear jitters, I can't help but feel that this novel borrows much the film ""Red Planet Mars,"" where astronomers get in touch with our planetary neighbor by broadcasting the number ""pi"" (and receive, in response, a broadcast of the Sermon on the Mount).Though some of this tome appears quite dated from a technological aspect, and bound up in the context of the late Cold War, it's still an entertaining read.Although the prose is somewhat understated, the main themes riff on the nature of both mortality and life.The plot is not simply about making contact with extraterrestrial beings, but emphasizes the relationship of humans between each other and the infinte quest to understand the mammoth question every person asks himself: ""why?"". Alongside some of the unnecessarily dense science parts, there is a well woven a story and an array of characters that we can empathise with. I enjoyed the way that religion and science entwine, and come to an understanding that it is somehow connected to all of us and everything we know. The serios drawback the amount of scientific jargon at the end, and that become tedious.But overall, this is not simply science fiction, it is a book on the human condition."

I think I saw the movie first and despite not really liking it, my interest was piqued by the book... and a big book, too. I really like long, good reads (chalk it up to my early interest in historical romance novels which for the most part - especially early Johanna Lindsey ones, none of her new crap - are long and big... haha) and this is definitely fits that category.Sagan, is quite simply, a master at what he knows and how he conveys all of it in this novel. While I didn't understand his explanations of radioastronomy or even physics, it made sense on some accessible level that did not take away from the heart of the book, the journey of its characters, especially Ellie, and his views of modern society, religion, and God.I especially liked his theory of world peace coming about when the citizens of the world realize they are part of a much larger entity than themselves and their nations after the realization of extraterrestial life. I guess you can call me a sci-fi romantic."

32,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4743119-oleksandr-zholud,3,"This is a first contact SF novel, one of the only two fiction works by Carl Sagan. It won Locus in 1986. I read is as a part of monthly reading in February 2020 at  The Evolution of Science Fiction group.This is a short novel that can be split into three main parts (very slight spoilers ahead)The first part is almost real life, in the tradition of Airport and Hotel, so called occupation novel, which details how professionals do their jobs. In this case a woman mathematician and astronomer Ellie Arroway works for SETI (a real world organization, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence). As can be expected from the title, they get the signal and try to analyze it. This part is strongly based on reality of how SETI works, what are the challenges and what they would do in case of non-random info from space.The second part is about the actual contact and it is not in line with physics as we now understand it, and neither it is actually original nor daring, so this was the weakest part for me.The third part can be titled Consequences has an interesting and maybe unexpected twist.Overall an interesting read, but nothing spectacular.

I admit its not Event Horizon, but Contact doesn't reveal anything in specifics too. It builds up the unknown, suggests even a debatable unreliability in protagonist's narrative and leaves the conclusion to readers. Sure, it suggests too much in the definitive line of science, but the Machine, and the unexplainable experience of cosmonauts all had the same fear of unknown. To me, it translated well, and left this sense of being a nobody or nothing in the vast world we know very little about. To Lovecraft it was frightening, and to Sagan it was fascinating.I noticed few more similarities of the sort in the book, regarding the societal response to someone who has embraced this vastness of universe. People were eager to brand her delusional for providing explanations for experiences they couldn't fathom. The Machine and her first contact further felt like an optimistic take on some sorta portal to the other that exists with us. Book even ended with the suggestion of some intelligence that predates humanity, Elder ones style.""Standing over humans, Gods and Demons, subsuming caretakers and tunnel builders, there is an intelligence that antedates the universe.""The second heresy is movie being better than the book, or more like an enhancing experience against the usual corollary. I loved the span of dialogue the book entertained. And the kind of balance it maintained in its science vs religion debate by placing skepticism against latter's received truth and former's hypothesis against revelation. Book was also very honest and realistic in its depiction of scientific community and academia that's stuck in the anxiety of publications. Translation of radio astronomy into geopolitics with the discovery, and variegated responses within and outside the system were also really interesting to read through. But, from a dramatic or entertainment point of view, movie had many embellishing aspects.I loved how fleshed Palmer was in movie and how unfleshed Ellie was. Her emotional baggages, though highly complimentary for book's first contact, made me feel like tuning through static for some signal. Also I found movie's selection of single occupant more narratively appropriate than book's multipartite crew. It went well with the collinearity of novel's point of view as opposed to the 11th hour gatecrashing by characters I wasn't emotionally attached with. The sole source also enhanced drama in my opinion, by adding skepticism to the already suggested unreliability. Further, the limited time made the Voyage more believable and thrilling in its few seconds than the comparable generosity in book. I loved the novel, but it also made me love the movie more; and I don't mean it as a negative here.In my severe reduction, Contact can be considered as humanity's delayed introduction to The Culture; it can also be viewed as the most expensive and elaborate psychedelic experience as well. The scientific slant towards latter is what makes the book different from my overkill of a comparison with cosmic horror. Nevertheless it was a very delightful experience even with spoilers from the movie."

Too much scientific information that is truly unnecessary; too many dry and long stretches that make you say, just get on with it already!; too many other books out there for me to sit any longer with this dinosaur.I haven't seen the movie, nor have I experienced the audiobook, and if I had more time in life I would perhaps try those two things in tandem with my reading. But I just can't seem to find the time .. or maybe it is the motivation. Even the audiobook knew enough to take out the monotonous parts (a friend who couldn't get through it on her own, followed the audio version with her text and had to skip pages of it in order to keep up with what they were ""reading"").I suppose it makes it easier to skip out on this book when it was for my book club and I cannot attend the meeting anyway, but I am [if nothing else] proud of myself to be willing to let this book go. Major progress and changes from years past."
35,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13266158-samadrita,5,"What a truly remarkable read. This is the kind of science fiction which instead of being more speculative relies on existing theories about extraterrestrial life and details of the ongoing research to spin an enthralling tale. Carl Sagan has tried in his own unique way to merge the seemingly contradictory worlds of science and faith. A near impossible feat for a man of science, but he manages to achieve exactly this and in such a thrilling way too. He combines elements of science fiction, radio astronomy, extraterrestrial life, conflict between science and religion and yet never manages to sound half-hearted. The reader gets the message in the end, loud and clear. The ending is the clincher and after finishing with the book I don't think there could've been a better way to end it. Must read! Though the movie was largely able to capture the feelings that the book evokes in the reader, the director ended up Hollywood-izing it anyway. "
36,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34207574-miquel-reina,5,"I always loved a good science fiction book, especially if the author deeply understands the technology and science behind the story. Contact is a great journey told by the always amazing mind of Carl Sagan. As a kid, I watched Jodie Foster's Contact so many times and I've always been a huge fan of Carl's Sagan Cosmos! I love space and good science fiction so I wanted to give a try to the only novel Carl Sagan wrote. Honestly, I thought I could get a bit boring because I knew the story, but I was really surprised, not only because the plot is much more complex and rich than the movie, but also, because of its deep themes. "
37,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62648627-nick,5,"Possibly not five stars, but then I respect and admire Carl Sagan ... so five stars from me!"

39,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"I adore Carl Sagan. I came to this adoration rather late, through Symphony of Science. So I've intended to pick up Contact for a while, and I'm glad I finally did. It did take me quite a while to get into it -- the level of scientific detail is what was difficult for me, but there were some great scenes: the one that springs to mind is the one where they're lying in bed quoting in the encyclopaedia at each other.Another thing I loved is that he had a female scientist as his protagonist, and a female president, but he didn't pretend he was writing a work set in a utopian world: Ellie still has to deal with people's prejudices against a female scientist. She wasn't a figure of total wish fulfilment, in any sense.The sense of wonder at the universe is something Carl Sagan always seems to convey, and it's here as well. One of the very good reasons for reading his work and watching his tv series (and now song videos!).I might reread this during the summer, when I'm less busy, and can just kick back with it. Because I read it over the course of a few weeks, and while I was reading several other books, I can't quite hold the whole of it in my head, which I'm sure took away some of the pleasure of it."
40,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2008190-drowningmermaid,2,"4 stars for ""Contact: or Celebrating All-Things Science with Feasible First-Contact Near-Term SF""1 star for ""Contact: How Carl Sagan Hates Creationists, now in novel form!""Ellie's collegiate-level (while she was still in high school! when she had never picked up a religious text before! WHEE!) deconstruction of the Bible was wildly implausible. Seriously, if a modern kid picked up the Bible and started reading-- having had no exposure to ancient literature, or the ""spiritual discipline"" of ""prayerful reading""-- they are most likely to be struck, not by the inconsistencies, but by how fantastically boring the whole thing is. The same goes for the Book of Mormon, and many other major world texts.And it only gets worse from there, really, with the introduction of characters who exemplify the most lugubrious stereotypes of creationists. And I am saying this as someone who basically agrees with Sagan's anti-creationist arguments. Just-- ugh. I'm the kind of person who can't stand listening to talk radio, or debates-- even if it be Bill Nye vs. the Creationists. And this book is devoting more and more pages to Girl Sagan's sweeping, sharp-tongued fantasy victories over the buck-toothed cousin-marrying morons."
41,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126262-brooke,3,"I've read several of Sagan's non-fiction books prior to this novel, and I strangely found him to be much less engaging here. The first half of Contact reads more like non-fiction than a story, but it's lacking the voice that made his non-fiction so good. The second half of the book, though, once the Machine gets built, suddenly has a lot more heart to it than I was expecting. Now that I'm done with it, I'm finding myself appreciating the whole thing a lot more than I thought I was going to in the beginning.The main character, Ellie Arroway, is basically a voice for Sagan. She has his same sense of wonder balanced by a skeptic's strict requirement for evidence. I liked the vision that Sagan had of a world whose international conflicts died down once we learned we weren't alone in the universe. "
42,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54835325-kat,5,Enjoyed the book even more than the movie.
43,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20276605-keikii-eats-books,5,"To read more of my reviews, check out my blog at keikii Eats Books!I also wrote a post comparing Contact with The Sparrow by Mary Doria Russell here. Quote: “This planet is run by crazy people. Remember what they have to do to get where they are. Their perspective is so narrow, so... brief. A few years. In the best of them a few decades. They care only about the time they are in power.” Review: Contact was published 1985 and it is just as relevant today as it was then.If you've never read the book or seen the movie before, you should. If you have seen the movie, then you know the general outline of the story. For those who haven't: the book follows Ellie Arroway, through her childhood and then into her adult life. It starts with her being a smart little girl, very gifted in science and math. And all the adults around her do not like the interests she has, and have no idea how to support a girl who likes math and science. They tried to redirect her interests, and it frustrated Ellie. She is insatiably curious, and she doesn't think highly of the adults in her life, because they weren't curious and they disliked her incessant curiosity that was very likely disruptive. #relatableThen Ellie gets to college, and she finds that she has to speak louder than her male classmates. She was very outnumbered in her classes, because she was taking astronomy and physics classes. She had to be more direct, more abrasive, and better than everyone else to get the same amount of credit and to be listened to the same as her male counterparts. This in turn makes Ellie very curt, direct, and abrasive to others, especially when she is fighting for what she believes in. It makes people not like her as much as others who can more easily play the likability game.There is one particularly long quote I want to share regarding this gender problem:She found it difficult to discuss physics, much less debate it, with her predominantly male classmates. At first they paid a kind of selective inattention to her remarks. There would be a slight pause, and then they would go on as if she had not spoken. Occasionally they would acknowledge her remark, even praise it, and then again continue undeflected. She was reasonably sure her remarks were not entirely foolish, and did not wish to be ignored, much less ignored and patronized alternately. Part of it—but only a part—she knew was due to the softness of her voice. So she developed a physics voice, a professional voice: clear, competent, and many decibels above conversational. With such a voice it was important to be right. She had to pick her moments. It was hard to continue long in such a voice, because she was sometimes in danger of bursting out laughing. So she found herself leaning towards quick, sometimes cutting, interventions, usually enough to capture their attention; then she could go on for a while in a more usual tone of voice. Every time she found herself in a new group she would have to fight her way through again, just to dip her oar into the discussion. The boys were uniformly unaware even that there was a problem.Yet for the incredibly logical Ellie, she does something odd, to those who don't know her well. She goes to get her PhD in Radio Telemetry, so she can join the search for extra terrestrial life (SETI). Something considered fringe, weird, and ultimately useless by her peers, taking up radio time and energy that could be used in better, more useful pursuits. However, Ellie is incredibly passionate about everything she does, and this is no different. She loves the search and it has become her passion.And then something unexpected happens: a signal comes from outer space. And it is intelligent. There is no doubt about it. And everything changes. Suddenly scientists are scrambling across the globe to figure out if it is genuine, where it is coming from, and what the message means. And to not lose any data, since the Earth happens to spin on its axis, and the radio array isn't always going to be pointing in the right direction. The scientists are largely working together, to figure out all the pieces. And there are a lot of pieces to put together.But the government, specifically the American government, isn't happy. The radiotelescope array is on US soil, funded by US taxpayers, and they got the message first. By pure luck, mostly. They think that they can hide this from other countries somehow. Because they don't want to cause panic, they want all the secrets to themselves, etc. But, the US isn't the only country with facilities to pick up the signal. Most notably, the Russian Government does as well. And the signal can't be hidden, the news is already out there. And it HAS to be an international cooperative agreement, because they won't get the entire message otherwise. And no one knows how long it will take to complete, nor if it will even repeat. Things only get more complicated when they find out that the signal is transmitting the blueprints to build a machine - and no one knows what it is supposed to be. But maybe it is a weapon? Orrr maybe not? Ever think about that, stupid government?There is also the religious sector. Especially within the United States. Fear is the name of the game, and some sectors of the religious groups think that this signal is a sign of the devil, to tempt humanity from the way of the good and holy. And if it isn't from the devil, then we can't let the scientists interpret the message, because they are not agents of God, and they wouldn't be able to decipher the message correctly anyway because obviously this is a message from the Holy. This becomes especially important when it becomes clear that The Machine is a transportation device. Everyone wants a spot, and there are only five seats.I love this story. I loved it the first time i saw the movie when I was a little girl. I love it now as an adult. I really wish I would have read this as a young girl. It would have made a big impact on my life. Ellie's fight to be seen in a world that would rather ignore her will speak to many women, today as the message did in 1985.And it is definitely worth reading the book, even if you have seen the movie a hundred times like I have. The movie did an absolutely phenomenal job of capturing both the tone and story of the book, but there are still a lot of differences due to it being an adaptation and the need to conserve time. Most notably there are differences in the religious and familial aspects, but everything else is better fleshed out. The ending of the book is also almost completely different, and well, well worth the read. Especially since this is not a solo trip like it is in the movie.I'm so glad I read this.And also: this resulted in the strangest ship I've ever had. Lol."
44,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41690792-muthuvel,5,"Many people get the feeling for a good book when finished that it should be recognized, read widely enough for the spread of intellectual harmony and happiness. Like many of those, I realised the love of my life very recently. At the time of finishing the book, I felt like a civilian of a far future civilization living in a nearby star system from Earth, feeling proud of the antecedents who had humble inceptions, how interesting the people evolved in time. I felt like it's the Best Novel I've ever read in my life.It was a book named Contact written by Carl Sagan, a late astronomer who had worked on NASA planetary projects and was a professor at Cornell University. He used to contribute a lot through the facade of science to common muggles thus had a prominent role in having created awareness towards the importance of science since early 80's till his demise. Unlike his other books, it was a Novel. It is often propagandized that Novels are most widely written than Nonfiction books. Maybe he wanted this book to be widely read; widely contemplated.The Story starts with a group of radio astronomers of US detecting unambiguous intelligent signal from a nearby star which is rich in tens of complex information. Having several political disputations between the nations, scientific community all over the world began to work the problem and figured that the information was actually for building a machine that could take humans to the star. after much unprecedented sabotages, 5 persons from USA, Russia, India, China, Nigeria were selected representing the Earth. what they encounter during their expedition could change/improve one's perception widely, drastically. There are several things I could say the best regarding the bookPOLITICAL STEREOTYPESNot many people think and realise the national borders are just arbitraries as a result of irrational wars and disputes just because of frequent misunderstandings for the past few centuries. In the story, the signals were sent to Earth by E.T.s only after they received the signal from us (Speech of Adolf Hitler during 1936 Berlin Olympic games). The following things are very likely to occur even in the current global scenario. Silent conspiracies were being run by politicians considering others as competitive in building the machine so that the particular nation could take pride among others (Space race and Cold war times). Various governmental security heads like NSA were too much chauvinistic releasing the scientific information between countries for the purpose of decryption and this nationalistic feel is only a boon up to some level. This can never bring out a solution to the problems faced by the people. We're one interesting species with an interesting mix.""To Every man is given the key to the gates of heaven; the same key opens the gates of hell""CLASH OF THE SCIENCE & RELIGIONThe signal from a nearby forgotten pole star helped many conspiracy theorists, chiliasts, religious propagandists to project their own ideas into the happening. It was interpreted by reverend clergymen that the signal either could be an invitation from the angels or the satan; Some Doomsday machine; some as Trojan Machine. Reminded me of one of the fallibilities of us, we always intend to represent our own nature into nature.LOVE OF MATHEMATICSMathematics is the universal language among intelligent civilisations. Maybe God is just a Mathematician, I remember a book written by Mario Livio. The signal actually sent by ETs was a kind of palimpsest i.e., various messages encoded over the same signal (here in this case phase modulated) one of the messages was about prime numbers that were heading towards the infinity. Even during the visit to those beings, protagonist retrieves data reg their effort in deciphering the pi value assuming it as a message in 11 dimensions. Maybe someone wanted to tell about the elegance of the universe bound of the essence of math. Maybe God is a Mathematician!MATHEMATICS OF LOVEFor the beings like us the vastness is bearable only by love. By the time, the five trained persons reached the alien land through a series of Einstein-Rosen Bridges or Wormholes, they spent the night in a world similar to Earth more likely to be simulated by those beings who did extract all the information from the human brains. They insisted that the humans were very few among the herds who reached them. Many civilisations mess with themselves because of various traits. Our unique abilities like dreams, love are very important. The only thing we've found that makes the emptiness bearable is each other. And love not just pertaining to the human relationships but as a species; as a caretaker being kind to the other species whom we share our tiny home.""Chastity is a wealth that comes from abundance of love.""LESSON IN HUMILITYIt was pretty sure that the humans were very backward technologically relative to the bulk beings who works on the galactic centre of the milky way teleporting matter particles over a nearby radio galaxy Cygnus A for the past 600 million years. Even they didn't want to judge the human species upon them. We humans are very adaptable. By the end of the next century or by the time when people start to live on interplanetary colonies, things might get changed.LEAP OF FAITHReligion and Faith weren't the two sides of the same coin at the beginning. However we humans have worked on the faith unconsciously for eons through our antecedents. it's hard to battle the billion-year-old instincts with the million-year-old evolutionary mind. Faith and beliefs made us humans. It made up our evolution process; our pages of the history says so; It will take us to the stars.""In the revealing jargon of theortitical physics, the universe was their apple and someone had tunneled through, riddling the interior with passageways that crisscrossed the core. For a bacillus who lived on the surface, it was a miracle. But a being outside the apple might be less impressed""They Bulk beings are in the search of a survey of intelligent beings and their capabilities in the local hood. that's one of the reasons they wanted the humans to reach them. They don't want to harm us or use us for their entertainment unlike we do many things with the fellow beings like insects, animals and birds, et cetera here on our home. Reminds me that Earth is a very small stage in the vast cosmic arena. Sagan wanted us to read it to remind us to be more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the only home we've ever known."
45,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/233507-s-ach,3,"For all the tenure of humans on Earth, the night sky had been a companion and an inspiration. The stars were comforting. They seemed to demonstrate that the heavens were created for the benefit and instruction of humans. This pathetic conceit became the conventional wisdom worldwide. No culture was free of it. Some people found in the skies an aperture to the religious sensibility. Many were awestruck and humbled by the glory and scale of the cosmos. Others were stimulated to the most extravagant flights of fancy.Our universe is complex. Science tries to uncover the truth behind this intriguing universe.This journey, this process of unravelling the mystery, is so beautiful in itself, that fictionalizing it becomes unnecessary.However, for the un-informed (read me), sometimes giving a thrilling, suspenseful and lyrical angle to science, makes it more palatable, more digestible. Probably, that's why Sagan, in his endeavour to popularize science, wrote this fictional account on the progress man has made in search for extra-terrestrial intelligence and its possible outcome.If you read 'Cosmos', you will instantly become a fan of Carl Sagan. Because, Sagan just not confined himself to wonders of Cosmos, rather transcended to the various facets of human curiosity, understanding and achievement. In 'Contact', one can see Sagan trying to give a fictional flavour to the development of our knowing the universe and predicting its future. An atheist reads the religious scriptures to find fault in them. A believer highlights the gaps and limitations of human knowledge and finds comfort in his own faith. But, an agnostic is in constant enterprise to find the truth. Sagan admits himself to be an agnostic. He famously said, An atheist is someone who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has compelling evidence against the existence of God. I know of no such compelling evidence. Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, we would have to know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such God exists. To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.  In the book the portions that deal with the conflict between religion and science, are the most interesting to read. Sometimes rational -...every religion there was a doctrinal line beyond which it insulted the intelligence of the practitioner. Reasonable people might disagree as to where that line should be drawn, but religions trespassed well beyond it at their peril.Sometimes more attacking -You see, the religious people — most of them — really think this planet is an experiment. That's what their beliefs come down to. Some god or other is always fixing and poking, messing around with tradesmen's wives, giving tablets on mountains, commanding you to mutilate your children, telling people what words they can say and what words they can't say, making people feel guilty about enjoying themselves, and like that. Why can't the gods leave well enough alone? Sometimes suggestive -We all have a thirst for wonder. It's a deeply human quality. Science and religion are both bound up with it. What I'm saying is, you don't have to make stories up, you don't have to exaggerate. There's wonder and awe enough in the real world. Nature's a lot better at inventing wonders than we are.But unfortunately, as far as Science Fiction is concerned, 'Contact' won't feature in my favourite selection. There has been no character development, not a single character that I could root for, no suspenseful thrills or plot twists, no mindboggling imaginations. The preparation of the space voyage is so lenghty and the actual ""contact"" so terse that it befits you-blink-you-miss. I would rather read more of Sagan's non-fiction. Truth is stranger than fiction - ain't it? "
46,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/952810-michelle-in-libris-veritas,5,"Have you ever read a book and when you finished it you find yourself just sitting there staring at the back of the book with a goofy smile on your face? That was how Contact concluded for me. A sense of awe, wonder, and utmost appreciation.Contact is a book that proudly dances on and across the line between logical science and brilliant wonder. It’s both realistic and hopelessly optimist about the vastness of our universe and I need that in my life as often as possible. Contact is at its heart a first contact story, that centers around a woman named Ellie as the Earth finds itself on the receiving end of radio waves from another star system. However, it actually presents a lot more than that. We get glimpses at science vs religions and how there is a possible marriage between the two, and even how when separate they can evoke the same feelings. We see detailed looks at human relationships and how we can be so busy focusing on the ‘big picture’ that we tend to forget the here and now, and how we miss out on things important to us if we don’t take a step back now and then. It holds a scope so massive and yet it spends a good deal of time showing those small important moments that really make a person. The science part of this can be dense and dry, but I honestly have a love of science so I didn’t mind it at all. I thought it was pretty fascinating. However, I think even if someone kind of zoned out during those moments the story would not be lost on you.The plot of this was quite surprising to me. I went in somewhat blind, as I haven’t seen the movie or even looked at reviews, and I am so thankful for that. It’s such an unconventionally beautiful book. Sure it’s dry and can be very dense in areas, but it kind of wormed its way into a portion of mind devoted to childlike wonder for space. I don’t necessarily think this is an easy read, and I had to listening to the audiobook while following along in my print copy just to make sure I was processing it. It certainly has its issues, but this is one of those cases where it just pressed all the right buttons for me. The first contact storyline was compelling and interesting, full of detail and reflection, and the look at Ellie’s personal life and thoughts brought so much more to table.Overall I think this is one to try out if you are a fellow sci-fi nerd. I do recommend trying it out first, perhaps through the library or a sample before committing to it fully."
47,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52718906-david-holmes,4,"It seems to me that Contact is only 50% science fiction novel, and 50% The Gospel According to Carl Sagan. That's not a bad thing. Carl Sagan's worldview permeates this entire book. Science, skepticism, truth and wonder are all advertised here, and organized religion, superstition, frauds and conspiracy theories are all criticized. I've read The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, and in some ways I think Contact does a better job of selling some of the same ideas.
She was determined to be as tough-minded as possible, without abandoning the sense of wonder that was driving her in the first place.
By this point I was starting to wonder if Ellie Arroway is an auther insertion character.Other readers have described Contact as ""religious"". I find this a bit odd, since Carl Sagan had no religion and didn't want to believe anything; he aspired to know. It would probably be better to call the book ""numinous"", a word he uses several times throughout.
Any faith that admires truth, that strives to know God, must be brave enough to accommodate the universe.
...
This new project of hers was in experimental theology. But so is all of science, she thought.
Unfortunately there is a price to be paid for a book that has a mission beyond telling a fun story. Contact takes some time to get going. The first half of the book introduces the main character and her history and her life and worldview, but the plot doesn't really move much until the second half. The second half is strong enough to make it a 4-star book."
48,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23932589-christopher,5,"There is something magical about this book.We follow the life of Dr. Ellie Arroway from childhood to a major discovery: there is a radio signal originating outside of our Solar System from the nearby star Vega. As Dr. Arroway and her research group Argus begin to decipher the signal, they realize there is an intelligence behind the signal -- it is not just noise or an anomaly. As the signal continues to be received, they find there is a pattern to it: it is a message. Humans have finally made contact with extraterrestrial intelligence.This is the backdrop of a philosophical and intriguing story of what is most important to humans, where we are in the universe, and where we are in the grand scheme of things. Carl Sagan was a renowned scientist and skeptic, and many of his philosophical viewpoints are captured in this novel through his protagonist Dr. Arroway. But Sagan isn't a simple person, and he displays myriad viewpoints through many characters as they all try to come to grips with this profound discovery and what it means for humanity and Earth.Sagan gives a fair treatment to all these views as the novel progresses, showing the pros and cons of each (some obviously with more cons or pros than others). What stands out most is the importance for humanity to find a unified perspective: that, despite our differences, we share a common inescapable fate. We either survive and thrive together, or we will destroy ourselves together.Other books tackle this topic in various ways. Watchmen, for example, involves a character trying to unify humanity against an existential threat. But Sagan's treatment is incredibly hopeful and optimistic, which is refreshing due to its surprising rarity. The ending isn't neatly tied together at the end, but that hope remains even until the last page: that we can make it together into the unknown future."
49,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26416859-calzean,4,"The question of what would happen if there is contact with another planet is well covered from various angles; the scientists are excited, politicians worry about security, business see opportunities and religions see threats. There are doubters, debaters and anarchists. There is some mathematics, a fair bit of debate and a lot of intellectualising as a machine is built to the instructions provided by the alien planet. Luckily it was easier than an assembly from Ikea and a gang of five scientists are sent off to return to a world sceptical of their achievement. What did not work in this book is a fairly insipid tale of the chief character's dicey relationship with her step-father. "

The author touches our reason and our faith,and a fine blend of both rarely happens. One can't leave this book without feeling awe at the world we live in,or feeling numinous. It is because of authors like these that it is said that ""books are the example of the fact that humans can work magic."" A must-read for any book lover. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."

I may not have understood or enjoyed a lot of the writing in this book (I find it hard to relate and pay attention to scientific/academic/fact-heavy writing), but the core message is almost everything my life aligns with. The first 300 pages felt challenging (I almost gave up on it multiple times), but that last 100 pages made it all worth it: so dreamy and magical and life-affirming."
54,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"Religion has a nature of making their interpretation of God to be an omnipresent, omnipotent deity. It is most obvious that they have to create such a figure for if otherwise, not many people will be takers for your religion. In the few decades that has passed ever since I have been capable of rational thought, it has been a consistent observation that a lot of people around me take God to be a petitioning body. You pray to him/her for getting through exams, a safe delivery of your child from the womb, success in business and countless other things that are the most important factors in our little lives. I have done this too when I was a child and believed that God was like this ATM wherein you only needed to punch in the correct codes and presto ! As time went by, I got into this nasty habit of reading and discovered how convoluted and downright narrow my idea of this cosmic intelligence was. All those eons old superstition slowly began to vanish when thought went along the lines of : God is said to be the creator of this entire cosmos so what makes us special enough for him to listen to our wish lists ? A perspective I gathered from this was to picture God the engineer, God the mathematician. If you introspect enough : God , the sense that prevents you from doing what is harmful to another human being. This slightly long discourse is not entirely off the topic when it comes to a review of Contact for at the core of this story is an appreciation of a creator or creators who is/are beyond the rigid dogmas of organised religion. This is quite simply put, an appreciation of the feeling of wonderment some of us have every single waking day.The search for extra terrestrial life has been something I was always amused with. This sense of amusement was what drew me to X-Files, the Alien franchise and ultimately to sci-fi too. While a lot of fiction in this field portrays them as either heroes or villains or something beyond both these opposing plot elements, Sagan chooses to portray them as beings which are slightly beyond the comprehension of a non-scientific mind. How we receive a message from beyond the stars, how we comprehend it and what we do with it is roughly how I can summarise this tale. On the way we are offered some scathing reviews of religion, a rather detailed dissection of what it means to be an agnostic or an atheist and the depths of selfishness in the political machine. Sagan is an excellent observer and some of his ideas and beliefs found resonance in me which is to say that the reader and the book connected fairly strong. His extra terrestrials also are not the overwhelming all encompassing type of titans but more of the scientific minded entities. The interaction between human and alien is brief, to-the-point and an epiphany in terms of the perspectives they offer.Let me also get one other factor absolutely clear, this is really below par as a novel. there isn't much of character development or a very detailed plot to speak of. Ellie Arroway as the central protagonist is not a person I would like to know in real life either. The other funny part was that there isn't even one single character in this book who is below a genius level of IQ. The few that do appear to be so are quickly forgotten among the pages. It is a story of geniuses and the topic being what it is, probably needs them. But then the book is brimming with ideas. Ideas that demand you to invest thinking time on, ideas that make you rethink a few of your foundations of thought and so on. It was an excellent book to start my new year with and a great read for all the seeds it planted in my mind !"
55,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17125495-eric,3,"Certainly some interesting science and philosophical discussion in this tale. I thought the ending a bit anticlimactic. The tale develops fairly slowly with the gathering of radio telescope data from an area in space near a star. A mere twenty-five light years away. If nothing else, the humans on earth from countries that rarely talk to each other, learn to work together and put their antagonistic natures aside. Long story short, a ""machine"" is built from the telescope data, a trip is taken, the antagonists return to their true nature and life resumes as if nothing has happened.Did I say philosophical discussions?I won't bother renting the movie."
56,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11408214-tobias-langhoff,4,"This is a slow-burning and contemplative story about humanity’s first contact with extraterrestrial life. Sagan touches upon the intertwinement of philosophy, religion, science and politics as he considers the ramifications of such an historic event. It is a book about the big questions in life and the small questions. About God and family, about aliens and ants. It’s very profound.The first part of the book depicts Ellie’s early life, as she discovers the world and universe around her. It struck a chord with me, being a recent father. Carl Sagan had just gotten a daughter, Sasha, in 1983, two years before the publication of the novel. It seems likely that he based some of Ellie on her; while Sasha was just a toddler at the time, and not even conceived when Sagan first wrote Contact as a screenplay, I assume he gave a lot of thought to how she would grow up in a man’s world (especially if she would follow in his scientific footsteps), and based the final version of Ellie partly on his vision of how she might grow up. (Coincidentally, Ellie’s father and role model dies when she is in seventh grade, and Carl Sagan himself passed away in 1996, in Sasha’s 13th year.)Laurel Lefkow did a great job as audiobook narrator. Her voices and accents were pretty on point, although I didn’t much care for her lisping character(s?), and her Ethiopian and Indian accents were pretty similar.I have actually never watched the movie. I will immediately do so. The story reminded me a fair bit of Interstellar (one of my all-time favorite movies), which is of course fitting since both star Matthew McConaughey, and Kip S. Thorne acted as science advisor on both."
57,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/361971-heather-s-mum,4,"Short review - huge book.I liked Sagan and his ""billions and billions"" charm. I am sorry he is no longer sharing planet earth with us. As with all of his publications, Contact was well written, entertaining & educational. However, it left me wondering if Sagan truly was an agnostic. (or atheist?)I hate to admit (& regret the fact) that the religious characters in the book do indeed reflect some Christian's attitudes and beliefs. There are times we (Christians) can do more harm than good with our closed minds and adamant viewpoints. A few, loud bad apples ...Ellie is the director of ""Project Argus,"" (in which scores of radio telescopes in New Mexico are used to intensely search for extra-terrestrial intelligence (SETI). Her character, near the beginning of the story, states the agnostic viewpoint that ""there isn't compelling evidence that God exists... and there isn't compelling evidence that he doesn't.""Later, after she has indeed not only contacted, but inter-acted with what she ""knows"" to be other-world intelligent entities (extra-terrestrials) but no one believes her, she is again faced with the conundrum of knowing something through personal experience without having documented, scientific proof (faith.) The protagonist's frustration spoke to my spirit and my own staunch belief in God: I ""know"" for a certainty by personal experience but can't prove it by using Sagan's novel computing digits of π (pi) or any other scientifically accepted method."
58,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4706205-cheri,4,"This book surprised me in its power. I actively disliked this novel about halfway through, when it felt like the religious perspective was being unfairly broiled by Ellie. I consider this part of the novel unartful, clumsy, even ham-fisted. Yet: the novel redeems it self. Solidly. This is about aliens and first contact, yes. But really, it's about the nature of faith, of proof, of the mystery of the spirit within math and science. That is a thing of beauty. I came to the end of the book while in Starbucks, nursing a lunch latte, and fought the urge to weep in public. I felt tender for the rest of the day.Sometimes, a story transcends its parts and reminds me of why I read. This is a book worth reading, flaws notwithstanding. "
59,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51089-jamie,3,"1. Sagan wrote the review for me. On page 18: “The book was better than the movie. For one thing, there was a lot more to it.” He’s talking about Pinocchio, and Ellie reading it as a girl, but it applies to his book too. Layers.2. Carl Sagan, astrophysicist, is better than Carl Sagan, novelist. Some of the characters, pacing, plot, etc. just falls flat. But at the science and imagination of it, he shines.3. Once they hit the wormholes, it’s the best part of the book. I hate that that part is so short.4. I think each review here says some version of this, but: the ending of Contact, the novel, is so much better than Contact, the movie.5. “You mustn’t think of the universe as a wilderness. It hasn’t been that for billions of years.”"
60,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4053034-laura,5,"Like many my age, Carl Sagan played a significant role in encouraging me to become a scientist and in particular, an astronomer. This book was transformative for me as a young teen: Ellie is such a strong, self-confident and human heroine. After reading this book, she was my role model, and it didn't mater that I knew she was fictional. If Carl wrote it, there must be female scientists out there just like her and one day I could be one too."
61,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3590983-andrewp,3,Slightly different from the film of the same name and I cannot decide which one I prefer. There were parts I preferred in both and other parts I did not like so much. If the two are taken together then this would be a 4 star book.It's probably the best example of alien contact where that contact is initiated by a signal from space and detected by SETI. Given Sagen's former relationship to that organization this is hardly surprising.

I knew it was not a pure science fiction book, but really there are too many infiltrations and in the end the book is very slow and boring. In addition to the main story, i.e. the message received from an extraterrestrial civilization, there are long references to how discriminated women are in science, how much religion intersects with science and all those false prophets who, even if clearly fanatics, however, they have a very large followers among the less intelligent groups of humans. A lot, too much, philosophy, so that in the end what remains is the feeling that the main plot is only a pretext for the author to talk to us about his vision of Life and Humanity. That was not what I was looking for when I started reading this book. The book is from 1985, so now 35 years old, but the story itself could be beautiful: there is Eleanor Arroway, called Ellie, who is the director of the Argus Project, within which the signals from space, received by U.S.A. radio telescopes in New Mexico, are intensively analyzed to search for extraterrestrial intelligence, in connection with the SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) project.After some time, which in the book is used to talk to us about Ellie's childhood and the effort she makes to make her way, as a woman, in the male chauvinist world of male scientists, the project actually discovers a communication signal that seems really sent by extraterrestrial beings. It is a repetitive series of prime numbers up to 261: the amazement is great, but becomes even more so when the analysis of the message reveals that it contains two additional messages encoded within it, through two signal modulations. The first sub-message is a kind of instruction manual for decoding other signals while the second of the sub-messages contains nothing less than the project for a mysterious machine.As I said at the beginning, there are parallel stories, and at this point the first one enters, that of Ellie debating with a couple of Christian preachers on the existence of God, to arrive, through the scientific method, at the conclusion that there is no irrefutable proof that God exists, just as there is no irrefutable proof that God does not exist. Come on….In the continuation of the plot the mysterious machine is finally built and Ellie with 4 other scientists leaves with it. On a journey through black holes and worm holes in the universe, they reach the center of the Milky Way, where they come into contact with the extraterrestrials and where they find solutions to many of their questions as scientists, recording all their experience. They resume the long journey back to Earth and when they arrive they discover that, in total, they have been out of the Earth for only twenty minutes. When they want to show others the recording of their journey they discover that it has been canceled, almost certainly because of a programming of the machine they have traveled on and therefore they are without any proof of their story, which for a scientist is the maximum defeat.I repeat: the story is beautiful, but it could be told in half the pages, cutting it off from everything that has nothing to do with a science fiction book. Perhaps, if I had started this book in search of a philosophy book, I would have found that it contains too much science fiction: personally I think this is the limit of this book: that it is neither meat nor fish."
65,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11874992-rex-fuller,4,"Carl Sagan was on TV a lot. Johnny Carson. PBS. Never liked him. Thought he was condescending and the very definition of “self-aware.” So, eventually, I paid no attention to him and never realized he had written a novel. The movie from it of the same name didn’t keep me awake. Plus, I don’t generally read science fiction. But, briefly finding nothing else I really wanted to read, I tried a sample of “Contact” on Kindle. Surprise!Sagan clearly and engagingly presents numerous highly technical scientific fields in telling “what if we hear signals from somebody out there.” He takes us through the process of grasping the contents of the signal, following its instructions, and surviving. And he does it so the whole process, including the world-wide reaction, seems entirely credible.Hats off. Well worth a read."
66,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2945070-thom,5,"First written as a screenplay in 1979, it was later brought to the screen in 1997. The action reads like a film, the science and history is wonderful popular science. The relationships and faith are the real impact here, one I didn't get from seeing the film first.In very brief summary, this is a very personal story of Eleanor ""Ellie"" Arroway, who today would be a poster child for STEM. Her science leads her and the world to the discovery of alien contact and beyond, but her relationships with scientists and others remains the focus. In a very strong way, this novel is as much about her contact with humanity as with aliens.This is Sagan's only fiction, which is a shame - the world needs more science in fiction (and outside of it also). I wish I'd read this in college. 4½ stars."
67,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98940026-shychemist,4,"After seeing the movie Contact I've wanted to read the original source material for the longest time. This summer I finally got around to it.Very similar to the movie but there's a lot of scientific thought experiments, discussions on religion and world politics which are barely reflected in the movie. So it was refreshing to dive into these topics more.It was very good. Very thought provoking and only feels a bit aged reading it in 2019. My only issue is I find the pacing for much of the book to be a bit slow and that detracts from the excellent discussions in the book, but that aside its a great Sci-fi read."
68,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79033563-jake-fucci,5,"Carl Sagan gives here one of the most plausible and interesting depictions of extraterrestrial presence. i really liked the depth of this book, exploring not only the ""aliens"" themselves, but our own reaction to life out of our Earth on every level from scientific to religious and political to social. the science of this book is hard and solid, but beyond that are some truly great characters and stories. Dr. Arroway's struggles with her relationships because of her passion for the Message gives an ironic look at human interaction. Hadden was a particularly cool character, the billionaire ""philanthropist"" who craves immortality. this book reminded me of why i love science and space and made me hunger for more education and speculation. looking forward to Sagan's other works too!"

Unrelenting in scope, it is a story fully realized. A tremendous feat. I wanted it to never end. I enjoyed its clever arguments revolving around science and religion. The pros and cons of both. They were realistic and compelling human portrayals. There were maddening moments in this story, but I enjoyed them most of all because they, more than anything, spoke of what it is to be human. To be afraid, jealous, scared, greedy and so on. This story was just superb. "

72,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2644896-mike-moore,2,"A long and thoughtful consideration on a subject that the author knows nearly nothing about and has very little interest in. I can imagine the conversation that must have planted the seed for this book: some religious adherent trying to explain to a heroically tolerant Carl Sagan how their belief is not rooted in ignorance, but in a functional representation of all aspects of the human condition (not exclusive of science). Perhaps C.S. Lewis was quoted. Someone must have said something like ""suppose, for instance, you had an experience that couldn't be independently verified..."" Anyway, Mr. Sagan must have been deeply inspired because he went and wrote this book to explore the idea of such an experience. It's a well written book, and despite Sagan's many indulgences and the static nature of his characters (the closest he gets to an arc is having one character say to another ""I think you have changed""), it's very readable. However, Sagan doesn't really understand religion and he doesn't really care to. He tries to be evenhanded, but his take is still a shallow caricature of the dynamic between religious and secular thought.For Sagan, it's clear cut. There are believers and there are skeptics. The skeptics are intellectually and morally superior to the believers in every way, but they might still be wrong (the last part is Sagan being even-handed). What Sagan doesn't grasp is that he is not himself a skeptic, nor does his book at any point present a skeptical viewpoint. This book is a passionate apology, not for atheism, but for SETI. A recurring statement, accepted by everyone in the book as an unassailable truth, is ""There can be nothing of greater importance than finding that we're not alone"". When the time comes to choose five people to go an meet the aliens, the world leaders decide that a bunch of physics weenies are the best possible representatives of the human race. The characters are constantly making wildly unscientific and frankly goofy assumptions about aliens, alien technology, alien motivations, etc. None of this is in any way indicative of a skeptical outlook. Of course, no one can be skeptical about everything. If you're going to accept Hume as the great spokesman of skepticism (which I do), than it is something of a dead end, which cannot be pursued to anything close to its limit without devolving to absurdity. I suppose that Sagan might say that being skeptical about God is a good measure of skepticism, neither too much nor too little. A golden mean of skepticism. This might be a fair point, but it's not what the book is about. In fact, the book takes things in more or less the completely opposite direction, suggesting that it's only really possible to be skeptical or a believer about creation, placing everything else outside of consideration. If this criticism seems abstract or meandering, it's because the book says almost nothing about actual religious thought, or the nature of skepticism. To castigate the one and laud the other without delving at all into their nature will be unsatisfying to anyone who has any interest in religion as part of the human experience. Sadly, neglect of theology seems to be considered the golden mean of intellectual laziness. "
73,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/132592-matthew,3,"(pre) discussions on science and religion with an atheist friend in the US led her to give me her battered copy of this. anticipating a good read and will start on it asap.(post) I quite liked Contact, though it was, especially toward the end, very different from what I expected. I thought Carl Sagan might come down more on the side of science, and at the start, when introducing Ellie the astronomer vs Pastor Rankin the crazy narrow minded evangelist, he was, but toward the end I wasn't really very sure what he thought. I mean, its pretty clear he's an awesome physicist and is probably on the side of science in the science vs religion debate - Ellie seems to be the vehicle for his personal point of view - but I'm not quite sure he thought that religion was all that baseless. Ellie after all has a quasi religious experience, as she herself points out, and is put in a situation where she and a small group have an experience that is (nearly) empirically unprovable and the 'explanation' is that it was all a huge hoax. And while the Pastor Rankin character is obviously a strike against irrational and narrow minded Christians, the Palmer Joss character is a lot more enigmatic, and less easily dismissed.Otherwise, though, I'm a lot cooler on Contact than many reviews on GoodReads are. Sagan's a good writer, but he's not a novelist. The language is complex but straightforward rather than lyrical, the plot is well-thought and the characters interesting but appear (to me) a little too transparently as vehicles for ideas.Still, it is interesting to see things as agnostic scientist Ellie sees them. It appears to me what Sagan's trying to get at is that you can't give up rationally trying to account for all the evidence there is, and that if your theory can't account for everything, or there are competing theories that can both account for everything, or certain evidence that no theory can at present account for, then you have to remain agnostic, open to changing your conclusions.Also managed to get through Ernst Mayr's This is Biology... essentially a glance at the various fields of biology and how they evolved (pun not intended!). Mayr's is the book I expected Sagan's to be - an account of science that categorically denies the possibility of creation, by making various statements about the widespread acceptance of the fossil record, the age of the earth, gradual continuous evolution of one species into another, etc. He doesn't really present the evidence itself though. "
74,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/235151-richard,3,"If there are intelligent beings elsewhere in the universe, why haven't we received a message from them yet? and what would happen if we actually did? Near the end of Contact we learn Carl Sagan's speculative but quite plausible answer to the first question. The bulk of the book concerns his answers to the second question, which are unfortunately far less satisfying.Contact suffers from an excess of exposition and from generally weak character development. (Isaac Asimov could make this work but few others can.) The only memorable character in the novel is its heroine Ellie Arroway, and even she never comes alive; we're told about her emotional revelations and turning points, but I never felt moved by them. There are no bad guys worth speaking of, and little in the way of suspense and surprise, at least on a human level. The story goes on for too long after its climax; at least one or two post-climax elements could easily have been moved to an earlier point in the story to greater effect. To be fair, the book is outstanding in two respects: its attention to scientific accuracy and technical detail; and the fairness with which Sagan, an atheist, portrays his religious characters. None of them is a caricature or cartoon and some are intelligent and articulate in expressing beliefs that were not the author's own.Written in the early to mid 80s, the book makes a number of false predictions about its period, the late 90s, which serve as distracting reminders that we're inside a fictional world. The Soviet Union is still intact; America has elected its first woman president; the Millennium is approaching but no one's talking about the Y2K problem; recording media are all magnetic but photography's gone holographic, and so on.It bears mentioning that the movie version of Contact is in a sense a mirror image of the novel. While the novel follows a bland path to a thought-provoking conclusion, the movie follows a more dramatic path (in many ways improved over that of the book) to a neutered conclusion that apparently assumes that the audience is too dumb to understand the explanation that is, in fact, one of the central points of the book. Similarly, the movie's version of S.R. Hadden was in most respects far more intriguing than the novel's, but the film completely dispensed with the last -- and most interesting part -- of his story."

They seemed to demonstrate that the heavens were created for the benefit and instruction of humans.”Dr. Eleanor Arroway is the Director of Argus in New Mexico, working for SETI and wondering why the extraterrestrials have not contacted us. Is it because conveying a message to us would be like teaching alphabet to the ants - they lose precious time and effort, and we learn nothing? When, finally, a palimpsestic message in the form of prime numbers and polarized light is received from a young star system called Vega with apparently no fully formed planets, let alone intelligent life forms, humankind is in a collective mental conflict. The questions raised by this message from the stars is not only scientific but theological. As Ellie explores her way through the scientific intricacies and has a heated argument with Palmer Joss and Billy Jo Rankin regarding the theological implications, Hadden has other concerns and so does Michael Kitz who doesn’t want countries other than USA to be a part of the project.“Zealotry, fanaticism, fear, hope, fervent debate, quiet prayer, agonizing reappraisal, exemplary selflessness, closed-minded bigotry, and a zest for dramatically new ideas were epidemic, rushing feverishly over the tiny planet Earth. Meanwhile, the Message itself continued to resist attempts at decryption.”Contact is not just about contact with extraterrestrials, but also with ourselves and the tangible people in our lives whom we choose to ignore or just plain forget for selfish reasons. Contact is about how a message from another world forces cooperation among countries setting aside the political boundaries for at least the time being. Contact stresses on the skeptical nature of humans whether it be scientists skeptical about spirituality or vice versa. Carl Sagan has done a brilliant job of writing a science fiction novel while stressing on all the faults that we humans have without it affecting the genre or pace of the novel.Opening with a very patient eons old polyhedral world and ending with the mysteries of pi, Contact never ceases to amaze."

It's really inspiring. This book is very simple to read, with clear language and an understandable explanation of most scientific phenomena, yet probes deep into both theological and psychological depths like few tales can. The result is something both enjoyable and inspiring. In Contact, Sagan's ability to capture the beauty and imagination of scientific research through the eyes of Ellie, an intelligent, capable young woman. Ellie discovers extraterrestrial life, and most of the novel is equally balanced between the scientific and technological impact of this discovery. Sagan introduces a hodgepodge of other characters in her life, from the curios Vaygay to the utterly frustrating (read: I hate this man) Mike Kitz. It's a story of people from all different races and backgrounds- soviet (oh, the cold war), Indian, Chinese, Muslim, Christian, etc- working together to achieve a common goal. It's a story of what the human race could achieve if we left behind our intolerance and instead worked for the future. While Ellie is self-aware in a way that too few people are, she lends a perfect voice to the narrative, which tells us about the importance of tolerance, peace, and love.I think what I'm saying here guys is that Carl Sagan was a brony."

Matthew McConaughey can suck it.So Carl Sagan, who worked on the SETI program for several years, basically works through the ""what if"" scenario in which extraterrestrials communicate a message to our planet. The idea seems simple enough, but Sagan explores in detail the political, scientific and spiritual ramifications of such a monumental event ever taking place. Some on Earth seek further understanding of the message and its instructions while others claim it is the voice of the Devil himself. The protagonist, astronomer Ellie Arroway, is a strong, curious, superbly intelligent woman who has set aside emotional ties to friends and family in favor of understanding the universe. She is a nuanced character who feels the pain of her decision long after she even knew she made it.Sagan's style is clean, gorgeous, and says just what it needs to say without embellishment, without tricks, and without showing off. He is not interested in writing for writers, which I think is what I find so refreshing about his prose. This is the only piece of fiction I have read by Sagan, and his awe and humility about the universe and our place in it transition seamlessly into narrative form. As he says so perfectly: ""For small creatures such as we the vastness is only bearable through love."""

This novel was a very pleasant surprise. I was prepared to read an old sci-fi novel about aliens, but it turned out to be so much more than that. I had watched the movie in the 90s and while I found it had interesting ideas, I thought it was boring as hell :) The movie didn’t do the novel justice (I’m not surprised).As someone who doesn’t like to see religion/spirituality mixed with science fiction, I was getting a little worried when the novel started with a discussion about religion, but then it blew me away. There’s a religion vs science discussion that I think it is one of the best parts of the novel.The story isn’t rushed, the author takes his time with the story, which at times felt like he was taking a little too much time with it, but fortunately when that happened it almost immediately picked up. This is a hard sci fi novel, so the science was spot on. The characters felt real. Ellie, the main character is a great character, she’s not perfect, she’s not flawed, she’s just a regular person like the rest of us.I’m sure I will be revisiting this book eventually, I really enjoyed it, and it’s now one of my favorites."
79,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20111493-josh,2,"Aggressively boring. Carl Sagan should not write fiction. The concepts introduced are interesting, but chapter-long lectures belong in nonfiction. Sagan has no sense of pacing, tension, or character development. The main character -- if you could call her that -- is forgotten for long sequences at a time, and the book hops from one summary of events to another in bland, dry prose reminiscent of a university textbook. Years pass in a matter of sentences; characters are introduced in one paragraph as a means of conveying information only to never appear again; the main villain is introduced in the final few chapters; several chapters should have never been allowed to remain in the final edit; and Sagan tells rather than shows.The final chapters are genuinely riveting, but we're required to slog through meaningless details of irrelevant data for so long that it's hard to care what becomes of, well, anybody. This is unforgivable.It's hard to understand why this book has become so popular, much less why it was put into print in the first place. But it's a big hit, so I must be missing something."

Kindly impose thy wisdom on thy brilliant writers who write amazing books but yet spoileth them with second rate endings. Contact starts off great. An extremely likable central character, making her way against the odds despite personal tragedies and professional barriers. After reaching the main theme however, we see repeated digressions and way in depth analysis of non-relevant plots and incidents. And the book, which stands logically until the closing pages, falls spectacularly apart at the end (SPOILER ALERT.)How does the signal stop the moment they board (it SHOULD beam for another 26 years at the least? Why does the government act that way, rescinding all support (especially the President)? Why the hostility, all of a sudden? Why no meetings of the Machine Council were convened to discuss the events (or atleast the perspectives of the five)? Even the actions of Hadden seem abrupt. How could he of all people NOT be curious about what happened with the machine? I hate to say it, but I believe the movie does a better job of the ending than the book. 3.5/5. "
81,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2169723-jayme,4,"This has been one of my favourite movies for ages now and it's about time I got around to reading it. I think the reason I love it so much is that it seems like such a plausible alien contact story. Like something that really could happen tomorrow. And that makes you think about what might be out there. On a day to day basis it seems stupid and silly to think about aliens, but once in a while something like this comes along and you think, ""Oh yeah, that could totally happen!"".However, this isn't a science fiction book to read if you like action. It is definitely a book to read if you like long pages of exposition on how the world and the universe works and what it might be like if aliens ever made contact with us."
82,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90067195-aarav-balsu,5,"I wish I'd read this earlier. It's a book that strengthened my belief in our shared humanity, made me appreciate the universality of mathematics and physics, and wonder at the infinite scale of the cosmos as well as our infinitesimal existence in the backwaters of the Milky Way. It helps that I finished reading it just as dusk was settling down over the Grand Canyon (I was visiting on a trip with my parents) and the stars were coming out.  When I was debating between applying to study at schools, it was a coin toss between astrophysics and aerospace engineering; the latter won out because I thought it'd be more practical, but if I'd read this book in high school, I would've picked the former."

Thank you Carl Sagan i will see you in Vega at some point of the space time."
88,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3217989-jared-della-rocca,5,"I've never seen the movie version of Contact, so I'm not sure how much of the book tracks with the movie. Which is to say that if you didn't like the movie, don't prejudge the book as I'm guessing that they've dropped a lot of the deeper dialogue that made Contact fantastic. I think the most analogous book I've read would be Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut, although Carl Sagan doesn't ascribe to the satire that Vonnegut excels in. Rather the book well traverses the intersection between Science and Religion, particularly in the grandness of the universe. Halloway's excursions to meet with the religious leaders Billy Jo Raskin and Palmer Joss, and then her individual conversations with Joss and Hadden really allow Sagan to transform the novel out of the bounds of ""science fiction"" and make the whole greater than its parts.Frequently when I read books I'm looking for plot development, and Contact certainly had some of that, even being listed as a Top 100 Thrillers for the ending. But while the ending was satisfying, I again have to identify the various conversations that Halloway has with the other luminaries as the highlights of the book. I think those could be separately clipped and, without any knowledge of the broader book, be studied as entities unto themselves as guideposts for the continued clash between science and religion.A really excellent work and well worth the time."
89,2266079999,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16330401-crypto-punk,4,"As cynical as I tend to be in day to day life, I have to admit that Sagan's visions of the future have always instilled some form of hope within me for humanity. His non fiction works show more than a few glimpses of this man's visions and ideas and I picked up his only work of fiction, expecting a deep dive into these ideas. Contact in that regard, absolutely delivered.Sagan's advocacy for science, crusades against superstitions, attempts to explore the confluence of science and religion, all find a prominent place in this book. It is a type of fiction that was written as a vehicle for the author to explore all his ideas in a near future setting and probe into the potential ramifications of finding intelligent life in the cosmos. The characters, plot and narrative work together to propogate these ideas in the form of a coherent story, expanding on the glimpses seen in his non fiction works. Such a book, also tends to have its drawbacks. For starters, I didnt care all that much about the characters. Even though the author goes into the details of their back stories, I found myself uninterested in them as people. While this may be a deal breaker in a conventional character driven fiction book, it wasn't that big of a problem here. Because the exploration of the aforementioned ideas transcends these characters and whatever character development issues were present seemed negligible. "
