0,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53165-warwick,4,"My mind finds it so hard to deal with the colossal timescales involved in palaeontology – even more so in the case of books like this, where the story being pieced together on this Brobdingnagian canvas is so crucial and so awe-inspiring. You're considering vast, Cthulhu-like stretches of time in which human societies grew up, discovered modernity in the form of complex tools and ritualised behaviour, held out for a while against the environment, and then disappeared. One after another, flashes of human civilisation blinking in and out of existence in the archaeological record.Seventy-two thousand years ago, at what's now Still Bay in South Africa, there was a human society that lasted for hundreds of centuries before vanishing; five millennia later, not far away at Howieson's Poort, a different and apparently unrelated civilisation thrived for a while before also being abruptly cut off. These people used compound tools and painted themselves with red ochre, buried their dead and wore jewelry made of tick shells; they must have had their own detailed rituals and legends and mythologies and social conventions that we can never now recover. In many cases they were succeeded by communities of much less advanced humans that did not understand their technology.All of this is an excellent illustration of the crucial point that evolution is not teleology, that ‘progress’ is not necessarily selected for, and that civilisational modernity has come about through random fits and starts and not through some kind of natural incrementation. The fortuitous anomaly of the last two-to-three thousand years has made it hard to appreciate this basic fact, which often strikes you when reading history but which is even more forceful and awe-inspiring when it comes to prehistory and palaeontology.Nowhere more so than in the case of ‘archaic humans’, i.e. other members of the Homo genus of which we are the last surviving species. Homo erectus, for instance, had already spread out from Africa to cover most of Europe and Asia, and it was once thought that erectus simply evolved into modern humans wherever it existed, so that different bands of humans suddenly popped into existence 100,000 years ago all around the Old World. This ‘multiregionalist’ hypothesis has now been largely replaced by a narrative whereby Homo sapiens evolved once, somewhere in eastern or southern Africa, and – after tens of thousands of years – finally expanded to colonise Eurasia and the rest of the world, in the process replacing whatever archaic hominins happened still to be in the area when they arrived.In Europe, that meant Neanderthals. If you have any imagination at all, it's impossible not to feel a rush of excitement at the idea of early humans suddenly encountering groups of these manlike people – a bit like how Portuguese sailors must have felt when they found strange men living in the Americas, only much, much more so: instead of a separation time of 30,000 years or so, this was on the order of 140,000 years. Neanderthals died out pretty much as modern humans arrived in Europe, suggesting that neanderthalis was out-competed for resources or even perhaps the victim of inter-species violence. Then again – still thinking of the New World comparison – perhaps new diseases had something to do with it. (I wish more serious novelists would address themselves to this story. The only good example I know of is William Golding's The Inheritors.)In any case, there was of course sex as well as violence involved. The idea that humans were boffing Neanderthals, at least occasionally, has been dramatically supported by genetic analysis: it transpires that if you're (genetically) European then around two percent of your DNA is inherited from them. Beyond Europe, it wasn't generally thought that there were any hominids left by the time that modern humans arrived – but this assumption has recently collapsed in a rather exciting way, thanks to new fossil discoveries as well as DNA studies. The most dramatic example is the so-called ‘hobbit’, Homo floresiensis, discovered on an Indonesian island, which seems to represent a descendant of Homo erectus that somehow survived on Flores until as recently as 12,000 years ago – in other words tens of millennia after modern humans were in the region. (Update – it's now established that floresiensis did not evolve from Homo erectus but in fact emerged much earlier – perhaps from Homo habilis some two million years ago.) Moreover, the latest genetic evidence suggests that humans interbred with non-sapiens species even before leaving Africa.So the ‘Out of Africa’ narrative is complicated a bit by increasing evidence of hybridisation and other complexities. Chris Stringer has been a key player in all this since the 70s, and he tells the story well, though the wealth of material tempts him to drift away from the point on occasion. He brings in a lot of very interesting cultural discussions about religion, language and other kinds of behavioural modernity. The writing style is confident and jovial, like listening to a kindly schoolteacher – he even attempts a few jokes (typically signalled by some hearty exclamation marks), which don't usually come off but you appreciate the effort.For me this book was the primer in recent developments that I've been looking for – even if the answer to a lot of basic questions is still a cautious ‘we're not yet sure’. Chris Stringer is too conscientious a scientist to gloss over this basic uncertainty, and if you're looking for black-and-white answers rather than the tangle of scientific exploration then this book may frustrate you. Otherwise it should prove a fascinating and mind-expanding read."

Unfortunately for Darwin, the first major unearthing of an archaic human fossil (in this case, Homo erectus) didn’t occur until 1891, nine years after Darwin’s death. The discovery most certainly would have delighted him, but it could hardly have come as any big surprise. In the last 130+ years anthropologists, paleontologists, and sundry other enthusiasts have amassed a literal mountain of evidence supporting Darwin’s insightful hypothesis. Dr. Chris Stringer gives a detailed overview of some of history’s most striking anthropological discoveries, starting with Eugène Dubois and his “Pithecanthropus erectus,” and aptly orders those discoveries into a semblance of logical progression and flow. Stringer’s presentation is, for the most part, methodical and academic, and I would be hesitant to recommend Lone Survivors to anyone with only a passing interest in human evolution. But, if your heroes and heroines have names like Leakey and Goodall and Wallace, and if your heartbeat quickens at the utterance of words like heidelbergensis and mitochondrial, then this is definitely your book.*I would be remiss if I failed to note Stringer’s inclusion of my favorite WSU professor in his take on the prominence and utility of Neanderthal brow ridges:“The eccentric anthropologist Grover Krantz even strapped on a replica brow ridge from a Homo erectus skull for six months to investigate its possible benefits, finding that it shaded his eyes from the sun, kept his long hair from his eyes when he was running, and also scared people out of their wits on dark nights.”"
2,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2482609-captain-sir-roddy-r-n-ret,5,"Chris Stringer's Lone Survivors: How We Came to be the Only Humans on Earth comes along some seventeen years after his ground-breaking book African Exodus: The Origins of Modern Humanity (Henry Holt, 1996). Stringer is one of the principal architects and proponents of the ""Out-of-Africa"" (OOA) hypothesis associated with the origin and dispersal of anatomically modern humans, i.e., Homo sapiens. According to Stringer and the OOA hypothesis, anatomically modern humans evolved in Africa nearly 200,000 years ago, and then 'something' happened about 50,000 years ago that resulted in essentially the relatively rapid spread of our species into much of Eurasia, eastern Asia, Indonesia and Australia, and into western Europe over a period of about 10,000 years! What is even more remarkable is that it now appears that there were other populations of archaic Homo species that we coexisted and/or competed with for a time, likely including Homo erectus, Homo neanderthalensis, and the newly discovered little people of Flores, Homo floresiensis. In just under 280 pages, Chris Stringer takes the reader through the history of our human origins with the fossil evidence. He synthesizes the latest advances in knowledge associated with paleoclimatology, geochronological dating methods, and geology and plate tectonics. Most importantly, Stringer spends much of the book talking about the evolution of human behavior (e.g., developing and utilizing technology, use of symbolism, developing survival and coping strategies, burial of dead, etc.). The evolutionary steps leading to Homo sapiens wasn't a given. It was really a very near run thing, and without the ability to rapidly adapt and respond to changing climate conditions and subsequent changed ecological conditions modern humans could quite likely have become extinct just as our close cousins, the Neanderthals, did about 30,000 years ago. For example, the massive supervolcanic eruption of Toba on the island of Java was very nearly a game-changer for all human species about 73,000 years ago. Finally, over the past decade or so, much of the OOA hypothesis has been validated and bolstered with the results of numerous studies and analyses of mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome DNA. In other words, we really and truly are all African. While all of this discussion of fossils, paleoconditions, and genetics may sound a bit daunting, complicated, or even off-putting, Dr. Stringer does a sterling job of leading the reader--whether layperson or specialist--through the data and evidence with his well-written and entertaining prose. I've kind of come to realize that Stringer and his peers--paleoanthropologists--are really much akin to detectives hot on the trail to better understand when we became who we are, and how we became who we are, and perhaps even be able to answer why. This book will definitely help you get your arms (and brain) around the critical issues and questions associated with what makes us humanIn closing, it is my opinion that Chris Stringer's incredibly thought-provoking Chapter 8 of the book, ""Making A Modern Human"" ought to be required reading by all of us. I don't know that I have underlined more passages or made more marginalia notes in a book since I left college in the mid-1980s. Reading this book, and Chapter 8 in particular, has stimulated a desire in me to chase down a lot of the technical references and journal articles that Dr. Stringer has provided in the book's extensive bibliography. This is a subject that profoundly fascinates me, and I am committed to educate myself and better understand my human origins, and have nothing but admiration and gratitude to Chris Stringer for inspiring me toward this end. All I can say is read Lone Survivors, it really is one of the most comprehensive overviews of the current state-of-knowledge associated with our human origins that I've read."
3,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"I’m a little baffled by those who say that this book is for the scientific community, because it so blatantly isn’t — it explains how DNA and various methods of dating work, for example, which definitely wouldn’t be required by someone with even baseline knowledge in the scientific community. (Including me. There was no single technique this book covered which I didn’t comprehend, and only one or two I wasn’t aware of specifically.) I think it can be a little bit dry — especially when it explains things like DNA being in a helix or mtDNA being transmitted only through the female line… And the structure could definitely use some help. While I can see that he’s trying to interrelate his chapters by saying “see chapter x”, it means that sometimes the significance of something isn’t as apparent as he thinks.Overall, though, I found it pretty readable and unexceptionable: Stringer freely admits that he’s been wrong at times about the course of human development, and that we don’t have all the answers now. He’s respectful of ideas he disagrees with, and covers some of them well, including the evidence which does point in that direction. I’m surprised by how little evidence of hybridisation he sees; I thought hybridisation with Neanderthals and Denisovans was more of a foregone conclusion than it appears from Stringer’s analysis.It’s slightly more up to date than the Homo Britannicus book by the same author, too. Of course, it covers worldwide human history in general, so it’s less limited, but it also includes stuff I missed in reading that book, like some discussions of the Denisovan caves and the remains discovered there.All in all, a reasonably good read, though naturally in general drift it supports the author’s hypothesis of a Recent African Origin for H. sapiens.Originally posted here."
4,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1036274-rmn,1,"Poorly organized, dry, and not as easy as it should be to piece together.....and that was just the fossils (rim shot please).The book tries to lay out current theories of early man and neanderthal man which should be fascinating material yet I found it painful trying to slog through it. The timelines of prehistoric man were not well structured and the book needed to be more streamlined (perhaps a neanderthal served as the editor). Often the author would start describing a fossil, stop, and then write ""but I'll get to that in later chapter."" Umm, if you are going to mention it now and if it is relevant to what you are discussing because you are mentioning it now, then just go ahead and dive in to it, don't wait for several chapters later on when the relevance may not be as meaningful. The book just seems to zig when it should be zagging.So feel free to save yourself the tedium of reading this and just know that the key takeaway is that current theories of early man and neanderthal man are largely predicated on guess work (as they have to be) and most importantly are still evolving (pun intended). So check back in a few years to read the latest iteration and hope it is better structured and better written than this book."
5,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1419068-elaine,5,"Without polemics, Chris Stringer shows how humans evolved. For those who believe evolution is bunk--although he doesn't mention them ever--he shows how one species, over millions or thousands of years becomes another. There are no missing links. What happens--and is happening-- is that when a fetus is created, it may have mutations in one of its genes. If that mutation allows it to cope with living conditions better than those who don't have it, that gene will be passed onto its offspring, gradually spreading through the species. As the years go on, and mutiple mutations have occurred, the species changes so much, it becomes a new species. Think of how different a Shi Tzu is from a wolf. Dog breeding is accelerated evolution. The same thing happened to homo erectus, who gradually turned into homo heidelbergensis, Neanderthals and homo sapiens. Homo sapiens wasn't the end game, either. Our brains have shrunk 20% since early homo sapiens. However, for centuries, man made culture has lessened the effect of mutations, favorable or not.Amidst all the theories being promulgated about the origins of humanity, this book is a relief. Stringer doesn't just cite those findings which support his theory, but presents those that don't. Moreover, he treats them respectfully, not tearing them down with glee. He'll politely say, ""I think the data can be analyzed differently."" Other times he says more evidence is needed for a definitive conclusion. You aren't presented with just his research, but with what's being done and said by just about everyone doing paleoanthropology today.Interestingly, Stringer negates his own early belief in the idea that all humans spread out of Africa. He now believes that homo erectus and his descendents migrated out of Africa at different times, taking with them traits that had developed at that time. Most fascinating and convincing, is his use of DNA analyses to show, for instance, which hominids went to China. to The Middle East and Europe.Stringer also discusses the importance of ritual to the evolution of early humans, as well as the jewelry they made and the pigments they decorated themselves with. The Neanderthals, who got to Europe earlier than other hominids, used black pigments as they were fair skinned and often red-haired. Their DNA tells us this. However, up to 11,000 years ago, hominids, including homo sapiens were dark skinned, so they used bright red pigments for self decoration. Again, DNA tells us that mutations for blue eyes and fair skin are recent, and occured in Europe.Stringer also has convinced me we have DNA in us from Neanderthals and homo heidelbergensis. All in all a fascinating book"
6,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5558652-emma-sea,3,"I hoped from the title of the book this might be more about how H. sapiens came to outcompete other subspecies like H. neanderthalensis but 95% of the book is an argument for the Recent African Origin using the fossil record, and recent developments in DNA and mtDNA analysis, to disprove the multiregional theory. This was good stuff, but not what I was expecting. Stringer's writing is dry and without the details that make science reading gripping. For example, on page 255 Stringer finally gives an anecdote about the discovery of the Broken Hill skull, and also how Stringer felt seeing it as a child. This is the first time in the book Stringer emotionally connected with me.I didn't appreciate Stringer's framing of prehistoric gender: ""One possibility is that subsequent bands of men violently replaced the original males and then mated with their females . . . or new men holding a reproductive advantage over the original males - perhaps the development of a . . . powerful new religion with male shamans, who gained privileged sexual access to the women."" (pp. 263-264)It's a very retrogressive framing that presents women as passive recipients of cultural change, and men as the ones doing the changing. 4 for the content, 2 for the delivery."
7,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3321431-kadri,5,"This was great. I liked the writing style and how detailed all the descriptions were from the methods used for dating fossils to what we can piece together from the remains of our ancient ancestors and other human relatives. There were of-course things I knew or had read about before, but those served as good foundation so that not everything was disconnected.Probably my favorite concepts I read about in this book were the cooperative eye hypothesis, which is fascinating, and Dunbar's number.I feel like now I have a slightly better grasp of the timeline of human evolution."
8,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7701175-alison,5,"I want to be a palaeoanthropologist.Or at least, I did for a good half-hour after finishing this book, before I remembered that I have trouble identifying differences between bones in diagrams, even with little pointing arrows added, so my chances of being useful with the real thing are pretty thin. But Chris Stringer's book was just so good, it left me wanting to plunge further into this world of evidence and ambiguity, of scientific collaboration and debate, of furthering our understanding about how we came to be.I have a confession to make - when deciding which books to read, I always read the negative reviews first. When non-fiction books (or historical fiction ones) are described as being ""dry"" or ""too detailed"", I'm in. This book, which is certainly full of caveats, alternate explanations, and cross-referencing is a good example of why.The earlier chapters can be hard going, as Stringer lays the basis of what we know (not much); what what scientists agree on what can be extrapolated (a fair bit more); and what various theories are contesting the rest of the vast space of the unknown. As the books warms up in the later chapters however, Stringer pulls this together into a discussion about what various conclusions could be drawn, and what those are that he has. He puts across his own theories without ignoring others, and empowers the reader to understand various scenarios. It brings the reader into science, not just into a cheer squad for a particular theorist.One of my pet hates is people (and I've been one) who read a single popular science book and then wander around citing what are in fact highly contested specific conclusions as if this is proven fact.(Please note, I am not talking about very broad scientific consensus conclusions such as ""the world's climate is changing due to human activity"" or ""species evolve via natural selection into other species"" here, obviously, more like ""the velicoraptor had feathers"" or ""Neanderthals couldn't speak""). It does more harm to the cause of science than good, as the belief in black and white right and wrong understandings obscures more than it reveals.It's not the fault of the readers as much as the writers - those who use writing persuasively to increase the consensus around their own work, or that of those they follow. No-one could accuse Stringer's book of this. One of the negative-ish reviews here suggest that you could save time by just knowing that we don't know very much about early human origins. That's true, but only if you are prepared to eschew a window into how we do learn things - by formulating and discarding different theories, by researching thousands of small questions (how thick is this skull?) and using them as building blocks, by inching DNA test by radiocarbon dating, towards an ever narrowing set of possibilities.This review is now very long and I haven't said much about y'know, the actual book. So here goes: Stringer is a leading and opinionated palaeoanthropologist. He covers here the current state of research - using bone analysis, DNA tests, dating techniques and archaeology to piece together the story of what emerged when. He covers the contradictory nature of much of that evidence, including some which has contradicted his own previous thoughts, and posits a theory to explain what we know. he covers extensively what other theories are also in the space. He has a factual and precise style, but he writes with passion and love for the subject matter.Stringer's final chapter, in which he discusses both the current-day relevance; the probable conclusions, and the importance of the scientific method itself is simply a masterpiece of scientific writing. I thought I wasn't going to find a book worth reading in this fast-moving area of research, just given how fast everything goes out of date. I'm really glad i decided to give this one a try."
9,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"Where does our species come from? Who were our ancestors?These are enduring human questions, and we are piecing the answers together out of bits of bone and stone tools and recovered DNA. Chris Stringer is one of the world's leading paleoanthropologists, and one of the leading proponents of the ""Out of Africa"" theory, proposing a recent African origin for Homo sapiens in eastern or southern Africa, who then expanded out of Africa, replacing the archaic humans, including Neanderthals, in the rest of Eurasia.Lone Survivors is an examination of the major breakthroughs of the last thirty years, with new evidence and new kinds of evidence, including the advances in recovering and analyzing DNA from ancient fossils. That evidence has, in fascinating ways, both reinforced the basic ""recent African origin"" hypothesis, and raised serious challenges to the idea that this origin happened in one, highly localized place.We may have made the leap to modernity in Africa precisely because Africa is a huge and diverse continent. When one population made the transition to complex modern behavior, and the local conditions turned against them, they may have died out or moved on or slipped back to premodern levels.But this was in Africa, and there was someplace to move on to where the environment would support the population density needed for modernity. And if the first group didn't migrate to a more promising area, there were other populations that could exploit them. Because there was a wide enough range of environments, and enough somewhat separated populations of early modern humans, eventually, that critical mass was reached, modern human behavior was here to stay, and modern humans spread out from Africa.That's the simple summary. This is a complex and fascinating story, including not just modern and extinct human species, but the ""archaic"" humans whose genes are still with us in our own DNA, including Neanderthals and Denisovans.Stringer avoids polemics, does not waste time on science deniers, and points out his own errors and mistakes over the years as readily as he does others'. His writing is clear, understandable, and informative.There is also discussion of the most newly-discovered, and oddest, member of Genus Homo, Homo floresiensis, a.k.a. the Hobbits of the island of Flores.Recommended.I bought this book."
10,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3116835-janice,2,"This wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I saw the author, Chris Stringer, on the Colbert Report. He was personable and engaging. It made me think this book would be very accessible to the layman. It isn't. It is very dry. I think the author thinks he has dumbed this down for the general populace but no. The only reason I got a good bit out of it was I knew something about all those early hominids, and how scientists had connected them in the past. Stringer kept throwing around abbreviations of things that the majority of people wouldn't know. Then there were utterly useless graphs and charts. They showed nothing. Literally nothing.I did find some of it interesting. That there might have been more than one exodus out of Africa. That maybe there wasn't a direct lineage to some of these hominids. That maybe there was some intermingling between several of the species.But overall this could have been a much better book. I'm sure that scientists in the field thought it was too simplified, and the layman gave up after the first chapter."
11,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13510236-richard-reese,5,"A million years ago, our Homo erectus ancestors consisted of maybe 20,000 breeding individuals, according to wizards who speculate on the hidden secrets of DNA. This is similar to the current population of chimpanzees or gorillas. The ancestors lived in scattered pockets of Africa, at a time when Earth was a paradise of abundant life. From these ancient roots, a number of hominid species evolved, but only Homo sapiens still survives, at seven-point-something billion and growing. The chimps and gorillas continue to live in a manner similar to their ancestors of a million years ago. What happened to us?Chris Stringer is one of the venerable grandfathers in the study of human evolution. He’s read the papers, attended the conferences, examined the skulls, and had a ringside seat at the noisy catfights. This field of knowledge is far from finished. New specimens continue to be found, and new technology provides deeper insights. Stringer’s book, Lone Survivors, discusses some primary issues, and the scholarly disputes surrounding them, as they stood in 2012. He does a pretty good job of providing an overview to a huge and complex subject, but readers with little background are advised to wear life preservers.I learned a lot about Neanderthals. They survived 400,000 years on a climate change roller coaster. They hung out with hippos in warm forests near Rome, and they chased wooly mammoths on frigid treeless tundra. They had short, stocky bodies that were good for preserving heat, but which required more calories. Males and females were about the same size, suggesting little division of labor, everyone joined in the hunt. The Neanderthal diet majored in the flesh of large game. Readers who have hunted hippos with wooden thrusting spears know that his is very dangerous. One site in Croatia contained the remains of 75 Neanderthals, and none were older than 35. In their clans, there were probably many orphans and few grandparents. The scarcity of elders, and the small size of their groups, sharply restricted the flow of cultural information from one generation to the next, and from clan to clan.Some say that Neanderthals lacked shoes and close-fitting clothing. When Darwin visited chilly Tierra del Fuego, at the bottom of South America, he was shocked to see natives wearing little or no clothing and sleeping naked in the open. Stringer noted that modern Europeans seem to be poorly adapted to the cold, physiologically.Cro-Magnons were the Homo sapiens that moved into Europe maybe 45,000 years ago. European Neanderthals disappeared around 30,000 years ago. Neanderthals went extinct in the Middle East, Siberia, Gibraltar, and Britain at different times, probably for different reasons. This was an era of frequent climate zigzags. When temperatures plummeted, habitable territories shrank, and fewer folks could be fed.Cro-Magnons apparently had footwear and warm, fitted clothing. They had better tools for hunting, so their diet was more diverse and dependable. They were able to extract more nutrients from an ecosystem, so they could survive in places where Neanderthals could not. They lived in larger groups, and more of them survived to middle age or old age, so more cultural information could be passed to the young.Large populations are better at preserving cultural knowledge, acquiring new information from outsiders, and generating innovations. More busy minds interact, exchange ideas, compete, and imagine cool ways for living even farther out of balance. Witness the city of Los Angeles, where 14 million animals with hunter-gatherer DNA are temporarily able to survive because of a highly complex system of innovative technology. Note that this innovation has no relationship to foresight or wisdom. Time is running out on Los Angeles.On the other hand, less innovation occurs in smaller simpler groups, and that’s often a blessing. Innovators can be dangerous loose cannons, introducing risky new ideas that result in horrid unintended consequences — like cell phones, automobiles, or agriculture. Nothing is more precious than a stable, sustainable, time-proven way of living, where the secret to success is simply imitating your ancestors, conforming to the norm, and enjoying life, like the chimps and gorillas do.When the planet heated up 14,000 years ago, rising sea levels submerged the land link between Australia and Tasmania, terminating the exchange of people, ideas, and gadgets. Tasmania’s traditional way of life was also squeezed as the warmer climate spurred the expansion of heavy forest. The natives experienced a cultural meltdown. “Tasmanians appear to have led an increasingly simplified life, forgoing apparently valuable skills and technologies, such as bone and hafted tools, nets and spears used to catch fish and small game, spear throwers and boomerangs, and anything but the simplest of skin clothing.”Will climate change have a similar effect on industrial civilization in the coming decades? Will it slash food production, sharply reduce population, eliminate travel between regions, pull the plug on modern technology, and erase lots of obsolete and unsustainable cultural information? Could collapse have a silver lining?Climate change can derail any culture, and drive species to extinction. It can also produce beneficial conditions, like the unusually favorable climate of the last 10,000 years. Natural selection rewards species that can adapt to change, and it deletes those that fail. There is another important variable that is often overlooked — genetic drift — mutations that happen all the time when slight boo-boos occur during cell division. These tiny defects can provide a barrel of surprises.We are repeatedly taught that humans are nature’s flawless masterpiece, the glorious conclusion of three billion years of evolution. But, if Big Mama Nature had experienced slightly different moods over the eons, we might be Neanderthals or Denisovans today (or maybe slime mold). Climate change and genetic drift are purely random. The fact that Homo sapiens is the lone survivor among the hominid species is not absolute proof of superiority, but it does indicate a temporary streak of good luck.Homo heidelbergensis was an ancestor that lived 500,000 years ago. They had brains ranging in size from 1100 to 1400 cc (modern brains average 1350 cc). The average Neanderthal brain was 1600 cc — much bigger than ours. Stringer noted that our brains today are ten percent smaller than our Homo sapiens ancestors of 20,000 years ago. Is there a message here?Without words, chimps and gorillas can express contentment, affection, irritation, excitement. But without complex language, they are more trapped within themselves. Language took us “into new and shared worlds that were unknown to our ancestors.” We can talk about the here and now, the past, the future, abstract concepts, feelings, imaginary worlds, and so on.Later, innovative geniuses invented the use of symbols. Now we can convert words into patterns of squiggly lines, for example: “computer.” Writing enables us to communicate with folks in faraway places. I can read words written by Julius Caesar, and so might the generations yet-to-be-born, in theory. Industrial civilization cannot exist without symbols — numbers, graphs, pictures, status symbols. Progress abounds with powerful and dangerous juju.Stringer is a mild mannered humanist. And so, he portrays the human journey as one of admirable advancement (the chimps fall down laughing). On the last page, he confesses a profound doubt. “Sometimes the difference between failure and success in evolution is a narrow one, and we are certainly on a knife edge now as we confront an overpopulated planet and the prospect of global climate change on a scale that humans have never faced before. Let’s hope our species is up to the challenge.” "

13,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3038974-steve-van-slyke,4,"I have read a handful of books on paleoanthropology over the years, and of the sciences that I enjoy following, this one seems to have the most volatility in terms of controversies, debates and new discoveries, which makes it fun to track. One of the oft-made comments about paleoanthropologists is that there are more of them than there are of the bones and skulls they study.As the book's title suggests, the author, Chris Stringer, focuses on the latter stages of human evolution, picking up the story shortly before the departure of the first members of the genus Homo from Africa. If you're more interested in the whole span of human development, beginning with our separation form chimpanzees and bonobos 6-7 million years ago, you might first want to read Masters of the Planet.Having said that, Stringer makes a thorough and compelling argument that modern humans are, for the most part, descendants of culturally advanced band of people that left Africa 50 to 60 thousand years ago and gradually replaced more ancient Homo ancestors including the Neanderthals in Europe and Homo Erectus and the recently discovered Denisovans of Siberia and SE Asia. However—he points out—recent genetic studies indicate that some moderns still contain Neanderthal and Denisovan genes in their genomes. Something happened in Africa just prior to this time that resulted in the so-called Great Leap Forward. Stringer offers a view that I personally agree with: that human population densities in Africa reached a critical point where there began to be an exchange of culture, technology and knowledge that created a multiplier effect, ramping up the rate of sophistication in middle to late stone age tool making. With these advanced tools/weapons modern humans were, for the first time able to enter Europe and out-compete the Neanderthals, eventually forcing them into a corner at Gibraltar where they finally disappeared from the record. Similarly, these new modern humans spread east and displaced their Homo Erectus and Denisovan cousins, apparently inter-breeding with them in limited instances.I found it interesting that Stringer is somewhere in the middle between the “lumpers” and the “dividers”. The first want us to believe that there is really only one species of Homo; i.e., Sapiens, and that archaic members of that group separately evolved into modern humans at various points on the planet, explaining the racial variations we see today. The “dividers” on the other hand, see a new species with almost every fossil that turns up. Springer's view includes Erectus. Heidelbergensis, and Neanderthalensis, but he does not differentiate between Erectus and, for example, Ergaster, as others do. As I said in the beginning, this is a rather volatile discipline with new views coming forward and being accepted or rejected.There were many interesting facts discussed in the book including: the human brain has actually shrunk a bit in average size over the last 20,000 years; Neanderthal brains averaged larger in size than modern humans; the modern human brain is about as big as it can get without medical intervention at birth due to the limits of the size the the birth canal; and humans are the only species whose skulls are limited in this way.This is an excellent book if you wish to understand the most accepted current view of how we came to be the lone surviors."
14,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7794908-lars,3,"I bought Chris Stringer's book ""The Origin of Our Species"" (or ""Lone Survivors: How We Came to be the Only Humans on Earth"" as the US publisher has ridiciously retitled it) because, obviously, I wanted to brush up on my knowlegde of human evolution. I was looking for a definitive, chronological human history as scientists now understand it. Unfortunately ""Origin of Our Species"" was not that book. In this book Stringer discusses how new dating techniques and our understanding of DNA and the human genome has revolutionized palaeontology and our understanding of human evolution. Unfortunately each new discovery raises more questions than it answers. Palaeontologists don't agree on a lot of things and Stringer touches upon some of the major debates being held by scientists at the moment. How did early modern humans leave Africa and spread thoughout the globe? How did Neanderthals came to be extinct? Did Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal interbreed? How culturally advanced were early modern humans? How did early modern humans live together and did they consider Neanderthals to be friends, foe or prey?The most frustrating aspect of this book is that author Chris Stringer can't satifactorily answer these questions, simply because these subjects are still hotly debated or there just isn't enough evidence to support one theory over the other. To his credit Stringer discusses many theories, even some he doesn't necessarily agree with in order to give the reader the complete picture. ""The Origin Of Our Species"" works as an overview of the advances in palaeontology and the study of human evolution in the past 30 years. If you're looking for definitive answers however, you'll be disappointed. "
15,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4973578-iset,4,"Chris Stringer, an expert in the field of more than 40 years, and currently attached to the British Natural History Museum guides the reader through the world of palaeoanthropology, and the changes and discoveries in this field over the past four decades. This book is well written, clear, and explains technical terms, so if you’re a newcomer to the subject this book is ideal, as it has been written to be easy and accessible for just such an audience. However, at the same time, it offers a pretty comprehensive discussion of the field and of the debates and exciting questions. Did humans really come out of Africa? To what extent did we interbreed with other human species? Were we as mentally proficient and inventive when we evolved as anatomically modern humans, or did our brain continue evolving and did we undergo a later revolution of thought, as some palaeoanthropologists argue? How is use of genetics changing our understanding of palaeoanthropology? Anything you ever wanted to ask about human evolution and stone age humans, it’s here. Of course, over time no doubt this book will itself become out of date, but I’m impressed with just how up to date it is, including discussions of the recently discovered Denisovans, Homo floresiensis, and the revelations in recent years that our species did indeed interbreed with both Neanderthals and Denisovans. I suppose my one criticism is that although I found the writing style easy and flowing, it was not deeply engrossing for me, and I would have enjoyed more photos to illustrate the points being made in the text.8 out of 10"
16,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/431213-anne,3,"I was watching a documentary on human evolution recently and realized the state of my knowledge on the topic was in dire need of updating. When I saw a review for this book, I thought it was a perfect opportunity to dive on in. But basically, I'm just dabbling here in paleontology, archaeology, and evolution. As for the book itself, for the most part everything was written clearly so even I, as a dabbler, could grasp most of what was being covered. But I found the organization horrible! I suspect my unfamiliarity with the topic contributed greatly, but my mind was spinning trying to keep track of when/where all the bones were coming from and how they all tied together. Essentially, I wanted more pictures, more diagrams, and way better maps. I think the nature of the topic lends itself to visual aids and the few that were in the book were severely lacking (for me, anyway).However, I definitely do not regret reading the book since I feel I did get some interesting information from it. My favorite part was the DNA analysis because (yay!) it felt more concrete (maybe even more reliable) than the speculation on culture, behavior, etc. of peoples dead millennia ago. "
17,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1156396-l,0,"Stringer tells the story of research into human evolution as a scientific adventure, with competing theories, new dating techniques turning ""firm"" knowledge on it's head, and more. One of my favorite lines so far is in the second chapter, in a discussion of the impact of new techniques on two competing theories--""We were both wrong!"" Instead of the usual academic self-justification along the lines of ""based on the best methods at the time . . ., blah blah blah"" Stringer shares with the reader the excitement that comes with watching what everyone, including himself, ""knew"" being swept away by new methods. The repeated use of the term ""Orientals"" is distressing. I don't know if this is disciplinary, a British thing, political, or what, but it is jarring."
18,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1555901-sara,3,"An interesting read, but found the organization to be all over the place. Lots of interesting tidbits on Neanderthals and theories for why they died off, but like another reader, I was irritated by the constant promises to explain very important points later in the book. The diagrams included did little to help with the confusion. One of them is a series of several points on a map with the names of species and dig names intermixed, no indication of which species was discovered at which site. Maybe I just need to build a memory cave, but keeping track of it all was a wee bit daunting. "
19,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1702050-fox,2,"I'm torn between a two or three star rating for this book. Chris Stringer makes it known in the first few pages that he wishes to write a book that is illuminating to both the layperson as well as the expert. In attempting to please both crowds, however, he succeeds in pleasing neither. The text sorely misses the easy to understand explanations that still contain high level material that books such as  How to Clone a Mammoth touch upon, as well as the easier to approach tone that  Bill Bryson,  Beth Shapiro, and others have so easily mastered. What is found instead is a fairly dry, informative, and slightly opaque book that is full of abbreviations where none are needed. The Out of Africa hypothesis may be more accurately called the Recent African Origin hypothesis - but does it need to be referred to as RAO? These aren't things like CRISPR which benefits from abbreviation, after all...Anyway, this book was fascinating. I learned a lot about other extinct hominids, the debate between RAO and Multiregionalists and the eventual current thought that RAO + Assimilation is likely the current best knowledge. I was a bit perplexed by the lack of attention to various specimens out of Asia, and the reluctance to speculate further on Denisovans and Hobbits. The Flores section in particular was lacking, but that may simply be due to the lack of new information in that area. I was also mildly perplexed by how little attention was paid to possible mating between hominids and gorillas (?!) I'd never heard of that being a predominant theory on where public lice came from, but one sentence was all that was given to it.This book is highly technical, and very dense. I love the subject, but I had difficulty with this book. Nevertheless, I look forward to reading more on the subject and continuing to challenge myself with each new text I come upon. Learning is never a bad thing, after all... And this book was definitely informative, challenging, and a higher level text on the topic than I think I've ever yet read."
20,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5682436-pearson-moore,5,"Title: Lone SurvivorsAuthor: Chris StringerGenre: Nonfiction, PaleoanthropologyLength: 321 pagesReviewer: Pearson MooreRating: 5 starsSummaryThe creator and primary spokesperson for the Recent African Origin Theory presents a well-supported discussion of his view of human evolution concentrating on the modern Homo era from about 40,000 years BP.From the PublisherA leading researcher on human evolution proposes a new and controversial theory of how our species came to be.In this groundbreaking and engaging work of science, world-renowned paleoanthropologist Chris Stringer sets out a new theory of humanity's origin, challenging both the multiregionalists (who hold that modern humans developed from ancient ancestors in different parts of the world) and his own ""out of Africa"" theory, which maintains that humans emerged rapidly in one small part of Africa and then spread to replace all other humans within and outside the continent. Stringer's new theory, based on archeological and genetic evidence, holds that distinct humans coexisted and competed across the African continent—exchanging genes, tools, and behavioral strategies.Stringer draws on analyses of old and new fossils from around the world, DNA studies of Neanderthals (using the full genome map) and other species, and recent archeological digs to unveil his new theory. He shows how the most sensational recent fossil findings fit with his model, and he questions previous concepts (including his own) of modernity and how it evolved.Lone Survivors will be the definitive account of who and what we were, and will change perceptions about our origins and about what it means to be human.ReviewThis is exactly the in-depth presentation and evidence-based debate I have been hoping to find in non-technical paleoanthropological works by leaders in the field. Kudos to Professor Stringer for laying out his vision of late human evolution in such an accessible and engaging manner.There is so much to like about this book. Of the five linear feet of shelf space I have given over to books and texts on anthropology, this one has become my favorite by far. The presentation of data is balanced, informative, and humble in its slow, methodical development of Stringer's now-modified ""Mostly Out of Africa"" Theory of human evolution and migration. One might expect the originator of a major scientific theory to defend his position tooth and nail. Instead, Stringer's presentation seems predicated on an almost completely open mind. His modification of the Recent African Origin (RAO) Theory to include elements of multiregionalist interpretation is nothing short of breathtaking to anyone familiar with the long and sometimes heated debate over human origins.This book may not be for everyone. In particular, non-scientists may find Stringer's relentless support of every statement daunting. Many reviewers penalized him on precisely this point. From my point of view, though, the detailed and balanced presentation of data, accompanied by authority-level interpretation and debate, was precisely the rich fare I seek in books of this type. But my perspective is that of a highly trained chemist; I recognize that readers not accustomed to the rigors of scientific inquiry may find Stringer's discussion tedious and perhaps overwhelming. On the other hand, readers not afraid of a deep, mature discussion of human origins will find in Professor Stringer's work a fascinating and thought provoking treatise.Stringer spent much of the book analyzing evidence for Neanderthal culture and genetic contribution to modern Homo sapiens. I paid close attention, for it is my intention to apply this information to my own work (I am a novelist). I have read widely in studies of Neanderthal tools, culture, and art. I have at least heard of every bit of evidence presented, and I have my own ideas about its significance, sometimes at odds with Dr. Stringer's view. Nevertheless, I found the author's informal but vigorous style more than engaging.OverallThis is an excellent, balanced development of the most recent permutation of the RAO Theory. Readers preferring a less rigorous explanation of human evolution may wish to read a coffee table book, such as Douglas Palmer's ""Origins,"" G. J. Sawyer's ""The Last Human,"" or Alice Roberts' ""Evolution.""Rating: 5 Stars"
21,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1036072-david-evans,4,Written by one the foremost researchers in the field of trying to find out just when our species developed in and then left Africa explains just how damn complicated sifting the evidence is. Did bits of neanderthal DNA get into our genome and just why did they die out while we thrived. This also raises in me the vexed question of just which is my favourite Homo? Currently I like the cut of the jib of H. heidelbergensis with his massive brow ridges glowering over those empty eye sockets and whose skull sits in safe outside the author's office.
22,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5619631-chris-demer,3,"Although this book has some very interesting aspects, there are some downsides. One: In places it is quite technical and the author assumes familiarity with the field that most non-scientists do not have and, two: the author seems to skip around a lot- from place to place and through time, sometimes leading to bewilderment!That being said, I gleaned some new information. While it is true that for long periods of time more than one human species existed - probably side by side at times, only H. sapiens evolved and survived to the present. Stringer solidifies the ""recently out of Africa"" theory and attempts to answer some of the most puzzling questions about our beginnings. He provides evidence for his ideas and acknowledges when there is still room for doubt. New dating techniques and genetic data have provided much information in recent years. He believes there are some Neanderthal genes in human populations of today, although they are few. Also Neanderthals were probably not brought to extinction by more sophisticated humans (ourselves) but met their demise gradually due to social, climatic and other changes. Stringer speculates that the forces that drove some humans to leave Africa around 60,000 years ago included larger groups living in close proximity and sharing knowledge. He believes modern humans had the edge over Neanderthals due to higher population density leading to cultural exchange and development. ""What is interesting about this (idea) is that it suggests that genetic continuity, large brains and intelligence on their own will not ensure success for human groups:the survival of knowledge is also vital.""He also puts to rest the concept that we are no longer evolving."
23,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4278829-lynley,4,"Chris Stringer certainly knows his stuff. He almost knows too much, and it seemed he didn't quite know the right place to start with writing a book about everything he's learned over a career. Like many expert authors of non-fiction books, he first went into overview mode, including different was of classifying fossils, disclaimers that we're not really sure about this and that, in blocks of information that I wished had been in bullet-point/diagrammatic form rather than solid walls of text.However, after ploughing through the first few chapters I became fascinated with the subject matter and by the last chapter I wanted him to write more, especially on his ideas about the future of human evolution. With the disclaimer that he doesn't really like to speculate on that, his educated guesses are still fascinating. I won't look uncritically again at science fiction illustrations of large-headed humans. We're more likely to shrink, as we have been doing. Shorties around the world unite. You are the future, it seems.Readers with a highly specialised interest in human evolution will probably get a lot more out of this book than I did, because I feel like I've absorbed very little compared to all the information offered. Still, I certainly have a broader view of current thinking. It will be exciting to see what is uncovered over the next few years, as many more complete human genomes are sequenced. And who knows, maybe even a few more fossils will turn up!*goes outside to dig in the garden*"
24,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/975391-steven,3,"I've seen the author on any number documentary programs about Neanderthals and the origins of humankind. He really does know his stuff and does an admirable job of outlining competing theories about human origins, and the new tools and techniques that paleoanthropologists are using to learn more.I got a bit lost a few times -- more my fault than his. I do wish there had been more discussion of other outlying branches such as the Denisovians and the recently unearthed ""Hobbits"" from the island of Flores. But Neanderthals are what he knows best, and Neanderthals are what we get. I appreciate that Stringer puts the evidence out there, some of it quite contradictory, so that the reader can get an idea of the issues being grappled with, then applying his b opinion as to what is most likely rather than just telling us ""this is the way it is."" It's a very even-handed approach, and he gives rival theories their due.My favorite take-away concept (not originally his, I think) was that all hominid species struggled along at levels of low cultural advancement, making and losing technological innovations until Homo sapiens managed to reach a tipping point, perhaps related to lifespan increases and symbol development that allowed innovation to survive and disseminate widely.You can definitely tell that Stringer is an academic and not a science journalist -- still, his enthusiasm for and knowledge of his subject shows."
25,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6967393-nicholas,4," The author has somehow produced an almost indecently readable book from the interpretation of data emerging from many advanced dating techniques.In fact his writing is some of the best I've come across in popular science.He manages to circumvent in-depth technical explanations and keeps matters as simple as possible. However the nature of the subject is such that in many areas no precise conclusions can be made,as certain finds cast doubt on previous theories and start to construct a picture of random mutations/evolutionary advances and hybridization,that flourished,died out and then re-emerged,frustrating any attempt at finding a pattern that would satisfy those in need of some form of clarity. The genetic data,does produce more definite conclusions in regard of population sizes and migratory patterns and also evidence of the emergence of a 'modern' brain/mind about 50,000 years ago,possibly triggered by a bout of dopamine triggered ADHD. This seem to be more conclusive evidence and the area where more advances will be made. On the whole then,a very entertaining book that sharpens the focus on pre-hisory and brings you up to date with the methodology being employed at present. "
26,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6042847-lasse-laitinen,2,"This book holds important information, but is poorly structured. It seems as if Stringer didn't even try to carry the reader through the narrative, as conclusions are often missing and as the author dwells on specific fossil finds. He should instead start from the bigger picture or bigger questions, which certain finds may offer insights into. The bones found in Nigeria, dated just 13,000 years old, are a positive example in this text. Furthermore, as ""Lone Survivors"" is meant for the wider public, the focus should be on the past humans themselves, their physiology and behaviour, not on their fossilised remains. Thus, approximate illustrations of human appearance in the past would have served the book better than (to me) unclear pictures of parts of human skulls.A single fossil find may have a profound impact on the field of paleoanthropology, and new questions and answers are arising at such a pace that there is and will be a steady demand for well-structured popular books on what human history on this planet really looks like.(I read the Finnish translation of 2014.)"
27,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,2,"This book jumps around a lot and doesn't really have follow a coherent path. Paragraphs don't follow on from one paragraph to another, never mind chapters. The book is also rather limited in that it discusses modern people and neanderthals in rather vague terms. The book wasn't overly technical but it presented information in such a vague and disassociated manner that it made things rather confusing. Too much speculation, not enough facts.I got the impression that the author's pet theory was the out of Africa hypothesis and he was going to cherry pick data to suit his theory. The author continually bashes the multi-regional hypothesis without actually providing any detailed information on this (or any of the other) hypotheses or providing information on why he considers it wrong. Even if the one hypothesis is completely wrong, I would still like to know more details about it and why it is considered inaccurate. I may have missed something with all the jumping around, but I still have no idea ""how we came to be the only humans on earth""."

Stringer lays out the evidence that Homo Sapiens originated in Africa and that there were not just one population of Homo Sapiens but several different populations that coexisted with other species of Homo Sapiens (such as Homo erectus). Eventually, homo sapiens replaced all other human species. The reasons that Homo sapiens survived and other species of humans did not is what the books is about. Those reasons consisted of multiple factors including luck, diet, climataic changes. Hence, the subtitle, ""how we came to be the only humans on earth."" The book isn't easy reading and I skipped over parts but enjoyed learning what I could from it. It addresses some of the major findings and conclusions of modern paleoantropology."

I feel certain that Chris Stringer is one of the true bright lights of paleoanthropology and has been for some time. This is not a book for the casual reader. Stringer's writing style is very pithy ( no, I do not have a lisp) and consequently the is a huge amount of information crammed into 280 pages, some of it pretty technical. He tries to be user friendly in the begining but the last coulpe of chapters require some slogging through. I don't mean to sound negative since this really is a great source for anyone with an interest in the subject. Stringer is quite objective and points out opposing points of view- and there are many in this field. Unlike the Clovus Firsters, he even owns up to his own mistakes- how refreshing. "

Consensus is we're all from Africa, that human-type beings have been on the Earth for quite some time in small groups, that these groups cooperated, interbred and competed with each other, that our species survived due to climate, food, and chance. Lots of holes left to fill that could turn this consensus around. Stringer is an expert in this field so his ""in my view"" is very authoritative. His explanations are clear and he is sufficiently humble to cover competing views and to point out where his views are speculative or are incomplete. If a volcano or some climate event had occurred in Africa, we might be modern Neanderthals who survived and evolved in Europe. Given our DNA contains some Neanderthal DNA, who knows?"

However, he presents it in a comprehensive way. And perhaps what I’ve heard did originally come from him and only now has it been written in a book. Either way, I like the theory. I like any theory that challenges long held ideas. I like when we consider other possibility, even if they take us nowhere. I didn’t get as much out of the book as I wanted due to the fast pace I had to read through it for class (itself due to lots of classes). Some of the material was not new to me, but some of it was new. And some of it merged what I knew and didn’t know. I may reread the book in the future. It’s got some great ideas and information."

My one big complaint is that the author is obviously determined that the researchers get full credit. Every single one of them. So EVERY theory in paleoarcheology gets introduced with all the relevant researchers' names. The sentences become convoluted to the lay reader. It was exhausting to wallow through all the credits that should have been in footnotes.

That's this book's key strength. However, I'm not a fan of the chapters about religion or what makes us, culturally, a modern human compared to Neanderthals -- the evidence is so small and the speculation so large that I am utterly not persuaded to believe any of the suppositions. A good read, if you skip those parts!"
34,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15005782-nancy-mckinley,4,The writer of this concise book has been involved in many of the newest and most exciting breakthroughs and discoveries in the study of early man and his take on the subject is enlightening. We are brought up to date on what we know so far. It mentions through example how sometimes even the experts can be fooled and much of what we know still lingers in theory. I enjoyed this book and I would recommend it to any other person who is crazy enough to adore anthropology as much I do. (A basic working knowledge of the subject is helpful.)

A fascinating account, nonetheless. "

39,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30791639-george-mcdonald,4,"Highly recommended for anyone interested in the topic of the origin of man. Chris Stringer has been a leading researcher in this field for 40+ years, and appears to have gone to a lot of trouble to provide an overview of all the relevant archaeological and genetic evidence. He doesn't stop at just reciting the evidence, but weighs in on the different interpretations of that evidence, and presents a compelling case for a narrative in which modern humans developed in a limited number of locations in Africa, and with a subsequent exodus out of Africa about 55,000 years ago.Spoiler alert (in as much as a non-fiction book can have spoilers): What follows below is less of a review, and more of a recap for myself of what I thought were the salient points. Views on the origin of our species have gone through many formulations and reformulations since Darwin, but an African origin for Homo sapiens is now the mainstream view.The estimated ages for recent events in human evolution are consistent with the latest fossil and archaeological data for the exit from Africa and for our arrival in Asia, Australia, Europe, and the Americas. “African Eve” would have lived about 135,000 years ago, the exit from Africa would have taken place about 55,000 years ago, and the arrival in the Americas at about 14,000 years ago.The long-term effective size of the ancestral population for modern humans might have been only about 10,000 breeding individuals, while the effective size of the female population, judged from surviving mtDNA, is sometimes estimated at less than 5,000! If such numbers are a true reflection of the original population size in Africa, humans were present only in numbers comparable to those of gorillas and chimpanzees, species that inhabit relatively small parts of the African continent today.What sparked the development of humans? What triggered the changes that led to our modern minds and patterns of behavior?Genetic data suggests that population size in Africa could have reached a critical threshold about 100,000 years ago, when population density and enhanced contact between groups could have allowed the rate of accumulation of innovations to overtake their loss, something probably rare in humans up to that time. Thus cultural change in the Middle Stone Age greatly accelerated, and the increased store of learning was beneficial to the survival of individuals and their groups. In turn this would have started a feedback mechanism, leading to a further increase in population density and contacts, and so on. What is interesting about this work is that it suggests that genetic continuity, large brains, and intelligence on their own will not ensure success for human groups; the survival of knowledge itself is also vital.Some scientists believe not only that the structure of the modern human brain is quantitatively different from that of earlier humans in its size and the extent of its gray matter, but that genetic changes unique to modern humans also qualitatively rewired our brains about 50,000 years ago, making us behaviorally modern at a stroke. To understand this, we need to address the important question of symbolism (what Harari referred to as a ""belief in fictions""), which many people think is a key to understanding what made us different from any creatures that came before us. Humans do seem to be pre-programmed for religious beliefs, readily taking these on board, however irrational they may seem to nonbelievers or those of different faiths. When we compare recent human societies of all types, there seems to be an association between larger group sizes and the prevalence of morally concerned gods, which could again aid social cohesion and conformism to social norms. Furthermore, modern psychological experiments have shown that religious beliefs can breed selfless behavior (and hence social reputation), discourage “freeloaders,” and encourage mutual trust. Archaeological evidence suggests that the reach of modern humans across the landscape in terms of food gathering, sourcing raw materials, and social networks increased during the Middle Stone Age and continued to increase during the Later Stone Age in Africa and contemporaneous industries outside of Africa, such as the Upper Paleolithic. Such developments could reflect the arrival of a modern kind of episodic memory. Moreover, the ability to conjure up vivid inner-reality narratives could also have been critical in the development of religious beliefs, since imaginary scenarios could be created as well as actual ones. Once people could foresee their own deaths, religious beliefs that provided reassurance about such events could perhaps have been selected for their value in promoting survival.About twenty-five years ago, the concept of a 35,000-year-old Human Revolution emerged. This revolution considerably preceded, but matched in significance, other transformations such as the domestication of plants and animals, the discovery of metalworking, and the development of industrialization. This revolution seemed to be associated with the arrival of the modern-looking Cro-Magnons in Europe; they had imported or rapidly developed a package of modern human behaviors, such as complex language, art, and specialized technologies, enabling them to replace the behaviorally inferior Neanderthals.A group of 118 bases known as human accelerated region 1 (HAR1) is virtually identical in animals as different as chickens and chimps, with only two coding differences, but humans have accumulated eighteen further mutations. Experiments showed that this DNA sequence is important in building the structure and connections of the cerebral cortex, the wrinkled outermost layer of the brain that is so important for human intelligence. Many other genes involved in the growth of the brain as a whole, such as ASPM, CDK5RAP2, CENPJ, and MCPH1 (microcephalin), also show accelerated change compared with chimps,There is evidence that Aurignacian people living in Goyet Cave, Belgium, already had large dogs accompanying them about 35,000 years ago. The dogs were anatomically distinct from wolves Moreover, ancient dog DNA was obtained, which showed that the Belgian dogs were already genetically diverse and that their mitochondrial sequences could not be matched among the large databases of contemporary wolf and dog DNA. These findings are important because they suggest that dog domestication had already been under way well before 35,000 years ago.At least one of the El Sidrón Neanderthals had mixed genes at the TAS2R38 site, which in modern humans controls an ability to taste (or not taste) the bitter chemical phenylthiocarbamide (PTC). Related chemicals occur in leafy vegetables like Brussels sprouts and cauliflower, as well as in some poisonous plants, and it is possible that the tasting/nontasting dichotomy had evolved in more ancient humans as part of a balance between nutritional needs and detecting the danger inherent in some bitter and poisonous plants."

The author covers fossil evidence but also covers issues such as lifestyle. In all cases, he discusses the breadth of opinion on any issue in addition to his current thinking. In Chapter 1, The Big Questions, the author describes earlier ideas of human evolution, then talks of Recent African Origin (RAO). He prefers RAO to ""Out of Africa"" as it is becoming clearer that there were earlier dispersals from Africa. On page 28, there is a good summary of the differences in skull and body structure between H. sapiens, erectus and heidelbergensis.Chapter 2, Unlocking The Past, concentrates on dating techniques. Newer methods are providing greater detail on the time frames of early human societies.Chapter 3, What Lies Beneath, looks at techniques such as CT X-ray, microscopic studies and high energy X-ray from synchrotrons. It has been found that the Neanderthals have a peculiar ear structure that differs from that shared by sapiens and erectus. Examination of teeth has given a better picture of the adolescent period of earlier humans. Unlike apes, H. erectus is now known to have a long immaturity period to allow for brain development. Chapter 4, Finding the Way Forward, presents newer sites that challenge current thinking. Small brained human fossils dated to 1.75 mya were found at Dmanisi, Georgia. H. floresiensis also small brained human that seems to derive from before the ROA event. One theory is a migration out of Africa almost 2 mya, of which these two humans are the only remains. Twelve Neanderthals have been discovered in the El Sidron caves near Asturias, which seem to show the marks of cannibalism.A partial Neanderthal skeleton found at Saint-Cesaire, France is important in that it was found in conjunction with the Chatelperronian industry. The is industry is important in that the blades were made by the striking of thin flakes, which had only been associated with Cro-Magnons. The Chatelperronian industry, at 35,000 ya, is the same age as the Aurignacian industry which has been tied to the Cro-Magnons.At Pestera cu Oase in Romania, a large number of skulls have been found that have both Neanderthal and modern characteristics. These finds are dated at 42,000 ya and could represent at mixing of early migrants with the Neanderthals. No artifacts have been found, but it is possible that they are responsible for the Bohunician industry which is about the same age but of unknown origin.At Nazlet Khater in Egypt, remains have been found of a boy who shows both Neanderthal and modern characteristics. Dated at 43,000 ya, this may represent an early migration into Europe.At Le Rois cave in France, a number of modern jawbones have been found in conjunction with what appears to be a Neanderthal jaw from a butchered child. Different interpretations are possible, but this may represent a meeting of modern humans and Neanderthal.While China has few sites of modern humans, a skeleton was found at Tianyaun cave that showed humans were present 40,000 ya and were coping with the cold. The foot bones suggest that shoes were worn.Chapter 5, Behaving in a Modern Way: Mind Reading and Symbols, looks at early human culture. The Social Brain Hypothesis (SBH) postulates that humans developed larger brains to facilitate social interaction. Art and symbolism appear to have arrived with the Cro-Magnons. However, fossils show that man has had a large brain for 200,000 y. Changes to the organization of the brain about 50,000 ya have been proposed to explain the sudden advance in thinking. Others argue that earlier advances in hunting, fishing and trade are indicative of earlier advances in the human brain. Blombos cave dates over 70,000 ya and shows refined tool making techniques, and tick shells evidently collected for wear and display. Ritualism, burial and speculation on the development of religion are discussed.Chapter 6, Behaving in a Modern Way: Technologies and Lifeways, discusses theories on the use of fire, harvesting plants, methods of hunting the development of the nuclear family. the development of language and the domestication of dogs. The author's opinion is that many small advances accumulated by 60,000 ya rather as opposed to arriving as a single package.Chapter 7, Genes and DNA, discusses the insights that have come from the study of DNA. Chimpanzees differ from humans in about 2% of their DNA, which is comparable to African versus Indian elephants, horse vs. zebra, or jackal vs. wolf. The Neanderthals had a change to a pigmentation gene that would allow pale skin and red hair, but is actually a different change than allows red hair in modern Europeans. There is evidence for the FOXP2 gene, tied to speech development in the Neanderthals, but whether they could speak remains controversial. The Neanderthals show very little genetic diversity, giving population estimates of 3500 breeding females in Europe and suggesting that they were always a threatened group. Analysis of the Neanderthal genome suggests it is closer to modern Asians, Europeans and New Guineans than Africans. The possible meanings of this are discussed. The Denisovans have genetic material more different than Neanderthals versus moderns and appear to have diverged over 500,000 ya. The Denisovans seem to be related to modern Melanesians. A possible explanation is that the Denisovans were present in both SE Asia and Siberia, and when pre-Melanesian populations migrated through from Africa, some interbreeding occurred.Chapter 8, Making a Modern Human, talks of possibilities in brain development, behavioral signatures such as tick shell findings, language development, the effect of environmental challenges, religion, and the push and pull causes of the migration of about 50,000 ya,Chapter 9, The Past and Future Evolution of Our Species, lloks at a number of issues. DNA analysis has not yet shown any conclusive evidence of Neanderthal- Cro-Mangon admixture. One study of DNA from three sub-Sahara populations has shown some ancient genetic material that early groups of H. heidelbergensis lived alongside evolving modern humans. Discussion on older African skulls including the Broken Hill skull which appears to be H. heidelbergensis dated 200,000 ya. Emphasis is placed on the high variation in African skulls. It is proposed that there was large variation of early humans in Africa, and some admixture shows up as variation in modern humans. Thoughts on future evolution, including genetic modification. An interesting graph is presented on page 271 depicting the evolution of humans over the past 2 million years versus the geographical extent."
41,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50914592-amit-misra,4,"This was a fascinating read on the current state of research on the origins of our species. I came in with a strong general scientific background but without specific information on paleontology, anthropology or human DNA analysis. So a lot of the techniques and scientific background were familiar, and the results and his descriptions were new to me. Overall this made for an enjoyable and educational read for me.Things I liked:•Stringer comes off as relatively unbiased. Obviously he is a supporter of the out of Africa theory, but this analysis is balanced and makes note of where the evidence is very strong and where it is not•There is an incredible level of detail in this book, which is surprising given the incredible breadth of the subject area.Things I didn't like (mostly minor):•At times all the different sites and times got jumbled together for me. I read it on a kindle so it wasn't easy to cross-reference maps and timelines - this would have been really useful so that if a cave from chapter 1 was referenced in chapter 9, I would know where in the world it was and when the fossil was from.•This is definitely not a casual read. At first I tried just reading this book before bed, but it was far too dense! Reading this definitely requires an investment of mental capacity."
42,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7605433-stephen-palmer,4,"Chris Stringer is well known as a senior scientist at the Natural History Museum, his area of expertise human evolution. 'The Origin Of Our Species' wittily riffs on Darwin’s classic work, providing an overview of the state of our knowledge about human evolution.The book was published in 2011, and a few things have changed since then, mostly down to ancient DNA analysis. This however being a Chris Stringer book means it remains essential reading: wide-ranging, entertaining, packed with fact and theory. He is generous with the work of others, but not afraid to take on those, e.g. evangelists of the Multi-region Hypothesis, with whom he has struggled before. And as he points out, the Out Of Africa Theory which he helped develop is now widely supported and accepted.The book covers palaeontology, the importance of scientific techniques, the limits of interpretation, then a brilliant few sections on deducing human behaviour and trying to determine how and when modern cognitive thinking developed.Some reviewers have criticised this book for being too dry. I think that’s well off the mark. It’s not dry, it’s sophisticated, comprehensive and written from immense experience. A fascinating coda for instance explains how ideas that we’ve stopped evolving are nonsense.Highly recommended."
43,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100524301-joe-dang,3,"Our understanding of human evolution has certainly changed significantly with new DNA evidence from extinct Neanderthal and Denisovan fossils. This book seems to be dated with a lot of focus on the book debating the arguements for multiregional evolution versus the compelling evidence for an a recent out of Africa expansion of the current and sole surviving Homo Sapiens race. With current DNA evidence of Homo Sapiens and Neanderthals and Denisovans, its hard to support a multiregional evolution hypothesis which was prevalent just three decades ago.The author clearly understands his field and describes numerous past and contemporary expert opinions regarding the field of paleoanthropology. However, he writing seems a bit scattered and not focused on the main questions as the title suggests as to what exactly were the factors that led to us being the sole surviving humans on the planet.I can see his biases in traditional anthropology with his depiction of measurements of different skull dimensions though admitting in several chapters that the variations seen in dimensions of different skull fossils at different locations could be just randomn genetic variation or drift rather than evolutionary forces at work creating a differentiation of different species. "
44,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19750450-jeff-gabriel,4,"This book was a bit different from what I expected in terms of explaining the ""how"" of the subtitle. The author was focused heavily on the migration of different homo groups and whether they lived together, etc. It was all very interesting and I enjoyed it all, but I think it was a revelation for me about how stitching together all the clues makes it difficult to present a specific (or at least ""neat"") narrative. This is a strength of the book - the author refused to draw conclusions not based in the evidence. The science of this particular discipline was also educational to read about - mixing geology, anthropology, sociology, chemistry, and a few other things in order to bring forth an explanation. Finally, if I can have one nit it would be to show, through pictures/diagrams, the effect of certain gene transmission patterns. Without a strong background in it, it was hard to think through the impact."
45,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111477287-paul-no-l,5,"This is the second book of Chris Stringer that I have read, the first being African Exodus: The Rise of Modern Humanity. Chris has a great way of writing and is of course very knowledgeable having worked in the field for decades. He has a very easy going style and imparts his and the knowledge of the field extremely well. Like all science, books can become outdated very quickly as humanity makes leaps and bounds with the new technology and methods available. So it is in the field of anthropology but most of what is in The Origin of Our Species with perhaps some dates being updated is still absolutely relevant. Chris weaves a fascinating story about the history of the different homo species and therefore this book is a wonderful introduction to the subject from a master at the height of his game. "
46,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43755864-kim-symes,3,"Fascinating subject, but poorly structuredA very interesting subject, but at times a rather tedious read. Chris Stringer is the world expert on this subject, so you can rely on the accuracy of the information presented here. I wasn't sure about the success of the book's structure as it seems to skip around a lot. The first chapter looks at the history of fossil and artefact discoveries, but this leads to these same specimens being looked at again repeatedly later in the book. There is no overall chart, diagram, table or graph that gives you the big picture in one place. The section on dating methods is tedious for the general reader, but not technical enough for a specialist, and so is either for the keen amateur, or written in the expectation that many readers would skip over it."
47,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109535466-mike-parkes,4,"A good look by a working scientist at a key chapter in human evolution. Stringer’s focus is on truly modern Homo Sapiens – what made them unique, when did they arise, and when did they move out of Africa? This is an update from the frontiers of knowledge – Stringer notes competing theories, data gaps, and the uncertainties that exist. You may walk away from the book feeling that what we do know about human evolution is dwarfed by what we do not yet know. While this book is only from 2012, there are a lot of newer fossil discoveries and molecular analysis, such as the story of the third branch of recent humans – the Denisovans - that have come to light since then (it’s a fast-moving field)."

This recent book picks up the thread on how we came to be the only ones of our kind. I learned much (I didn't realize the Out-of-Africa hypothesis is as recent as the 1970s), and I though the author's remarks on environmental challenges/opportunities on small human populations was interesting. I also found his comparison of evolutionary selection vs. cultural selection/preference also interesting."
49,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24409180-guy-lenk,5,"This is an amazing account of the most recent hominids written by an unbelievably knowledgable scientist. Some say this is geared to people in the field of hominin evolution, but it is for a lay audience. However, I will say that it is highly detailed and that it is probably NOT the first book you are going to want to read on human evolution. I found it quite compelling an informative and found it fascinating to read."

I could probably re-read this a handful of time and learn just as much each time over.Author does a good job, I thought, of presenting opinions other than his own and being clear about where he had reason to disagree vs. just a differing opinion. His honesty was very valuable since there are so many differing, but valid, thoughts being floated around!"
51,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15790274-wes-cobb,2,"A rambling look at human evolution with plenty of interesting nuggets interspersed.

52,0805088911,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93427720-marieke,4,"Interesting. Sometimes a bit dry. Seems to contain some contradictions (people are exactly the same the past 40.000 years/evolution is going at it’s fastest the last 10.000 years) but that might be because he’s presenting views of different scientists. Lots of archeological findings are discussed, a challenge to remember and keep apart. :-)"
