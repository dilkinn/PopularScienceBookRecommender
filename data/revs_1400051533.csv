0,1400051533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/531689-e-s,2,Being dead shouldn't exempt Gould from editing. 
1,1400051533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18218857-marc,3,"I had a very up-and-down experience with this book where certain parts fascinated me immensely and others felt like suffering until the next chapter. Gould's first step in mending the gap between the sciences and humanities revolves around establishing mutual respect for both approaches to knowledge and appreciating what types of knowledge each is suited for (observation and empiricism being largely suited to the harder sciences; ethics, morals, culture/art being better studied by the humanities). He goes to great lengths to outline the process of reductionism and the urge to synthesize complex systems under broad theories/definitions. He does a great job tracing the history of the ""two cultures"", as well as debunking the myth of theology vs. science as being necessarily in opposition. The more he mentioned the hedgehog and fox analogy, the more muddled I thought it became--I am still undecided if this was because I felt I was being beat over the head with it or because Gould had additional points to which my lesser brain was oblivious."
2,1400051533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28243-max,3,"While an entertaining read throughout, Gould's final book heats up when he takes on E. O. Wilson's take on consilience, a term coined by William Whewell, an obscure 19th-century English polymath, to refer to a particular kind of scientific induction that does not rely on reductionism. According to Gould, the sciences and humanities represent distinct ways of knowing, and distinct modes of inquiry. Scientific inquiry will never successfully reduce the humanities into constituent parts that are neatly made up of fundamental sciences such as physics and chemistry. He uses Whewell's elaboration of consilience to attack Wilson and differentiate himself from scientists who hope to one day subsume the humanities. Gould does not spare non-scientists, however, and chides them for not taking full advantage of scientific developments as an aid to problems in philosophy, history, mathematics, literature, and art.Gould's book also includes many other fine moments derived from his lectures and other books, from which he excerpts liberally. In particular, his discussion of the ancients versus the moderns in Swift's time does a fine job of introducing Swift's famous ""sweetness and light"" quip to a new generation of academic partisans.While hardly a timeless classic, and certainly an unfinished manuscript, this book showcases the tremendous breadth of Gould's thinking and suggests what was lost with his death."
3,1400051533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11398764-lukas-szrot,4,"As a student of sociology of scientific knowledge I stand on the precipice, in the midst of an ongoing debate about whether sociology should be a quantitative (a la the natural sciences) or qualitative (more like the humanities) endeavor. I wonder, 'don't we need both, and for different reasons?'I found this book interesting because I am also reading Dennett's ""Darwin's Dangerous Idea"". On a side note, it was a great way to brush up on some Latin, and a reiteration in some ways of the Non-Overlapping Magisteria thesis appearing in other works like 'Rocks of Ages'. there is this 'realist versus relativist' debate and the old 'science and religion' relationship which are both central to SSK as heated issues in which the public has become heavily involved. I really appreciate that this book took on some different, lesser-known but highly illuminating perspectives, rather than starting the discussion with a well-worn caricature of Galileo and the Church.Thank you, Stephen Jay Gould, for providing the framework for a tractable middle ground between the narrow positivism growing in popularity among natural scientists and the postmodern irrationalism that has become fashionable in the humanities. You are missed."
4,1400051533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70907778-liedzeit,4,"A tiny little bit too much Gould. Although I like it that he seems to get his pleasure in displaying his knowledge. And his books. He knows Latin and German. Well, not that he knows how to spell schwarz. The hedgehog fox metaphor (from Isiah Berlin) I do not really get. Okay, the hedgehog does know only one trick. But very efficient. Is this science or humanities?He talks about Snow, the invention of the flat earth. There is no war between humanities and science since one party (science) does not show up. Meaning they are not interested and do not know about any conflict.A large part of the book is directed against Wilson (nice anecdote about someone pouring water on AW. SJG says he regretted that he did not use violence at the occasion.) I will try to remember the name Konrad Gessner. The censor of Gessner’s work on animals (everything about pigs e.g.) He crosses out every occurrence of Erasmus. Misses one though, where he talks about the hedgehog/fox. Nice, but too arty."
5,1400051533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1233641-tomomi-landsman,2,"I purchased this book at Second Story Books in Washington DC.I usually love Stephen Jay Gould's books, but I just couldn't get into this one. I can't tell if this is because of the lack of editing by Gould himself, the topic, or the writing coming late in Gould's life, but my eyes just glazed over for the vast majority of the book. I enjoyed the essays in the middle that were reprinted from previous works, but I just didn't understand the overarching thesis for this book.On the other hand, I enjoyed the Note to the Reader at the beginning of the book as so many times I think to myself (and say to other people) how I wish Gould were alive today. Not just so I could read more popular science on more current topics written in his clever prose, but because we need his measured voice and knowledge in our current polemical climate.I don't think I'll revisit this book again, but I'm glad I read it once."
6,1400051533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3196101-zachary,2,"Gould has a good point in this book about the separation and mutual value of science and the humanities, but it sadly gets lost in the verbiage. Here Gould is at his worst, showing off translation skills, bragging about his book collection, and generally being an obnoxious know-it-all in love with his own language. I love Gould, but this is not a good book."
7,1400051533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115143058-rory-fox,4,"The author is rightly remembered as one of the leading communicators of scientific ideas and this book is no exception. It focuses upon the relationship of Science and Humanities, arguing that there is no inherent reason for them to be in conflict.The book is erudite with a wealth of examples and anecdotes: possibly, occasionally too many. Nevertheless, the thesis is simple. It presents historical arguments to show that there is no inherent conflict between Science and Humanities, and then a Philosophical conclusion to show that they ought not to be in conflict.The author showed that the earliest historical disagreements between Scientists and Humanists were not actually about Science or Humanities at all. Experimental science originated during the renaissance, when established academics were focused upon trying to retrieve the lost wisdom of ancient Greece and Rome. Working with an assumption that everything worth knowing had already been discovered by the Greeks and Romans, they looked upon Science as a self-indulgent waste of time and resources. Once the arguments began, issues of dogma and philosophy did indeed arise, but again there was no need for them to come into conflict. At least some of Galileo’s difficulties were caused by the fact that he was a “frightfully undiplomatic hothead” (Loc 1336). In more recent times, Scientific Positivists tried to claim that Science was objective (and therefore preferable) while Humanities were just subjective opinions. But again this wasn’t a real disagreement because it was an “arrogant” and “cardboard” version of Science which was easily shown to be wrong by writers like Thomas Kuhn (Loc 1804).Not only are Science and Humanities not intrinsically in conflict, but the author believed that they shouldn’t be in conflict. Pragmatically, both disciplines can learn from each other. Humanities can help Sciences communicate ideas better, and the Sciences can help Humanities represent their ideas better.But the author thought that there is a much stronger reason for them not to be in conflict. Science and Humanities are dealing with totally different questions. Science deals with descriptions, and Humanities deals with interpretations (Loc 1319). This grounded the author’s view that the disciplines are non-overlapping magisteria, each autonomous in its own specific aspect of addressing factual descriptions (Science), or values, interpretations and implications (Humanities). As the subjects are non-overlapping in their focus, then they cannot be in conflict.This idea leads to the author’s vision of Consilience, which is a uniting of Science and Humanities. It achieves this unity through avoiding the temptations of reductionism, by treating each as a separate partner in a joint enterprise of seeking knowledge and wisdom.This idea seems initially attractive, but it encounters two significant problems. Firstly, the model of non-overlapping magisteria seems to collapse back into a distinction between the Objective Science of descriptions vs the Subjective Humanities of interpretations. And that is a model which the author has already dismissed as a flawed (arrogant, cardboard) model of science. More significantly, it is far from clear that Science and Humanities can be non-overlapping. Descriptive facts might not entail specific values and moral obligations, but religions, ethics and spirituality cannot be entirely divorced from all ‘facts,’ otherwise they become irrational superstitions. Ultimately, it is difficult to escape an area of intersection where humanities subjects depend on at least some facts about the world to drive their interpretations; and where Sciences are using interpretations as theories to drive their observations. The idea of non-overlapping magisteria doesn’t really solve the problem of conflict between Science and Humanities, it just rephrases the terms of the problem.Overall, this is a thought provoking book which repays careful reading, regardless of whether you agree with the author’s conclusions."
8,1400051533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13340068-amy-king,2,"I am scoring low not because of the writing it'sself, but my own personal rating of enjoyment in reading this book. I gave it all that I had and wanted to commit to completing it, but after getting about halfway through, I found that my life would be no different if I stopped now and picked up something that I would find more fufilling.I chose this because the parents book club at my daughter's school was reading it, so I wanted to check it out. It's quite wordy, refers to ancient scholars and is just a little more than what I personally can handle. It's great that there are people in the world passionate about science and humanities to this degree, but the presentation style of the topic in this book is not for me.There were a few comments that were rather humerous, which I enjoyed."
9,1400051533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9233935-paul,3,"This book is a response to Edward O Wilson's Consilience, which was a much better book. Although I disagree with Gould's thesis, especially how he clings to the statement that Science and Religion are completely compatible, which he dismissively states that he ""proved"" in an early work, I did find the historical tales that he cites as evidence to be entertaining and informative. The reader should approach the book as a collection of historical episodes illustrating the conflict between Religion, Humanities, and Science, but the philosophy attempting to glue it together is bunk."
10,1400051533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4697471-garth,5,"Gould wrote much like he talked. His prose is dense with parenthetical asides, long footnotes, obscure references, and humorous anecdotes that occurred to him at the time. If you're not used to all that, it can take you a couple of chapters to get in the groove. It's worth the effort, although I imagine his editors double-dosed on Rolaids when he submitted a manuscript. Be prepared."
11,1400051533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27554940-raymond-nakamura,5,A delightful argument for the keeping the different goals and strengths of science and the humanities rather than attempting to mush them all together as E O Wilson suggested in Consilience.
12,1400051533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59054793-tom,3,"sjg's take on the science/humanities divide, kind of. flawed but at times very engaging. gould passed away before he had the chance to proof this book and unfortunately it shows."
13,1400051533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43477226-todd-stockslager,3,"Review title: Science vs. the humanities in a shrugfestGould, while touching briefly on the more headline-grabbing battle between science and religion (which he has apparently tackled in full elsewhere), takes on the science vs. humanities here. My suspicion is that the lack of crackling urgency the topic seems to have today is dependent on two key factors:1). Science has won! We are all materialists, we are all reductionists; even if we are not all scientists, we see the fruit of science in the technology that dominates our lives today in so many ways--computing in the workplace, pervasive entertainment convergence technology in the home, mobile communications everywhere, once miraculous medical treatments and pharmaceuticals everyday. We even recognize, whether or not explicitly as materialists, that the brain is at the very least a powerful machine driving the mind, which perhaps serves as its operating system which enables us to think, live, create, all those things under the umbrella of the humanities.2). To a large extent, the division is and has always been an academic one. People living in the real world read, right, watch, admire, create live, in the humanities, while recognizing the value, impact, and reductionist/materialist rightness of science in its proper place. We know the world ""works"", we need not know or even think about it that hard. Perhaps we are too cavalier in our ignorance of the sciences, but a case could also be made that to the average non-thinking person, even the humanities are a distant land too seldom visited, so why the hub-bub?Gould's point in this book, which based on these factors seems more dated than the 10 years since its publication, is that science is like the hedgehog, a "":simple-minded"" creature in that its only method of self-defense is to curl into ball to surround its soft internal organs with its prickly covering. On the other hand, humanities are like the ""wily"" fox, with many methods of defense or escape which he crafts to the occasion. Gould calls for both approaches to action to resolve the dilemmas facing the sciences and the humanities, in other words, the world today. He doesn't call for convergence on scientific materialism to resolve problems which is outside the ""magisterium"" (or realm) of science, such as questions of origin (although Gould reveals a strong bias by condemning Christians who believe the Biblical creation account), morals, ethics, politics , and religion. Rather, he suggests that scientists use the fox's range of methods by becoming well-read and thinking holistically to approach problems that can not be simply addressed through materialism, and that humanists adopted the hedgehog's scientific method to resolve problems in its magisterium when those problems are really amenable to materialism. He also calls for the wisdom to know when.Gould uses the Magister's Pox of his title as a warning of the inability to solve this conflict by force--in this example the censorship (pox) attempted by the Catholic church to erase the nascent scientists names (not even their ideas, just their names) from a 17th century volume in Gould's personal library. The effort, besides being wrong-minded, turns out to be impossible, in Gould's interesting example. So the battle may no longer be in full fight, but Gould's reminder still has an impact."
14,1400051533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/294130-manderson,3,"This is the first book of Gould's that I've read, and I will agree with some other reviewers on this site that his final book could have used some deft posthumous editing. Some of the book was ponderous, but overall, I enjoyed Gould's playful, intellectually self-indulgent use of language in service of his arguments, and my interest has been piqued for reading more of his books.As an aside, did anyone else notice Gould's exorbitant use of ""ineluctable"" and ""immiscible""?I found the middle part of the book to be the most enlightening, and the latter part of the book--where he spends a lot of time deconstructing E.O. Wilson's book Consilience--to be the most dreary.There are some gems embedded in his narratives, such as the historical anecdotes about Nabakov, Thayer, or Poe, which will make this book worth wading through for those interested in academic considerations of the possibility for collaboration between the humanities and the sciences.I am looking forward to checking out some of his earlier works."
15,1400051533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8156215-ann,5,"Through his usual informed and intelligent use of meaningful figures and sayings, Gould makes a good case for the false and ongoing division between the humanities and sciences and presents a resolution. In his conclusion he critiques E. O. Wilson's resolution (presented in Consilience)and counters with his own distinction between consilience and reductionism. He concludes with an affirmation of the important and necessary differences in ways of knowing and what the sciences and humanities can gain from a respectful relationship. I recommend the book for those interested in science, humanities, intellectual history, and the history and philosophy of science."
16,1400051533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5081047-catharine-jones,0,"Don't ask me why I'm reading this - or why I've been trying to read it since I bought it way back in something like 2003; let's just say I'm going through my let's find out more about Isaac Newton phase. Indeed a lot of the books I've been working my way through at the moment have mentioned Newton - including Quicksilver, in which he's plays a key role, to the Lost Symbol, Discovery of Witches and even Rivers of London, in which it turns out he defined magic!!Anyway, Gould has a dry wit and while much of his narrative does go over my head, there is enough there to keep me interested."
17,1400051533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19857709-jesse-dunietz,2,"The historical tidbits are fascinating, the argumentation is mostly sound, and the point the book aims to make -- that the sciences and humanities must be informed by each other -- is noble. But Gould focuses way too much on picking apart E.O. Wilson, and the book ends up being a repetitive litany of reasons to distrust science centrism. His writing style is also suffocating: every sentence seems to have so many twists, turns, and subordinate clauses that by the end I would find myself literally feeling a need to gasp for air."
18,1400051533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10663965-nishant,2,"I only scanned it in parts and jumped from one chapter to another when it became too heavy or when I could not make any sense of point made by Jay Gould. First of all, this book is not a lucid reading at all which is contrary to what I thought it to be. However, given that book aims to take on the evergreen conflict between science and humanities as two distinct approaches of gaining knowledge about and analyzing the world (and non-world), this book, being the last and unfinished manuscript of Jay Gould, is  not an ideal starter  on this topic. "
19,1400051533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4696922-ushan,3,"This is one of Gould's last books, full of logorrheic musings on the relationship between science and the humanities. He says that science is not an enemy of religion, not an enemy of ""science studies"", not an enemy of art, and the people who make the opposite impression are marginal radicals; C. P. Snow's famous essay on the two cultures overgeneralizes a parochial British situation; Vladimir Nabokov was a competent lepidopterist and Ernst Haeckel a great art nouveau illustrator."
20,1400051533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/356012-michael,2,"Not the typical essay compilation, here we have Gould essentially responding to Edward O. Wilson's Consilience in a most critical manner. Perhaps of interest to you scientific types, this book is certainly many steps removed from the openness (orientation to the layperson) exhibited by his essays and he just seems crabby."
21,1400051533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/934422-a,3,"Interesting read, but I had a few complaints. One, he's real happy about pointing up the size of his rare book collection (TURN OFF); and two it's obviously unfinished. I mean the writing's real good but you can really tell that the argument is seriously undeveloped for, well, such a long argument. Which lets you yell back, true, but I wish that the argument had cohered better at the end. "
22,1400051533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1372721-elizabeth,4,"Brilliant book (and Gould's last) outlining and expanding his concept of ""overlapping magesteria"" to describe why science and the humanities (including religion) aren't mutually exclusive. His discussion of false dichotomies is killer, and his description of the need for spirituality that begins ""we live in a vale of tears"" is right on. "
