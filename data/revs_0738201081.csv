You can love his as a scientist, as a man, as a genius, as a teacher, as an iconoclast. He is the real deal.  'The Pleasure of Finding Things Out' is a series of 13 speeches, articles, essays, interviews by or with Richard Feynman. These are guilty pleasure reads for people who adore those great physicists of the early 2oth centuries who were lucky AND brilliant enough to be physicists when physics jumped from classical to quantum. These guys were amazing. Feynman wasn't among the first wave of theoretical physicists to dance in the quantum space, but he was a huge member of the second wave.The thing that makes Feynman so interesting is just his unpretentious quirkiness, his love of telling stories, his ability to quickly grasp the root of a problem (whether in physics, biology, or religion) and give you an honest answer. The only drawback to this collection is it repeats several stories. Feynman retold many of his favorite stories (locks at Los Alamos) or ideas (cargo cult science). So if you've read Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!: Adventures of a Curious Character or Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman many of these stories have been heard before. Even inside of this book a couple stories get retold a bit. It is unavoidable, but still a bit of a draw back.Anyway, this isn't a deep dive into science. It is a flirtation with the curiosity that drives scientists. It is the recollections of one of the most fascinating characters to come out of the Manhattan Project and the post-quantum revolution period of physics. So, if you haven't read much on Feynman I might recommend reading 'Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!' first, but I'd still not neglect to check this out as well."
1,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,3,"Here's the problem with having high expectations: they're so often dashed.In my years trawling the web and being a science nerd, I've heard a lot about Richard Feynman. There are legends about him, that he was the Puck of physics - brilliant, untamed, and really, really funny. When I got the book, I was expecting to read a lightning-quick volley of ideas that would set my mind alight with the wonder and infinite possibilities continued within a lifetime's pursuit of science.Yeah, that didn't quite happen.Don't get me wrong - Feynman is indisputably brilliant, and far from the classic mold of the physicist. He had no patience for titles or honors, and in fact couldn't give a damn about them as long as he had science to do. He would tell Nobel laureates - men whose names were bywords for scientific brilliance - that they were wrong, without hedging or worrying about their egos. He liked to play the bongos, loved a good party, and delighted in playing tricks. One of his more irritating hobbies was safe-cracking, and by the time he left Los Alamos labs after the Manhattan Project there were no places left to hide secrets from Feynman.So Feynman was no doubt a really cool guy, the kind of scientist you would want to invite to your party without hesitation. His first interest was science, and as scientist go, he was one of the best.That doesn't mean that reading him is entirely entertaining.The book is, for me, not very readable for two reasons. The first is that it goes get terribly technical at times, and while I love science, I am not educated enough in it to grasp a lot of the technical details. Indeed, it broke my heart when Feynman said that, when it comes to physics, if you don't know the math, you don't know the science. True, yes. Humbling, yes. But still.... Were I editing a collection of Feynman's work, I would have started with the Big Ideas, defenses of science as an integral function of humanity's ultimate progress. Then, having made the reader comfortable with how Feynman thought, they could have gotten into what Feynman thought.But no, the book starts of with highly technical lectures on quantum electrodynamics and the difficulties in getting parallel computers to work. If you don't know a lot about how computers work, or you don't have a detailed awareness of atomic theory, you're going to be a little lost. Or a lot lost. Even his minority opinion on the Challenger accident, something I was especially keen to read, was far too dry to be enjoyable.The second reason why I didn't really enjoy this book is because a lot of it is transcripts of speeches and interviews. Very few people are able to speak in a readable manner, and someone with a mind like Feynman's - always moving, always active - isn't one of them. There are a lot of asides and false starts, wandering thoughts and truncated paragraphs. Even his more structured speeches aren't structured very well for the reader. Perhaps it would be different to listen to him, to sit in the audience and watch the man speak. I reckon that he had the kind of infectious energy and enthusiasm that would make it easy to gloss over structural problems and really enjoy the speech. But turning speech into print is always dangerous, and here I think it fails.For different people - people who are deeply involved in physics or who are Feynman acolytes - this book is probably a fascinating look into the mind of one of the 20th century's greatest scientists. For the rest of us, we're going to have to find other things to enjoy from the text, and it is there. One of those is, indeed, the title of the book - the pleasure of finding things out.For Feynman, science wasn't a rigor or a job, it was a joy. He attributes a lot of that attitude to his father, an unlikely fan of science. As a uniform salesman, Feynman's father was not a scientist and had no scientific training. But he raised his son to think about the world. Rather than tell him why, for example, a bird picked at its feathers with its beak, encouraged Richard to observe the bird, to form a hypothesis and then see if observations confirmed it. His father taught him to question everything, to form his own opinions about the world, and by doing so, made him into a scientist from an early age.It is that attitude which should be the dominant theme of this book, rather than Feynman's technical genius. He says, over and over, to doubt everything. Ask yourself why things are the way they are, rather than just relying on what other people tell you. Observe, experiment and test, and you're doing science.He has some disdain for social sciences, and a pretty healthy dose of misogyny in a couple of places, but if he is arrogant, then it is probably deserved. Feynman was a man fascinated with how the universe worked, all the way down to its smallest components, and that was his passion. Not awards, not titles, not praise - just the work, the discovery and the pleasure."

I used to sit in the cafeteria with the students and eat and try to overhear their conversations and see if there was one intelligent word coming out. You can imagine my surprise when I discovered a tremendous thing, it seemed to me. I listened to a conversation between two girls, and one was explaining that if you want to make a straight line, you see, you go over a certain number to the right for each row you go up, that is, if you go over each time the same amount when you go up a row, you make a straight line. A deep principle of analytic geometry! It went on. I was rather amazed. I didn't realize the female mind was capable of understanding analytic geometry.She went on and said, 'Suppose you have another line coming in from the other side and you want to figure out where they are going to intersect.' Suppose on one line you go over two to the right for every one you go up, and the other line goes over three to the right for every one that it goes up, and they start twenty steps apart, etc.-I was flabbergasted. She figured out where the intersection was! It turned out that one girl was explaining to the other how to knit argyle socks.I, therefore, did learn a lesson: The female mind is capable of understanding analytic geometry. Those people who have for ears been insisting (in the face of all obvious evidence to the contrary) that the male and female are equal and capable of rational thought may have something. The difficulty may just be that we have never yet discovered a way to communicate with the female mind. If it is done in the right way, you may be able to get something out of it."" (p. 175-76, which is somewhat hilariously indexed as ""Geometry"")This is pretty ugly even for 1966.Hard to reconcile that this is the same guy who espouses""I don't believe in the idea that there are a few peculiar people capable of understanding math, and the rest of the world is normal. Math is a human discovery, and it's no more complicated than humans can understand"" (194) - until you realize when he says people he means men."

We need more people/professors like him, to induce in children love for nature, science and curiosity about all the wonders around us.This book contains some of his most popular lectures, and many of them can be seen in the documentary with the same name, which I wholeheartedly recommend. His enthusiasm and love for nature, science, music and life are contagious and you’ll enjoy it immensely.If you’re new to Feynman, you may choose either this one or 
Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!: Adventures of a Curious Character
; it is almost the same book, with the same lectures. I enjoyed the latter more due to the way it was structured, but nonetheless, I very much liked rereading them here."
4,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6743601-jim-fonseca,4,"Feynman is brilliant, arrogant and emotionally cold. He was the youngest brilliant mind working on the atomic bomb in Los Alamos in the 1940's and later won the Nobel Prize in physics. This book is an unintegrated collection of essays, transcripts of speeches, interviews and memoirs. As such it gets repetitive. We hear three or four times about how his father taught him to observe and we hear three or four times the identical story about the Cargo Cults in New Guinea after WW II. His father, who was not a scientist, turned out to be an excellent teacher specializing in teaching his son to learn by observing. Feynman and his school buddies also had basement ""workshops"" so that helped their intellectual development. It's fun to see a mind at work, punching the envelope, too undisciplined and too powerful to be contained within a skull."

This is an excellent collection of some of his ideas and stories, mostly about his life experiences and how he became who he was. Even if you do not have a good understanding of physics or even math you will still enjoy this book. It is not a tractate or a manual but rather a collections of anecdotal stories and interviews that allow anyone to take a peek into the mind of this true badass."
6,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53458752-scot-parker,4,"This book is a compilation of some of Dr. Feynman's more notable writings and talks from over the years. I imagine it was a daunting task (even for Feynman himself) to choose which 300 pages of his work to include, given his brilliance and his storied life, but I found the collection here to be an excellent representation of many of the more notable adventures of Feynman's life and some of his more interesting ideas. Of course, only a fraction of his body of work could be included here.There is some overlap with other works, mostly with ""What Do You Care What Other People Think?"": Further Adventures of a Curious Character. I didn't find that this detracted from the book, however. This work is fundamentally different in its aim; ""What Do You Care..."" comes across as a bit of an addendum to Feynman's first biography, ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"": Adventures of a Curious Character, and a bit of a stand-alone biography, although particularly focused on a couple of periods of Feynman's life rather than his life as a whole, while this book is first and foremost a collection of notable lectures and writings. The stories that overlap between these works tend to be, in my opinion, notable enough that they bear repeating, such as the method through which Feynman learned what the ""valve"" symbol was on a particular set of blueprints, or how people working on the Manhattan Project were able to access important files in locked filing cabinets while the cabinets' owner(s) was away.Unfortunately, nobody is free from flaws, and perhaps Feynman's most notable flaw in my opinion was his sexism; this shows through in a couple places in this book, so be aware.Overall, I strongly recommend this book, though I suggest starting with ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"": Adventures of a Curious Character. Feynman, despite his flaws, was a fascinating, brilliant person, lived a storied life, and came up with quite a few brilliant, world-changing ideas across a variety of academic disciplines. He is worth reading about."
7,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1433865-robert,4,"For those who might not know, Richard Feynman was a Nobel Prize winning theoretical physicist, canny self-promoter and renowned teacher who worked on the Manhatten Project before he had even finished his Doctoral Thesis. Many books by and about him have been published and he has become a kind of miniature industry since his death; almost anybody who attended one of his lectures and scribbled some notes has tried to get them published, there are biographies and a volume of letters, CDs of impromtu drumming - the list goes on...I was put off reading this book for several years by the fact that ""all but one"" chapter had been published elsewhere; I was figuring I already owned most of its contents.That turned out to be wrong; although published, most of these essays, anecdotes and lectures had not seen the mainstream and fewer than 6 of them had I read before. Unfortunately some of the material covers territory that is widely available elsewhere and hence adds nothing in terms of ideas or anecdotes for the Feynman fan of long standing.The material that was entirely new to me was interesting and made the book worthwhile on its own, but a characteristic of this book is that Feynman's own voice comes through strongly, unfiltered through editors and that made even familiar stories interesting. Feynman's voice comes through because many of the pieces are transcriptions of talks or interviews he gave. The book also covers a wide range from the silly stories to the serious science to the discussions on the nature and ethics of science.Feynman fans should read it and people who want to know what the Feynman Fuss is about could do worse than start here."

I still really appreciated the writing and his insights into the physical universe. I feel like more teenagers should read Feynman - he believes so strongly in LIVING and THINKING and WORKING while still enjoying oneself that he could do so much good for that age bracket. Also, as an aside - can you even imagine the conversations between this guy and Neil Degrasse Tyson? CAN YOU. "

He is also an interesting and irreverent personality. Reading him is refreshing and his mercurial skepticism is and down to earth style make him fun to read. He covers personal anecdotes like safecracking at Los Alamos, to his report on the space shuttle and some interesting science talks two of which for saw miniturization as the path forward for computers and see a future in what is called nanotechnology today. Definitely fun to read this down to earth genius."
10,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Brilliance and charm: Feynman as a teacherI very much enjoyed this entertaining and delightful collection of lectures, talks and essays by the world-renown and sorely missed Professor Feynman, Nobel Prize winning physicist, idiosyncratic genius and one of the great men of the twentieth century.I particularly enjoyed the subtle yet unmistakable way he scolded the people at NASA for putting their political butts before the safety of the space program they were managing in his famous ""Minority Report to the Space Shuttle Challenger Inquiry."" But the chapter that really sold me on Richard P. Feynman, boy wonder grown up, was ""It's as Simple as One, Two, Three"" in which he explores the ability to do two things at once through an experiment with counting. Such a delight he took in learning as a kid from his friend Bernie that we sometimes think in pictures and not in words. And then the further delight he took in learning that some people count with their inner voice (himself), and others (his friend John Tukey) count by visualization. I was also loved the chapter, ""What is Science?"", a talk to science teachers in which Feynman demonstrates that the real difference between science and other ways of ""knowing"" (e.g., religion) is the ability to doubt. In science we learn, as Feynman said he himself learned, to live with doubt. But in the religious way of ""knowing"" doubt is intolerable. Feynman gives an evolutionary illustration of why doubt is essential. He begins with the ""intelligent"" animals ""which can learn something from experience (like cats)."" At this stage, he says, each animal learned ""from its own experience."" Then came some animals that could learn more rapidly and from the experience of others by watching. Then came something ""completely new...things could be learned by one animal, passed on to another, and another, fast enough that...[the knowledge:] was not lost to the race...,"" and could be passed on to a new generation.Now, let's stop for a moment. What a great teacher does--and here and elsewhere Feynman proves himself to be a great teacher (although he said he doubted that!)--is to guide the student just enough so that the student arrives at or anticipates the point of the lesson before the teacher gets there. What is the punch line of this lesson for the science teachers? Namely this: with the passing of knowledge from one generation to the next it became also possible to pass on false knowledge or ""mistaken ideas."" Feynman calls this a ""disease.""""Then a way of avoiding the disease was discovered. This is to doubt that what is being passed from the past is in fact true, and to try to find out ab initio, again from experience, what the situation is, rather than trusting the experience of the past...""In other words, don't blindly accept the word of authority. Test it for yourself! And this is what science does. It tests and it tests again, and it doubts and it doubts--always. I loved this because one of my dictums is ""always guide the experts""--the lawyer, the doctor, the insurance adjustor, et al. Always guide them because, although they are the experts, you're the one who really cares. To this I can now add that you should also doubt the experts because even though they are experts they can be wrong. And, as Feynman showed in his report on the Challenge disaster, they can be wrong for reasons that have nothing to do with their expertise.I also liked the commencement address he gave at Caltech on ""Cargo Cult Science...and How to Not Fool Yourself."" We fool ourselves a lot. The managers at NASA fooled themselves; what's their names of cold fusion delusion fame fooled themselves. Feynman has noted that he has fooled himself. Science, he avers, is a tool to help us to not fool ourselves. He is profoundly right. Without science we would go on fooling ourselves with all sorts of mumbo-jumbo, ""revealed"" religiosity and scientific-seeming stuff such as Rhine's ESP experiments some years ago at Duke, the entire litany of New Age pseudobabblese, and--yes!--such stuff as the amazing Cargo Cult Science in which some Pacific Islanders, in an attempt to attract the big birds of the sky with their cargoes of goodies, built ""nests,"" that is, landing fields with empty cargo boxes, and faux towers, etc. in the hope that the planes flying overhead would see them and land on their island. Feynman has taken this as an example of pseudoscience, that is, behavior in the form of science without the substance of science, without the ""integrity"" of science.The integrity of science, Feynman advised the graduates, demands that all the information about the experiment be given, even detrimental facts. Feynman contrasts this idea with that of advertizing in which only that which makes the product look good is given.When reading this book it helps to imagine that one is listening to Feynman speak. The text includes repetitions and the omissions which he no doubt conveyed with his voice, expression or gesture. When one reads him this way, some of Feynman's endearing charm and the gentle, self-effacing humor for which he is famous comes through. Here's a joke from pages 206-207: He is at Esalen in a hot bath with another man and a girl. The man begins to massage the girl's foot. He feels something in her big toe. He asks his instructor, ""Is that the pituitary?"" The girl says, ""No, that's not the way it feels."" Feynman injects, ""You're a hell of a long way from the pituitary, man."" And they both look at him. ""I had blown my cover, you see--and she said, It's reflexology. So I closed my eyes and appeared to be meditating."" Yes, Feynman is a long way from reflexology. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"

It's not as biographical as Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!: Adventures of a Curious Character or as technical as Six Easy Pieces: Essentials of Physics By Its Most Brilliant Teacher, and I think this would be a good place to start for anyone interested in learning about this fascinating man. This collection highlights throughout Feynman's deeply-held belief that doubt should be at the heart of good science. It also reveals his quirky, inquisitive character--I particularly love his explanation of how he learned to pick combination locks. For further reading, I also recommend Tuva or Bust!: Richard Feynman's Last Journey, which is funny and sad at the same time.The Pleasure of Finding Things Out was compiled nearly twenty years ago, and part of the charm is seeing which of Feynman's predictions came true, and where science has gone since the late twentieth century. Overall, though, I like seeing how Feynman thought--and doing a little check to see how well my understanding of science holds up."
12,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28112297-nico-scagliarini,3,"I have always been wary of scientists and scientific literature, because being apparently the ""artsy"" type I have been struggling with hard sciences my whole life: I always found them fascinating and scary at the same time and I only managed to make peace with Mathematics a few years ago. Never with Physics or Chemistry, and I always thought people who do them for a living were some kind of aliens. And they are (and so one more fond of science might say about artists), but after reading this book I can say that Feynman's way of thinking is simply brilliant, revolutionary and unique. It does not relate pretty much to anything else but his curiosity for what he calls ""the wonders of the world"", therefore in its uniqueness it's also not too far away from the artist's point of view. Feynman looked for answers he was aware he might not find, he was also aware of his potential and one might not agree with some of his ideas about gender equality (women do not strike him as smart creatures), religion (he does believe in God, despite not in the traditional/christian way) and morals (he kept on working on the development of the atomic bomb after Nazis had long gone) but there is no denying that trying to see the world through his eyes is enlightening. Some parts of the book are very technical and especially towards the end his thoughts and his way of expressing them are repeated in an almost redundant way, but this can easily be forgiven considering that the book it was not written by him but is a collection of transcripts of his speech and interviews."

There is a marked difference in the way people talk about something when they enjoy doing the thing and are good at it than when they don't enjoy it very much. That is very noticeable in this book. Feynman has a way of making his sense of wonder and the hunger of understanding things very contagious. The biggest takeaway that a person not involved in the sciences can get from this book is a solid understanding of what is and what is not science.What makes the book a bit difficult to read is that the book is almost a direct transcription of his speeches - which means the prose is less than exemplary.. Feynman's rambling style of speaking, with omissions and repetitions here and there do not make for an easy reading experience."

Among all other physicist Feynman was the one most distinctively standing out as he was the one who could do the best job of familiarizing the layman with the ways of nature and things hard to grasp intuitively. I also like Sagan, but I found him more like inspirational guy, Feynman was one with magnificent explanations. A lot of that stuff can be found on youtube, but maybe the most precious fruits of his work I found in Six Easy Pieces: Essentials of Physics By Its Most Brilliant Teacher and Six Not-So-Easy Pieces: Einstein's Relativity, Symmetry, and Space-Time. For anyone wanting to get better understanding of physics and acquiring basics those are invaluable-do-not-miss. This book, although not bad, is not what you would want to get out of him. It will offer you glance at his personality, life and way of thinking but Feynman’s real treasure is in him talking physics. This one can be viewed as desert after getting main dish. Nevertheless I liked it, because it is impossible not to like his genius and personality. Once again he motivated me to go and dive deeper in wonders of universe."

I had some expectations based on some of the stories I heard and his general fame, but the actual Feynman turned to be much deeper and interesting than just those glimpses in popular myths.The Pleasure of Finding Things Out is going to give you just that. Through the speeches and essays in this book you will see the workings of an extraordinary mind and learn much about the process of science and its place in our world. You will witness historic events, such as the construction of the first atom bomb, meet famous physicists, such as Einstein, Fermi, Bohr, and others, and hear ideas which kickstarted whole fields of science, such as nanotechnology and parallel computing. And as a side effect, you'll find out one way to raise your kid to be a scientist, and learn a bit about the art of safecracking.All in all, this was a truly inspirational read, and I can't recommend it enough."

There is some overlap in the stories between these two works (and apparently in his other more famous work Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!). I continue to enjoy the perspective that Feynman brings to life. He wants to better understand the world and enjoys solving problems, getting a ""kick out of the discovery"" of a solution that others can use. Feynman embraces doubt/uncertainty as the basis for understanding the world. Because without it we don't ask questions and thus leave no room for progress or learning. science is not finding out the truth... but that this or [that] is more or less likely ... to different degrees of certaintyFeynman's epistemology is rooted in the idea: we can't know anything with certainty. He goes so far as to answer the question ""what is science"" with doubt. A doubt that must include the theories that scientists advocate.science is the belief in the ignorance of expertsThis uncertainty is part of his idea of ""scientific morality"". A view in which ideas/beliefs are evaluated, evidence is examined, and findings are presented with integrity. This integrity requires including known problems and challenges to the theory/idea being advocated for. This scientific morality is contrasted with the untested/unproven ideas of pseudoscience, the propoganda of advertising and politics, and with ""religion"" which values absolute certainty. The first principle is that you must not fool yourself — and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After you’ve not fooled yourself, it’s easy not to fool other scientists. You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that.The stories about his experiences at Los Alamos working on the atomic bomb was fascinating. In this part of the book, we see Feynman's approach to wrestling with ideas. I'm dumb about one thing. I never knew who I was talking to. I was always worried about the physics. If the idea looked lousy, I said it looked lousy. If the ideas looked good, I said it looked good. Simple proposition. I've always lived that way.His willingness to approach ideas in this way was appreciated by Niels Bohr. when I hear about physics, I just think about physics, and I don’t know who I’m talking to, so I say dopey things like “no, no, you’re wrong,” or “you’re crazy.” But it turned out that’s exactly what [Bohr] needed. ... [Feynman] is the only guy who's not afraid of me and will say when I've got a crazy idea. So next time we need to discuss ideas we [need to] get that guy first This ""scientific morality"" (which is really an approach that values philosophical integrity and critical thinking) is brought out further when Feynman urges the importance of being ""less polite"" in discussing opposing views. By engaging in discussion we have to defend our views. And when we are defending our views it requires learning more about the views that one disagrees with. Further, discussions about different ideas should help us avoid cognitive dissonance, requiring us to evaluate the potentially competing ideas we might hold together as true. I believe we should demand that people try in their own minds to obtain for themselves a more consistent picture of their own world. That they not permit themselves the luxury of ... never trying to compare the two points of view because we have learned that by trying to put the points of view that we have in our head together and comparing one to the other we make some progress in our understanding...And while he doesn't seem to have much room for religion, in part due to his epistemology, he offers the following:I do not believe that science can disprove the existence of God; I think that is impossible. And if it is impossible, is not a belief in science and in a God — an ordinary God of religion — a consistent possibility? Yes, it is consistent. Feynman sees the conflict between science and religion at the level of metaphysics. Why? Because they can arrive at different answers to the same questions. However, he argues that science and the morality of religion can coexist. This is because science can't answer moral questions like ""should I do this?"" Science can only say what will happen if you do it.science can be defined as a method for, and a body of information obtained by, trying to answer only questions which can be put into the form: If I do this, what will happen"

Feynman's. If you have read his autobiography ""Surely You Are Joking, Mr. Feynman"", you'll be familiar with his curiosity and playful characters, cracking safes, playing pranks on colleagues, and observing his surrounding no matter how mad he might appear to other people. ""I'm not responsible for what other people think I am able to do,"" he said, ""I don't have to be good because people think I'm going to be good.""However, I personally have some problems with this book. Despite his enthusiasm in some of the chapters in the book, quite a number of technical issues are beyond my ability to comprehend. Those lectures were delivered to audience that had medium to high scientific literacy, which is why an ordinary reader like me found it very challenging to digest those ideas. I've noticed three important, but complicated speeches on three different special occasions: first is the investigation on Challenger Space Shuttle disaster, the moment that haunted NASA as well as forced them to be more careful in their future missions; second is nanotechnology, which Feynman himself was one of the pioneers; and third, the speech related to quantum electrodynamic, the subject that won him a Nobel Prize. Heaven knows how much I want to understand the science behind those speeches!In spite of those technical stuffs, readers could learn a great deal about his way of learning science, his standpoint on the relationship between science and religions, etc. Feynman repeatedly reminisced his father involvement in his early scientific experience. Although not being a scientist himself, Feynman's father was eager to show his son how to observe, question, and breaking up the knowledge of their surroundings into comprehensible information.I love his stand on science. ""The first way in which science is of value is familiar to everyone,"" he reasoned, ""It is that scientific knowledge enables us to do all kinds of things and to make all kinds of things. Of course if we make good things, it is not only to the credit of science; it is also to the credit of the moral choice which led us to good work. Scientific knowledge is an enabling power to do either good or bad–but it does not carry instructions on how to use it. Such power has evident value–even though the power may be negated by what one does."""
28,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1213820-chad,3,"I really enjoyed reading my first book by Richard Feynman. The only problem is, this isn't really a book by Richard Feynman. It's a collection of some of his speeches, along with (what has to be only a portion? of) his Minority Report on the Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster. Feynman is brilliant and has a quirky sense of humor and playfulness, and that comes out in his speeches. But it felt like some of the rigor of his scientific prowess was missing, simply because the format of a speech is so different from the format of a book. That said, I wouldn't recommend you specifically avoid this book because of that, but if you are going to read it, you should go into it knowing that its feel tends toward the incohesive and the extemporaneous rather than the methodical and structured. This is a great way to get a feel for his personality, though, which you probably wouldn't get with a normal book. So if you read it, plan on picking it up here and there and diving into a chapter at a time. It's enjoyable.I especially liked reading about his perspectives on what science is, and how he was introduced to the concept of science as a child. He praises his father for asking him questions, and then, no matter the answer that Richard gave back, examining through observation and comparing to Richard's hypothesis. He talks about his ability to accept the fact that he might not know something, and how that wasn't just ""not bad,"" but rather it was useful as a way to approach science without preconceived ideas of the results. Maybe that was just something that felt especially attractive to me because of where I am in my life right now, but it really impressed me that he has lived most of his life that way."

I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of certainty about different things, but I’m not absolutely sure of anything and there are many things I don’t know anything about…This is a collection of “the best short works of Richard P. Feynman”. As such, if you’ve read Feynman’s two biographical works, a couple of the chapters there are reproduced here, and many of the stories from there are told in different form here. I recognized quite a bit from the other two books.It also reprints an interview he did with Omni that I may well have read at the time, but don’t remember anymore. I don’t remember when I started to read Omni, and I don’t know where, if they still exist, my copies are.And there are several pieces I’ve not read at all before. If you’re a fan of Feynman’s writings, you’ll probably find this a rewarding read, even if you skip over parts. If you haven’t read Feynman yet, this is a great place to start. It covers a wide variety of topics, showcases his unique humor, much of it scientifically self-deprecating, and especially focuses on the scientific viewpoint, of the necessity of doubt so that you don’t end up fooling yourself, “because you are the easiest person to fool.”That is essential to progress, both scientific and social."
30,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77291875-ramu-vairavan,4,"This is a fine collection of Feynman's lectures, interviews and writing that introduces us to the man, scientist and Nobel laureate. Through his stories, Feynman paints an enigmatic character out of his father that rivals his own. And so we really get to meet two interesting people.A few things I gathered from this collection: Feynman is all about ideas. He plays with them like a child plays with toys. His imagination is vast, he dreamed up advancements in nanotechnology decades before they were made. He's very gutsy too, not afraid to ask questions. He's a serial fun-seeker, and he saw much pleasure in figuring things out. This is evident in his little adventures and funny anecdotes, of which I found his lock picking exploits at Los Alamos and his story about turning himself into a lab rat in a counting experiment memorable.One grudge I have is that brilliant people often don't talk enough to share their thoughts with us while others talk too much without being asked. Feynman distinguished himself as being both brilliant and vocal. His take on scientific matters was fresh in his day and is still so.Would recommend this book to folks who like getting to know other curious folks, Feynman definitely was one. It may get a little repetitive as Feynman rehashes stories at different occasions, but there's still good material in there - a good mix of technical and non-technical pieces from a range of topics/settings."

This compilation of talks, interviews, and lectures throw light on Feynman's work, ideas, relationships, and philosophy. The essay 'The Pleasure of Finding Things Out' shows the inception of Feynman's disposition to science and the didactic relationship with his father, while 'Los Alamos from Below' shows his playful relationship with his wife, and how he constantly tries to push boundaries. 'It's as simple as One, Two, Three' shows his curious and restless nature, his love for experimenting absurdities, and his need for proving or disproving things. Many of the more scientific essays involve his ideas and thoughts on computing machines, improving efficiencies, and trying to constantly challenge science.The essays I enjoyed the most had more philosophical undertones and covered the topics of religion, pseudoscience, the value and role of science. His approach to the untruths and the half-truths is empathetic, and he strongly encourages deeper exploration and uprooting rather than dismissing them on the face of it. His attitude to the unknown is very easy on the conscience, and seems to be what keeps him going actively.A few essays have redundant points and incidents, but as an admirer of the queer and wise Feynman, it was my pleasure to indulge in the repeats."

33,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43687-elena,4,"Like my affinity for Harold Bloom, Richard Feynman can do no wrong in my book. He was a man that thought outside the box, and was ahead beyond the technology of his time. However, what left the most lasting impression in this book is when Feynman turns into a bit of a philosopher and it made me think for days.Feynman discusses the Heritages of Western Civilization:Western civilization, it seems to me, stands by two great heritages. One is the scientifice spirit of adventure- the adventure into the unknown, an unknown which must be recognized as being unknown in order to be explored; the demand that the unanswerable mysteries of the universe remain unanswered; the attitude that all is uncertain; to summarize it-the humility of the intellect. The other great heritage is Christian ethics- the basis of action on love, the brotherhood of all men, the value of the individual- the humility of the spirit. How can we draw inspiration to support these two pillars of Western civilization so that they may stand together in full vigor, mutually unafraid? Is this not the central problem our time?It is this question that has left me after reading all of his lectures. "

That book was deep, thoughtful, inspirational.This book isn't bad, definitely, but the format is slightly different. Because the book consists of a set of interviews, the narration is not that smooth, different ""chapters"" has similar ideas just because each chapter is just a speech that Mr Faynman gave at some time. And of course, they won't be that deep either.I would say that if you didn't read ""You're Joking"", read it. If you'll like it (and you definitely will) you can read this book next year, just to remind yourself about one of the greatest minds of the century."
36,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126262-brooke,4,"Feynman has a wonderfully readable voice. 90% of this wasn't too over-my-head technical, the pieces selected for this collection were mostly Feynman musing about things or sharing stories. His enthusiasm for physics and discovery reminded me of Carl Sagan's similar enthusiasm that comes through in his books. I have to wonder why none of my science and math classes in school did anything to exposure us to this enthusiasm. People really, really like science and math! Who knew? None of my teachers, apparently."

This collection of pieces is telling of Feynman's unmistakable character of no nonsense, and therefore meaningful insight into concepts of science, and of science and its relationship with factions of life, including a great postulation on the meaning of life. His ideas are refreshingly logical, comically anecdotal, and are articulated in a pleasing conversational tone which articulates concepts so fluidly. I found that Feynman actually indirectly offers a great way to approach life and its challenges, one parallel to the logic he offers."

This subtle change is of utmost importance and represents the difference between religion and science. Absolute certainty doesn't exists in true scientists even the religious ones.Facts of science also challenge religious vlaims.Morality without religion.Atheism and communism. In communism all the answers (political and moral) are provided without explanation or doubt. This is the antithesis of science. Democracy is closer to science with its discussion and ability for modification.Science doesn't impact the ethical aspect of religion [or life].There is a conflic in fact and in spirit between science and religion when it comes to the metaphysical claims of religion [he means the factualy claims of religion and the certainty of it vs the uncertainty of science].Moral questions outside of the scope of science.

It's not a book that will teach you about relativity or quantum mechanics or any other area of physics or science. If you're going in expecting a bunch of explanations about how the world works - this ain't that book.What, then, is the point of reading this book, titled ""The Pleasure of Finding Things Out"", if it doesn't tell you any of the fun stuff?You see, we spend all these years in school ""learning"" science. We call ourselves scientific and all, but no - we ARE NOT. All we do is take the works of the previous scientists for granted, as long as they don't directly contradict our own beliefs and prejudices. But science isn't about blind belief. It's about constantly doubting your understanding of nature. In fact that's what experimental science is all about - finding data that our theories can't explain, leading to better theories. We tend to think of science as ""the subject that gives you all the answers"". No, that's not science. That's never science. Science is about constant questioning of your previous assumptions.Feynman puts it this way: ""Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts."" But that's not all. If you just keep on believing that the experts are wrong - that ain't science either. You have to TEST your (and the experts') beliefs to call your opinion scientific. And that testing too has to be rigorous, eliminating biases, minimizing false positives and all that. We have a tendency of calling everything ""scientific"" nowadays, because that gives things a humongous shield of credibility, though a major portion of those are, in reality, pseudoscience. They tell you ""this is a scientifically proven way of teaching best"" ""this is a scientifically proven way of pooping"" or stuff like that, but most of those are poorly experimented - people just believe those are true with little asking for evidence. This book serves as a guide for living in this world, for understanding why ""unscientific"" isn't always bad. This teaches you the REAL essence of the scientific method - which probably was never taught to you in school. A must read for any man wishing to live in this era of science where distinguishing between real science and pseudoscience has become tougher than ever for the lay people."

He has a very interesting perspective on the world, really seeking to understand why things work rather than just knowing names for certain phenomena. He also really emphasizes the importance of doubt and skepticism in both science and life. Today this is extra important; not many people understand this. Absolutes, unless they are tautologies, are probably false. This is most apparent in the fields of politics and religion (and scarily, one side of the former is becoming more and more like the later). Anyways, this was an interesting read, and you can split it up, as the chapters read just the same stand alone. A couple of the parts made me do a double take, as they were tinged with the sexism of the day. But overall, a good insight into this genius’s mind. "

Keeping that in mind, the net content of this book is pretty good and helps you learn more about the technical bits and about Feynman's approach to things. If you've read the other 2 books focused on stories by Feynman, this book can be skimmed."

61,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7231171-ray-norris,4,"I learnt my physics at the feet of Feynman. Metaphorically speaking. As a student of theoretical physics at Cambridge in the 1970's, I spent dreary days in stuffy lecture-halls listening to boring old farts droning on about Wronskians and Greens Functions (ugh!). But then I'd come home and open my copy of the Feynman Lectures on Physics, whose pages brimmed with inspirational tales of quantum mechanics, and quirky ways of looking at the physical world. Feynman made physics fun, and gave me my first real understanding of physics. How lucky were those undergraduates who sat at his feet at Caltech! But, oddly, those Caltech undergraduates taught by Feynman didn't get particularly good grades, and not many continued as physicists. I later found out that, while many of my generation of physicists were driven and inspired by Feynman, the Feynman Lectures were inspirational only to those who had already learnt the basics of physics cooped up in stuffy lecture rooms listening to aforesaid boring old farts. If the Feynman lectures were your only source of physics instruction, then you were lost when an exam question asked you to calculate a Wronskian. All of which is a very long-winded introduction to the disappointment I felt when this book showed me that my hero had feet of clay. For example (p.178) he cites the case of a first-grade science book which showed pictures of a clockwork dog and asked the question “What makes it move?"", hoping the student would answer ""Energy"". ""Wrong!"" thunders Feynman. Energy is merely a label for a very subtle concept! If your answer is ""energy"" then you learned nothing except the definition of the word! Ummm... I hate to question my hero, but isn't the point not to elicit a one-word answer, but to introduce the student to the subtle concept of energy? A good teacher would then use that one-word answer to discuss how energy moves between the chemical energy of the person using the toy, the potential energy stored in the clockwork, and the kinetic energy as it moves. The teacher can then introduce the Law of Conservation of Energy - itself an amazing symmetry of our Universe. But that discussion is much harder if you don’t have the label to start with. And the connection with the Feynman Lectures became obvious: if you've already learnt the label, then Feynman’s discussion becomes inspirational and illuminating. But don't try to introduce these subtle concepts to the first-grade student before they've even found a name for the concept.Of course, this book presents entertaining tales of the genius mind using simple approaches and clear thinking to hack through the Byzantine complexities of particle physics and exploding Space Shuttles. But you also meet a grumpy old man discussing topics (e.g. religion or philosophy) where he has no special insight, and sounding a bit naive compared to say, Dawkins or Kuhn. Perhaps such discussions are best left unpublished. On the other hand, having feet of clay is perhaps the most human of attributes, and Feynman was, above all, human. Maybe it’s my own fault for keeping him on a pedestal for so long and failing to recognise that he, more than anyone else, earned the right to become a grumpy old man."
62,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5566779-kara-clevinger,5,"“Of all its many values, the greatest must be the freedom to doubt.”I wasn’t particularly excited to read the Best Short Works of Richard P. Feynman because, even though I was told that Feynman makes science accessible to non-sciencey brains, I was convinced that nothing scientific could possibly makes sense to my utterly unscientific mind. A wonderful surprise awaited me. This collection of mostly speeches from the mid-twentieth century ponders the value of science in modern society and philosophizes integrity in scientific work.As a literary scholar, a born and bred reader and writer, and a diehard humanities advocate, I’ve viewed science as the enemy. I adore science fiction, but not science. So much so that I’ve never even considered the beauty of seeing the world through a scientific lens or using the scientific method as a foundational philosophy for human progress and thinking. Feynman has transformed me. Repeatedly, he tells his audience that doubt is what modern science is built upon (tracing it back to Galileo’s assault upon the beliefs of the Church and the subsequent birth of the scientific method) and doubt is freedom. If we begin to take anything as authority—results, religion, government, etc.—then we have given up our freedom. And he is not afraid to challenge authority: he went up against NASA in his report on the Challenger explosion, which he attributed to the organization’s irresponsible dismissal of engineers’ concerns that the shuttle should not launch in cold conditions. Feynman in this instance and in his commencement address to Caltech graduates insists on honesty in scientific work—that scientists should not be shy to publish failures because there is as much progress in failure as in “success.” Feynman is not results-oriented, and is, in fact, suspicious of results—his emphasis, his enjoyment, is in the process of researching, questioning, and discovering. He thinks the idea that science is cold is absurd. “With more knowledge comes deeper, more wonderful mystery,” he muses, “luring one on to penetrate deeper still. Never concerned that the answer may prove disappointing, but with pleasure and confidence we turn over each new stone to find unimagined strangeness leading on to more wonderful questions and mysteries—certainly a grand adventure!”He states that in science there is no absolute truth, there are only varying degrees of certainty, and I love this approach as a way of looking at the world, because isn’t that what we want?—to always question, never assume. In “The Value of Science,” Feynman tosses out the idea that scientists are searching for the origin of life or the meaning of it all and insists that the pleasure is in the unknown, in there always being new things to find out. To know the mystery of existence would be another kind of loss of freedom—our freedom to question and explore and learn and grow.Feynman’s writing is clear, logical, and eloquent, his ideas beautiful, gripping, and challenging."

(The NASA officials probably thought he would just be some academic who would serve as a useful tool to give the public reassurance/confidence, but were they ever wrong about his thorough nature to anything he undertakes..) Amusing aspect to the 1965 Japan lecture was the Q&A where one of the scientists asked him how you could input information into computers as they get increasingly tiny and (apologies for the metaphor/cliche) apparently not seeing the big picture on how the inputs would get rather standardized and the evolution to complex computer programs/operating systems that would be doing the computations. (As part of Feynman's response was about how the computers wouldn't be used for simple computations, I suspect Feynman kept an open mind about the future.) In fairness to those ""shortsighted"" scientists, there obviously weren't keyboards, computer mice, or touchscreens back then. Maybe the most intriguing part of the lecture was how a lot of those concepts are still taught in much more depth at the junior/senior undergrad level at universities like Stanford.There was some overlap in the material about his Los Alamos years and that mentioned in James Gleick's biography of Feynman, but the distinction here was they were almost entirely Feynman's words rather than Gleick's attempts at paraphrasing.Other interesting snippets I grabbed:Criticism of being too concerned with the use of the idea, rather than the idea itself.Importance of recognizing ignorance and leaving room for doubt.""I don't believe in the idea that there are a few peculiar people understanding math and the rest of the world is normal. Math is a human discovery and it's no more complicated than humans can understand. I had a calculus book once that said 'What one fool can do, another can.'""

64,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6376052-lois-keller,3,"This book was a unique one for sure. If you enjoy watching the ""Big Bang Theory"", have a group of sciencey friends, or you have some interest in learning about the life of Richard Feynman, then this would be a good book for you to read.  This book is lighthearted and straightforward to read, comparable to listening to one of your grandparents telling stories. However, depending on your nature, you may find this book to be more of a rollercoaster ride. I would be laughing jovially on one page, and then fuming at the next page. For example, this book actually gives TERRIFIC insight into the plight of female scientists, especially in the 1960s. It's subtle, you'll have to look for it. However, I think an analysis of Feynman's portrayal and opinion of women would merit a five star book if done properly. For instance, one thing I was irked by was Feynman's astonishment at the fact that women could comprehend math. He goes on for several pages about how he had always thought that women could only comprehend simple household tasks, but he grants them some ""potential"" after overhearing two girls at Cornell talk about knitting socks. This was not early in his career - this was when he was teaching at Cornell that he thought this. How many female students had he had and thought the same thing - ""oh, yeah they scored well on that test, but it's only because they can memorize things. Now Johnny, he's a bright one..."". The sad part is that this thinking has not been vanquished from the scientific community, and Feynman at least is arrogant enough to vocalize his opinions. The great irony in all of this is that Feynman's sister was a well respected astrophysicist, but clearly he didn't think she could properly understand math either.There are many deprecative motifs similar to the one above that course this book. It took a lot of the enjoyment out of what would have been a pretty decent book. Grade: B- for offense towards the reader and lack of coherency and depth. A good afternoon light read for those who seek a few chuckles."
65,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9914220-david,5,"Here is a collection of interviews, lectures and talks over a thirty year period that gives some insight into the remarkable mind of RF. He has given a lot of thought to what constitutes science, and what is not science, and it takes some effort to recognize that he is talking about the difference between knowing the name that has been given to something and actually knowing something about the thing itself. This is a very philosophical question, but Feynman wasn't interested in philosophy. In fact, he comments at one point on Spinoza and how silly the man was to speculate on issues that men like Newton were actually investigating during the same time. Several of the talks involved what he called ""cargo cult science"", or what others might call sympathetic magic. Taking the forms and rituals of science and calling it science when it really is not science. By far, the most interesting presentation in the book was his famous talk entitled, ""There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom"" in which he explores what has eventually become the realm of nanotechnology. He uses some simple arithmetic to arrive at the conclusion that it would be possible with the technology of 1959 to inscribe the entire Encyclopedia Britannica on the head of a pin and be able to read it with existing electron microscopes. He goes on from there to explore these regions and begins to set the lower limits for the size of logic gates in a region where quantum phenomena would become involved--which is really the beginnings of quantum computing and the need for designing logic circuits so that they could operate in either direction without loss of information (specifically designing AND/NOR gates that could function equally in forward or reverse without loss of data) so that such machines could function and eventually solve problems. He also talks about other things in this brilliant article, and it got my head spinning in wonderful ways.These articles are a wonderful glimpse into one of the most brilliant scientific minds of the past century and well worth the time."
66,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30742175-gillen-brown,4,"Richard Feynman is someone who has been a great source of inspiration for me. His joy for science and almost childlike curiosity about the way nature works are nearly unmatched, and they come through clearly in this book. There are multiple passages about his desire to figure things out that I really admired. Feynman believed that the ability to doubt and be unsure was the most important attribute for a scientist, and one that society in general should imitate more. For someone who wants to be a scientist, or who just wants to think like one, this is a great book to read. Feynman's thoughts about what science should be are very evident throughout. That said, some parts of the book are much better than others. The sections on future computers and nanotechnology are somewhat technical and outdated. They are interesting in that Feynman's scientific creativity is evident, but at the same time they don't that add that much to the book. The book also loses its appeal when Feynman strayed from his scientific thoughts and into realms where he didn't have as much knowledge or experience. Feynman had a strong dislike for social sciences, even calling them pseudoscience, which I think is a bit harsh. His thoughts on philosophy were similar. Also, at one point he even expresses surprise that women had the capability to do algebra.The good parts of the book were fantastic, though, and some of the anecdotes are fascinating. Feynman's discussion of the beauty of the flower (which is the first thing in the book) was great, as were his stories from Los Alamos. I also enjoyed his stories about how his father raised him to think scientifically and be curious about everything he encountered. Some of the interviews with Feynman were also fun to read. The best passages were the ones where Feynman was discussing his curiosity and the joy he got from ""finding things out."" His outlook on life and science are really special."

This is the third book I've read by him and it's a collection of short works by him, various interviews and orations, all along the common theme of science and that awesome pleasure of finding things out! Feynman's early experiences molded and encouraged by his curiosity-driven father who passed on a similar inquisitive spirit to his precocious son are the best part of the book. There is a bittersweet passage where the bright student first discovers calculus in the public library and takes the questions back home to his dad only to discover his father's intellectual limitations. Feynman would, of course, go on to surpass his father by becoming a Nobel laureate and live out his life as a professor of theoretical physics. But those early years are frequently fondly remembered and his father's contribution acknowledged. The collection includes glimpses of Feynman's classic irreverence for authority and rules, his days spent working on the atomic bomb where he met Bohr and Fermi, his thoughts on what science is, and his idea that the thought processes that drive the scientific method and the ethics of religion are not incompatible at all. There is also an interlude where he speaks of his first wife, Arlene writing letters to him at Los Alamos that would get censored and his tongue-firmly-in-cheek descriptions of how he'd fight back. I miss Arlene from his other book of essays and it was a mention of her death, that reminded me of their deep love for each other. I love reading Feynman and I'm biased towards him so this book is thoroughly recommended. He'll always be the whiz kid with his maniacal grin and conga drums. And it'll always make me smile to read him."

I dreaded the dense topic of quantum electrodynamics. Feynman (1918-1988) won the Nobel Prize and this is a series of lectures and interviews he gave during the mid-20th century. It is kind of like reading Hugh Nibley’s transcribed lectures, with all the detours and inside jokes. But fascinating. “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.” Feynman is full of himself; I decided to forgive that. He helped build the atomic bomb, after all. “Science creates a power through its knowledge, a power to do things…There are no instructions along with the power and the questions of applying the science or not is essentially the problem of organizing the applications…” I know we are in an age of anti-science, which is a constant surprise and disappointment to me. I love science. I am not afraid of science. I enjoyed Feynman’s descriptions of meeting and working with some of the greatest scientists of our time, how they debated things and pushed each other to be better. He is a brilliant guy who said in the 1960s that someday computers would be tiny and hold more information than anyone could imagine. He is constantly, relentlessly curious about the natural world. I couldn’t help following his infinite trains of thought.

I had tried listening to one of his lectures, and though he was an engaging teacher, I was missing two things: a view of the blackboard he was writing on and any sort of understanding of what he was talking about.This is a series of short essays, speeches and interviews done by (or on) Feynmann. Some of the science of it was beyond me, but generally this was an interesting read. Feynmann was a character, and his talk on working on the Manhattan Project was actually quite funny. He becomes a safecracker, a building inspector and he and his wife befuddle the government censors.The real character revealed is that of Feynmann's father, Ivan. He instilled a curiosity and way of thinking logically that has carried with Feynmann, and enabled him to contemplate the deep mysteries of physics. Ivan Feynmann also instilled a distrust of authority which is plainly passed on. Ivan told his son that the only difference between a man people obey and the men obeying is ""epaulets"", meaning authority didn't count for much.Ivan Feynmann is felt many times in these pieces and I found his story as compelling as his son's. Brush past any difficult math you might encounter and there are a lot of powerful ideas in this book, some way ahead of their time."

His view of the world is unique and he surely had a lot to teach (even though he constantly says he doesn't). Most of his talks are really inspiring and motivational, while making you want to search deeper into subjects (he especially talks about the difference about knowing something and understanding something). He talks about science and religion, teaching and morals, his wonderful adventures in Los Alamos, the way his father taught him science, and the way he felt after the atomic bombs exploded in Japan, among other strange subjects as censoring and safe cracking.I surely recommend this book to others, for it reviews the basics of science and restores your faith in it :-) The only downside to the book is the editorial choices (the book is a collection of interviews, conferences, talks, articles, ...) because some just don't make sense. This is especially true in the beginning of the book, when in the same chapter you have what seems to be random paragraphs of information written down in an unorganized fashion.

Because we have learned that, by trying to put the points of view that we have in our head together and comparing them one to the other, we make some progress in understanding and appreciating where we are and what we are.

Everyone loves science's final product but failed to get involved in the whole process (which sometimes it's pretty much more rewarding than the final product itself).

Feynman's talks, from his work on the atomic bomb to his theory in electrodynamics, from his views in God and on the educational system, leave a clear evidence that we humans have a lot to discover about what makes the things around us, a lot to correct in our way of answering the questions our species formulates. Luckyly we have Richard Feynman himself as a teacher, who in turn had his father, a sales manager, to teach him to be curious, to rely on his own mind, to question things, to find them out. This book has been the one that's taken me the longest to finish reading, since it's the first of its kind for me, that is, about scientific discussion. It was indeed a challenge at parts, but a very rewarding one. I've never considered myself a scientific person, I'm more on the dogmatic side, nevertheless this read enriched my point of view on religion and taught me the advantages of having an objective perspective on matters, why we need to constantly update our way of getting answers and to never think there's absolutes.

Again, my only grumpiness is with his adamantly irrational atheism--he points out how rightly impossible it is for us to fully understand how the universe works and then uses that as a reason why God must NOT exist, which doesn't really strike me as scientifically rigorous for a guy who won the Nobel Prize. Reminds me of a Star Trek:TNG episode I saw recently where the Enterprise crew end up on a planet with rudimentary techonology, the inhabitants of which mistake the Captain for, you know, the BIG GUY. Crew members go on to point out to the silly rubes just how irrational it is to believe in an all-powerful being who conducts their lives. I think that the episode following that one was the one where Q appears and whisks the Enterprise off to be squashed by the Borg. Ah, I see--it's irrational to belive in an all-powerful being who cares about you, just not one who is abitrary and mean."

There is no doubt that this book is written for the general audience. However, there were a few places that it was difficult to follow some of his explanations and arguments. Having said this, still, when he is providing technicalities he simplifies the topics pretty successfully.A few chapter were especially quite interesting to read for me, such as the role of a scientist and also the role of religion along with science in the western civilizations. In general, besides a few technical details it is an easy read and in many ways, it is motivating and thought provoking.

Being pulled in and questioned of the code he was using to write his letters wife (a grocery list), and sneaking out the fence and confusing the guards when someone who had never left came waltzing up to come back. All the while picking locks to safes and great at being able to read a person.Second is his story about people on some island which the name escapes me. They built an airport out of sticks and torches lighting the way down the runway. After they had completed it they could not figure out for the life of them why none of the big metal birds would land there. They had no idea of why the planes landed, they just knew what the airports looked like.

At a time when the United States political landscape is populated with people who deny the findings of science and the value that those findings can bring to society, this book can offer some insight into the dangers that such attitudes hold. For me, Feynman is a model of how to approach mystery and applying the solutions of mystery to everyday life. His integrity, ingenuity, originality and humor are inspiring. He would have been one to say, ""Work the problem, have some fun with it, and save the drama for your mamma."" In a society influenced by ""reality"" TV and fake news, his is a sorely needed approach. "

Feynman should read this book you get many in sights in the manner he goes about a problem and his personal views. Generealy the stories that he tells in this book are entertaining and just fun to read about, a good example of this is the story of the safes. “So I close the door and then I sit down and I read a magazine, or do something. I average about 20 minutes of doing nothing, and then i’d open it, you see, well, I opened it right away to see that everything was alright and then sit there for 20 minutes to give myself a good reputation that it is wasn’t to easy there was no trick to it, not trick to it. And I would come out you know, sweating a bit, and say ‘It’s open. There you are’ ”(Los Alamo's from Below 95). That is a small section of the safe stories that are in the book and makes a lot more sense when you read the book, this small quote doesn’t really show great the stories are. Anyhow I recommend anybody ,like I said before, that is a fan of Richard P. Feynman should read this book."
81,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19672057-cade,3,"This book is a blatant attempt by the next generation to cash in on their father's name. ""The Best Short Works"" is code for a assorted mix of whatever transcribed speeches and interviews and maybe a couple essays they could scrape together to fill a book. Richard Feynman was a great scientist and a great character (i.e. entertaining), but he was not a great philosopher. Much of this book includes material where Feynman speculates on his worldview and philosophy of science. Much of this is repetitive and frankly not that compelling. Some of it deals with his speculation about future developments in computers and nanotechnology. While it is interesting to see that he was pretty insightful for his time, these speculations are completely obsolete.The one real gem of this book is the part where he remembers his time on the Manhattan Project. This part is interesting and entertaining because it shows Feynman as scientist and prankster which are the parts of his identity that made him famous."
82,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,3,"I've read a fair number of books about Richard Feynman and this one is unexceptional. The book consists of transcriptions from his appearances on TV, during lectures, and some letters produced by Richard Feynman during times where he's interfaced with the public or a larger audience. At all times, he's trying to cut down non-sense and bouy reason and does so with impressive intellect. Most of what's covered here will be covered with more context and background elsewhere but there is something charming to hearing Dick in his own words. A bit more information around each piece would have helped.I think he's at his best when he's a little angry. His attack on the lazy and on the impractical are the pieces I most enjoyed followed by him talking about the joys of science and the raw understanding it can bring.I wouldn't recommend this as one's first Feynman book. For that I'd recommend ""Surely You Must Be Joking, Mr. Feynman"" followed by ""Genius"". But if you've read everything else and simply want more, there is more here."
83,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59326858-tom-shannon-jr,4,"I listened to the audiobook. The reader did a great job. The material overlaps some with two other Feynman tomes (Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman and What Do You Care What Other People Think), which is a welcome refresher for me. His report to the space shuttle Challenger commission explains what went wrong. This book includes transcriptions of talks he gave to schoolteachers, academics, and professionals, and a few interviews. One chapter was over my head with its physics jargon, but the rest was very valuable food for thought. I never get tired of hearing his Los Alamos stories or his reasoning and skeptical thought. I should not have been surprised to hear him called the Father of Nanotechnology. The lecture that kicked it all off (""There is plenty of room at the bottom"") with his promise of two prizes of $1000 each, which he eventually paid on, is here. Don't be scared off if you're not a techie or math or science person, because Feynman is to be enjoyed for his badass attitude and good-natured spirit!"
84,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7358-jen,3,"I really enjoyed the plain old storytelling aspects of this book - especially the parts about Los Alamos. I got little out of the science lectures and interviews though, embarassingly. I haven't read other Feynman so don't know if this is standard or the leftovers that they tossed into this compendium because they weren't already published. The way I see it, I don't have enough of a background in, say, nanotechnology to listen to a lecture from 50 years ago and sort out what ideas were revolutionary, or ahead of his time, etc. I realized that when I latched onto a passage where he mentioned some current issues in biology and how physicists could help answer them by developing a better electron microscope...it was so interesting to think about what they didn't yet know then and were discovering (in biolgy) that I thought maybe someone with more background in physics would have the same reaction to the book as a whole. "
85,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8122302-neko,0,"Some of the content I recognized from Surely You're Joking Mr Feynman, but most of it were gathered articles, lectures and interviews from various other sources. In addition to the chapter on nanotechnology, I found the chapters at the end of the book the most interesting, where Feynman gives his views on teaching, religion, pseudoscience etc. While it is mentioned that he does not like philosophy, he kind of uses arguments derived from his work in science to formulate a way of looking at the world, which would not be too foreign in philosophical contexts. Personally, I prefer Feynman's talks about science-related topics rather than personal anecdotes with blurry grammar. Everything complex seems so exciting when he talks about it, like interest is all you need to learn it. Feynman was in many ways prescient, and it really confused me when he got surprised about the female mind capable of doing mathematics. Was this supposed to be a joke? hmm... "
86,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11941509-ken,5,"Richard P. Feynman is purported to be our current day Albert Einstein. This book is a collection of some short works he wrote and some speeches he made. Sometimes, I found the information he imparted to be very technical and difficult to follow, but I haven't studied theoretical physics, nor other disciplines he discussed. I did come away feeling that he enjoyed life and valued being uncertain.I enjoyed hearing about how he did some safe cracking while working at Los Alamos. It was interesting hearing about how he didn't soften his challenges to others' ideas, regardless of their overwhelming reputation in the science field, during his tenure working at Los Alamos and really at any time in his career. I enjoyed hearing his philosophy about if he should have contributed to creating atomic bombs, or not and I enjoyed hearing about his bucking the Shuttle Challenger catastrophe's review board. "
87,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5720805-tom-schulte,4,"This a joyful overview of Feynman interviews and talks with topics stretching from the beginning of his career (breaking into safes and avoiding fences at Los Alamos) on to the unwelcomed Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965, and in the 1980s his role on the Rogers Commission, the panel that investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. Talks on the field of computing, and introducing the concept of nanotechnology as well as the mysteries of teaches as the Richard Chace Tolman professor in theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology are all here.Feynman was a keen and exciting popularizer of physics through his lectures, and his distinctive joyous and confident voice comes through with the the narrator here. He was a noted prankster and I have read Feynman describes snowing people with fake Italian and, until Rio De Janeiro Carnival pros, enthusiastic if untutored bongos. This work claims him to truly have excelled at that percussion."
88,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6881385-nik,3,"I have respected and admired Richard Feynman since I first read ""Surely you're Joiking..."" some years ago, and there was a fair bit of overlap of all the ""classic Feynman"" anecdotes. Inevitably within the collection itself there are also things repeated, but this is not necessarily to the book's detriment.For myself, a non-scientist, the most meaningful chapter by far was chapter 6 ""The Value of Science."" Though Feynman's writing is sometimes a clumsy or tangential, this passage is the most eloquent and at times poetic in the collection. He thoroughly explores the value to society of both science and by extension scientific thinking. Though the whole book is readable for a layperson, that chapter steers especially clear of potentially eye-glazing scientific specifics. I could recommend reading solely this excerpt without fear that the reader would drastically miss out, but again, this is the second book on Feynman for me."

He’s the only guy who’s not afraid of me, and will say when I’ve got a crazy idea.

It really affirms a point that both Gleick and Krauss made about Feynman: he actively sought to architect and cultivate his own public persona, and reinforced it with his charismatic storytelling. To anyone who's interested in Feynman, I'd recommend Genius rather than this work, and supplement with this if you're curious for more. Still need to read Surely you're Joking, Mr. Feynman, the Six (not so) Easy Pieces, and the Feynman lectures. Almost certain I'm woefully unequipped to tackle that last, but we'll see."

In fact, the book bills itself as the best of his shorter works but some of the pieces were transcripts of interviews so they really weren't his works at all.As individual pieces they were fine but together reading them back to back they were disjointed. I'd say this book is fine for people who are going to read it piecemeal but all in a row it isn't that great."

It isn't a cohesive book because it's arbitrarily selected Feynman writings and speeches drawn from the span of his life. It's well worth reading, however, if you want to learn a bit more about him but, perhaps, aren't a fan of reading a full biography. "

176,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71924987-payel-kundu,2,"I adored Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and  What Do You Care What Other People Think? Those are actually two of my favorite books. Thus, I really expected to enjoy this book, and just did not enjoy it nearly as much as I expected to, for several reasons. First of all, many of the stories from the books I mentioned above are mentioned in this book, but not elaborated on. Thus you learn things like Feynman has a penchant for cracking safes and playing the bongos, without any of the rich and colorful story to accompany it. This book contains speeches made by Feynman primarily, rather than stories about his antics and character. I must say, reading about Feynman from an admiring friend of his is really different from hearing his speeches from the man himself. The speeches were often insightful, eloquent, and clearly made by an incredible scientist, but to read them end on end in book form is a little boring and redundant. Perhaps read one at a time, with a little spacing, that might make it better. That ends my minor objections to this book. I have two major objections. One is that Feynman is very dismissive and condescending to fields of study he viewed as unscientific, like the emerging field of Psychology. I understand it was in its young days and that the methods were not always rigorous, but Feynman's attitude struck me as one that would alienate someone in that field rather than inspire them to learn more about rigorous scientific practices. My second major objection is that some of the book was so breathtakingly sexist that I thought it was a joke. I'm quoting the most egregious example below in its entirety.  "" When I was at Cornell, I was rather fascinated by the student body, which seems to me was a dilute mixture of some sensible people in a big mass of dumb people studying home economics, etc., including lots of girls. I used to sit in the cafeteria with the students and eat and try to overhear their conversations and see if there was one intelligent word coming out. You can imagine my surprise when I discovered a tremendous thing, it seemed to me.I listened to a conversation between two girls, and one was explaining that if you want to make a straight line, you see, you go over a certain number to the right for each row you go up, that is, if you go over each time the same amount you go up a row, you make a straight line. A deep principle of analytic geometry! It went on. I was rather amazed. I didn't realize the female mind was capable of understanding analytic geometry.She went on and said, ""Suppose you have another line coming in from the other side and you want to figure out where they are going to intersect."" Suppose on one line you go over two to the right for every one you go up, and the other line goes over three to the right for every one it goes up, and they start twenty steps apart, etc.--I was flabbergasted. She figured out where the intersection was! It turned out that one girl was explaining to the other how to knit argyle socks.I, therefore, did learn a lesson: The female mind is capable of understanding analytic geometry. Those people who have for years been insisting (in the face of all obvious evidence to the contrary) that the male and female are equal and capable of rational thought may have something. The difficulty may just be that we have never yet discovered a way to communicate with the female mind. If it is done in the right way, you may be able to get something out of it. "" That last portion, ""you may be able to get something out of it"" was like a slap in the face to me as a female scientist. Given his relentless and admirable pursuit of good scientific principles and rationality it amazed me that his assumption was that the female mind was inherently less capable of grasping mathematical principles, without considering that it might be related to differential cultural expectations and upbringing. Perhaps saddest of all was that this attitude crept in when Feynman describes the different ways he has learned to read stories to his male and female children. Overall, having been such a fan of Feynman for years, I still remain one, but I'm deeply disappointed at the way one of my role models viewed females.  "
177,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2989615-lukasz-pruski,4,"""[...] a question requires doubt. People search for certainty. But there is no certainty. People are terrified - how can you live and not know? It is not odd at all. You only think you know [...] most of your actions are based on incomplete knowledge and you really don't know what it is all about, or what the purpose of the world is [...] It is possible to live and not know.""This overlong epigraph illustrates Richard P. Feynman's main thesis presented in The Pleasure of Finding Things Out (1999), a collection of informal writings by the famous physicist, a set that could be called ""the best short works of Feynman."" It includes his talks, official speeches and lectures, transcripts of TV programs, and even Feynman's ""minority report"" to the official Challenger disaster report. The Nobel Prize winner, a man universally acclaimed as a true genius, returns to his main thesis several times in this collection. His definition of a scientist is:  ""A scientist is never certain. [...] all our statements are approximate statements with different degrees of certainty; [...] when a statement is made, the question is not whether it is true or false but rather how likely it is to be true or false.""  The only statements which can be proven true or false are statements of mathematics, which is one of the reasons that mathematics is not a science. I wish Feynman's words were required reading in colleges, perhaps even in high schools.The author offers a sharp and convincing critique of pseudo-science where he uses examples of astrology and parapsychology, and returns to his famous ""Cargo Science"" case that originated from observations of tribal society's customs acquired after their interaction with technology beyond their grasp. Feynman also lambasts the practices of advertising industry and writes that commercials may constitute ""scientifically immoral description of the products."" I exclaimed ""Yes! How true!"" when I read the following fragment:  ""[...] we live in an unscientific age in which almost all the buffeting of communications and television words, books, and so on are unscientific.""  Feynman is lucky to have not lived long enough to witness the times of total misinformation that now exists thanks to the Internet. He would be horrified!Feynman writes about other important topics as well. The last piece in the set is entitled The Relation of Science and Religion, where the author distinguishes three main aspects of religion: metaphysical, ethical, and inspirational, and argues that there exists an incompatibility between religion and science in the first aspect, and that there may be conflicts in the domain of inspirational aspect. This is a fascinating discussion, and as a true scientist the author emphasizes that he is not completely sure of his statements. On a lighter note we have a long item where Feynman reminisces about his times on the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos. We read about hilarious pranks he pulled: safecracking, sneaking out of the tightly guarded compound, etc. The reader can find an extremely funny (and I mean it literally, ""extremely funny"") passage where the author is awed by the decision-making prowess of top-level military people: how they are able to decide in just five minutes on momentous issues about which they do not have the faintest idea!Four stars."
178,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54135119-bogdan-teodorescu,4,"Good read. Some Feynman words are always welcomed. Actually what this is, is a collection of essays he either wrote, or from speeches and interviews given on various occasions. I found ”Computing Machines in the Future” pretty interesting. In the same futuristic-feeling is the talk named ""There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom"". Also, in the book is presented Feynman's report on the Challenger disaster, which was nice to read. A few words about it, I found it to be a lot detailed than I thought, being insightful about the whole thing that was going at NASA in those days. Won't spoil the fun for you, but I must say that it was fascinatingly well documented. Finally, of particular pleasure to me were ""What is Science?"", ""The Smartest Man in the World"" and maybe ""The Relation of Science and Religion"". And, of course, ""It's as Simple as One, Two, Three"" was maybe the most funny essay, with lots of things to learn.Some ideas are repeated over the book, but it's interesting, because they are repeated in different ways. So it may be annoying at times, but fixes better what he wants to transmit, which is good. ""When a scientist doesn't know the answer to a problem, he is ignorant. When he has a hunch as to what the result is, he is uncertain. And when he is pretty darn sure of what the result is going to be, he is in some doubt.""""And that is what science is: the result of discovery that it is worthwhile rechecking by new direct experience, and not necessarily trusting the race experience from the past. I see it that way. That is my best definition""""Learn from science that you must doubt the experts. As a matter of fact, I can also define science another way: Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts.""“I think we should teach them [the people] wonders and that the purpose of knowledge is to appreciate wonders even more.”""As long as it looks like the way things are built is wheels within wheels, then you're looking for the innermost wheel - but it might not be that way, in which case you're looking for whatever the hell it is that you find""""So you temporarily prejudice or predispose yourself - but all the time, in the back of your mind, you're laughing. Forget what you hear about science without prejudice. Here, in an interview, talking about the Big Bang, I have no prejudices - but when I'm working, I have a lot of them.""""I've learned how to live without knowing. I don't have to be sure I'm succeeding, and as I said before about science, I think my life is fuller because I realize that I don't know what I'm doing.""Some funny thoughts: Feynman clearly didn't really believe in the power of women, not to say women in science. That can be seen on a number of occasions throughout the book.Another funny thought: The last essay of the book, the one on the relationship between science and religion, was kinda fun to read. Although Feynman definitely lacks knowledge in philosophy (and that can be seen easily), his logic is perfect. Some knowledge in the field would have been more useful, but still, he says some really nice stuff out there. One last quote, ok :)) On his choice of leaving Cornell University and joining Caltech: ""First of all, the weather is not good in Ithaca. Secondly, I kind of like going out to nightclubs and stuff like that"""
179,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/120501171-manasi-kulkarni,5,"This book is a collection of America’s finest and renowned theoretical physicist Richard P. Feynman’s lectures, interviews, talks and notes. It is easily possible to be misled into thinking that the book contains technical details; however it has been written with such grace and nuance so as to reach out to readers from all aspects of the society and not just physicists. A nobel prize winner in Physics, Feynman was extremely passionate about physics. His major contributions were in quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics.From a very young age, Feynman was inclined towards science; his father played a major role in shaping him. He always taught Richard to be curious, question the working of everything even if it has been accepted by the world. This curiosity paved the way for him to pursue theoretical physics. In one of the talks in Japan, forty years after the Nagasaki bombing where Feynman was a veteren of the Manhattan project (to be explained later), he talked about the power of gigantic computing machines and the future that beholds extensive use of such machines. Even in the 1980s, Feynman had thought about the benefits and hurdles of such huge computing power, and how it will catalyze Artificial Intelligence.Feynman was a part of the Manhattan project - responsible for creating the atomic bomb. During World War II, America was on the verge of losing. Even though Feynman knew the dangers and morality of creating a bomb, he knew if America doesn’t create one, Germany will (probably already had started creating one). This project was based in Los Alamos, New Mexico. During this project, Feynman got a chance to work with many great minds such as Robert Oppenheimer, John von Neumann and Neils Bohr among the many. During the working of this project, his wife was admitted to a hospital, as she was suffering from tuberculosis. However she died and Feynman had to continue working on the project. He is the only person to see the explosion during the test run without dark glasses. He hid himself behind the windshield of a truck to protect from the UV radiation. He also saw a purple after-image of the explosion. To keep himself amused at Los Alamos, Feynman studied safecracking and pranked his colleagues by opening their safes. He also talks about the contradictions between science and religion and how one cannot justify or exist with the other. He also talks about how people accept everything at face value, mostly because they don’t care about the scientific aspects. If people are presented with religious views, they will agree with the views, as religion doesn’t involve science. He also highlights an important aspect about scientists interacting with other scientists or laymen. Scientists should be careful while explaining certain things to laymen, without too much pride. Also, it is said that if you are able to explain things perfectly to laymen, you have understood the concepts. Another advice given by him is “Never say you will give a talk unless you know clearly what you’re going to talk about and more or less what you’re going to say.”"

What would come of it of value-of good? Now a question of the form: If I do this, what will happen? is strictly scientific. you still have to judge what happens-in a moral way."

Feynman is a funny, charismatic, and likable physicist. He has a fun way of describing his life and work, and his enthusiasm for learning and discovery is palpable. This collection of essays and interviews is a great ""Best of Feynman"" book, and I am glad I came across it and read it.There is some overlap among several of these chapters. I heard about ""cargo cult science"" and how he felt about helping develop nuclear weapons more than three times each, but the repetition was, in another sense, minimal. One interview may have emphasized cargo cult science while another chapter mentioned it only briefly, so it didn't feel like I was re-reading the same spiels over and over.What is unique in each chapter is fantastic. Reading about his coming to be a part of the Los Alamos research team is a fascinating treat. Hearing about his lock picking wiliness adds a funny layer to Feynman's already quirky personality. Seeing how frank he can be about some things, like his perceived value of social sciences, has given me some food for thought. It was fun to see him predict things in the realms of computer science and biology, and it was even more fun to think about how far we've come in so little time.Yet some of the larger issues Feynman talked about are still undoubtedly with us. The destructive tendencies of some humans, of pseudoscience, of people being cocksure about things they have no business being so certain of -- we still live in that world even with our modern genetics and handheld computers.Now it is time to find more Feynman books!"

Education, by him, was finding out how to find out. He personally had no scientific training or education, but he knew about science and what it was and what learning it was!This book is a collection of stories that Feynman has given or commented on over the years. It's a fascinating collection of knowledge and thoughts. I like the fact that it confirms my belief that science is not about knowledge, and doubt is an essential part of life. The problem with pseudoscience and fundamental religion is that they require certainty and they do not allow for ""I don't know"" or ""I have doubt, but let's see what there is and how reality works"". And the ""recognition"" really doesn't mean anything, the important thing is learning; it's answering questions.And his sequence on ""what use is it?"" really hit home with me, particularly his thoughts about the age of the universe and faraway stars that really don't affect us. These are things that my husband finds interesting, but I don't understand why he studies them. The answer is"" to find out! It's interesting!"" I don't agree that it's interesting for the most part, but ""to find out"" is, as Feynman points out, are perfectly legitimate answer!Some of his stories are well represented in the past (like the ""Cargo Cult"") but this makes a good compendium.a"

This is a collection of his writings, memoirs, lectures, and interviews and they draw a good picture of his life and work.I am now in many minds about the man and his life. He is part of inventing the worst weapon in human history as part of the Manhattan Project and that is not what I would appreciate in a scientist. On the other hand, he acknowledges that he should have re-examined his position on being part of it after Germany was defeated because his reason was that a nuclear bomb would have been worse in the hands of Hitler. He is a good scientist in his understanding and adherence to the scientific methods and the doubts that should be on the mind of every scientist but he is smugly dismissive of everything that is not physics or mathematics and has neither appreciation nor understanding of humanities. He has said several things that sounded and probably are incredibly misogynistic in the book and it shouldn't be good enough to say that he is a product of his time because he is supposed to be a genius and see a little further.In all cases, the book is entertaining and has many little funny anecdotes and tells part of the history of physics and life in the middle of the 20th century, certainly not a wasted time. "
184,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/757532-l-a-l,4,"An interesting complilation of some of Feynman's writings and talks. His passion for physics, and science in general, comes through. I found it refreshing to hear him be humble about his knowledge. A nobel prize winning physicist, part of the Manhatten Project at age 24, and he's so humble about it all. A true scientist.Although I admit that at times I didn't quite follow some of the physics concepts, I found the entire collection quite interesting. And a lack of physics knowledge does not diminish what you can get out of it. The physics is just part of who he was. The larger messages are about science and continuous learning and questioning. My favorite essays or chapters were 1, 3, 8, 9, and 10. In particular, I enjoyed hearing about his time on the Manhatten Project ion Los Alamos. I work for the DoD, and so to hear him talk about the bureaucracy of the Army, I complete got his frustration. And the whole trying to impose that bureaucracy, particularly the censorship bits, on scientists made me laugh out loud. A delightful collection that provides more insight into an incredible genius. Defintely worth the read or listen.And while the narrator, Sean Runnette, lacked Feynman's distinctive NY-Queens accent, he does a great job."
185,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63856135-alexis-voutouris,4,"The first thing that strikes the reader of this collection is its extremely informal style, which is partly due to the fact that it mostly consists of talks and interviews, and partly because of Feynman's self-admitted difficulty with language. You will either find this refreshing, as I did, or annoying;I would advice you to listen to Feynman on youtube for a while, and then keep the memory of his very lively way of speaking as you are reading. There is certainly a charm to this, though, as his disdain for empty words and phrases lets you right into his way of thinking.It is also safe to say that you will not be equally absorbed throughout. There are parts too technical for the non-experts, while in different excerpts you will find that a few stories are repeated. But it is not a long book, and you can always skip through a boring passage if no one is looking.What is beyond dispute is the man's genuine and innocent love of experiment and discovery, and of course how brilliant he was at it. The enthusiasm conveyed through the pages makes for a really effective work of popular science."

Scientific integrity means reporting, for an experiment, ""everything that you think might make it invalid-not only what you think is right about it: other causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you've thought of that you've eliminated by some other experiment, and how they worked."" That is, a full explanation of experimental ""successes"" and ""failures"" to better advance scientific understanding.There's so much Cargo Cult behavior in society today--the belief that saying something, with no real proof or explanation, makes it ""true"" seems rampant in politics, media, institutions. Anyway, the book is a very good read that is still relevant."

The editors could have done a better job.He was a great scientific mind with a clear understanding of what nature really is. He was funny, intelligent, modest and curious. This book has some good anecdotes, some funny ones, some are just fillers and some are really interesting. They way he talks about his father sometimes makes him even more interesting than Richard Feynman himself. Even though some chapters were not what I expected, it was a pleasure to read this book. To learn about the origins of nanotechnology and the future of computers, his work on Los Alamos with Oppenheimer, when he won the Nobel Prize, when he talks about pseudoscience and religion, about teaching science and even about his lock breaking hobby. He was a man that inspires to investigate, to learn, to find things out. "
188,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57473547-katie,3,"I have very polarizing feelings about this book. There were some paragraphs on science and technology that I read and reread because I loved his thought processes so much; however, his personal anecdotes were consistently appalling.For example: during the Manhattan Project, he strategically chose his dorm based on its location which was across from his female colleagues' dorm building. He was so pleased with himself for picking a room that could theoretically allow him to spy on the women he worked with while his wife was dying of TB in a near by city. He also threw her items on his dorm floor to make it look like two people were occupying the room so he could get away with being the only scientist without a roommate. Sure, it's clever but it's also inexcusably selfish and shouldn't be something worth admiring.The man was a brilliant and insightful scientist. Had this book kept to science it would deserve 5 stars."
189,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43864216-karen-grothe,4,"I was torn on how to rate this book. I enjoyed much of it, but Feynman's sexism comes out jarringly in a couple chapters. I enjoyed the following chapters: The Pleasure of Finding Things Out, Los Alamos From Below, and The Value of Science. I liked reading about how he learned to love science from his dad in chapter 8, What is Science?, but I found his one sexist, unnecessary comment about Women's Lib in the chapter disturbing. As a systems engineer, I really enjoyed reading his Minority Report to the Space Shuttle Challenger Inquiry - I realized that much of what he criticized NASA for came down to poor systems engineering. The last chapter, The Relation of Science and Religion, is thought-provoking. Personally, I enjoyed Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman better than this book. Feynman fans will probably like it, or at least most of it."

I know now that, in addition to all of those descriptors, he was also extremely funny. I stopped the audio book of The Pleasure of Finding Things Out many times to jot down eloquent turns of phrase and pithy crystallizations of profound ideas, but even more than that I laughed out loud. Feynman’s descriptions of his safe-cracking exploits at Los Alamos while working on the Manhattan Project, his joyful recollections of walking in the woods with his father as a child, and his incredulous tales of exploring various pseudoscientific activities are all filled with the kind of soulful humor that makes you wish you had known the man. His brilliance, quirkiness, teaching ability, and uniqueness are all on display as well in this book, but his humor is what makes it special."
191,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13265566-purna-lingam,5,"This book is a collection of various lectures, interviews,talks given by Feynman at various junctures. I was reading this book mainly for the two chapters ""There's is plenty of Room at the Bottom"" and ""The Relation of Science and Religion"". The former is a envisioning talk on miniaturisation and eventually the field became known as ""nanotechnology"" way back in 1959. I believe in any course you take on nanotechnology or microscale engineering, this would be the first lecture you encounter.Then comes Science and Religion, I wanted to know Feynman's views on that, as one can see when you read, he talks about the uncertainty in the existence of God, which takes away the concept of absoluteness of God which every religion proposes and reveres which is the root case of many problems which is also my take on God and Religion. It's worth the time reading a genius...!!"
192,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7807167-ayman,5,"This is a science book, yet I found in it some of the best parenting advice I had so far.Feynman admits that he became a scientist at a very early age because of conversations he had with his father during their long nature walks. His father encouraged him to question, experiment and most importantly imagine and visualize. for example when young Richard read that a T-Rex's is 15 feet tall and his head is 6 feet wide, his father asked him, so if there was a T-Rex outside the house, would it be able to come through the window? It's Feynman's early training in visualization that equipped him to become the genius he was. Unfortunately, I don't think many parents train their kids to explore the potential of their visual imagination, so I decided to ask my daughter more what-if questions and help her exercise this important brain muscle.A great book."

If one can adapt Feynman's general worldveiw, it really could open some doors to your perception of the reality you live in and around. His explanation of science and of its many magnificent potentials is exceptional.All though some of the lectures on nano-tech and quantum electiomechanics are above my head, all of the pieces was a delight to consume, even with a limited understanding of the technicality. The lecture transcript ""Los Alamos from below"" shook me to the very core. The backdrop and building blocks in this true story is bedazzeling, and likewise the absolutely hilarious presentation from Fenyman. A mixmastering of emotions from laugh out loud to deep thinking. Life on earth would really look different if it wasn't for the brilliant Richard Feynman. Thank you!"
194,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5397189-koit,3,"I’m in two minds about this one. Firstly, it’s an excellent work as Feynman’s achievements and works are both highly readable as well as entertaining. At the same time, if you, like myself, have read the other works that exist, this one adds very little new and even less which hasn’t aged very much.For example, while I had nothing against going through ‘Los Alamos from Below’ once again, I already knew where I could find this story in other books. Neither did I need the Challenger report again for this also exists in one of the other collections of Fenyman’s works.At the same time, some of the ‘new’ included content was relatively old. It was of slight interest to see whether the predictions of sixty to seventy years ago have been fulfilled, but there were very few new ideas. As such, I will continue to keep on recommending Feynman but at the same time recommend ignoring this volume.

An English physicist who studied under Feynman in America, infected by his personality as well the technical accomplishments his theories made possible.Only a few days before Dyson had died, and the name really stuck out for me thereafter from the foreword. Dyson describes his relationship with Feynman by parallel with Shakespeare and his protege, Ben Johnson. This dynamic comes through in this book of short pieces.If you have a chance watch the video series available, for Feynman's ability to describe the complex phenomena of existence in a simple and concise manner is incredible.There is plenty of technical material but nothing that a lay person couldn't skip over without much issue.""Come hear the man who saw the first atomic blast without dark glasses!"""

The lost star would also be attributed to some troubling and very uncharacteristically unscientific mysoginistic opinions Mr. Feynman casually threw around. However, with that said, this was a fascinating view into one of the greatest minds of the 20th century - and as an Engineer very humbling to see the massive gaps in my approach to problem solving and my lack of familiarity with the scientific method. I hope in the very least I take away the kind of curiosity to things unknown to me that Mr. Feynman had with all things in life."

Due to the same reason, this book wasn't much appealing to me initially but the chapters at the end of the book really got me hooked. The chapter I liked the most was "" What is science? "", in which Richard Feynman explains what is the difference between a globally excepted definition of science and what science actually is. This book also has a whole chapter on how he speculated the ""challenger disaster"" which might look boring to you if such things are not your poison. At last, this was a really great book though most of it is a part of another book."

This book, like ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman,"" is also a collection of speeches and interviews that Feynman gave. And while it makes up for an average read, what puts me off is how low-effort it is. There's no common theme between the essays and often they 're overly technical or verbose. I don't blame him. They make up for a great speech for a crowd that has the context, but personally, I found them dull. To be sure, not all essays are like that. I really loved the essay on Cargo Cult Science, but I wish there were more like it. "

The title captures the theme.Richard Feynman lived quite the life.

He seems to be one of the best examples of a specialist who was able to avoid the dangers of specialization. I was thoroughly impressed with how much he really understood, and how well he conveyed, the real stuff of science--not just physics, but all science (including science education). But more than his passion for science, which is considerable, it was his humility, humor, and humanity that I was struck by again and again. I would very much like to read some more of his books."

In some excerpts Feynman jumps back and forth between arguments, making it hard to follow his line of reasoning. Nonetheless, the book provided an entertaining insight into Feynman's views on physics and science in general. In this regard the book definitely lives up to its premise.

The transcriptions are easy to follow, since he speaks more commonly. His thoughts on religion and science were very interesting to me - his viewpoint that ""you can't prove anything"" and to question everything is a conclusion I've sort of arrived on my own throughout my life.

315,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33670963-sarahj33,4,"The Pleasure of Finding Things Out is a sort of grab-bag of Richard Feynman's best remembered lectures, interviews, and articles. Although the book was assembled in 1999, some of the writings are as old as the 60s, so at this point the book is as much about history as it is science. For a lay-reader, it can be a little frustrating to read an article, clearly written by a genius, and not know how much of the content is still true or relevant. Some of the articles come with annotations with follow-up information, but it leaves a lot to be desired. Another factor that dates the book are a few phrases that I found to be pretty sexist - at one point, Feynman is shocked to discover that ""the female mind is capable of understanding analytic geometry!"" And although this is not a memoir, and only sort of touches on his personal life in places, I was shocked at how cavalier he could be about the death of his wife, who he never even named in any of the articles. But I would hope that you can get a more clear picture of his character from other sources, such as his autobiographies. The real focus of this book is his ideas.And what ideas they are! Although he is always downplaying his skills as a teacher, he has a lot to say about teaching that I think everyone who teaches science, and especially who develops science curriculum, should pay more attention to. He is also invested in explaining to people what science really IS. Not what it does, like give us cars and electricity, but what it IS: the relatively new idea that nothing should be taken on faith, but everything should be confirmed by observation and experiment, completely honestly and without prejudgment. One article especially focuses on when science fails. Feynman was the one scientist who was member of the commission that investigated the Challenger Shuttle disaster, and the report he published was almost suppressed because it showed NASA in such an unflattering light. In this article, Feynman takes care to remind the reader that the first people that scientists have to worry about fooling is themselves. Feynman also is unafraid to take on other establishments that can come into conflict with science. In some ways, these articles can be depressing because so little progress has been made in some of these areas since Feynman wrote about them. It seems like the prevailing view among scientists today is to try to show that science is compatible with religion, but Feynman has a more pragmatic viewpoint. Although he respects the contributions of religion in the fields of art and especially ethics, he sees that the unquestioning faith in God that most religions espoused is not compatible with a scientific worldview. In science, you must always doubt everything, so the scientist who believes in God is really saying, ""There is a very high probability that there is God."" And until there is a church that acknowledges that world view, science and religion will be very hard to reconcile. Feynman respects religion even as he takes a bold stand on its relation to science, but other fields get a more thorough take down. Feynman has very little that is good to say about anything he calls pseudoscience, which certainly includes ESP and UFOs but also includes lots of sociology and psychology, in his opinion. He accuses much of the social sciences of jumping to conclusions to easily, and claiming to be doing scientific studies when lots of their results aren't reproducible, or worse, no one has even tried to reproduce them. I'm not a scientist, and I'm sure there are psychologists and sociologists today who are doing impeccable science, but I've read enough ""studies"" in the press that find totally illogical things to know that his claims are not entirely unfounded. So there is a lot that a reader can take away from this book, despite being occasionally outdated and repetitive. I haven't even mentioned yet how amusing Mr. Feynman can be - he was the practical joker of Los Alamos, if you can even imagine such a thing. His way of speaking is also quite unique. This editor left most of his work untouched, even occasional grammatical errors, so the reading is anything but dry. A couple of the more scientific articles left me scratching my head, but the big ideas were always clear and inspirational, even if the details were confusing. All in all, a worthwhile read that inspires the reader to go forth, steadfastly doubting everything in the name of science, and even doubting Mr. Feynman himself when necessary."

318,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47990949-brad-balderson,4,"It's hard not to be inspired by Richard Feynman; he was a great scientist, an honest person, and he put the truth above all else. He was extremely creative, fun, and an industrious person; clearly always experimenting with himself and the world around him. The most important thing I learned from Feynman, which I think he taught many others as well, is his huge advocacy for teaching as a method to determine if you know what you think you know. He also taught me the great importance of true understanding, and how hard it is to really obtain. For instance, one can use a great many big words and phrases, all with the goal of fooling ourselves and the people around us into thinking we actually know something. We say the reason why our shoes wear down is due to 'friction'. But one could equally say they wear down due to god, due to magical fairies, and so on. It's a substitution of a more scientific sounding word in-place of a more fantastical one but never-the-less does not explain the mechanism. Instead, Feynman suggests we should say our shoes wear down because little bits get stuck to the pavement as we walk. The mechanism is more clear; but of course we still have the word 'stuck' which could be taken and simplified further. So we can see how difficult it becomes; to really explain why this happens one would likely have to really explain the whole nature of the universe.I think it follows from this that no-one really understands anything, not until we understand everything, which is still a great deal away. Feynman's explanation here also reveals a subtle method for building understanding, and identifying the mist of what we do know, and what we do not know. This is, in essence, the method of building mind palaces, which was a popular memory technique in Roman times. The idea is to build a spatial construct of interrelated things in our mind, and we can subsequently keep building on this by using Feynman's method of questioning, where we increasingly identify things we are taking for granted in our mental model of the world. Where the mist lies, where the image is clouded in our mind, there our understanding ends. The other important thing Feynman discussed at length, was the importance of scientific integrity and looking for truth; how to differentiate pseudoscience, from real science; the importance of not fooling yourself. I have fooled myself a great many times as a graduate-student, and my capacity to not do so has been increasing dramatically as I realise the serious cost of running on assumptions without thinking very deeply and carefully about the problem, in the manner Feynman suggests above. Feynman also gave me inspiration to continue my attempts at bringing my current field of research from its state of mindless empiricism to become much more like the vigorous and grounded theoretical physics; mind-first, data second. Thankyou, Mr. Feynman!"

320,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24460839-muriel,5,"These things strike me: 1. Social science is not really science, people could make conflicting statements and not the least feel embarrassed. 2. Feynman confess that he posits no teaching philosophy. Different students learn different ways, instead of using one rigid teaching method that caters to some students all the time, Feynman claims to use different methods so he could catch all students some of the time. He illustrates this point with his experience interacting with his son and daughter: while his son would respond to imaginative stories that Feynman made up, his daughter just prefer stories read from books. 2.1 This example echos another soft story of Feynman. His own father told him not to remember names of things, but to understand things. His father told Richard if you remember the name of a bird, you just know what different people decided to call the bird, but you still do not know what the bird is like, how it behaves, eats, et cetera. This was from a period when Feynman's father would take him to walk during vacation in a summer camp, which is rare since no other father would do it. Other mothers liked it, and begged Faynmen's father to take their sons, but he would not do it because `he has a special relationship with me'. So these mothers made their own husband taking their sons to walk during the summer camp. I found these background stories touching. 3. Not thinking who you are talking to. From my vantage point, Feynman looks a huge intimidating figure. Nobel Laureate. Manhattan Project... This book gives a more humble and intimate view on his acts when he was a nobody. He asked Oppenheimer how to persuade Oak Ridge big shots to be present at his meeting, Oppenheimer told him to thread with `Los Alamos cannot be responsible for Oak Ridge's failure in... unless'. He gasped `Me? Little Richard? Telling the Oak Ridge big shots this?' Readers could relate to the `Little Richard' part -- I did.Little Richard grows up fast, partly because he was not thinking who he was talking to. When the Great Bohr visited Los Alamos, he discovered that Feynman was the only person not intimated by his stature, the only person who would respond `That is a crazy idea', the only person who would not be saying `Yes, Yes, all the time.'---------------The audio book production is strange in that it reads everything including the book's jackets. But it also works in the narrator really tried to mimic actual promptu speech, for those essays that come from Feynman's interviews with BBC, or public speeches. This includes chuckles. "

323,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109063501-kurt-foster,4,"Read ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"": Adventures of a Curious Character first. Approximately 1/4 of these stories are the exact same, but they are told way better in ""Surely You're Joking"". Also, don't know why or who did this but there is a short summary in italics before every chapter starts, which basically spoils a funny detail or two, I don't recommend reading those. I really like the story, ""Computing Machines in the Future"" and a few others I haven't heard, so there is a good reason to buy this. However, definitely read ""Surely You're Joking"" before reading this, the stories are told in a much more entertaining fashion. Also as a side note, nothing in this book is even remotely close to the idea of ""The Pleasure of Finding Things Out"". Yes, Feynman didn't actually like the idea of getting a ""Prize"" (the Nobel Prize) for having discovered something, he mentioned it like the real prize he got was, “The Kick in the Discovery"", so I think the title would have been better if it was this."
324,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3107285-brett,4,"Not quite as good as ""Surely You're Joking Mr.Feynman"", but still a great read. This book is a collection of essays and transcripts from speeches given by Feynman over the years. It feels a bit of a hodgepodge at times, and some of the chapters are certainly better than others. That said, many of the chapters that are good are very good. The trademark Feynman wit is on display, as is his ease at explaining complex subjects, and a sense of humble curiosity. His chapters explaining his approach to life ring very true to me. Moreover, we also get to read his speculation on nano-science WAY before nano-science was even a field! The book also includes his minority report on the Challenger accident, which was also very insightful. Overall, after you've read SYJMF, I'd recommend this book. I'm sure I'll pick it up for re-reads of a number of chapters in the coming years."
325,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3457071-martin,3,"The Pleasure of Finding Things Out is the second Feynman book I've read, the first being Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!. This book differs slightly from that as it is a collection of his works from speeches, interviews and articles and contain none of the womanising and strip-club frequenting tales which made up his memoirs.It was, as are most things that involved Richard Feynman, very interesting, in particular his personal report about the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster which is printed here in full. I'm not going to give a long review here and, to paraphrase Feynman's taxi driver, if I could explain this book to you in two paragraphs it wouldn't be worth reading."

327,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4635771-ryan-vaughan,2," I have held off on posting this review because I was never really sure what I a wanted to say about this book. The book is basically a collection of speeches and exerpted interview Feynman has given over the years. Feynman is very engaging when he speaks of how his father kindled his interest in science. He also speaks quite candidly and openly of his work on the Manhattan Project. The book is not all autobiography though Feyman also spends a great of time discussing his first love physics. This is case where the phrase ""It's not you it's me"" most definitely applies. Let me honest and admit here and now that in matters relating to science I am woefully ignorant. I simply did not have the necessary background in physics and computer science needed to understand the technical information Feynman presents. I hate to admit it but I skimmed throught a great deal of this book."
328,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9608847-artur-galiullin,4,"This book is a collection of short stories, speeches and interviews with Feynman. It jumps from laugh out loud stories of Feynman’s adventures at Los Alamos to his futuristic predictions in nanocomputing, to his philosophical thoughts on the role of science in society. We also get a glimpse at his physics research and the state of the field at his time.I found most of the fragments very interesting and entertaining. The only downside is that there really is no central theme or idea, other than the focus on this great physicist and his way of thinking. This book has inspired me to look into Feynman’s other works. He definitely has a unique way of looking at things and is able to present his deep understanding of many subjects in a simple and coherent manner, often with great humour and entertaining storytelling."
329,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13184361-dodecahedron,5,"Gosh I give a lot of 5 star reviews, but this really was amazing. The Pleasure of Finding Things Out is a diverse collection of several short works by Richard Feynman. The material was gleaned from the transcripts of lectures, tv programs, panel discussions, interviews and the like and thus the chapters can be read in any order. The appeal of the various topics and formats might vary a bit so don't let one bad apple deter you. I found that Chapter 2 was quite dense but nonetheless believe that it was a worthwhile read. However if it doesn't appeal to you, don't let it to stop you from reading further -- just skip it, the next chapter is a really fun. Chapters 1,4,6,10 and 13 (not in that order) were my favorites but I found something insightful, beautiful, challenging or otherwise valuable in every chapter. I look forward to reading much more Feynman."
