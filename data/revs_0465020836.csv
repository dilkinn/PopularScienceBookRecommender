Part autobiography, part earnest attempts to guide the reader accurately through all the complex steps by which such genetic work is actually done. (And also to show the equally complex social networks through which science is done.)I had enjoyed hitting up 23andme last year for its estimate of my own personal percentage of ""Neanderthal genome"". (I was very close to the European average, unsurprisingly.) It was fascinating to see where that option really all came from. And rather stunning, in a science-fictional way, how soon such gene-scanning became available to the general public, which is a new thing in the world.I must say, it was also deeply amusing to me, when the news of Neanderthal gene-crossing into modern humans first came out a while back, just how fast all the artists' representations of Neanderthals were upgraded.I love this sort of stuff.Ta, L. "
1,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/929238-hbalikov,3,"I have a friend who is a science professor and we attend a book group together. A few years back he suggested the book Spillover by David Quammen and I found that its impact on me was tremendous. I appreciate those who are battling the next series of pandemics we will face (some a lot worse than the current influenza season). [my review can be found here https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... ]I had the same anticipation when he recommended this book by Svanto Paabo. My GR friend Jean describes it as more a memoir than a science book. I feel the same but this book comes with plenty of technical jargon that only a genetic scientist could love. Speaking of genetics, I have found the subject fascinating for a long time, but it is clear from this book that those who work in the field have to have some very deep skill sets in order to gain further insights. Paabo has been hard at work for several decades in digging out the secrets from the DNA of extinct species. He calls his specialty, “ancient DNA.” His focus eventually turned to other members of our primate “tree.” He and his team have been responsible for some key insights into Neanderthal man and the relationship of that line of development to Homo Sapiens. Those of you who have had your own DNA evaluated may have found that your DNA contains a percent or two of Neanderthal DNA. That data proves one of the insights that Paabo was responsible for confirming: Our species and Neanderthals actually interacted and produced offspring during their common time on Earth. This and other insights are scattered through this book.Whether you find this book to your liking may depend on how much information you want about Paabo’s associates, competitors and the culture of advanced degree academia. Or, it may be how much you are attracted to or daunted by the language of the subject. Paabo is not as talented as Quammen at putting concepts and procedures in layman’s language. Here are some examples to test your reaction:“When Johannes made libraries from the extracts, he applied one of Adrian Brigg’s innovations to deal with the chemical damage that changed C nucleotides in the DNA to U nucleotides.”“The comment was fun to write but also somewhat bitter, given that studies such as the Utah one had become a constant feature of the ancient DNA field. The problem of high-profile but dubious results still plagues research on ancient DNA today. As my students and postdocs have often remarked to me, it is easy to generate outlandish results with the PCR but difficult to show that they are correct…”“When he looked at divergence of the Denisova DNA sequences from the human and Neanderthal genomes, he, like Nick , found that the Denisova genome shared more derived SNA alleles with the Neanderthal genome than with modern humans. “Paabo’s work is exciting and I learned a lot about it and about the field, including that there is a panel of DNA available that is a collection from 938 humans from 53 separate populations around the world!For me, less career musings and a more concerted effort on bringing the import of Paabo’s paradigm-shattering work to us lay people would have been welcome. I was just never swept away by the narrative in the way I expected to be."
2,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,4,"I found this most interesting and fun book to read. It is written in the first person just as if Svanto Paabo was sitting beside the reader telling the story of how he mapped the genome. Some technical information is provided and explained but mostly he tells about himself and his colleagues and their work. The way the book is written keeps the reader engaged and enthralled with the story. The book reads like a memoir rather than a scientific book.The story starts in 1981, when Paabo, a Swedish graduate student, became obsessed with ancient DNA. He extracted DNA from Egyptian mummies; at that time no one had any idea the desiccated flesh of mummies contained any genetic material. In this book Paabo reveals the three decades of research that led to the mapping of the Neanderthal genome. Toward the end of the book Paabo reveals in passing that he is the secret extramarital son of Sune Bergstrom, a well known biochemist and co-winner of the Nobel Prize.  The book is well written and is easy to read; all scientific technical information is simply explained for the lay person. I learned a lot about the Neanderthal and about DNA from the book as well as the workings of higher education politics. I read this as an audiobook downloaded from Audible. Dennis Holland does a good job narrating the book."
3,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6506088-elyse,5,Ever since I had my DNA analyzed by 23andMe and they told me I am 2.6 percent Neanderthal I've wondered how that is possible. This book explains the complexities. It is written by the leader of the project who first sequenced Neanderthal DNA. This is a very recent occurrence and happened after modern homo sapien DNA was sequenced in 2003. Turns out the Neanderthal project team was as surprised as me that most humans contain DNA from an extinct creature. They weren't predicting this result. This book got really exciting as it neared the end and the team raced to publish their findings.
4,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6753221-steve,2,"Overall, this book did not completely live up to my expectations. While it was a fairly interesting premise, the author veered off track too often for me.Author's Premise: Are we related to Neanderthal Man? If so, how?Book's Structure: First 3rd is autobiographical. Second 3rd is heavily technical discussion of mitochondrial & ribosomal DNA- its extraction, viability and study. Final 3rd: interesting discussion of how we share certain genes with Neanderthals and how this possibly could have come to pass.The good: If you are interested in the inner politics and workings of scientific discovery this books goes into great detail about this. The author proves pretty conclusively that we share DNA with ancient humans and has some plausible reasons why. The last third was the most interesting to me.The bad: Author got side tracked by his own personal biography too often. The premise of the book did not drive the whole narrative. "
5,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,5,"Svante Paabo, perhaps the most eminent paleo-geneticist in the world, has written a science blockbuster recounting the trail of his sequencing of the Neanderthal and Denisovans genomes. Not only has he given us an exciting story of discovery, competition, camaraderie and the world of science, but he has written it in language that the informed layperson can grasp.Sequencing ancient DNA required a series of technological breakthroughs, each of which began as a mystery and ended with an innovation that solved it. Finding Neanderthal DNA required Paabo to convince a museum to part with enough bone to process into genetic ""libraries."" Only small fragments could be isolated for sequencing, so how could these be mapped against modern human DNA to identify similarities and differences? One of the pleasures of this book is Paabo's descriptions of each genetic puzzle and how a team of determined scientists met every Friday for years to work out how the pieces fit together. Ultimately, Paabo's team at the Max Planck Institute succeed in isolating mitochondrial and nuclear DNA from Neanderthal bones and publish the genome in Science, a coup of the highest order. Along the way, it becomes clear that modern humans and Neanderthals were not only contemporaries in Europe and Asia, but they clearly mated and left progeny who have passed down Neanderthal DNA to modern humans. I myself was fascinated to learn that I share 3.3%of my DNA with Neanderthals.. But there is a coda. A tiny bone fragment from an ancient cave in Siberia turns out to belong to an even more ancient hominem--the Denisovans. Paabo's team, using their newly developed technological tools were able to rapidly sequence nearly 70% of the genome of a very young girl who died of unknown causes over 100,000 years ago. This is a delicious book for the science lover and of special interest to anyone who shares Neanderthal genetic heritage."

Book ends in updated Postscript telling of the latest research on the FoxP2 language gene, and what happens to nice when they have the human version inserted into their genome."
7,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"I really wanted to like this because it's by a scientist, but I can't honestly say this is a great read. The science is solid but there apparently isn't enough interesting to say about Neanderthal Man to carry a book. So the rest is filler about the author and the office politics of science and the names of the people who found the caves that the bones were in that he analyzed in his lab, etc., etc. "
8,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2422276-mag,5,"What a fascinating ride! From working on the genome itself, through the way research institutions work to the personality of Paabo himself. The book is written very much in the same convention as The Genome War: How Craig Venter Tried to Capture the Code of Life and Save the World, which is about the competition between Venter and Collins to sequence the genome. Paabo's book has the same unabashed honesty about rivalry in the science world, but here it's not written by journalist about the scientist, it is written by the scientist himself. Loved it. I would love all scientists to be like Paabo, actually. He seems really anal in his insistence on purity, repetition of results, checking everything trice, and he seems entirely trustworthy because of that.Fascinating as well how much we can learn from a tiny fragment of bone of an individual human who had lived eons ago.5+"
9,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7701175-alison,5,"This will be one of my top reads of 2014. This disarmingly frank tale of Paabo's thirty years at the cutting edge of historic DNA sequencing work as a tale of scientific pioneering, giving rare insight into the politics, money, rivalry, passion and innovation of modern science.Paabo's frank, almost naive, tone can be cringeworthy at times - especially discussing his affair with a colleague, and you have to wonder how some of his colleagues feel about his well-meaning descriptions of them - but is always entertaining. He matter-a-factly discusses everything from realising your cost estimates were in the wrong currency, to the delicacy of ending long-term partnerships when the technology is better elsewhere, to navigating the iron curtain in the 1980s. The result is a very easy read that bridges the chasm between peer-review-is-foolproof and scientists-are-all-corrupt, to give you the warts and wonders of rapid scientific advances. Paabo includes a great deal of detail on the technological advances in gene sequencing, as well as a readable introduction to the main debates in the human origins field, but the detail never weighs the book down - it floats definitively in the relatively easy reading category of science books.In the end, Paabo's narrative is the tale of the development of a key scientific field from a group of enthusiasts to a major research field producing Nobel prize winners. Parallel to this is the development of a young man who just wants to sample Mummy DNA into a Foundation head, a passionate young man into a comfortably happy father.The book, as is the case with many I argue with on the reading, is one that has stayed with me, giving a real sense of the excitement of science, while never shirking the reality of collegial camps and rivalries, the endless struggle for financing and the corrupting influence of headline-grabbing media. This is science as it is really done, and emerges even more heroic for it."
10,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"This book is less about Neanderthals themselves and more about the biological and technical details of extracting their long-extinct genomes from the preserved bones we’ve found, and also about Svante Pääbo himself — it touches on his bisexuality, his moves between institutions, even his affair with a colleague’s wife. I could’ve done without the personal info; it often felt like it was completely incidental to the extraction and sequencing going on in his teams. There were some interesting bits in the way his team worked together, and his decisions as the leader, but his affair with Linda Vigilant was entirely irrelevant.Still, it’s a fascinating narrative taken as a whole, tracking the various theories, setbacks and new techniques Svante Pääbo and his team went through in finally extracting and sequencing the Neanderthal genome. There’s some coverage, too, of how it differs from the Homo sapiens genome and that of chimpanzees, and what that means in terms of phylogeny and the relationships in the family tree of human development. It also touches on some of the politics of science: rival groups, jockeying for funding, terminating partnerships which aren’t delivering what you hoped… A reminder that you’re never gonna get away from politics of some sort, I suppose!I found it deeply interesting and well explained, though I am a little disappointed that it was more of an autobiography of Pääbo’s working life than about Neanderthals and what we know about them because of his work.Reviewed for The Bibliophibian."
11,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,3,Left at 40%. This is the type of book I would like for me to enjoy. I've always thought of myself as someone interested in science. I have also learned valuable details of how quickly DNA disintegrates and how difficult it is to extract ancient DNA without contaminating it. That's what most of the book that I've read was about. That and a few details of the author's life. This is not a bad book. It just isn't what I need right now. I want some mind-numbing blood splatter to cool of my frazzled nerves. Not dusty Neandthertal bones. I want something which is easy to digest and which requires just enough brain cells to keep my mind off work - but not so many they exhaust my already depleted energy resources. Maybe I'll get back to this one day. More likely not. 
12,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12213552-nancy,2,"I was disappointed in this book. I learned very little about our present knowledge of Neanderthals, and a lot more than I wanted to about the author's personal life. He presented excruciating detail on the long process of getting support, funding, and various methods of extracting DNA. I also learned about his relationships, professional and private. Looking back at the title: Neanderthal Man: In Search of Lost Genomes, I guess I should have figured it out. Apparently ""Neanderthal Man"" referred to the author himself and not to our ancient cousins.Oh well, I chose poorly in terms of my interests. I finished the book, but I'm not sure it was worth it."
13,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,"This book provided a lot of technical detail about mtDNA, which was very enjoyable and educational. I am more familiar with nuclear DNA and was happy to gain a more in depth understanding of mtDNA while enjoying a great story. More surprising though was the amount of personal detail shared by the author. I loved his candid and matter-of-fact way of writing about his personal relationships and his interpretation of the politics that accompany academic competition. Great read. "
14,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1113365-clay,4,"Tremendous! Paabo does a great job at outlining the tedium and excitement of science. He happens to have made discoveries with his science that few other people can even dream of. A great read for those interested in genetics, human history, and knowing just how much Neanderthal/Human gene mixing occured."
15,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1555901-sara,5,"A few years ago, my partner and I went to a conference in Northern Japan where we had the luck to have dinner with a paleontologist. Excited, I asked her about the Neanderthals and she gave a quick, paranoid sweep of the dining hall before leaning in and whispering, ""They're an ancestor."" ""As in...direct?""She nodded, before proceeding to unfurl a sorry, nefarious tale about ""those people"" at the Max Planck Institute who have a monopoly on the narrative and that's why we're not hearing the real story. Little did I know, but I'd just stumbled into the longstanding tiff between the multi-regionalists and those who support the out-of-Africa theory, between the paleontologists and paleo-geneticists. As a bitchy saber tooth tiger might say, ""raaaaar!"" After reading this, you'll come down firmly on the side of ""those people,"" if only because Paabo comes off as unceasingly rigorous and uncertain of his findings, even admitting in the last chapter that a tiny Siberian finger bone might have thrown the theories of both sides up in the air. I've never seen so much fretting over bacterial contamination, and it's absolutely riveting."
16,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9674065-schmidleysscribblins-wordpress-com,2,"Very uneven book. Sometimes engaging, sometimes baffling. Sometimes too much self exposure. I really don't need to know who he slept with, or how he stole his lab partner's wife. Best part for me as a retired researcher was how the research process including paper publishing works. Major shortcoming...his criticism of paleontologists and lack of sensitivity to the ethics of genetic research and possible negative outcomes regarding genetically modified organisms. He is the scientist depicted in Gulliver's Travels."
17,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8049925-sarah,2,"The content relating to genetics and biology was very interesting. The sometimes jarringly out-of-place commentary about the author's personal life was less so. As an example, was a summary of each item eaten at a specific dinner really necessary? These random insertions intruded on the main points being made; in the end I finished this book for the sole purpose of having an extra title to add to my reading challenge goal"
18,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2458054-frank,3,"This is an above average popular science book. It describes the experiences of SP, the leader of the experimentalist team which sequenced the Neanderthal and, later, the Denisovan genome.

I thought that this book is about nature and biology of this kind individuum. However, this book is about not only DNA and other biological terms but deep personal and professional feelings of the author. He expalained everything clearly and obviously. I would call this book like autobiographical. It was quite interesting to be a 'imaginary' participant in Pääbo's labs. I wish I would one day be in his labs.While the content of the book is bright, at some parts I did not like author's attitude to other scientists. I mean he adores only his friends, and others are considered to be his competitors. Converesely, I liked Pääbo's persistence and struggles to his wills."
22,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2482609-captain-sir-roddy-r-n-ret,3,"An incredibly fascinating look at the role that genetics is now playing is sorting out our human origins. While this particular book is not all that well written, I have to acknowledge that Svante Paabo is clearly at the cutting edge of the science in better understanding the evolution and relationships between Homo sapiens, Homo neanderthalensis, and other potential hominin species that have occupied the Earth. With Paabo, and other geneticists like him, I think we will be learning more and more with each passing year. These are incredibly exciting times to be following paleoanthropology. No longer is paleoanthropology simply the story of what can be gleaned from ""stones and bones"", but now is really, first-and-foremost, what the genes tell us and supported by the archaeological evidence."
23,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46969823-velia-penza,4,"I thought Svante Paabo was just a regular guy with a brilliant mind, but he is actually a bisexual swedish super soldier/scientist with a flexible moral about seducing married women. I enjoyed this book SO MUCH is not even funny, but I don't know if it would equally exciting for someone who is not in the field or not very VERY interested in how to extract ancient DNA from bones, genome biology and how the progress in sequencing techniques saved us all. Apparently they found the jawbone of a man 40000 years old in Romania who had at least one Neanderthal ancestor four generations back and good Svante is studing it together with Quiaomei Fu. They're the gift that keeps on giving. "
24,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2613975-phair,3,This was a little heavier on the processes of genetic/DNA research than I had hoped. Not really a lot about Neanderthals as beings. I give the author credit for writing in a way that made at least parts of those complex scientific processes understandable to the layman but will admit that in other parts the glut of statistics caused my eyes to cross and made me check to see how many pages until the next chapter. The book definitely made it clear that this type of research is a collaborative effort involving a huge range of specialists from all areas of science. Interesting but not particularly memorable.
25,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13061921-oth-n-a-le-n,1,"Can I NOT like this book? Actually, I just returned it... This happens rarely because I try to carefully choose my readings, but this time, I failed. Right from the start, I noticed the rhythm of the author was not good for me (too slow)... When I finished chapter #1, I said to myself I was gonna make the effort and that maybe during chapter 2 things would change. Not so. I made it to chapter 5, but then I could not continue. The moment the author started (chapter #3 I believe...) to speak about his bisexuality, I decided I was not going to learn much about Neanderthals, which was my main interest. My fault. I did not inform myself in advance."

But, I decided to give it a chance, because it was interesting, and I haven't regretted it. I learned a lot about lab procedures, and DNA extracting, and how, sometimes, it might take you years to fulfill your wishes, passions. Author is a great scientist, and I promise his life isn't boring either.

30,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1414282-peter-bradley,4,"Neanderthal Man: In Search of Lost Genomes by Svante PaaboPlease give my Amazon review a helpful vote - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-re...Svante Paabo is the Mick Jagger of Recombinant DNA Anthropology. I know this because I saw him on an unrelated TV program and you could see the young female Neanderthal professor simply quiver in his presence.So, it's probably not surprising that a surprisingly large portion of this book involves his personal life. I suspect that he imagined himself fighting the stereotype of cold, impersonal science with his personal reflections. Perhaps, but there was an awful lot of barely covered up infighting, concern about political correctness, and calculations about how not to be upstaged. Actually, in a way, that may be the more important historical angle; Paabo offers an insight into the culture of science as it is actually practiced.On the other hand, there was really some personal information that we didn't need. Paabo lost a lot of empathy for me - and, in fact, reinforced the image of the out of touch science nerd - with his story about how he went from out of the closet homosexual to heterosexual parent by committing adultery with a married colleague, who was so cool with this cuckolding that he moved to Germany, took a job with Paabo, and, apparently, welcomes Paabo into the family. Yuck!Another large, large portion of the book is the inside story of how recombinant DNA research is done. Actually, I found this interesting because I've heard the terminology for years and Paabo was able to explain it. Nonetheless, this stuff went on for a long time. Again, though, as a history of the field, this book will probably be a treasure to future historians of science.The gosh-wow! information was mostly relegated to the final chapters wherein we hear about Neanderthal gene flow into Homo Sapiens, e.g., all non-Africans have around 3% of the Neanderthal genetic information. Paabo was also the person who discovered that Denisovans were a new....species? sub-species? race?...it's not clear. Paabo explains:""The final mappings didn’t change the picture, and I became convinced that the Denisova girl was a member of a population that shared a common origin with Neanderthals, but that had  lived separately from the Neanderthals for at least as long as Finns today have been separated from, say, the San in southern Africa. Denisova DNA sequences tended to be a bit closer to those of Eurasians than to Africans, but less so than were the Neanderthal DNA sequences. This was best explained by a common ancestry for the Denisova girl and Neanderthals so that when Neanderthals mixed with modern humans, Eurasian ancestors inherited DNA sequences that were somewhat similar to Denisova DNA sequences just because the Neanderthals were related to the Denisova girl.""That was probably the most surprising bit of the book. The Denisovans have been presented in the popular media as a completely new species, but that doesn't seem to be the case.I thought the book was interesting. It should have been a lot more tedious than I found it to be. However, it didn't have the attention grabbing, gosh-wow! interest that I expected. So, rather than 5 stars, I've rolled it back a star based on my subjective expectations. I suspect that for reader not looking for a deep dive into chemistry and lab techniques the rating will be much lower."

The drama of competition in researches field along with the frustrations of satisfying a reviewer, a lot to learn.

They are excellent books, well-written and researched.When a professional in the field tells the story, be they a scientist, historian or whatever, you tend to get a different perspective: more on the inside, a bit better informed and in-depth.Svante Pääbo does this wonderfully in Neanderthal Man. It is not only the story of the first sequencing of the Neanderthal genome, but the story of the person who lead the effort, written by that same person.The science in it is top notch as befits a researcher at the top of the field, but what makes it hard to put down is the story. Pääbo shares the personal side of his journey to paleogenetics which is also the story of the birth and childhood of the field as well. From his youthful dreams of decoding ancient DNA to the first sequences and publishing, we see the ups and downs, the successes, frustrations, despairs, fears and ebulliences of all aspects of the scientific life: technical, cultural, competitive and social.Science is amazing in what it has and can do for us, but we forget that it is a human endeavor and few scientists share this side of it with us (and, of course, the journalists rarely get a chance to see it). Svante Pääbo deserves high praise for wedding the stories of his amazing technical achievement with his intimate personal experience."
37,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4162791-claudia-putnam,4,"This book was interesting for the explication of the technical process of sequencing an ancient, fossilized genome. You come away impressed with how hard this team worked to do it right, and yet how many errors are still involved, and how much we still do not know. Though it appears that the breakthrough in sequencing a Neanderthal genome has led to much better--more accurate--sequences since. The most interesting section, to me, was on the Denisovans, another related human group that carries Neanderthal, modern human, and some more ancient DNA. The trouble is, the fossil record is mysteriously lacking (so far) regarding this group, which appears to have contributed genetic material to some Asians and Australians. You'd think that given their range, we'd have found more of their bones. I'm impatient for that to happen.There are some weird assumptions about how people vs other animals communicate. Apparently studies on apes show that ape parents don't teach their children, an assertion/conclusion that sounds absolutely ridiculous. Ever watch a cat with kittens? Behavioral studies need to be done in the field, not the lab. Also, apes and other primates don't point to objects or other creatures in order to refocus the attention of their companions. Okay. So does that mean they can't direct attention? The assumption here is that other primates don't develop a ""theory of mind,"" the way humans do, early on. Around the age of one, human kids start to recognize that there are different perspectives, and not everyone around you is seeing the same thing.But what if humans are oddly disconnected from the group? What if other animals don't NEED to overtly redirect attention because they are more attuned to one another? The unexamined assumption that the human approach is innately superior bugged me. It may be the case, but starting there may block key observations.Nevertheless, it's clear that DNA studies have a lot to tell us both about human ""development"" and about migration patterns. I wish they'd start applying this technology with the ancestral Pueblo remains in the American Southwest, as archaeaologist David Stuart urges. "
38,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4623559-toni-moore,4,"This is a book about the discovery and identification of the Neanderthal DNA sequence, or genome. It's organized as a memoir, with Swedish scientist Svante Paabo setting the stage by recounting how he became interested in deciphering the genetic code of extinct hominins like Neanderthals. Hominins are modern humans, extinct human species, and all our immediate ancestors.It's a chatty book; Paabo, director of the Department of Genetics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, has a breezy writing style. His story is interesting, but I wanted to get to the good stuff, and that didn't happen until Chapter 7, with the first sequencing of Neanderthal DNA. The first few chapters dragged a bit. Paabo also reveals more about his personal sexual life than I wanted to know. I mention that because it didn't seem to fit within the overall narrative. It set me wondering about his complicated relationships rather than the incredible effort he and his team of scientists went through to sequence the Neanderthal genome.However, the book gets better and picks up steam once the search for enough Neanderthal DNA to sequence starts. Paabo clearly explains complicated genetic concepts, and he chronicles the achievements and disappointments his team experienced. He gives much credit to team members and other geneticists and scientists. You see that science definitely is a team effort. You also get a good picture of how personal and professional rivalries can affect scientific research.By the time I finished this book, I had a much better grasp of what DNA sequencing does and how difficult it is. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in the scientific process, genetics, and early humans."
39,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51912460-brook,3,"I nearly did not finish this book when half way through I decided the author was egotistical, but was grateful when I decided to push on to see my own hyper-judgement against an interesting and apparently ethical scientist who recorded the journey of discovery, including its anguish, competition and comraderie, working together or challenging others. The details of discovery and thought process made an interesting read for me."
40,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26380418-waco-glennon,3,"I love science history. I especially like when the history tells of the personal details of the men and women involved. This is a wonderful story that tells of the challenges endemic to the pursuit of knowledge. This book highlights several other facets of the scientific endeavor. First, there is an ever expanding horizon. The book starts with a very small, but crucial discovery. The author and his team find mitochondrial DNA of a Neandrathal human. At the time, there was little belief that they could get beyond this because of the difficulties of finding preserved nuclear DNA. Slowly, but surely, the questions give way to a new understanding. Along the way, new techniques were discovered, competitions with other scientists proceeded, and new institutes were formed. Science is often unrelenting, sometimes dangerously so. But, forever, there is new territory to explore.The second characteristic is that science is full of surprises. The author, who was the lead scientist in the uncovering of the Neanderthal genome, is often taken unawares by what they discovered. Paabo did not believe that nuclear DNA could be found. It was. He did not think that Neanderthals had contributed DNA to modern humans. But there is the 4 to 5%. Due to the success of the Neanderthal project, Paabo and his team worked on the discovery of a new species of humans, the Denisovans.I really enjoyed this book for the story behind one of the most fascinating discoveries of our time: some of our past."

The Double Helix of our generation
This book really reminds me of 
The Double Helix
, a 1969 book where James D. Watson recounts the story behind his discovery of DNA structure together with Francis Crick. Both books not only tell about breakthrough discoveries in biology, but they also show the ""behind the scene"" of science, including its politics and personal aspects. On the other hand, these books also show how biology in the 1950s is different to that in the 2000s. While in the past, breakthrough biology can be done by only a few people, today it is done by consortiums. And they also show how physics in the past is like bioinformatics now to biology.Overall, I really enjoyed reading this book. It was quite hard to stop reading after I started it less than a week ago! Some parts are admittedly quite technical, but they don't at all spoil the story. I would recommend this book to all students in biological sciences to know how scientist work in their daily activities."
42,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43864046-steve-mitchener,3,"I need to preface the following review with an acknowledgement of the scientific prowess, dedication and ingenuity of Svante Pääbo and his team. Their work to sequence the mitochondrial DNA of Neanderthals, as well as another hominid variant, is unquestionably brilliant. Not only do we learn about our close cousins, but the team’s findings cast light on the spread of modern humans as well. I found their work completely fascinating. That said, the book was not quite as enjoyable as I had hoped. The style of an author of scientific papers, typically destined for peer review, does not morph easily into a High Street book destined for the lay reader. Many pieces of the scientific research presented will be unattainable to non-molecular biologists. Some of the biographical detail was mundane. Nevertheless, this is a highly compelling and emerging area of science and one that will be of interest to many readers. "
43,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5942798-shana-yates,3,"So this book was not what I expected it to be. If you are in search of a fairly approachable, detailed explanation of the long and winding path (and the scientific and technical intricacies involved in) that led to the sequencing of the Neanderthal genome, this is the book for you. If you are in search of a discussion of Neanderthals, their characteristics, and what their genome can tell us about both them and ourselves (homo sapiens), then this book will likely not deliver. The book is 70% technical recounting of the processes that allowed the genome to be sequenced, 15% general memoir, and 15% discussion of what we learned from the genome. It is well-written, but not a page-turner and disappointing because of my own misguided expectations. What it sought to do, it did well; but the title seemed to promise more Neanderthal information than it delivered."

Ema kinkis sünnipäevaks ja sellele järgnenud nädalal lugesin vups läbi.A really good insight of how science is made. Yes, it has Pääbo's biography in it, yes, it has tons of technical details. And yes, it has information what was discovered on the way, including how Neanderthal humans differ genetically from modern humans. And these three parts form a great story what fantastic things really happen around us today, how people are capable of putting together such complex information while just being the very same humans you, me and our friends are. I think all these three parts are essential to peek into the world of scientific discoveries. I'm grateful that I read this book, it definately gives a perspective of an era, of a profession, of human curiosity."

And this is also exactly why some parts of the book were enormously exhausting for me to read. The parts where the research isn't going on. Experiments fail and so one. Everyone will feel bad when this happens. But having seen experiments fail myself, the pain was even worse. The book is also a reminder of all the things, that I think go wrong in science nowadays. Everyone is trying to publish in ""the big"" journals and there's rivalry among everyone. And the worst of all: Luck is the main thing needed to become a big man in science. The author originally being a medical doctor is not an exception from this. [Yes, I am jealous! ;-)]Three Stars nevertheless, becaus I liked the young Pääbo, hiding away private experiments from this professor. "

Following the (scientific) biography of Pääbo was fun as well. But I fear not too many people will have fun with the book, as the scientific details given are great if you're from the field. I guess if you don't have any training in molecular biology/population genetics and paleoanthropology it might be a bit hard to swallow. Recommended for: For anyone working in /interested in the details of molecular biology, population genetics, evolutionary biology or anthropology."

I don't have enough of a background in the details of genetics to understand much of what Pääbo was describing in this book. But it's such a cool description of how good science is done. In great detail, Pääbo describes how he became in interested in the genetics of extinct hominins, and how he led a team through the complicated process of teasing the Neanderthal genome out of a handful of bones. The litany of papers, conferences and meetings can be a bit difficult to follow, but it's fascinating to watch a deeply talented scientific mind describe how he and his colleagues approach a project, collaborate, handle roadblocks, and follow through with it.

When the topic gets technical he always speed up the rhythm and present ideas on the more confusing way he could find. Plus, he really dedicated more time explaining all his personal life, sexual orientation, recruiting process, the fears of all types of problems for his project, and stuff that have nothing to do with the Neanderthals, this book is difficult to follow and so boring."

Imagine being so prominent in your field that you can, on the one hand, run down the journals Nature and Science as being too eager to publish half-baked work, and, on the other hand, call the editors of Nature and Science to pre-announce and promote your upcoming work. Overall, it's well worth reading. I did find the details of the author's sexual proclivities to be especially uninteresting."

In person, Svante Pääbo is a really good lecturer, and he's done some pathbreaking paloeogenomic research. But somehow, he couldn't tell a story that kept my attention. May just be me, but I give up."
58,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53026475-maurice-williams,5,"Svante Pääbo’s book, “Neanderthal Man: In Search of Lost Genomes” intrigued me. DNA is composed of minute chemical molecules embedded in soft tissue. I am amazed that anybody can detect its presence in living tissue, but detecting these molecules in fossilized bones really piqued my interest, so I read the book. I’m not versed in microbiology or in anthropology, so I wondered if I would get anything out of reading this book. Actually, I did.When the author was thirteen, his mother took him to Egypt where he picked up a life-long interest in Egyptian mummies. In 1981 the twenty-six year old Pääbo, while a medical student at the University of Uppsala in Sweden, became intrigued in the possibility of obtaining DNA from Egyptian mummies. His procedure was to take a minute sample of the material he wanted to test and join it to a plasmid (a carrier molecule prepared from a bacterial virus) and introduce the plasmid carrying the foreign DNA into live bacteria where it would be replicated along with the bacteria’s DNA into hundreds or even thousands of copies of the foreign DNA. Success with calves’ liver launched him into his quest for the DNA of mummies.After many failures, Pääbo realized that the Egyptian mummification procedures destroyed the DNA. So Pääbo shifted his interest to finding DNA in Neanderthal fossils. In 1997, Pääbo received a golden opportunity when he was offered a directorship in the Max Plank Institute for genetics in Leipzig, Germany. He accepted and did his major work on Neanderthal genome there. Pääbo wanted one of the objectives of the center to answer the question “What makes humans unique?” This should be an interdisciplinary institute where paleontologists, linguists, primatologists, psychologists, and geneticists would work together on this question. Pääbo finally published his paper on the Neanderthal genome at Vanderbilt University in Nashville in 2010, bringing the applause of whole scientific community to the fifty-five year old scientist for this extraordinary achievement. Pääbo and his team have been administering intelligence tests to baby apes and baby humans. Until 10 months of age, there is hardly any difference in the apes and humans. But at around 12 months, humans do something apes do not do: they start to draw the attention of others by pointing. Soon they point at everything just to draw attention. This is the first cognitive trait to appear in children but not in apes. Also humans early on tend to imitate what their elders do, like expressions and mannerisms. Also human parents and other adult humans try to modify and teach correct behavior in the children to a much greater degree than apes do. In contrast, there has been almost no teaching observed in apes. Whereas apes must learn almost every skill through trial and error, without parental activity teaching them, humans can much more effectively build on the accumulated knowledge of previous generations.Author thinks there is a biological substrate necessary for acquiring human culture, but he is also convinced that social input is necessary for the development of human cognition. Neanderthals appeared between 300,000 to 400,000 years ago and existed until around 30,000 years ago. Throughout the tens of thousands of years of their entire existence, their technology did not change much. Only at the very end of their history, when they may have had contact with true humans, does their technology change in some regions. And they did not migrate over open water to reach other shores.I picked up on Neanderthal technology not changing for the 300,000 to 4000,000 year duration of their existence on earth, whereas human technology has changed drastically in the past 100 years. I see that human technology and culture has changed substantially since the beginning of recorded history some 6000 years ago. Even in my lifetime I see a phenomenal increase in human technology. Plus humans are the only physical life forms that cook their food and fashion clothes for themselves and practice some form of worship to a deity. I think something is missing when anthropologists compare humans to other life forms. I think there is a spiritual dimension to being human, something above the sum total of the molecules and genes that are built into the human body, something not composed of matter and not occupying space.I observe humans being involved in things no animal has ever been involved in, like interest in the purpose of life and appreciation in art, music, exploring the universe. No animal does any of those things. Humans are also very heavily involved in considerations about what is right and what is wrong in human conduct and in discovering the ultimate truth about the world we live in. As far as I know, no animal has ever done any of those things and yet look at how much time and energy humans devote to them.I’m very interested in learning the science of the world we live in, and I enjoy reading books like this one. I’m sure scientists will eventually arrive at the core of correct science about the world, but today, I think scientists are missing something. I think there is a spiritual dimension to being human; something that should be addressed if we are ever to understand what makes a human different from an animal."

67,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89470481-g,4,"While scientific biographies and autobiographies are generally not my favorite genre (despite my love of science), Svante Pääbo's Neanderthal Man is well-paced, and interesting enough to have sustained my interest long enough to finish it. One positive aspect to Pääbo's writing style is his brevity; the chapters are short and easy to read in one sitting, which makes it easy to put the book down and read it again later without feeling as though one needs to read through several previously read pages simply to reorient oneself. While the subject of the book is most certainly on the discoveries his team made in sequencing the Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes, and therefore much is written about the results and their significance, much time is devoted to describing the social and political aspects of running a world-class molecular biology research center that collaborates with other institutions in several countries. Thankfully, Pääbo does not spend overly much time writing about personal anecdotes or such banalities as his childhood experiences that led him to pursue his study, though he does introduce some interesting aspects of his personal life and motivations even as he presents the basic science behind his research.I would have liked to have read more scientific detail than he provides, but Pääbo manages to find a satisfying balance between clear descriptions of his work and details of the scientific and technological advances that were crucial to fully sequencing the Neanderthal genome a mere two years from publicly announcing it as his goal. Pääbo is clearly an intelligent and conscientious scientist, and although he does not write with the same art as a non-scientist who specializes in writing may, his prose is concrete, concise, and clear, which accordingly leads to very easy readability. There was not a great deal that I learned that I had not previously heard or read about (in broad strokes, at least), but I found some of the briefly mentioned technical challenges he faced in sequencing ancient DNA as well as the depiction of the operation of his scientific collaborations and research teams to be interesting and enlightening. Some of the fun tidbits I encountered were unexpected statements about his sexual orientation and personal life, as well as his apparently estranged relationship with his Nobel Prize-winning father. While I found the personal details somewhat fascinating, I was relieved at his seeming reluctance to waste words describing aspects of his non-scientific life. The main focus of Neanderthal Man was the trajectory of advances and painstaking, detail-oriented experimentation that led from Pääbo's initial interest in Egyptology to the study of ancient humans. I would recommend this book to those who would like to see a glimpse of how a top research lab overcomes challenges in a competitive field of inquiry, and who have an interest in exactly how it became possible to sequence the ancient DNA of humans who lived tens of thousands of years ago. The story is compelling, and the telling is captivating. While I would prefer David Reich's book Who We Are for much more scientific information on the evidence for the patterns of admixture and migration of human groups all over the world, which is nearly a textbook of elementary ancient human population genetics, Svante Pääbo's Neanderthal Man provides an account that enables one to see the social and political aspects behind the operation of the scientific endeavors that made the information presented in Reich's book possible."
68,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2958674-nikki,2,"Overall Neanderthal Man is a book that appeals to me as a reader and holder of a biology degree. However, it failed to deliver a concise and interesting focus throughout. The author included far too much superfluous information and too little genetic information- the most interesting part in my opinion. There were also far too many trial and error science moments depicted. Yes, this IS science but it does not make an interesting book to read with such repetitive inclusions. I also found the author himself to be quite distracting, the random inclusions of personal information felt out of place and odd. Overall the autobiography aspects were unnecessary and unwarranted. They also so often came out of the blue that it was jarring. One second we are speaking of another genetic test in the laboratory and next he is stating that he slept with this person or spent days naked on a particular beach. Did this add to the story? No. Did it distract? Quite well. Neanderthal Man definitely covers an interesting topic, however, it is too long winded and infused with personal information to be wholly enjoyable. I did, however, enjoy the following passages:The most common type of damage that occurs spontaneously in DNA molecules, whether nuclear DNA or mtDNA, is the loss of a chemical component—an amino group—from the cytosine nucleotide (C), turning it into a nucleotide that does not naturally occur in DNA called uracil, abbreviated U. There are enzyme systems in the cells that remove these U’s and replace them with the correct nucleotide, C. The discarded U’s end up as cellular garbage, and from analyses of damaged nucleotides excreted in our urine it has been calculated that about ten thousand C’s per cell morph into U’s each day, only to be removed and then replaced.  Loc177In fact, the genomes in our cells would not remain intact for even an hour if these repair systems were not there to maintain them.  Loc184I'm quite frankly always struck by the fact that humans have not disappeared from this planet, between our own behavior and our bodies we don't stand a chance.Using the models for how fast different types of mutations occur in mtDNA, we estimated that the mtDNA ancestor common to all humans alive today, the Mitochondrial Eve, lived between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago, as Allan Wilson and his team had found. However, the ancestor that the Neanderthal mtDNA shared with human mtDNAs lived about 500,000 years ago; that is, she was three or four times as ancient as the Mitochondrial Eve from whom all present-day human mtDNAs are descended.  Loc325...we suggested that Neanderthals were probably similar to modern humans in having little genetic variation and that they had therefore expanded from a small population, just like us.  Loc1439There are two species of chimpanzees, both living in Africa. The “common” chimpanzee lives in equatorial forests and savannahs in a patchy distribution stretching from Tanzania in the east to Guinea in the west, while the bonobo, sometimes called the “pygmy chimpanzee,” lives only south of the Congo River, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Comparisons of DNA sequences had shown that the two chimpanzee species are the closest living relatives of humans, our lineages having split perhaps some 4 million to 7 million years ago. A bit further back, perhaps 7 million to 8 million years ago, humans and chimpanzees shared an ancestor with the other African great ape, the gorilla. Orangutans in Borneo and Sumatra share with the other great apes and humans an ancestor who lived perhaps 12 million to 14 million years ago  ... Loc1678 I had always thought of myself as gay. In the street, I would certainly mostly notice good-looking guys. But I had also been attracted to women,  especially those who knew what they wanted and could be assertive. I’d had relationships with two women before. Yet, I thought that being together with Linda, who was married to a colleague and had two children, was not a great idea. It could be a temporary thing at most. But over weeks and months it became more and more clear that we understood each other at many levels, also sexually. Nevertheless, when Mark and Linda returned to Penn State University after their year in Munich, I was sure that my relationship with Linda would end. But that was not to be.  Loc1579Again making comparisons between randomly chosen pairs, he found an average of 13.4 differences between any two individuals. It was, to my mind, an amazing observation. Seven billion humans hugely outnumber chimpanzees, perhaps numbering fewer than two hundred thousand. And humans live on almost every speck of land there is on the planet while chimpanzees live only in equatorial Africa. Yet any two chimpanzees carried three to four times as many genetic differences from each other than two random humans.  Loc1686Genetic variation is known to be a marker of a healthy population, which also leads me to wonder how humans continue to exist...at this point it seems mere numbers.The mammoth sequences were identical to those of the Asian elephant but differed at two positions from the African elephant version, suggesting that mammoths were more closely related to Asian than to African elephants.  Loc1825The giant sloths had left behind large amounts of droppings, which archaeologists dressed up with the fancy name of coprolites. In fact, in some caves in places like Nevada, the entire floor, to some depth, is largely made up of old ground-sloth feces.  Loc1881I need to go to a Nevada cave, stat.His results suggested that people who are of European or Asian ancestry have inherited between 1 and 4 percent of their DNA from Neanderthals. David and Nick did a different analysis where they essentially asked how far Europeans and Asians are toward being 100 percent Neanderthals. The answer varied between 1.3 and 2.7 percent. Thus we concluded that less than 5 percent of the DNA of people outside Africa came from Neanderthals—a small but clearly discernible proportion.  Loc3385But since we are humans, we are more interested in what makes humans human than in what makes chimpanzees chimpanzee. We should not be ashamed of being “humancentric” in our interests. In fact, there is an objective reason to be so parochial. The reason is that humans, and not chimpanzees, have come to dominate much of the planet and the biosphere. We have done so because of the power of our culture and technology; these have allowed us to increase our numbers vastly, to colonize areas of the planet that otherwise would not have been habitable for us, and to have an impact on and even threaten aspects of the biosphere. Understanding what caused this unique development is one of the most fascinating, perhaps even one of the most pressing, problems that scientists face today.  Loc3585I have to disagree with the author here, there is all the reason to be ashamed.According to the fossil record, Neanderthals appeared between 300,000 and 400,000 years ago and existed until about 30,000 years ago. Throughout their entire existence their technology did not change much.  Loc3593Amazingly, even crude measures such as the size of the testicles relative to the body reflect this difference in male competition for fertilizations. Whereas chimpanzees have large testicles, and the even more promiscuous but smaller bonobos carry around even more impressive sperm factories, the intimidatingly huge silverback gorillas have puny little testicles. Humans, as measured both by testicle size and evidence for positive selection on genes relevant for male reproduction, seem to be somewhere between the extremes of chimpanzee promiscuity and gorilla monogamy, suggesting that our ancestors may have been not so unlike us, vacillating between emotionally rewarding fidelity to a partner and sexually alluring alternatives.

Throughout their entire existence their technology did not change much.”― Svante Pääbo, Neanderthal Man: In Search of Lost GenomesYou Are Likely Part NeanderthalMy fascination with neanderthals has to do with apparently being 2.8% neanderthal myself (genetically speaking).But then again, unless you are of a particular African decent, you most likely have Neanderthal DNA in you. Anywhere from 2%-2.8%.DNA is the code of biological life, if you don’t know. It is read, and translated by the cells in your body, to make pretty much everything that your body needs, whether still useful, or not.But How Did You Get It in You?To understand how we got this DNA, I assume that it had to do with the constant impeding wave of homo sapiens onto neanderthal territory.As the homo sapiens saw another species, they would simply attack, kill the men and children, and rape the women.In some, if not most cases, they would also cannibalize their victims – we know this, because some populations of humans have a protein that allows them to digest human flesh.This was how societies were in the past… long moments of nothing happening, then brief moments of intense violence and rape, and then nothing again.The other 99% of the time consisted of famine, disease and early death.So It’s VERY Difficult to Discover Ancient DNANeanderthal Man: In Search of Lost Genomes is an autobiography of one scientist:Svante Pääbo.It’s his decades-long pursuit into figuring out how to discover the DNA code of creatures that have died tens of thousands to millions of years ago, but more specifically, the Neanderthal.As Detailed As You Can Get?Everything from dates, meetings, people, technology, scientific details, press releases, and even personal life details are revealed.The amount of detailed information that is revealed from the chronological events, scientific discoveries and trials is incredible.Clearly, this book was written by a very studious and precise scientist (as they all should be).I can’t say that every part of the book was easy to follow. Sometimes, the complexity overtook me.The book felt as if it was written more for final-year high school students who have biology and chemistry training, or university students within the same majors.But I loved how every detailed discovery and innovation in technology, allowed the author and his team (and many other science teams), to take another step towards revealing the DNA of the neanderthal.What About A Bonus?One thing that was perhaps missing, was an epilogue, or even a chapter, of how the author would extrapolate the life of a neanderthal, and their eventual demise.A conjecture section based on decades of learning everything there is about our ancestors would have been nice.If you are aspiring scientist, have the spirit of a scientist (like myself), and are fascinated with one of our genetic ancestors, then this book is definitely for you.A++ read."
70,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3893885-brenda-buck,2,"The book is fairly easy to read and I wanted to give it a higher rating but I cannot. I am an academic scientist, so the author and I have this in common. However, the author comes from SUCH a place of privilege. Yet, I think only once in this text does he sort-of mention this. He does not help readers understand just how privileged he is, and I come away from reading this thinking he also has NO IDEA how privileged he is. Most scientists would never get the opportunities he has had, no matter how great their ideas or how hard they work. I really feel this gives the layperson a seriously flawed idea of what doing science is actually like for the vast majority of us. The book is also steeped in patriarchy, although in places the author does try to make amends for this and I applaud that. Overall, I personally found it difficult to read about yet another person of extreme privilege tell me how great life can be when doors open for you instead of close. It was for me yet another reminder that this field is NOT welcoming to minorities or women. It was for me yet another reminder about how science does not treat all of us this way. That said, the story is interesting, he puts in enough personal details, travel, timing, colleagues, etc. to keep you interested in how things happened. He explains situations where politics interferes with science and in my career I've found this to be common. If you are interested in the Neanderthal story, it is an easy read and interesting. I'm happy he got to do this work, I do believe it is important work. But the entire field is so incredibly sexist and this book again shows if you are the right gender, race, economic status, etc. then with hard work and brilliance you can do great things. If you happen to be born the wrong gender, race, etc. then science is not going to welcome you - and in my experience this community will actively work to limit your access/interactions/ability to contribute. It is highly unlikely that you can get to chase your dreams like this guy did. Let's hope the future changes this."
71,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98030829-sumukh,2,"As others have pointed out, this is mainly an autobiography. I was desperately hoping for a detailed accounting of everything humans have uncovered about neanderthals. Instead, what I got was an old man talking about his academic journey, with vivid descriptions of every major person he's ever met. And Svante spared no details. He's more than willing to tell us about how he had an affair with a colleague's wife. He also makes sure to let us know how this married couple had 2 kids together, just to rub it in our face what an asshole he is. Did you know that Svante considered himself gay, but realized he was bisexual after meeting her (Linda)? Because apparently, that's really important to know. Oh, but it gets better because Svante then gets married to Linda after breaking up the marriage. Afterwards, Svante gives a graphic account of his honeymoon, letting us know about how he and Linda wandered a multitude of European beaches together naked, while spontaneously making love all over the place. Ah, a 55 year old man living life like a horny teen, just the image I wanted. Yay, 3 cheers for Svante the home-wrecking asshole everyone!To Svante's credit, there are some interesting parts in his book that cover the genetic sequencing of the neanderthals (dedicates a third of the book to this). He also goes into detail about the what we can learn from the extracted mtDNA and microbiome. While the scientific process involved in extracting DNA is interesting, I was hoping there was more details regarding neanderthals in general (such as behavior and culture). Honestly, I learned more from the Neanderthal Wikipedia article.Ultimately, this book is 1/2 biography, 1/3 scientific process, and 1/6 general knowledge of neanderthals. If you can stomach the 1/2 biography, it makes for an interested scientific read. But you can just save yourself the trouble and read the Wikipedia article."
72,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7166646-vinod-peris,5,"Except for the fact that they were somewhere along our path from Chimpanzee to Human, I knew very little about Neanderthals. I happened to stumble upon Svante’s TED Talk about “DNA clues to our inner Neanderthal” and was riveted by the idea that we all had a little bit of the Neanderthal genome in us.This book is a first person account of Svante and his team’s journey in sequencing the Neanderthal genome and comparing it to humans across the globe today. He goes back to how he got his start in the genome sequencing business, and does an excellent job of describing all the technical challenges that he had to surmount. It is hard enough to sequence the genome for living beings where you have an abundance of DNA to work with. Svante and his team had to deal with a very limited supply of Neanderthal remains that could have been significantly contaminated by the DNA of other living things that they shared the soil with for the last 40,000 years. By force of necessity, he invents various mechanisms to distinguish between the original DNA and possible contaminants and manages to find a way to sequence a majority of the Neanderthal genome. The book is very well written and I was drawn in by Svante’s enthusiasm for the subject. On completion of the book, I am obsessed with finding out more about how the modern homo sapiens came to be."
73,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1711341-marfita,3,"I can't pretend to understand the math involved. What I did want to understand and what was made clear to me was the mechanics behind getting DNA from fossils. Pääbo makes it clear that they recognize the problems with contamination and how they went about isolating the Neanderthal mtDNA from the bacterial or modern human. The part that's hard for me to understand is how they figure time-spans and percentages. Pääbo is frank in his narrative, about his personal life and about his own mistakes and misconceptions, making him appear to be the model scientist. At the same time he is vulnerable to the competition in the community, and cops to that as well. He has had to negotiate collaborations and withdraw from them as well - without name-calling. Sometimes being a scientist also means being a diplomat.He also includes some TripAdvisor moments when he shares his opinion on the food and drink he enjoyed in his travels. It makes one want to follow in his footsteps in Croatia ... first, of course, sending one of those landmine-locating rats ahead.The Max Planck Institute is continuing to provide us with more insight into our past. Hurrah!"

I'm not a scientist - but I do love the topic of DNA archaeology and how DNA sequencing can be used to find out about our past. The scientist / author of this book was referenced in the last book of this subject that I read, so I knew I had to read more about the search for the Neanderthal genome.Despite my lack of scientific background, this book was thoughtful, amazingly well-explained, and I was able to understand what they were doing and how they did it. I learned quite a bit and also got a look into the scientific process and how modern day scientists go about their research. (I also loved the juicy gossip. The choice to make this into a semi-memoir was a good one.) I also had no idea DNA degraded. It's kind of amazing how far technology has come in such a short time. I feel like if more people read books like this and actually began to understand where humans stand in the grand scheme of things that maybe we would be less terrible to each other. Today's conflicts seem so small in the vast face of history. I loved this book, it was fascinating. "
75,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53547411-ron,4,"This book is an important one for anyone interested in human evolution and its specific genetic history, not because it gives a comprehensive introduction to the topic. Indeed, the actual technical details are relatively scarce, the science merely touched upon. Rather, it provides a very personal and readable account of the difficulties, technical, personal, political and scientific, when searching for answers in such a complicated, fast-developing and cutting-edge of science fields as genomics, evolutionary biology and population genetics.Much of the book reads rather like an autobiography than a scientific essay, and for some readers that might be a reason to stop reading. However, Pääbo offers here his insights distilled from decades of pioneer work grappling with the difficulties and technical problems one faces when sequencing archaic DNA and explains in a matter understandable to laypeople why Jurassic Park is nothing more than science-fiction and will most probably remain such, despite sensational headlines and repeated boasts in scientific journals. At the same time, having achieved a major breakthrough, he also manages to explain why it is still important to investigate the genetic code of our nearest evolutionary relatives if one wishes to better unterstand our own species."
76,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100524301-joe-dang,3,"This is a book about a thirty year development in the professional career of the scientist who first cloned the Neanderthal genome. As it deals with technical matters of DNA sequencing and contamination, it is a rather dry read on those matters. I have a medical degree and an undergraduate degree in Biochemistry and worked in a science lab in the late 1990s and I find his description of gene sequence hard to follow.The author adds deals about his personal life which don’t add much to the story. I did enjoy how he had to negotiate with foreign entities to collect Neanderthal source material for sequencing and negotiating and breaking deals regarding collaboration in his endeavor. I wish the book would have gone into greater depth regarding the ramifications of his discoveries. It’s like he made a great discovery (sequencing Neanderthal genome) but does not know the next step into applying this information into exploring the benefits of Neanderthal genes into the Homo sapiens development."
77,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58371897-ioannaky,5,"So what first comes to mind when you hear the word Neanderthal? Stupid, ugly, primitive giants that were replaced by the so much cleverer Homo Sapiens huh? Well, think again. Because they certainly were not stupid (although I'll admit that they might be ugly) and they didn't go extinct 100%. Part of them lives in me and you and everyone that is not African. So next time you make fun of this hairy cave man,think that some of the genes you own are from him. I hope Professor Paabo and his team get a Nobel soon because they made some truly spectacular and unique discoveries sequencing not only Neanderthal DNA but discovering Homo Denisovan too and sequencing his DNA also.Thanks for an exciting read!"
78,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12258846-kate,4,"I thought I'd be reading an overview of the current genetic science regarding neanderthals. Instead, this is Paabo's memoir regarding his work with that genetic science. It wasn't what I was expecting, but it was worthwhile read. Though full of very scientific language, Paabo does his best to make his research process readable and relatable. From his fears regarding contamination to his realization that modern humans and neanderthals did, in fact, interbreed, Paabo is earnest and excited. His use of exclamation points is particularly endearing.If you're a paleoanthropology nerd, like me, read this book!"
79,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33102578-maegan-ellicott,5,Absolutely wonderful book. I've been a fan of Dr. Paabo's work for some time now and this was just amazing to read. He very carefully breaks down how he and his teams made some of he most amazing breakthroughs starting with his original work that started the field of ancient DNA analysis and moving on to founding the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and exploring the Neanderthal genome of course. He also does not shy away from discussing his personal life which gives an interesting view into the minds of one of the most brilliant men in the world of genetics and anthropology today. 
80,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/595286-james,4,This was an interesting inside perspective on the race to sequence the Neanderthal genome (with Denisovan tossed it for giggles). It's written in lay prose and takes the reader through the various technics and challenges faced when sequencing mtDNA and nuclear DNA from ancient remains. The book is punctuated with some anecdotes about the author's life and the characters that helped or competed against the goal of being the first to sequence ancient DNA. As someone interested in the field of paleontology and archeology with less than passable knowledge of the science behind genetics this was a solid read.
81,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80303007-carlos-de-oliveira,4,The author of this book led the team at The Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Science that found Neanderthal genes in homo sapiens; yup love knows no genus boundary. The account is a white knuckle ride with his team through the acrobatic intellectual escapades to perform feats that border on magic.They had to first get quality Neanderthal DNA. That trail led to Serbia's treasure of Neanderthal remains. Their path is a treat especially if the reader has some science background. I could really appreciate some of the mind blowing work this team performed.This title remains on my 'read again soon' list.
82,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4236601-popup-ch,3,"This personal recollection of the enormous work that went into sequencing the Neanderthal genome gets rather tedious. I'm sure that the minutiae of different methods of genome sequencing and contamination avoidance are interesting to the expert, but to a moderately interesting layman it gets old rather quickly. The autobiographical touches provide a welcome relief, but the narrator almost ruins it, by not being able to pronounce many of the names. If the you have to pronounce the name of the author's son (which occurs about about half a dozen times in the book) - at least figure out how the name is pronounced!"
83,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71420-jyv,3,"This book is very much about the long and very technical process in extracting and analysing Neanderthal DNA (which I can appreciate), but also the author's personal and professional life. As such I didn't find it hugely satisfying. The last chapter does the same briefly with Denisovan DNA but again, I'm left feeling less enlightened than I expected. I wish I could understand all the technical jargon but I just don't have the brain for it. As someone who has always been interested in human evolution, I found Adam Rutherford's and David Reich's (both mentioned by the author) books more engaging. But if you're more interested in the scientific process itself, read this one."

It is also a description of how big science is done (and gives the reader a glimpse into why it's so darned expensive.) The two really important threads that run throughout are the vital importance of getting the right people working on the problem and the necessity of inventing both hardware and problem-solving techniques to overcome obstacles. A cursory reading might lead one to imagine the outcome was forgone; a careful consideration of the numerous ways the project could have come undone belies this. A remarkable account of a remarkable achievement."

What makes it interesting to me is the view it gives into the social structures in science, the process of trial and error, and the ever growing role of journalism, the dissemination of information, in the process. Those 3 things have a great effect on the following... The ethical vs the unscrupulous. The desire to be first vs the desire to make sure you are right. The buying up and/or sharing of ancient discoveries, scientific tools, and knowledge. In all, a very enlightening look at science and human evolution."

I enjoyed the insights into the scientific community, the conflicts and rivalries, the comradeship, friendships and loyalties, the hard work!What a huge undertaking and accomplishment. He makes it as understandable to a lay person as he can. He is respectful of rivals, he is human - with some Neanderthal.

In a scientific book I feel that the other details (like funding woes or the rivalry between different Gene sequencing consortiums) at best help to shift the focus. Pääbo didn't have to make this exciting for readers by including trivia. What could be more exciting than reading about the events that culminted in Neanderthal gnome sequencing for the first time in human history and to realize that we share 1-4% DNA with them?!"

104,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64349645-ciara,4,This book is an odd mixture of memoir and scientific literature. A bit misleading but none the less informative and I firmly believe if you intend to pursue graduate studies in the sciences it's an excellent reference point.
105,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106772887-mark-stattelman,4,"Enjoyed the book. The science part of it, and the suspense. Could have enjoyed it more without the author veering into his personal life. I realize that is part of it, but, really? His love life? In a scientific research book."
106,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/589844-pat-lampe,4,"I read this book in chunks over a period of weeks. It is very interesting but so technical that I could only digest a little at a time. Amazing how dedicated these researchers are. And amazing that we can learn so much from people who became extinct 30,000 years ago. "
107,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63302889-tanai-cardona,5,What fantastic science. I reflect on my own and must acknowledge that I may never accomplish anything as great.
108,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2133220-donna,4,fascinating look at our ancient ancestors and the science behind tracking them down.
109,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5059704-straykatstrut,4,Fascinating account. I'm glad I finished it.
110,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61762907-martins-slisans,2,Very scientific. Hard to fallow 
111,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32873953-reneemartinez,4,"actually enjoyed this more than I thought I would, the science is very blunt and well written, extremely compelling."
112,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55920040-sayako,1,"Disappointed. I came for scientific writing and not for how did you mess up with other people’s wife, man…"
113,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1040247-danforth-morrigan,4,"A little less science and a little more history/diary than I was expecting, but I've got a much better appreciation for the difficulties researchers go through to keep clean DNA samples."
114,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4609110-frank,2,"Too much personal stuff. More science poorly explained than I could understand, a fair amount of shit talking other scientists killed and otherwise compelling story."
115,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42698612-john-h,4,"Interesting subject, but the writing is a little dry."
116,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89830360-jack,4,"Impressive to see scientific process with all the struggles of the academic life, give birth to an amazing discovery. It’s a nicely written self bio/science book."
117,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4658546-melanie,2,It was a little too cerebral for me. But it was good to help me fall asleep. 
118,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19040199-dariusz-szewczak,3,"Great read, at the same time not being from the scientist community I found it hard to follow at times when Svante dived into the technicalities of reading a genome. Still a recommended read... "
119,0465020836,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91579756-steven-latham,5,Fantastic account of Svante Paabos and the process of how he was able to clone the Neanderthal gene.
