Maybe it's the colleague who is bright and cheery at 8:00 every Monday morning when everyone else is struggling just to open their eyes and get their third cup of coffee down? Or that really annoying person who always urges you to look on the bright side. Oh, your arm fell off? No worries, you have another! Oh, your second arm fell off too? Well, just think of all the fun you're going to have learning how to use your feet to open doors, feed yourself, and wipe your own ass!I don't know about you, but those kinds of people are just far too optimistic for me. If you're one of those people, well, maybe you can learn to tone it down a bit when you find yourself living in the real world with other human beings.Humankind: A Hopeful History is the book equivalent of that overly optimistic person.Author Rutger Bregman is certain the human species is inherently good. Most people, deep down, are really good people who care about others and want to help everyone and treat each other fairly.Growing up, I thought the exact opposite. Most people were bad and not to be trusted. Then, as an adult, I started seeing good in people. Maybe I didn't trust most people, but I let myself believe that there are a lot of genuinely good people in the world and maybe even there are more good than bad.Then along came trump and showed me how mistaken I was. Even some people I thought were good went to his side, ignoring the harm he does to minorities and even relishing in his hatred and cruelty towards them. After that, along came Covid-19. Now we really see how many people care absolutely nothing about their fellow human beings. They do not care if they pass the virus on to others, some of whom might die, because they just don't like wearing a mask. (That is at least many Americans. The fact that other countries impose steep fines for not wearing a mask makes me think that it's not just Americans who are that self-centered, and others would go without too if not for those fines.)Yes, they are actually okay with being inadvertently responsible for someone else's death so that they don't have to be inconvenienced.  My faith in the inherent goodness of most human beings has plummeted. I'm eager to know what Mr. Bregman would have to say today. Would he write the same book? Probably. So let's get to it.Mr. Bregman starts with the premise that people are basically good and then pulls up all these studies to ""prove"" his point. Most of the studies he talks about are ones I've come across in other books, but he claims the exact opposite results. Who is correct in their conclusions? I would like to believe Mr. Bregman is, but I rarely did.He seems to cherry pick the things that support his premise while throwing out everything that goes against it. He also makes some wild assertions such as, ""Basically, our ancestors were allergic to inequality"".  He's talking about our hunter gatherer ancestors and makes the claim that for most of human history, people lived in a veritable Paradise. That mythological Garden of Eden. Everyone got along, sharing, and doing their part, and kissing, and hugging, and singing Kumbaya, and being the very best of friends.He even goes so far as to claim that babies in hunter gatherer societies were different! When talking about a study that shows human infants have a clear preference for those most like them, he tells us that it just wasn't so for most of human history. He offers not one iota of proof for this, just assures us that babies today who are born into big, anonymous cities are different than babies that were born in the forest with a small tribe of other human beings.At times it was like reading a religious apologist. That said, it was enjoyable to read this book. It's interesting. It's written well. Even if I disagree with most of Bregman's conclusions, the book encouraged me to think about things in a different way.I think the author is correct in his assertion that the media shows us the negative and leaves out the positive. I accept his conclusion that most people would find it difficult to take the life of another human being --IF they had to do it face-to-face. We see with the pandemic that many, many people really do not care what happens to anyone besides themselves or at least outside their own circle of close family and friends. They are okay with being responsible for someone's death even if they wouldn't pull out a gun and shoot someone.That doesn't make me feel very optimistic about humanity.I believe Mr. Bregman is correct -- the stats support it -- we live in the safest era, with far fewer people dying from violence inflicted by another than at any other time during civilization.I just can't share his optimistic conclusion that humans are basically good and caring people. Some are, some aren't. It's almost amusing how he runs around in circles trying to explain away such atrocities as the Holocaust in a world where just about everyone is good. It's like arguing for a benevolent creator who purposely created such things as cancer in children and parasitic wasps that lay their eggs inside caterpillars, slowly and horrifically murdering them as the baby wasps eat their way out.Maybe I'm cynical, which Bregman assures us is lazy. He asserts that, ""If you believe most people are rotten, you don't need to get worked up about injustice. The world is going to hell anyway"". I disagree. The more injustice I see in the world, the more I realise how much work there is to be done and the more I wish to be able to do something about it.If we ignore all the very real suffering humans inflict upon each other and other living creatures, we don't see where change needs to be made and we don't take responsibility for trying to bring about change. Mr. Bregman's ideas seem lazy to me. For instance.... his solution for racism? Just let racists hang out with people of color. While not coming out and directly saying that people of color are responsible for eliminating racism, that is what he is implying. Why should people of color have to hang out with people who hate them (or LGBQT+ with people who hate us) in order to change their minds? It is not minorities who should shoulder the responsibility for change. I had to deduct a star from the rating for that BS.He blows off hatred of minorities by saying it wouldn't exist if we lived in small bands of people and yet at the same time among people who are very unlike us. Yeh, I don't understand that either.So, my conclusion is that humans are capable of both good and bad. We are capable of love and kindness and compassion but also capable of the opposite. There is no neat and tidy way to account for war and genocide while claiming people are mostly all good. We are complicated. Life is complicated. It's a big grey area; human nature doesn't come in black and white, all good or all bad. Do I recommend the book? Absolutely. I'm glad I read it, even if it didn't succeed in changing my mind. "

Even so, it's the perfect time for a healthy dose of optimism and if there's anything this book does well it's showing how hope and positivity can breed more. So go forth and be the good you want to see in the world. You might just inspire others to do the same.ARC via Netgalley"
2,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51783460-elzinus,3,"Bregmans book is immensely populair at this moment in Holland. The central thesis is clear from the title, freely translated: Most people are OK. Bregmans, is a journalist and historic from Holland who gained fame by explicitering the need for tax reforms at Davos. In this book he argues that most people are OK in two different ways.1. By summarizing study results that proof our good nature, that is, an preference for social cooperative behaviour and aversion to violence2. Secondly by trashing exemplary research into the dark human nature and present examples that show the good nature of humansFor me his thesis is ridiculous. In our daily life we approach most people like they are OK. We don’t distrust our colleagues when they asked for help and there are always people standing up in public transport to free a seat for those who need it. These are the kind examples he gives of good behaviour.Still, maybe this is not the kind of behaviour Bregmans wants to talk about. In the beginning of the book he states (from an personal email of a university teacher) that 97% of people belief that we are inclined to act fully in self-interest in panic situations.However for this argument the research he presents is less convincing. This is because the ‘proof’ of our good nature falls mostly in the category ‘a la café’ and because he is not able to explicate these results in an synthesized framework.Secondly because by trashing the research methods of i.e. Zimbardo’s prison experiment (where splitting up a group into prisoners and guards results into violence) he claims to prove that people are not inclined to show bad behavior. This however, is false reasoning, since the results of the Zimbardo experiment where always a presentation of how the context can make people bad. This is still standing, even if the researches (career driven lying pricks) where pushing for escalation. They where just a power structure within the context.As Rutger Bregman states he hopes to follow Bentrand Russel’s maxim to never get distracted by what he believes. It is a pity that he doesn’t live up to this. As he states in the preface, his goal in this book is not to prove that people are angels, more that we have an preference for te good (p.31). He fails to do this because:- He fails to make proper conclusions but merely summarizes a lot of research (which is interesting for sure!). But not explicitly derive the conclusion that this means ‘we’ are inclined to do the good in panic situations- This leaves him with the meaningless proposition that most people are (most of the time) OK. What do you mean OK? When are we not OK? What does this mean for our OKness in general? (This defect of the book was, for me, compensated by the last couple of chapters where the question is no longer the prove of the central thesis, but how vitreous behavior can be stimulated)- The question of evil is never a question of quantity but of quality. One person starting a fight in a bar can ruin the night for 30 OK-people. Magnifying the good intentions of the rest is not the point here. He does not address this but talks as if bad an good are leveled in equal measure. For example, the good behavior of (a lot) of people during WO II does not lessen the fact of the Holocaust.It is noteworthy that this book is so popular. Why so? De meeste mensen deugen is written in a way that makes you feel like a marathon runner. You just kill the thing in a few hours, and this made me feel good indeed.But this cannot be the only reason. What got my attention is the dualism created in the book between we (the 99%) and the leaders, scientist and politicians (the 1%). The most people are OK, but leaders… oef, the chances are high that they are psychopaths. In this way this book is a warm blanket that works as a sedative. We don’t have to feel guilty, because we are inclined to the good.[1]So, should you read this book? I think so. Rutger Berman is a great collector of research and is able to summarize the information so you can read it with ease. On the other hand, be aware that this book is an ideological pamphlet and the results of most research can be interpreted in multiple ways. So, practice benevolence, but not everything is OK and not only the powerful are evil._________[1] This is ideology and false with our direct experience. Though we think most people are OK we all now some examples where somebody is (as we say in Holland) ‘licking up, and kicking down’. Or for me growing up with brothers. I showed virtuous behavior, as well as evil sadistic behaviour to my younger brothers (not something i am proud about)."
3,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,5,"To be honest, I picked up this book to hate-read it. I thought it would be more Pinker and and that Lars guy saying how everything is better now and will everyone just shut up sort of stuff. But I actually really loved the book--that is, I loved the first 2/3rds of the book. The last 1/3rd was way too cute and optimistic for my cold cynical heart. The book is not making the claim that Pinker is making. The book is a point by point debunking of a Hobbsian worldview and the sham ""studies"" and stories that have upheld it. This is important because this bleak worldview has led us into bad policies and behaviors because we assume that if the police state was slackened, there would be absolute mayhem and murder in the streets. That is just not true."

An idealist can be right her whole life, and still be dismissed as naive. This book is intended to change that. Because what seems unreasonable, unrealistic, and impossible today, can turn out to be inevitable tomorrow. It is time for a new realism. It is time for a new view of humankind.
With the subtitle “A Hopeful History”, Humankind is exactly the kind of optimistic read I think I needed right now. With so much negative going on, I keep hearing, “What do you expect? People are the worst, a plague on the Earth!” And not only does that not solve anything, but it's so fatalistic as to suggest that nothing short of total human extinction could solve anything. With this new review of human history, Rutger Bregman not only busts a bunch of myths (and especially those based on social science experiments) about how rotten we humans are at the core, but by adding in stories of human decency and exploring some better ways of setting up entrenched institutions, Bregman shines a light on a more hopeful way forward. If the “nocebo effect” (If we believe most people can't be trusted, that's how we'll treat each other, to everyone's detriment) is as powerful as Bregman suggests, then a book like this that proves that humans are not basically evil is the first step towards building the society that works better for everyone. Just what I needed. (Note: I read an ARC from NetGalley and passages quoted may not be in their final forms.)
There is a persistent myth that by their very nature, humans are selfish, aggressive, and quick to panic. It's what Dutch biologist Frans de Waal likes to call “Veneer theory”: the notion that civilization is nothing more than a thin veneer that will crack at the merest provocation. In actuality, the opposite is true. It's when crisis hits – when the bombs fall or the floodwaters rise – that we humans become our best selves.
For most of this study, Bregman reviews what famous thinkers, philosophers, social psychology researchers, and recent pop historians have written; often finding source material that contradicts what we've been led to believe their evidence shows. Bregman starts with the opposite philosophical poles of Hobbes (“The man who asserted that civil society alone could save us from our baser instincts”) and Rousseau (“Who declared that in our heart of hearts we're all good” and that “'civilization' is what ruins us”). Bregman decidedly comes out on the side of Rousseau (and from more recent times, on the side of Yuval Noah Harari of Sapiens fame), who all believe that the dawn of agriculture was the downfall of happy human co-existence (and Bregman even takes issue with Steven Pinker and his hopeful books about how violence has decreased over time because, according to Bregman, there's zero evidence to support the widely accepted idea that nomadic/hunter-gatherer societies were anything but peaceful). To counter the dim, but popular, view of uncontrolled humanity in William Golding's Lord of the Flies, Bregman recounts the true story of a group of six Tongan boys who survived on a deserted island for over a year by creating a totally egalitarian society; to dispute the notion that men are jingoistic warmongers, he shares the incredible stats about how few soldiers in the major wars actually fired their weapons; to try and explain why it was the comparatively weak and smaller brained Homo sapiens who survived out of several competing hominids in prehistory, Bregman uses a recent study on the domestication of foxes to suggest that it came down to “survival of the friendliest”. If nothing else, Humankind is a fascinating and wide-ranging collection of stories.
I'm going to be honest. Originally, I wanted to bring Milgram's experiments crashing down. When you're writing a book that champions the good in people, there are several big challengers on your list. William Golding and his dark imagination. Richard Dawkins and his selfish gene. Jared Diamond and his demoralizing tale of Easter Island. And of course Philip Zimbardo, the world's most well-known psychologist. But topping my list was Stanley Milgram. I know of no other study as cynical, as depressing, and at the same time as famous as his experiments at the shock machine.
So, not only does Bregman confront Golding, Diamond, and Dawkins (actually, although I had never heard this, apparently Dawkins has disavowed his early notion of the “selfish gene”), but Bregman also spends a lot of the book writing about Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment and Milgram's shock experiments. I remember learning about Zimbardo and Milgram in more than one Psych course – as they both demonstrated something fundamentally awful and important about us humans – but I don't remember ever being told that Zimbardo was basically a fraud who manipulated his process and his results (but sure loved the fame that followed) and it hasn't become commonly known that while, yes, test subjects under Milgram were convinced to administer ever-increasing levels of painful shocks to unseen confederates of the experimenter, the results are much more nuanced than that (for example, subjects uniformly refused to continue if they were ordered to administer the shock instead of being encouraged to do it for the good of the experiment; believing that they were being helpful caused most to continue, against their own better natures, in the name of doing something good for society at large). Apparently, these experiments are still being taught because they seem to confirm what we all know – that people are just this thin veneer of civilisation away from brutality – and that's why we don't trust each other, and that's why we allow our governments to use lethal force against other countries and our own fellow citizens.Myths are so insidious. I remember reading somewhere recently something like, “What do you think that dude on Easter Island was thinking as he cut down his island's last tree? Could he not see that he was literally cutting down his own civilisation?” This was written in the context of climate change – and why are humans so self-interested as to continue to do those specific things that will lead to our own doom – so it was fascinating to me to read here that, although deforestation is the accepted explanation for the collapse of the Easter Island society, Bregman didn't need to dig too deeply into the evidence to discover that the islanders didn't cut down their vast forests (as Malcolm Gladwell reported and which everyone then accepted as fact) to the very last tree, but that an invasive tree rat was carried to Easter Island on Peruvian slave ships: slavers took the healthiest people and unknowingly left the rats (which had no natural predator on the island) and of course their civilisation collapsed. Other myths that deserve to be broken: The “bystander effect”. We've probably all heard about the murder of Kitty Genovese – killed on the doorstep of her NYC apartment building while thirty-some people watched and figured someone else would call the cops – but it turns out that her murder didn't happen that way (and when someone tried to correct the official account, the leading article's writer at The New York Times refused, saying that positive details would ruin the story). Also, the “broken windows” theory of crime control: Sure, the stats for serious crime went down when this practise was adopted in NYC, but it turns out that undue pressure was put on beat cops to make massive arrests for small misdemeanors and to discourage the reporting of major crimes (and apparently it was Zimbardo, once again, who did the one flawed experiment that served as the basis for this theory?) And also the notion that mass incarceration is the only way to deal with criminals because softer rehab options don't work (the sociologist who inspired this practise, Robert Martinson, eventually killed himself when he saw how his conclusions were applied; apparently, this former civil rights activist wanted to prove that all punishment was ineffective and “everyone would realize prisons were pointless places and should all be shut down”.)And why these myths matter today: As Bregman notes, the broken window strategy for policing is a racist system:
Data show that a mere 10 percent of people picked up for misdemeanors are white. Meanwhile, there are black teens that get stopped and frisked on a monthly basis – for years – despite never having committed an offense. Broken windows has poisoned relations between law enforcement and minorities, saddled untold poor with fines they can't pay, and also had fatal consequences, as in the case of Eric Garner, who died in 2014 while being arrested for allegedly selling loose cigarettes.
In an earlier story, Bregman recounts the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina – when, despite terrible newstories of opportunistic murders, rape, and looting – it turns out that most residents acted with “courage and charity”. Even so, first responders were also hearing the stories of a city in chaos – the thin veneer had been breached and 72,000 troops were called in – and “on Danziger Bridge on the city's east side, police opened fire on six innocent, unarmed African Americans, killing a seventeen-year-old boy and a mentally disabled man of forty”. The myths we tell ourselves about human nature matter, and more insidiously, we shouldn't allow the myths perpetuated by trauma-hungry media (or other entrenched institutions) form the entirety of our perceived reality.
Could this be the thing that the Enlightenment – and, by extension, our modern society – gets wrong? That we continually operate on a mistaken model of human nature? We saw that some things can become true merely because we believe in them – that pessimism becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. When modern economists assumed that people are innately selfish, they advocated policies that fostered self-serving behavior. When politicians convinced themselves that politics is a cynical game, that's exactly what it became. So now we have to ask: Could things be different? Can we use our heads and harness rationality to design new institutions? Institutions that operate on a wholly different view of human nature? What if schools and businesses, cities and nations expect the best of people instead of presuming the worst?
In the last section of Humankind, Bregman tells the stories of various institutions (a factory, a school, a healthcare service, a prison, a municipal government) that found ways to do away with bureaucracy and middle managers, and instead, empowered individuals to follow in the direction of their own instincts and motivation. His examples sound Utopian – if you treat people like they're good and smart enough to do things right, they will – but they don't sound universally applicable; still, it was hopeful to end on such an optimistic note. Maybe we'll get there.I wrote about a lot here, but the book contains even more stories, experiments, and busted myths. I suppose because it contains so much, Bregman couldn't follow every strand out to my full satisfaction, and I found some of his quirks annoying (and especially, after suggesting we thrived through survival of the friendliest, Bregman continually refers to humanity as “Homo puppy”; dumb), but the good far outweighs the quibblesome; four stars is a rounding up."
5,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45941903-lou,5,"Rutger Bregman returns with one of the most anticipated nonfiction titles of the year. What makes this such a fantastic read is that it is equal parts fascinating and informative; many such books can be dry and tedious but Humankind avoids those pitfalls by employing a highly readable writing style to entice you to carry on turning the pages well into the night. At its heart, this is a book about human nature and on the whole is optimistic about life. I found it different from what I would usually read as I am quite the cynic and it has taught me interesting anecdotal tidbits I will remember. Highly recommended. Many thanks to Bloomsbury Publishing for an ARC."
6,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44595752-t,5,"Some books reach you at the right time and this book did exactly that. To be fair, the right time for a book offering a hopeful, optimistic view of humankind to reach me wasn’t that small of a window – I’ve been noticing how I, an usually optimistic person in my day-to-day-life, have become increasingly cynical when it comes to my fellow humans. And… can you blame me, in this economy, this pandemic, this global climate crisis, this political turmoil, etc. etc. etc.?Just like I know you can’t blame me for losing hope in humanity, I also know there are many who feel the same, so I can’t be thankful enough for Bregman and his (almost suspicious) optimism to come around the corner with this book and the many receipts that show that, yes, humanity has a questionable record, no reason in denying that but, contrary to what has sadly become popular belief, most of us are actually pretty ok – even more than ok. There are good people – and they’re not the exception. And there’s definitely enough of a reason to keep hope alive.
""Remember that cynicism is just another word for laziness. It's an excuse not to take responsibility. Because if you believe most people are rotten, you don't need to get worked up about injustice. The world is going to hell either way.""
In Humankind: A Hopeful History, Bregman discusses many of the studies in psychology that seemed to have cemented the idea that humanity is pretty much a lost cause. That, if briefly left to our own devices, we turn ugly and mean. As it turns out, many of these studies were rigged or forged to suit a certain preferred narrative. If a study proves that people are kind of ok, where’s the controversy in that? Where’s the exposure, the fame, the renown? Ah, but prove that people are just one step away from turning into savages – there’s a headline. But it’s not only scholars and their rigged studies that Bregman discusses. He also mentions real-life events that corroborated this pessimistic view of people. Turns out, what the media had reported wasn’t all that close to the truth. And not necessarily because they didn’t have all the facts, but rather because some facts got in the way of the narrative that has become the most suitable narrative, that with the highest shock value, and were quickly dismissed and forgotten.
“But the people behind Facebook, Twitter and Google know you well. They know what shocks and horrifies you, they know what makes you click. They know how to grab your attention and hold it so they can serve you the most lucrative helping of personalised ads.”
But more than Bregman’s argument about there being hope for humankind, what I appreciate most of this book is the way his optimism and drive to see things in a better light rubbed off on me. As I mentioned earlier, I’ve become more and more cynical and, while some people may have come to terms with or even like being that way, I don’t. I didn’t know just how much I wanted to fight that growing cynicism until I started reading this book and could feel that desire to believe in a better, kinder world rekindle. Perhaps my eagerness to believe Bregman’s arguments has clouded my judgement, and I know this whole review may sound too sugary, but whatcha gonna do.Bregman starts his book by saying that, at its core, this is about a radical idea. That idea isn’t just that people are pretty decent. Because if his radical idea holds true and if we allow us to believe it, if we approach others trying to believe the best instead of the worst, if our default shifts from distrust to trust, if we behave towards those around us as if we expected them to be decent, even good, even nice, they may in turn start to behave in a decent, even good, even nice way. This is a form of the Pygmalion Effect, a phenomenon wherein high expectations lead to improved performance. Unsurprisingly, the contrary also holds true. Expect the worst of someone, and you may be unknowingly helping to make the worst become true.
""It's also one of the insidious mechanisms behind racism, because when you're subjected to low expectations, you won't perform at your best, which further diminishes other's expectations and further diminishes your performance.""
Sure, not everyone will prove to be a sweetheart or a genius in disguise, and one person expecting the best of others won't turn our world into a Disney musical. But Bregman says, and I want to believe him, that there’s more to gain than to lose in adopting a more positive set of mind. And wouldn't it be nice to go around expecting not a scowl but a smile and giving one in turn?"
7,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47593908-tine-putzeys,3,"Once again, I'm in doubt about the number of stars to give this book. I wanted to give it many many stars, I really did, because I like the premise that most people are inherently good. This has been my gut feeling for a long time, even if I get all kinds of opposite signals from the media and the f*ckers stealing my phone and breaking into my house. Bergman does give us some great examples of people being awesome and lovely anecdotes for me to casually throw into random conversations. And if I look at the reviews it's getting, I see many people are loving it and saying it helped ""restore their faith in humanity"" or that it's a good antidote to their cynicism. Which is great and I think this was the explicit aim of the author. So in that sense, good book.You can argue about style. Yes it's written like an irritating click-baity internet piece, but then again, the author writes mainly for a digital audience, so that's probably what he's used to. If your target is the general population, the worst thing you could do is write in a dusty academic style. It won't wint prizes for its literary prose, but does that matter if everyone is reading it?However, the main flaw is the same as most of these feel good books: what the f*ck do I do now. Bregman gets a small amount of bonus points, because he has the 10 rules epilogue, which gives you some guidance on how to use the content, but it seems to be too small-scale to matter. Assuming the premise is correct and most people are inherently good, we still fall victim to our circumstances and the systems we live in. He briefly touches on this sometimes, like referring to how the wonderful Agora school could be shut down if it doesn't perform up to the educational standards in the country. And then he goes on to the next topic. Same for the rebels in the Columbian jungle. Now that they have returned to celebrate Christmas with their mother, the jungle is now taken over by drug lords and extreme right groups. Just leaving that hanging there and on to the next topic. SO WHAT NOW, my brain keeps screaming at me. In the end, I think stars should represent how valuable the book was to me, no the general population. How much I liked reading it and how much I got from it and I can't in earnest give it four stars with my brain still screaming at me. Thank you mr. Bregman for the lovely anecdotes and for 'proving' my gut feeling about people is right, but I can only give you 3 stars."
8,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13298726-michael-perkins,5,"Humankind is a wonderfully iconoclastic book. The book is fluidly written and I have learned a ton. My favorite book of the year so far.Podcast interview with the author. What I find persuasive here is that other countries are operating on different assumptions, better assumptions than we are in the U.S., and getting much better results. We always make excuses for why we can't change, say to implement true gun safety. We cling too readily to our cynicism, when maybe we are looking at the world all wrong. This captures best the flavor of the book than I could in a written review.https://pitchforkeconomics.com/episod...---------------“TO BE HOPEFUL in bad times is not just foolishly romantic. It is based on the fact that human history is a history not only of cruelty, but also of compassion, sacrifice, courage, kindness.What we choose to emphasize in this complex history will determine our lives. If we see only the worst, it destroys our capacity to do something. If we remember those times and places—and there are so many—where people have behaved magnificently, this gives us the energy to act, and at least the possibility of sending this spinning top of a world in a different direction.And if we do act, in however small a way, we don’t have to wait for some grand utopian future. The future is an infinite succession of presents, and to live now as we think human beings should live, in defiance of all that is bad around us, is itself a marvelous victory.” ― Howard Zinn"
9,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27362230-rhian-pritchard,5,"This book has taken me nearly two months to read, not because it was difficult to read (it’s not, it’s beautifully written and translated) but because the ideas required quite so long to process fully. I don’t know if anyone has spoken to me in the last two months and NOT had me recommend this book to them wholeheartedly, even when I was only about a hundred pages in. It is like reading a book that confirms and reinforces, through meticulous research, discussion and sourcing, a secret truth I have wanted to believe, deep down, all along. But it took these two months, and I imagine much longer still, to begin dismantling the ideas society has ingrained in me. I can’t write a good review of this book because it would essentially mean rewriting the book. I have nothing to add, nothing further to discuss. I just want to put it in people’s hands and let it change their lives. And I believe Rutger Bregman is right - it is easy to be a cynic, to scoff and scorn kindness. It’s hard to be kind because it means taking responsibility - it means believing that your actions are worthwhile, when it is easier to believe that there is no point in trying, the world’s fucked anyway. I dare you to believe that it’s not true. I dare you to be an optimist - or as Rutger Bregman would have it, a realist. This is a challenging book to read. It does not shy away from the darker sides of humanity. But it is ultimately hopeful, and the more people begin to change their minds and believe that humans are not inherently bad, the better. "

Hmm, could that be the case with his book and his ""research""? He seems to want to sell his idea so (too) badly that he foregoes any scrutiny or nuance. There are a lot more points of criticism and I did start to write them all down, but my list was getting too long so I stopped. Besides, there are some excellent reviews already (be it in Dutch):Bou's reviewLieke's reviewDaniëlle's reviewAmber's reviewI mean, I can understand that people like this book, the optimistic message and I hope that some will be positively influenced (so therefore I give it 1.5 stars, rounding it up to 2). I suspect though that this will be the case mainly for the people who already have a positive view of the world and people. It is just too positive and not enough nuanced to be convincing for those who aren't convinced already."

12,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5754022-eddie-clarke,4,"Four stars. In the philosophical stand-off between Hobbes (human life is a war of all against all, papered over with the thinnest veneer of civilisation) and Rousseau (we were born noble savages and civilisation has corrupted us) Bregman comes down decisively in favour of Rousseau.Such a flattering premise makes the book very enjoyable to read, at least in the first half.The weakness of the book is that it is a string of nicely written and presented anecdotes/episodes/debunkings and then like a butterfly Bregman wafts on to the next flower in the field without really developing a coherent argument. In the end, despite disclaiming the ‘self-help’ genre he nevertheless ends with 10 rules for individual living.He is clearly a highly intelligent academic and throughout the book appears completely aware of the political implications of what he is up to (notably, he mentions conflicts with his German publishers over the message of this book). The second half covers contemporary societal issues - schools, prisons, countries in conflict - where his avoidance of political engagement becomes alarmingly apparent (and his engagement in each issue therefore feels superficial). He resolutely draws back from drawing any fundamental political conclusions, which leaves a syrupy aftertaste. (He does mention he likes Richard Curtis films.)But there is a tremendous amount of interesting and original research entertainingly presented. There is more than enough here to inspire your own thinking. Recommended."
13,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31506695-david-wineberg,5,"Rutger Bregman set himself a really high-barrier task in his book Humankind. He wants to prove that Man is actually not violent, or bellicose, but peaceful, helpful and kind. To do it, he went back to all those famous, landmark social science studies we’ve all grown up believing. They show unequivocally that Man is selfish, self-centered, violent and wallowing in it. Bregman shows them to be faulty, false, staged or just plain bogus. It makes for an eye-opening journey readers will not soon forget. And he does it with style.Readers will recognize the studies, like the Stanley Milgram electric shock study and the Stanford Prison study. He even goes after the Kitty Genovese murder case and Lord of the Flies. Bregman goes back to research not just the study or the book, but the author and the author’s own notes. He uses an absolutely delightful structure. He describes the study, book or story, giving it all the credit it has always claimed, seemingly case closed, no argument possible. Then he starts researching, going back to original documents, and where possible, original participants. The story starts to crumble, and he ends up shaming the originators of the bogus findings. It makes a for a lively read of a very serious problem with Man: not violence, but fraud.Man bites dog doesn’t sell as well as dog bites man. So newspapers focus on the sensational negatives, and don’t bother correcting stories when they prove false. Hollywood is all over sensationalism, mostly in the form of violence and gore. Everyone is always at war, always in a personal fight. Doesn’t matter if it’s Genghis Khan, Vikings or pilgrims. So viewers come to believe that they are accurate, that it is reality. That’s the way it always has been. That’s the way Man is.For example, Bregman cites the Easter Island story. For centuries, it has been “known” that Easter Islanders raped the island and went to war with each other, finally eating each other as cannibals when the island could no longer support them all. It’s a classic that is in constant use to demonstrate Man’s selfish inhumanity to Man and total disregard for nature, not to mention the tragedy of the commons (which Bregman dismantles separately). Only it never happened. Going back to the original ship captain’s logs, he shows that Easter Islanders were not just peaceful, they were thriving: joyously open and healthy. Not only did they not fight, they didn’t even know what weapons were. (The Dutch sailors showed them, mowing them down, then later enslaved them and left them with Plague.) In the famous Stanley Milgram experiment, volunteers electrocuted people, almost to death. It was supposedly the answer to why Nazis could exterminate people so readily. But Milgram hid the fact that more than half the subjects believed his shock machine was fake, so it didn’t matter how high a shock they administered. And it only came out much later that Milgram’s assistant continually harassed the subjects into shocking the victim. The results were therefore not definitive in any way. Or even valid. But the study lives on as a foundational document and seminal moment in social science.Similarly, the Stanford Prison Study proved that jailers plus prisoners will always lead to violence, causing the entire justice system to apply stricter rules that caused (and continue to cause) totally unnecessary violence in prisons. The truth is the researcher forced the violence by making it a we/them setup (with him leading the we as the warden), forcing the guards to be aggressively obnoxious, and imposing odious arbitrary and humiliating rules on the prisoners to get them to rebel. Literally millions of Americans have suffered as a result of this landmark study. Meanwhile, in modern prisons in Norway, prisoners and guards live, work and play together, help each other in tasks, and prisoners leave ready to rejoin society at a higher level. It costs the state less, and recidivism is a fraction of the American rate. The author of the Stanford study lived off it his entire life, rising to the highest levels in psychology, never admitting what his notes showed was bogus science.In the infamous Kitty Genovese murder, a New York woman screamed for help as she was being stabbed to death, while 38 witnesses did nothing. She died in the hallway of her apartment building in Queens, alone. This story went global, and demonstrated how inhuman humans had become in big cities, reverting to savage animals who couldn’t bother even to lift a phone to help.Bregman went back and found that two people had called the police immediately, before the second attack took place, but the police never sent anyone. They decided Genovese must be drunk (it was 3:30 am). And she didn’t die alone. A woman in her building immediately rushed to her and cradled her in her arms until she died. Lastly, two men stopped a robber carrying a tv out of a house in broad daylight shortly thereafter, disabling his truck so he couldn’t get away. These two good neighbors turned out to have caught the Genovese murderer, but that was never reported either. No, it was preferable to leave the sensational story of uncaring New Yorkers and an unsolved murder fill the media forever after. Cities breed uncaring, leering animals remains the takeaway, despite the facts.Even Lord of the Flies, which has long proven how beastly human children will be when left on their own, turns out to be bogus. This novel, read by every schoolchild in the country for 60 years, was written by William Golding, a man who professed Nazi sympathies, and had a worldview of violence and hatred. He made no pretense of it being scientific, but it has become key to the canon of innate violence in Man regardless. It fits our worldview, so it has become truth.Bregman found a real case of Lord of the Flies, in which half a dozen kids on Tonga stole a boat and ended up shipwrecked on an island called ‘Ata in the 1960s. It took hard digging, but he tracked down the captain (now 90) of the boat that rescued them and got the whole story. After year, the boys were in excellent shape, finely toned, well organized, and now lifelong friends. Any time there was a disagreement on the island, the antagonists had to go to different ends to cool off, and had to shake hands and apologize when they came back. Wouldn’t make nearly as good a film as Lord of the Flies. And no one has ever heard of it outside Australia, where it has been forgotten. Meanwhile, Lord of the Flies is mandatory reading.It’s not the common man, it’s his leaders that embody this evil nature. “Dictators and despots, governors and generals—they all too often resort to brute force to prevent scenarios that exist only in their own heads, on the assumption that the average joe is ruled by self-interest, just like them.” Bregman finds the farther one is from the front line, the easier it is to espouse violence.There are lovely stories of how men find ways not to fight. Ninety percent of the muskets collected after the Battle of Gettysburg were loaded, often with two or more balls, as men used any excuse not to fire their weapons, pretending to be reloading rather than rushing into battle. At Christmas in 1914, Germans and Brits celebrated together, singing carols to each other from their trenches and then meeting to exchange gifts, play football, and carouse. To the point where the generals had to reinforce orders not to fraternize with the enemy. What enemy? “From Troy to Waterloo and from Korea to Vietnam, few armies have fought without the aid of intoxicants, and scholars now even think Paris might not have fallen in 1940 had the German army not been stoked on thirty-five million methamphetamine pills (a.k.a. crystal meth, a drug that can cause extreme aggression),” Bregman says. As for guerilla organizations. he cites Erica Chenoweth who found that more than 50 percent of nonviolent campaigns were successful, as opposed to 26 percent of the militant ones. The primary reason, Chenoweth established, is that more people join nonviolent campaigns. On average over eleven times more. Turns out violence is way less appealing to ordinary people, even under duress. Man is a domesticated animal, the finding of Richard Wrangham, from his excellent, groundbreaking book called the Goodness Paradox which I reviewed here: https://medium.com/the-straight-dope/... As with other such beasts, from dogs to cattle, Man is smaller than his wild version the Neanderthal, and has much gentler features. Mostly, he is more peaceable and friendly than the wild species, just like with all domesticated animals. For us to have built this false collection of violent attributes, Bregman says, must simply be wrong.Before modern times, tribes raised children together, partied with other tribes, shared food, and owned nothing. It was the rise of agriculture, the ownership of land and tools that started the route to wealth, inequality, protection of assets, selfishness and constant warring, Bregman says. He extends the argument to capitalism, which he says was imposed from above. He says the Adam Smith version is wrong: “Now it turns out that this view is completely upside down. Our natural inclination is for solidarity, whereas the market is imposed from on high. Take the billions of dollars pumped in recent decades into frenzied efforts to turn healthcare into an artificial marketplace. Why? Because we have to be taught to be selfish.” Bregman’s quest here was recognized three thousand years ago by Aesop. One of his fables was about the sun and the wind. They spotted a man in a cloak, walking along. The wind bet the sun he could get the cloak off the man. He blew and blew as hard as he could, and with every gust, the man clutched his cloak to him even tighter. Then the sun took his turn. With the wind dying down, the sun came out, the birds went back to singing, and the air became welcoming and pleasant. The man took his cloak off himself.Not much has changed in 3000 years. Co-operation works better than force, no matter what binge-tv series present. And that’s how people actually operate.We owe Rutger Bregman a debt of thanks for unearthing the truth behind these long-held frauds, and for starting to clear the air about human nature. It’s a lovely, lively, uplifting and scientifically important book.David Wineberg"

Life is way more nuanced, and all that he tries to deny is just fact. Face it, don't try to blame the most ridiculous stuff, which most of the time was contradicting his own premise; that most people are good."

Bregman discusses the fundamental nature of humankind and presents evidence of goodness. Many times I did feel as if it was too good to be true. But until I can disprove any of his claims and the proofs he accompanies them with, I will be believing in the goodness that is present in each of us."

Most people are okay, and if I didn’t already feel that way, Bregman sure as hell convinced me with this book. It’s basically hours of meditation and therapy and insights from dozens of self-help books, all wrapped up into one cogent, eloquently written text. If I had to name one drawback, though, it would be that the book could be about 1/3 shorter and 1/3 less anecdotal. Contrary to Harari, Bregman underestimates his reader’s intelligence at times, endlessly chewing on every piece of information, working a point until you feel exhausted by the repetition and slow pace. Yes, I remember that you’ve already mentioned this in a previous chapter. No, there’s no point in repeating that yet again. Maybe that’s one of the typical pitfalls of an academic trying to entertain his audience, when in fact he should be doing what he’s best at: educate them. Challenge them. Maybe I’m just spoiled by Harari’s more intricate, more mature writing style and insights.So for that, four stars. Still, I’d recommend this book to anyone. I feel like we need it."

what if our negative ideas about human nature are actually a form of pluralistic ignorance? could our fear that most people are out to maximize their own gain be born of the assumption that that's what others think? and then we adopt a cynical view when, deep down, most of us are yearning for a life of more kindness and solidarity?
on one hand, dutch historian rutger bregman's new book, humankind: a hopeful history, is a thoughtful, engaging, wittily written effort. on the other, it reads as an anecdotal, feel-good magical thinking polemic trying its best to prove a premise settled upon in advance (for which the necessary corroborative evidence was then collected after the fact). while many of bregman's debunkings (the stanford prison experiment, the milgram shock experiment, easter island, lord of the flies, etc.) are compelling in their own right, to then use them as a foundational argument that people are better than they seem is rather specious.inevitably, human beings are indeed far kinder and altruistic than governments, corporations, or other dogmatic institutions would have you believe. thus, kudos to bregman for dispelling so many of the beliefs that have persisted not only popularly, but also in fields like social psychology. the argument that hey, people really aren't that evil or bad, just gullible and stupid is rather cold comfort, however. presuming that, in fact, humans are wired for kindness, beneficence, compassion, etc. (which does seem to be backed by considerable evidence), would a widespread understanding of such a point radically upend the world as we know it? or does it simply assuage our frustrations, pessimism, and/or latent guilt?if an alien anthropologist descended upon our planet some century or millennium hence to discover anthropogenic climate change ravished the living world, or that the sixth extinction annihilated millions of species, or that rapacious capitalism turned the earth into a ruinous hellscape, or that some egomaniacal autocrat launched nuclear weapons... what might they conclude? that with all evidence to the contrary, the so-called most intelligent creatures on the planet destroyed not only themselves but lifeforms of all kinds despite their natural inclination for cooperation and kindness? perhaps a more trenchant take on humanity's psychological makeup would have delved a bit more deeply into how it is we're so adept at destroying ourselves, other humans, non-humans, and ecosystems alike.inherent kindness or not, we've made a royal mess. to consider human's innate goodness while glossing over the ravages of capitalism, colonialism, empire, climate change, genocide, slavery, patriarchy, warfare, and the like seems, frankly, a sugar pill still too bitter to swallow. (rutger himself, however, seems like a charming fellow and his takes on many issues, including ubi, taxation, work, social progress, are most commendable. and his clash with perennial moron tucker carlson is required viewing.)*translated from the dutch by elizabeth manton (bregman's utopia for realists)"

We are not savages hidden beneath a thin veneer of civilization as cynics and controllers would have us believe.

We have a strong preference for those who are like us and are easily turned against the ""other."" But we are also quick to help when given the chance.Bregman refutes the studies and most famous incidents of evil in clear, logical prose explaining how we are able to do horrendous things to each other and why these events are aberrations rather than the norm. Too often the scandalous news gets the headlines and the corrections are never reported. It is a compelling read that is a breath of fresh air amidst the doom and gloom all around us."

In a way that is scientifically underpinned and using lots of historic examples. The author debunks a lot of things you think you know about, with the latest information available.

21,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57263951-nacho-santos,5,"Humankind: A Hopeful History By Rutger BergmanIt’s been almost 2 months since I last finished a book. This book is a great comeback to this lost momentum.I believe this is the next required read. To me it is as essential as Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari. It breaks down so many of the beliefs we hold true and debunks them in such an understanding way. For example, did you know the Stanford prison experiment was pushed by Zimbardo to be that way? Or the Nobel winning prize book, the lord of the flies is an unclear depiction of human nature. This book tackles what we think about human nature, specifically, how in the back of our minds we think everyone is selfish or only in it for themselves, with stories and clear logic. I learned that beliefs regarding the “evilness” of human nature is false. Bergman showed me time and time again, we are good. Today, our culture never pushes that idea. We heard of the Stanford prison experiment but we haven’t heard of the dozens of others that tried to confirm it? The ones where that result never happened, where the prisoners actually had a smoke with the guards. What more, the Stanford prison experiment laid the foundation for what the prison system and mentality is today. We do not know most of the stories that debunk these “facts” because they apparently aren’t “news worthy”. It is a “nocebo”, when we believe something false and then that information actually makes up the world we are in, being detrimental to all of us. We haven’t heard of the Christmas truce of 1914. During WW1 when British, German, and French soldiers in the trenches were each expecting a surprise attack on Christmas Day, the British heard choirs of Germans singing. It was a life changing moment for all of them during a time where they were supposed to be killing one another. Following that, the French and British sang carols out in the dark night, they then all met up going through no mans land, the space they have been sacrificing their lives to keep. These are only a few of the stories mentioned, yet they are so essential. We are reminded to “think as carefully about what information you feed your mind as you do about the food you feed your body.” Remember, social media and the news is not a real picture of the world we are in. Look outside, talk to a friend, and you’ll find that people, the world, is better than what our culture makes it seem to be.5 ⭐️"
22,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21106268-eric-van-der-toorn,5," De meeste mensen deugen (Rutger Bregman) I’m going to be honest here, I never expected to be putting a Dutch book on this list. Not because I can’t read Dutch (I have a good grasp of the intricacies of the Dutch language as a native), but because I had grown to hate Dutch literature in all of its forms over the years in high school where I was forced to read and analyze literature that I intensely disliked, which took away my interest. ""Is this the best that Dutch literature can offer me,"" is the thought that recurred time and again. My prime example, by virtue of its still-living memory, is not a particularly horrific one but a work that started off great. ’Het Leven in een dag’ is a novel that describes how life could look like if we were to live in a world that where lifespans where compressed to a single day, and everything was about ’firsts,’ from the first time you saw the sun rise to the first time you had sex. Firsts were also lasts however, and most things could never happen again (we conveniently exclude things like breathing and thinking). In this world, heaven is a single moment where ’everything’ happens, and hell is the endless repetition (or ’Earth’ for those less religiously inclined) The concept is quite interesting and sets one to thinking about how the repetition of events makes them lose a lot of their magic. The plot of the story was that of a typical romance with an interesting plan: Have more sex by going to hell. In our world the reverse is usually preached, but I like this version more to be completely honest. The plan to go to hell by murdering someone and getting executed succeeds and our main character finds himself on Earth and looks around for his girl.Then, to completely gore the entire thought process that the first two-thirds of the book stimulate one too, the main character is recruited by the man he killed to become, of all things, a prostitute. The following few scenes are just raunchy depictions of the things he is all but forced to participate in, my ’favourite’ being where he has an orgy while skydiving, laid out in explicit detail.I realise that I have in the process of wanting to rant about it written an entire review, so I’ll now start talking about the book that (after a lot of stimulation from my dad and it being suggested by a lady I met while traveling) I reluctantly started listening to and now am determined to finish to the end, though I sometimes have to bite through some reluctance.The book starts off discussing how humanity is perceived, from a philosophical perspective. The age-old question that Bregman wishes to touch upon once again (and hopefully answer) is whether civilization - rules, order, and leadership - is a boon to humanity, a requirement for proper treatment of others, or a poison that has only eroded the basic human decency that is inherent to all of us.Bregman wants to approach this topic, which is prone to being quite subjective, as scientifically as possible. I believe he did a remarkable job, though the book is named after his opinion, which is that humans are inherently decent. He starts by analyzing our behaviour without civilization, through pre-historical findings, current tribes, and stories where civilization got a ’fresh start’ - a la The Lord of the Flies - then continues onto social psychological conclusions that are widely known but deeply controversial, to finish with how things should change if the worldview that most people are decent would be implemented, and what would be the effect. In the conclusion he briefly describes 10 lessons he’s learned over his research.In his efforts to sound rational and scientific he has done quite well, though some parts of the book leave me wondering whether he sufficiently defuses the arguments against human cruelty being non-inherent. One thing that I feel he skirts about unwilling to actually dive into is the belief that civilization is responsible for all that is cruel. He repeatedly paints the civilized world as the ’evil’ guy, with its colonization and slavery practices, through the comparisons feel more like comparing apples to oranges. I would’ve enjoyed it if he’d mentioned more cases where one civilization compared to another. Are leaders always the people with the most hate for eachother? How does this work in rebellions? How should we look at people that commit not violent crime but horrible deeds like paedophilia? These are just some of the questions that the book neglected to touch upon in what felt like an effort to not get into the intricate debates surrounding those topics.To conclude my review, this book has made a significant impact on how I perceive the world in terms of how people are, baring some of the resolutions that I felt are intuitive, and with that allowing me to become more resolved in their veracity. On the other hand, it is like an opening move at a debate, where the response and the ensuing persuasive efforts still have to follow. And I am looking forward to see the arguments from both sides."

24,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18791611-shivam-kimothi,3,"Bergman says that our pessimistic view of humanity is a placebo. The placebo effect states that things have the potential to be true if we believe in them. He says that we have been made to believe that humans are motivated by self-interest and are inherently evil. By whom? By the psychologists who are motivated by selfish reasons and are seeking prestige and acclaim by proving so. And because we are made to believe this, we think it is true.The book puts forward a radical idea: that humans, deep down, are decent. Bergman supports this claim by debunking most of the social experiments that promote the selfish nature of humans. He debunks lord of the flies, the Stanford prison experiment, the eastern island experiment, and many more such experiments. This part constitutes most of the book. I didn't like it.If humans are so good, then why do we fight? Why are there so many wars and genocides? He believes it's because of empathy. Oxytocin, the love hormone, not only enhances affection for friends, but it also intensifies aversion to strangers. The mechanism that makes us the kindest species, also makes us the cruelest species on the planet.The last part of the book is flat out tedious. It's too radical of an idea to be believed so easily. But it sure does ignite a spark. It makes you question your beliefs. You should read this book because it promotes an optimistic view of life, a life filled with kind and humble people.  "
25,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58140457-wendy-hoenkamp,5,"I hope this will become one of the most important books in the history of humankind. It's a true page-turner and gave me the same addicted feeling as i.e. when reading Harry Potter. I've been a big fan of Bregman's work since about 2011. If you also have been following his journalism, and especially if you attended his book promo tour (in October 2019 in The Netherlands), you won't hear a whole lot of new things. Even if you have been following him for that long, it doesn't matter. Because this book sparks joy, generates an incredible amount of energy and trust in humanity. I can't think of a better way to spend your time, than to read this book!

26,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54,5,"I am giving this book five stars because it was very stimulating and engaging around its central idea - that we should assume good about the people we encounter and give the benefit of the doubt to others. The author has written a book about a simple idea that proves to be very complex. The idea concerns the initial assumptions we make about the goodness or lack of goodness of other human beings as a basis for our action. Do we assume that other people are good (and trustworthy) or do we assume that they are not? Are we living in a veritable jungle where we are competing to the death with others or do we start out more sociable and welcoming (and trusting) of others? Is civilization based on a veneer of humanity that will easily disappear under stress or is our humanity more robust and instances of inhumanity what are more engineered? These sorts of questions and the assumptions that go with them in some form or another are behind much of what we do and how we live. They are behind theories of capitalism and marketplace competition. They are behind how we treat other people and whether their background and characteristics and origins matter to us or not. They influence how we think about politics, how we behave at work, how we interact with the police and the courts, how we process political slogans. They are behind how wars break out and how they are won or lost. They are even behind our religious beliefs. I have read a lot in history and political theory and the issue in this book is Nothing less than the current state of the debate between Rousseau and Hobbes. The author drops a lot of names in book but also seems to have done his homework. If you are not up to speed on the background for some of these chapters, I would recommend have a device handy to check when you have questions.Sound a bit much? Perhaps, but perhaps you might read this book to see if you agree. I was surprised by how thoughtful and how learned the book is. Mr. Bregman is a Dutch public intellectual of sorts and this book is a research based but a multi-disciplinary examination of how these ideas of been accepted or rejected, how they have been researched and promoted, and how they have changed over time. When I say “research based” I do not mean that Mr. Bregman has done the original research himself but more that he has looked at what researchers have found out about a topic. ...and then he digs even deeper to see if the findings have stood up over time and how the promotion of research findings has been consistent with what the researchers and their studies have actually found. He has certainly done his homework. The result is a breath taking tour of how some basic ideas can turn up all over the intellectual map - even in discussions of how to tame Siberian foxes.Why five stars and not four? I am familiar with most of the cases Bregman raises in the book and appreciate that sorting our these assumptions is complex and nuanced. There are not a lot of simple answers. What I loved about the book was how the author dug into particular illustrative chapters and showed that the research was famous and why it was famous (famous studies by Zimbardo and Milgram, for example). But then, he continues to push further and show how replications worked out, how the researchers’ later work fared, and what the backstory for various studies actually was. This is extraordinarily valuable and should be the process that anyone uses in familiarizing themselves with a research area. Unfortunately, it is time consuming to do the real homework and as a result, it is a chore to really complete the due diligence that is needed on even a simple topic.This is not a specialized research book. Mr. Bregman is aiming for an engaged and educated audience but also a general interest audience. The book reads as if he wanted to figure out the questions for himself and then communicate what he found. This is infrequently done in any publications especially those meant for relatively wider trade book audiences. I commend the author for taking the time to do this and I highly recommend the book."

The translation is available to ""wish for"" on NetGalley, to be published 2 June 2020.I read (and watched) Lord of the Flies by William Golding so long ago, I have only an overall sense of how repulsed I was. I remember it as being about a bunch of English schoolboys stranded on a desert island and how they become ruthless savages. It is often required reading in schools, and I imagine it makes for lively classroom discussions.So I was fascinated to see this recent Guardian article about some real boys who faced a similar situation in 1966, a decade after the book came out. They were Tongan castaways. They had a completely different outcome. We'd all do well to learn how they did it.https://www.theguardian.com/books/202... The article ends saying, ""This is an adapted excerpt from Rutger Bregman’s Humankind, (Humankind: A Hopeful History) translated by Elizabeth Manton and Erica Moore. A live streamed Q&A with Bregman and Owen Jones takes place at 7pm on 19 May 2020."" I assume that's via the Australian Guardian, but I don't know. He's an interesting speaker and was in Australia discussing his much talked-about Utopia for Realists: How We Can Build the Ideal World."
28,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7431593-kathleen,4,"I really enjoyed this book. And, even if I don’t ascribe to all Bregman was exploring, it was absolutely the most thought provoking book I have read this year. According to Bregman the change from being Hunter Gatherers to Agrarian was the beginning of Humanities problems not the advent of our “civilization” but of our downfall. We are made for connection and interaction but the rise of cities, then country’s made us distrusting and insular. And no, he doesn’t proscribe going back to being hunter gatherers. I recommend to anyone who wants to think deeply about humanity and our role in this world and how we as individuals can and should make a difference. "
29,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4689774-sabahat,5,"I love it because it confirms some of my essential beliefs in life. It would have been even better without the slightly wide-eyed, naive tone in places and the occasional grammatical missteps in translation. I particularly love how it takes on ‘Lord of the Flies’ and wish I had this book to use as argument when the professor who taught me that text treated its ‘lessons’ as empirical facts.It should be essential reading for all Wall Street types and non-humanities folk out there."
30,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/591923-katie,4,If you enjoyed Malcolm Gladwells “Tipping Point” you will enjoy this one. I did find the first half almost like being back in Social Psychology class but it picked up for me in the second half. I find human behavior to be interesting. Also enjoyed his ten tips for a better life at the end. 
31,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12362120-annikky,3,"I am generally suspicious of books that have one central tenet that needs to be proved at all costs. And after reading this, I am not convinced the truth about human nature is quite as heart-warming as Bregman presents, but I think it’s an argument that needs to be made and fortunately, he is capable of *some* nuance. I did enjoy the way he criticised these old totemic studies that have shaped our views to an alarming degree - I can only hope the studies supporting Bregman’s views received the same level of scrutiny... It is an easy, engaging read, especially the first two thirds. As is often the case with thinkers, the parts about how to actually implement their excellent ideas are the weakest link in the chain."
32,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5198943-jenny,5,What an incredible read! I would highly recommend this to anyone who is tired of all the negativity and cynicism in the world. So many interesting studies and stories in here that help to reaffirm the basic goodness of people.It reflects highly on the author that he is able to criticize his earlier work and strive to do better. As should we all.
33,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6044031-jayati-deshmukh,5,"This book is like a ray of hope in the current times of global pandemic, inter-community disruptions, natural disasters and more. All of us need to be reminded in the intrinsic goodness of the humankind, even though sometimes it might be hard to see. The core idea of this book is that humans in general are kind and trustworthy. And the author builds on this idea throughout the book across diverse aspects like education, business, government and more.The book has many interesting and well researched case studies like the real life version of the fictional story from Lord of the Flies. What might have happened on the Easter Island than the usually believed story of war, mass destruction and cannibalism. There is also an in-depth analysis on some of the expected questionable events / experiments like the Stanford Prison experiment, Milgram’s shock machine experiment and Catherine Susan Genovese’s murder in NYC. In all these cases, an alternate picture based on detailed research is presented which completely changes the point of view. The models of our day-to-day systems will be very different and enriching when they are built from a trustful point of view rather that the existing models which are usually distrustful by default. There are interesting examples where the application of these principles has brought remarkable change. Management, of example in a top down manner with strict way of doing things can be counter productive. There is an interesting example of Blok’s model of management where small teams are given full autonomy which has been very successful and created a win-win situation for the company as well as the employees. As the author say, “Because nothing is more powerful than people who do something because they want to do it.”Further, education is looked at from the opposite of current day industrial / factory model. Importance of play, where the children are left free to experiment and explore is highlighted. Agora model of education which give a lot of autonomy to kids to design their own learning paths is presented which builds much more well-rounded individuals. “You can’t teach creativity,’ writes psychologist Peter Gray, ‘all you can do is let it blossom.”Next example shows how cities and governments might look like when then are run autonomously using participatory models of governance. There is also an interesting discussion of the Elinor Ostrom’s model of the commons countering Hardin’s tragedy of the commons. Finally, the author gives examples where even in the most complex scenarios like handling prisoners, controlling police or even wars, it is possible to bring a positive change with models based on trust and compassion. Being kind in not easy. As it is mentioned towards the end of the book, “To believe people are hardwired to be kind isn’t sentimental or naive. On the contrary, it’s courageous and realistic to believe in peace and forgiveness.” Also this strategy won’t be successful in 100% scenarios, however as the author says, “ accept and account for the fact that you’ll occasionally be cheated. That’s a small price to pay for the luxury of a lifetime of trusting other people.”This book is powerful and can change the way we perceive the world. It also presents numerous examples where a culture of trust, autonomy, goodness and compassion can build much better systems. This book restores hope in humankind and shows a way where we can be the change we want to see in the world, by being kind!"
34,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6571378-luke,5,"This was a wonderful book!While reading I was doubting if I wanted to give it 4 or 5 stars. The reasons for giving it 4 stars being that a). Bregman writes in quite an informal way - sometimes bordering on slang - and b). makes very 'out there' statements which at times seem to be written just to shock., both of which I found to be slightly aggravating. However, I found that I got used to this as I progressed and that the content of the book outweighs these reasons by far. To me it was very surprising how Bregman manages to discuss themes, current affairs and human behaviour in a completely new and innovative way while being 'realistic' and using excellent resources (and let me tell you, if there is one thing that irks me greatly, it is a lack of- or untrustworthy resources). The value of the book in this regard is in my opnion both the way that Bregman dares to discuss them so fearlessly, thereby breaking old taboos and clearing space for new ideas, and the nuanced way he seems to do so (once you get used to the slightly jovial use of language, that is). I recognized many of the studies that Bregman debunks and was just afghast once I realized how religiously they are being teached at our schools and universities when learning about our Western history and society. Take Zimbardo's Standford Prison Experiment for example, or Miligrams shock experiment, both are studies that were very formative when learning about human behaviour during both my social and nursing education. Like I said, this book opened some doors for me and broke a lot of old thought patterns I ddn't realize I had. It made me feel inspired, uncomfortable and hopeful at the same time. I am very happy it will be released in the English language in may 2020... this way I can recommend it not only to my Dutch speaking friends, but to my English speaking ones as well ;)"
35,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62488403-ben,5,"Why should cynicism be synonymous with realism? Bregman deconstructs our views on human nature, and the way these views underpin our sociopolitical institutions. With his defence of human decency, a tendency toward peace, and a sense of community, he builds hope. Despite occasionally feeling disorganized, this book should be required reading - especially for those who question whether people are fundamentally good."
36,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1838124-bart-van-loon,4,"I really enjoyed this book - or collection of essays if you wish - by Bregman. I am very happy to have some of my misconceptions in social psychology set right (the shock-experiment, the Stanford prison experiment, the murder of Kitty Genovese, etc...). It was also refreshing to see somebody bluntly oppose great thinkers like Pinker and Gladwell and join the ""new realism""-ranks of Harari. I found this new history of mankind very compelling and interesting to read.However, I also agree with most of the criticism online: sometimes the author's writing betrays a pedantic desire to have an exclusive right to the truth, and from time to time he even reverts to fallacies he elsewhere condemns. I also found the very large font size, big margins and huge chapter headings in this edition and the sensationalist style overall somewhat negatively impact my taking his obviously hard work seriously.Still, he has me convinced that people indeed are inherently good and the subtitle ""a new history of mankind"" is not exaggerated for this book."
37,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4877957-denise,3,"Bregman espouses the theory that people are fundamentally good and we should all act according to that assumption, thus making the world a far better place. It's a nice theory, optimistic, uplifting, bound to give you the warm and fuzzies. If you buy it. Which I don't. I went into this book with a healthy (though Bregman might disagree) dose of scepticism, and I came out with said scepticism firmly intact. That's not to say I think the book a load of nonsense - on the contrary, Bregman makes many good points and offers plenty of examples to back them up. It's certainly thoughtprovoking and makes one question one's assumptions. It's also, however, entirely too biased and black and white if you ask me. For every ""people are good at heart"" example he cites, one could find one supporting the opposite - but anything that doesn't fit Bregman's preconceived notions is disregarded. Call me cynical, but to me this oversimplified view is both unrealistic and naive."
38,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115057071-anthony-weir,1,"Many human beings may be 'nicer' than we might imagine, but we are also much more stupid and subservient than Bregman allows. The famous Tongan boys were co-operative and mutually self-supporting because they came from a congenial Tongan culture very different from the competitive and status-obsessed one of the boys in ""Lord of the Flies"". We are only as good as our culture and our leaders - and, crucially, our peers - allow us to be. Status, like Power, corrupts, and we are, largely, the slaves of power and the status it confers. Collaborators with tyranny (as Bregman must know) tend to vastly outnumber dissidents and resistants. There are exceptions (such as the Danes in World War Two) but they only prove the rule. "

41,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11365134-zo,4,"In this book, Rutger Bregman gives an answer the age-old question 'is human nature good or evil'. Verdict: humans have a natural tendency for kindness. He questions why this answer is often met with scoffs and skepticism, and challenges the view that it is more realistic to view humanity as bad once you remove the veneer of civilization. To do so, he puts into questions popular psychological and sociological theories, common myths and beliefs, and often succeeds at completely undoing them. He collects a good number of studies, experiments and stories that provide evidence that it may in fact be more realistic to expect people to do good. He then explores what this shift in perspective might mean for school, democracy, and the corporate world. I'm so glad this book exists. I've been finding it difficult in recent months, if not years, to keep optimistic about humanity and the future, so it's been great to be reminded why it's worth it to be optimistic. This books is well argued and is well-referenced. I also can't emphasize enough how easy it was to read. I was taken in from the beginning and had trouble putting the book down at times. I also like that the author doesn't wave off the fact that humans can be cruel and instead, acknowledges, and integrates that fact into his argument. Because the author tries to include many dimensions and presents his argument in a very digestible way, some sections lacked a bit in depth, especially in the final chapters. However, that's what bibliographies are for and I'm looking forward to reading the work of some of the researchers mentioned. After enjoying this book and Utopia for Realists: How We Can Build the Ideal World, which both present real possible ways the world could be improved if we just open our minds to the possibilities, I'm looking forward to reading his next books."

I read a review (which maybe I shouldn’t have) saying this would be the next “must-read” book such as Sapiens - I guess my rating is influenced by what I expected vs what I got. All that aside, I did enjoy reading this and discovering different aspects/perspectives of famous studies, stories, or news that have warped my view of the world. “Interacting with strangers is something we have to learn, preferably starting from childhood. Best of all would be if every young person could travel like Abraham Biljoen did in his college days. Mark Twain figured that out as early as 1867, observing that ‘travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry and narrow-mindedness’. This is not to say we need to change who we are. Quite the opposite. Among the most notable findings to come out of contact science is that prejudices can be eliminated only if we retain our own identity. We need to realize it’s okay that we’re all different - there’s nothing wrong with that. We can build strong houses for our identities, with sturdy foundations. Then we can throw open the doors.”"
43,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61150437-xerxia,5,"It isn't often I can say that a book has left me profoundly changed, but I can here.This book is essentially a meta analysis of decades worth of psychology, anthropology and sociology studies, woven together into a narrative to prove the author's thesis. It delves deeply into all of the ways humanity has been painted as inherently bad, via war, criminology, education, and religion to name a few, and then sets out to prove them all flawed. And if that sounds boring, let me assure you that it is not. Yes, it's well researched and supported, but it's tied together in a beautiful story of hope. The author's underlying message, that people are fundamentally good, is hard to digest in our current reality. But his hopefulness is infectious, and beautiful. It's not the hope of a naive person, it's a rational and thoughtful hope. And a powerful message."

Seriously though, I don't know that this theory adequately explains the terrible choices and acts of inhumanity committed by human kind, on each other and on creatures we share this planet with. I am also not quite sure that the main take I have from this book is what Bregman would have intended.. Friends are a really bloody awful idea and make us act like vicious arseholes all too frequently. I will mull it over and hopefully come to some less depressing conclusions."
45,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67610833-john-crippen,3,"The feel good hit of the summer for me. Bregman debunks the veneer theory by reanalyzing the classic experiments and arguments supporting it. If you've been irritated or upset by the constant stream of bad news about human nature coming out over the last fifty years (he does also take some deeper dives into history, particularly to look at the effects of the agricultural revolution), then you should read this. He misses the mark on some of his criticisms (Dawkins really was talking about genes, not humans), but his overall message is important and important to talk about as a society: Hobbes was wrong, Rousseau was right, humans are naturally kind. Thanks to Shal for the recommendation. "

It just felt hard to connect some of the ideas. The stories were great and I loved hearing different sides, but there were some obvious thoughts he sought to dismantle, with no facts to back up his opinion. There were definitely some facts in here, but also some over arching opinions. While I enjoyed the last hundred pages or so, it wasn’t my favorite I’ve read."
47,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2497661-jeanne,0,"I take issue with this author's handling of the story of Tongan men in an article for the Guardian. For more information see this article by an actual Tongan: https://thespinoff.co.nz/atea/17-05-2...This author turning a very complex story and culture into Feel Good Clickbait White Savior story, makes me question the lens of the other stories in this book and who profits when white authors treat other people's stories (especially those of indigenous people) like a salad bar. Picking and choosing what they like to produce a book that likely is intended to only comfort those who already benefit a great deal from the pain suffering of others.

It goes through the biological changes and advantages of being kind to one another, then debunks common misinterpretations of popular studies, like the Stanford Prison experiment, and finally gives a few examples of how we can utilise our natures to make the world a better place, citing the Norwegian vs American prison systems and alternative education systems. The chapter on NYPD's 'broken windows' philosophy is particularly pertinent today.It does gloss over 'the solution to racism!' happily by saying we'd all be better if we just mixed a bit more. It's clearly written by an author who has never had the pressure of representing their token minority or experienced aggression for being the odd one out.Easy to read and it makes you feel smart."

I feel like it’s something that everyone could read over and over again and take something new from it.It’s truly brilliant and opens us up to a hope for the future while also being honest about how society is and how it can seem like we’re all alone but we’re not!"
50,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67574581-david-franklin,4,"An entertaining book which succeeds in persuading us that we are kind at heart. Bregman is right to take on Lord of the Flies, and to challenge Hobbes’ contention that we are all savages in a state of nature. His exploration of empathy as a double-edged sword gives us a helpful framework with which to understand the polarisation we see today. The book is an easy read: Bregman is good at connecting with his audience, and his use of examples throughout is excellent. Where the book struggles is with the gap between ‘we are kind at heart’ and ‘we must design institutions that reflect our kindness’. Bregman may well be right that it is civilization’s fault that we end up with Machiavellian leaders. But we are here now, and civilization has more going for it than against it. He cites a few examples of participatory democracy and self-directed teams, but they are more of a curiosity than a convincing case for change. The reader is left slightly in the dark about how Bregman would go about redesigning institutions for the better.While the writing is persuasive, he over-uses the ‘I used to think X, but then I found Y and it shocked me’ device. There’s also one bit where he admits: “I’m going to be honest. Originally, I wanted to bring Milgram’s experiments crashing down”, which is not a good starting point for an unbiased examination. That said, his honesty, like much of the book, is refreshing. Four stars for being a great read, and for fighting back against the false idea that the cynics are always right."

56,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25535194-devina-heriyanto,5,"Humanity's atrocities and the capacity for evil have been well documented throughout history in countless books, both fiction and nonfiction. Rutger Bregman's Humankind: A Hopeful History takes a radical view of humanity, with the idea that deep down, humans are actually, well, kind.Citing various studies, Bregman builds a case on his thesis that humans are decent by nature. Homo sapiens, Bregman argues, made it this far, beating the stronger and more intelligence (at least judging by their bigger brain volume) Neanderthals because we are better at social learning and cooperation. Our survival, according to Bregman, is not a product of our selfish gene but came out of cooperation and kindness — at least towards one another.However, the affinity toward in-group members is exactly what makes humans ""the cruelest animal on the planet"", to borrow the words of a puppy expert, Brian Hare, whose works are largely cited in the book. In explaining atrocities and violence committed by humankind, Bregman looks to the system, power and the sheer fact that humans are social creatures that follow authority and one another.Besides the elaboration on the thesis of kindness, Humankind also explores how our cynical view of humanity might be detrimental to society and how we can improve the system with this new realism approach, which can be applied in many fields, from education, management and law enforcement to counter-terrorism and politics.It is hard not to be hopeful while reading Humankind. While this might come across as a naive and utopian view of the world, it is precisely that response that becomes the target of the book. Perhaps, it is okay to be trusting and hopeful, and if a critical mass of people believes in this utopian view, it will become real.Full review here"
57,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8853269-erik,5,"Having just finished Bregman's previous book, ""Utopia for Realists,"" I was glad to find this new one. And once I'd finished it, I was not disappointed. In both books, Bregman presents innovative and challenging ideas in an accessible prose style. The two books seem to reinforce each other. In ""Utopia"" Bregman advocates for three policy ideas: a universal basic income, a 15-hour workweek and open borders. In ""Humankind"" Bregman presents the evidence for why the three big policy changes of ""Utopia"" would work and why they're necessary.""Humankind"" argues that all public policy, politics, and economics are based on either one of two views of human nature. Each view was best expressed for the modern world by philosophers of the 17th and 18th centuries: On the pessimistic side, Thomas Hobbes concluded that humans were naturally violent and needed a strong authority or nation-state (which he called ""the Leviathan"") to rein them in and keep people from slaughtering each other. By contrast, optimist Jean-Jeacques Rousseau wrote that humans are essentially good and can manage themselves, unless they are spoiled by society.Bregman comes down on the side of Rousseau to justify the reforms he presents in ""Utopia"" along with other reforms he offers in this book. Bregman starts by refuting well known stories of people allegedly behaving badly that have made the case for human badness seem ironclad. The real story behind the novel ""Lord of the Flies."" Psychology experiments from the 1950s and 1960s showing how ordinary people could behave like monsters. The fake news of how 37 New Yorkers supposedly heard Kitty Genovese being murdered but didn't call the police. Bregman offers convincing evidence that these cases were understood incorrectly, presented dishonestly or just downright wrong.That's because elites have a vested interest in convincing us that unsupervised humans can't take care of themselves -- thus, the need for kings, presidents, police forces, bosses and teachers. The media of course is full of war, murder, sexual violence, and larceny. But that's not because these things are so common. It's because they're uncommon. That's what makes them news. You don't attract TV viewers or web clicks by putting a reporter out in a field to announce that today marks yet another day of peace. Also, if most media does the bidding of elites, then it's clear that elites want to promote the view of Hobbes, the view that people need leadership to keep humanity from descending into violent chaos.After debunking these stories of violence, fear and selfishness, Bregman then presents other stories of people behaving well, with altruism or compassion. One of my favorites was Jos de Blok, founder of a healthcare company in the Netherlands that beats its competitors in every way -- providing better care at a lower cost -- while delighting its employees. That's because de Blok employs self-directed teams and hands-off management which assumes his employees don't need to be manipulated into performing through incentives or punishments but instead, that employees are naturally driven to succeed for their own satisfaction. De Blok eschews such management-training course staples as performance bonuses and KPIs. ""Managing is bullshit. Just let people do their job.""This book helped bring together ideas I already had in a coherent framework. For that I am grateful to Bregman. In debates over such current policy ideas as those in ""Utopia"" or related ones like reforms to policing, prisons or that old chestnut, healthcare, Bregman's basic framework can cut through a lot of clutter: Are you with Hobbes or are you with Rousseau? That is, do you follow Hobbes in believing that people are essentially violent, lazy and selfish, as most people in authority seem to do? Or can you trust your own experience, with your own motivation and the behavior of your family and friends, to conclude with Rousseau that people are mostly kind, generous, and well intentioned?The path to hell may be paved with those good intentions sometimes, but that doesn't take away from Bregman's basic point that people are good and should be treated as such. With that view, you can then find easy ways to get someone off the wrong path and back on the right one.One of Bregman's most surprising stories shows how a good human quality can be turned to ill use. In World War II, Allied commanders were continually surprised at how hard ordinary German soldiers would fight even as it became clear in 1944 that the war was lost for them. Interviews with captured German troops showed why. It wasn't because they were so inspired by Hitler or moved by Nazi ideology or stuck on antisemitism. It was because soldiers were good friends, or comrades. German commanders would even take the time to keep army units back from the front long enough for new recruits to form strong friendships with their new comrades. To keep from letting those comrades down is why the average German soldier fought so hard.What's the lesson? The Allies tried different messages in the propaganda leaflets they dropped behind enemy lines, with better results. Meantime, readers of Bregman should consider how one of history's most famous fans of Rousseau and believer in the goodness of man went wrong: the leader of the French Revolution's Reign of Terror Maximilien Robespierre. See my recent review of a lively and fair biography of Robespierre, ""Fatal Purity"": https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...The lesson there is that humility and a sense of humor, which Robespierre lacked, can keep a leader's zeal for righting the injustices of the past from turning into murderous tyranny in the present.In the end, Bregman's book makes us ask what kind of leaders we need or whether, in some cases, we need leaders at all. Agreeing that power corrupts, Bregman finds that perfectly fine people turn into monsters when they rise to positions of such power that they no longer need to worry about pleasing others. Bregman does seem to think that prehistoric tribal societies were more just and more fair than the settled farming civilizations that came after the Fertile Crescent. But rather than preaching revolution and anarchism, Bregman seems to be merely calling for reforms to make industrial society kinder and gentler. Those changes, as outlined in ""Utopia for Realists,"" may seem extreme in the context of today's cut-throat capitalism. But things like universal guaranteed income and giving workers more free time may be just what we need to save any form of modern economy at all."

60,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13555414-olga-miret,5,"A bright and well-argued book full of hopeful content Thanks to NetGalley and to Bloomsbury Publishing Plc (UK & ANZ) for providing me an ARC copy of this book that I freely chose to review.I know I write long reviews, so I wanted to give a heads up to those who prefer a brief one. I loved this book. Why? I picked up this book based on NetGalley’s recommendations as good read for these current times when things feel quite tough and most people feel quite negative. And they were right. It’s difficult to read this book and not feel more optimistic by the end of it, even if you might not be absolutely convinced by all of the author’s arguments. It is engaging, easy to read, compelling, it includes a large variety of studies from many disciplines (criminology, sociology, anthropology, history, economics, ethnology, biology, literature…), and I think most readers will be familiar and/or intrigued by many of the topics he touches on.  And it does look at all of those with new eyes. It also collects a large number of positive examples of human behaviour, so, if you need an injection of optimism, I recommend it. There is a detailed index, and plenty of notes, but as I said, it is a book written for the general public rather than for academicians or experts, and no specialist knowledge in any of the fields it touches on is necessary to enjoy it.In the acknowledgements, the author explains how the book came to be. Dutch philosopher Rob Wijnberg told him he had a project. He wanted to launch a new kind of publication “with no news, no advertising and no cynicism”. That became De Correspondent and Bregman explains that the book is the result of working there for seven years, and of many of the conversations he had with readers over these years. This explains, perhaps, why the book is so varied. Anybody who has done research (academic, for work reasons, for a specific project, or out of personal interest) knows that once you start pursuing something, it’s easy to get side-tracked by bits of interesting information and go down the rabbit hole following those, because sometimes those discoveries feel more interesting than the original story, or simply because new things keep coming to light, and, well, you just need to know more.This book is roughly divided into two main halves. One where the author, after explaining his thesis about the nature of human beings (I’ll only tell you he calls us ‘Homo Puppy’. I’ll let you read the rest yourselves), he explores a large number of studies and arguments proposing that human beings are naturally egotistical, violent, aggressive…  and challenges many of those. Bombings during the war, psychology experiments (the Stanford prison experiment by Zimbardo, the Milgram experiment on obedience to authority involving electroshocks …), friendly foxes, Neanderthals, educational experiments, studies of old civilizations and ancestral bones, Easter Island, William Goldwing’s Lord of the Flies, Hobbes and Rousseau’s philosophical ideas among other, all are discussed and analysed. I was familiar with many of the studies, and even with some of the criticisms, later reappraisals and evidence against them, but not with all, and I have learned plenty and been inspired to dig deeper into some of the stories.  Although he supports all of his claims and interpretations with notes, he does it in an engaging way, and the result is an accessible and clever page turner.In the second half, Bregman shares examples of people and communities who have done things differently with impressive results.  I was aware of some, like the way Norway runs its prisons, but others made me pause (in particular, the reference to Jos de Blok, who runs a home healthcare organisation without heavy top-down management and allows the groups of workers to organise and manage themselves), and  I particularly enjoyed part 5, ‘The Other Cheek’ .  The author acknowledges that, of course, the instances he discusses are not perhaps as well-accepted and regarded as he thinks they deserve, and one example does not change everything, but he does maintain that an optimistic attitude can bring a positive change, and I hope he is right.He also includes, with some reluctance, ten rules to live by at the end of the book, and I cannot fault them, although they are not easy to implement. I have already mentioned the acknowledgments section, the notes, and the index, that occupy around 19% of the e-book.In sum, I enjoyed the book enormously, and I think most readers will get something positive out of it. I know not all reviewers are convinced by the author’s arguments, and that is to be expected, but I think no matter what conclusion you reach by the end of it, it offers plenty of food for thought. I definitely will be looking into some of the initiatives he talks about in more detail, and I will follow Bregman’s career with interest from now on. If you need a bright and well-argued book, full of hopeful content, don’t hesitate. Go for it."
61,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168981-douglas,5,"“What if propaganda not only sows discord, but can also bring people back together...”This line from the book defines the core of what I grasped from Brugman’s writing style. The underlying intent of the book is to make us aware that yes, in a certain sense, he is writing a ""propaganda piece""; he is spinning the narrative to promote his new realism. He is speaking of alternate facts to well-known truisms about human nature (we are always one small step away from lie, kill, cheat, steal). He is claiming that its time to get real: by seeing our fellow humans as friendly, helpful, kind, and peaceful, and, by spreading this news to others in real-time, we can shape a new reality though what he calls new realism. ""The war is over, if you want it."" But it won't end until we actively participate in forming such a reality.What is this new realism? If you have read his Utopia for Realists you might be familiar with proposals for a shorter workweek; basic income; open borders. In Humankind, he opens up our personal borders and allows us to let others in. There is very little sentimental writing or empathetic reasoning. His is a new realism, yes. And this realism is so surprisingly realistic that it can easily seem idealistic. And he backs up his words with deep research.He provides ample evidence that it can work and does work. His alternate facts are such that debunk others’ spun facts (see the original version vs Brugman's version of prison experiments, Lord of the Flies, Kitty Genovese). Bregman even calls out historians such as Harari and Diamond for weak research points. Where they seem to take for granted certain historical accounts, Bregman gracefully calls out where stories are born and he rewrites these myths. And they seem all the more realistic as he provides ample evidence for his case. This is one of Harari’s central tropes: that we tell ourselves stories. We heard it on the news, we saw it on YouTube and ... even if we don't believe it is true... we are still right in the midst of it. The stories we tell ourselves created money, society, religions. Bregman says its time to tune out from the stories others form for us, to tune out from the harmful news and online activity and tune into what is right in front of us. And, as Harari (though still vegan and trim and stoic) and kin grow larger in fame…certain storylines will be formed just as a canal is formed; some will be true and some will form into myth. Bregman is a tributary of these recent giants in intuitive-intellectual presentation and has this reader/reviewer interested in the streaming waters of this newly dug out waterbed. Thinking of making my home in his waters. The great thing about all of these streams is that they are all headed in the right direction. They swim against the waters, struggling to get upstream…once there, they reach new islands that promote a better vision. Bregman’s stories may also become mythic once he rises in popularity, and he is not without critics. But in a cosmos of cluttered, divisive thought, his hopeful history is a welcome one.This life stance of trusting others, seeing innocence before guilt, avoiding sensationalist news, personal gain…this has been my point of view throughout my life. Yes, at times I have been dominated, cheated, left behind, left bereft. But it has always felt true to me…it just seems realistic. “to believe people are hardwired to be kind isn’t sentimental or naive. ..it’s courageous and realistic to believe in peace and forgiveness.” I have been afraid to speak this point of view, fearful that this realism is too idealistic for our times. Brugman has helped me to internally articulate this position of “new realism” …now it’s time to let others know too."
62,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3677821-pete,3,"Humankind : A Hopeful History (2020) by Rutger Bregman is a curious book that is a mish-mash of various bits of history and psychology research that has a grand thesis that we’re all pretty decent folks and we should just be nice to each other and things will be grand. It’s appealing suggestion.Bregman starts out looking at how people have recently banded together in various trying times including the Blitz, the Allied bombing of Germany and after natural disasters. Bregman doesn’t pick the Holodomor or The Great Leap Forward where human behaviour under combined suffering was not nearly as noble.He goes on to look at how the idea that hunter gatherers were inclined to violence against each other and suggests that they were largely peacefuland disputes various claims by others including Steven Pinker. A bit of reading around on the internet appears to show that this is far from a fringe theory and may in fact be the case. But it’s far from clear that it was not the case either. Suggesting that war is due to agriculture and property is more than a bold claim.The book then looks at how various psychology experiments that showed that people can be made to do awful things, such as the Stanford prison experiment and the Milgram experiment were very poor experiments that shouldn’t be used to push the idea that it’s easy to get people to do ill. However, impressively while citing these dubious bits of research he goes on to cite SLA Marshall who claimed that most soldiers avoid shooting to kill. It’s worth quickly reading Marshall’s wikipedia entry, which includes the line “more recent historians have contended that much of the research he conducted for his most famous work, Men Against Fire: The Problem of Battle Command, was either biased or even completely fabricated.”There is an interesting bit on ‘Lord of the Flies’ and what happened to a real group of young men who were shipwrecked where the boys worked hard together to survive.The book looks at how prisons that concentrate on rehabilitation and try to treat people as well as possible do well, which does seem to be backed up by various justice systems around the world. There is also a foray into very free schools, which Bregman suggests are great at educating. However the one Bregman visits is failing to meet basic educational standards in the Netherlands, which made me laugh out loud.Bregman does some admirable work in collating the debunking of various false studies, but then accepts happily a few ideas that appeal to him.Humankind isn’t a terrible book, but it’s worse than his previous book ‘Utopia for Realists’. There are some interesting facts in there and Bregman writes well, but the book overall is pretty weak."
63,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126747-liz,5,"When I was a teenager, my class read Lord of the Flies. We didn’t just read it, of course: the backstory was pressed on us. William Golding was an unhappy teacher in a public school (obviously the epitome of a balanced, functional society) and so he decided that the veneer of civilisation over humankind was paper thin. Put a load of privileged boys who’ve never had to think for themselves, worry about money or resources, or deal with anything except avoiding bullies, on an island and take away the constraints of civilisation… and savagery comes to the fore very quickly. It’s a theory that goes back centuries, and it’s an assumption generations of British schoolchildren (much less privileged than those Golding dealt with) have grown up with.Here is Bregman’s story of a real life “Lord of the Flies” situation, and how it stacked up against the fictional one: https://www.theguardian.com/books/202... It went viral on social media last month, perhaps because, in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic, we are looking for stories of hope.Hope is hard to find at the moment. People are dying from covid-19 and its repercussions, governments all over the world are failing their citizens, racism is still playing out every day in so-called civilised societies, social media is polarising everyone, nobody has time to read beyond the headlines any more, fascism is on the rise, and the inevitable reality of climate change is looming ever closer in many people’s minds.So Rutger Bregman’s book is an extremely timely one. It doesn’t just strip away some of the fears about our impending collapse into savagery; it shows how they were built up, theory upon theory, and then explodes many of the layers that formed these fears and beliefs. There were serious problems with the Stanford Prison Experiment, for example (https://www.vox.com/2018/6/13/1744911...). There is growing evidence that before we became “civilised” into townships, life was much less violent. In fact, there is growing evidence that humans specifically evolved to be “friendly”. Bregman also cites the way wrongdoers are punished in Norway and their low rate of reoffending, in stark contrast to the high rates in the UK and the USA.This book doesn’t contain all the answers. No book does. But it lays out a strong case for believing in the *kindness* of humankind. And once we take away some of the fear about the world we currently live in, we can truly focus on making it better for everyone.Read this if you’re afraid or sad. Read it if you think we’re doomed. Read it if you need a reason to carry on. Read it, and your world will be a better place."
64,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49566607-ellen-dooren,4,"This book shows that for every negative philosophy, study or view on humankind, there are positive ones to balance it out.In the Netherlands this year started (again) with news on violence against employees of the emergency services during New Year's Eve. Then in the beginning of the year, the news was filled with items on violence with knives among teenagers. Then Corona happened and stories about scam in regard to face masks followed. All these stories aren't really beneficial to the believe that humankind is good by nature. So it is nice for once to read a book that is filled with examples that show is that humankind is indeed good by nature.The book shows us that there may have been much research and many events that have proven that humankind is bad by nature. That people will turn into bad people under the slightest amount of pressure or change, because that is who we are (not even that) deep down inside. There is nothing to be done about it. But when Bregman zooms in on the same research and events, there are plenty of details and evidence that might, in fact, prove the opposite. There is a clear ""rode draad"" throughout this book. However, consequently, to me, it sometimes felt a bit repetitive. In reviews I have seen arguments that Bregman simply wants his believe (that humankind is, in fact, good by nature) to be true so much, that he only writes those things that might to support this. And maybe that might be true. In fact, he starts the book by saying that he wrote this book to prove/support that very believe of his. So he basically admitted that. But for me it doesn't make this book less believable of less true, because the book shows us that for every negative thing you might believe, there is also an argument to believe the opposite. And on top of that, he explained that we, humankind, have a negative view on humans. We tend to believe the worst about ourselves and others and every time something negative is highlighted in the news (the exceptions) this proves this negative image. So it makes me wonder whether this criticism stating that the book maybe is too (forcefully) positive, might be caused by that very phenomenon (or maybe it's just me and I have been successfully brainwashed by this book).Anyway, no matter what you think about the way the book is written, it is so lovely to for a change be reminded of the good in us. With evidence."
65,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37218645-francis-djabri,5,"This book grabbed me right away and left me with a better sense of the world and recent events. The premise wasn't promising - Bregman is trying to make the case that we tend to have a very dim view of humanity, and by doing so we are causing ourselves collective harm. The last few years have made me pretty cynical and the last thing I wanted to hear was someone expounding a rosy view of humanity. But as I kept reading, the importance of Bregman's argument became more and more vital and in particular, it gives us a new way of thinking of how to respond to the injustice that we're seeing in the world today. By believing that we're fundamentally selfish and indifferent beings, it gives us the internal excuse to think that engagement and resistance isn't worth the effort. This whole book is aimed at deconstructing this belief. In doing so, Bregman takes aim at some of the most famous psychological studies of last century, which were taken as inviolable law when I studied psychology - Zimbardo's Prisoner experiment, Milgram's electroshock obedience experiments, and the stories of indifference to Kitty Genovese's murder. The murder of George Floyd has led to our own Kitty Genovese moment - we've all witnessed an act of murder and are processing how to respond. The horrific conclusion of the Kitty Genovese story was that we as a society didn't care and didn't want to get involved. But, through a forensic analysis, Bregman shows how this conclusion was, in fact, fake news. Normalizing a view that we are at root selfish and indifferent makes it easy for us to shrug when we see hatred and injustice. It makes it easy to endorse the view that when the looting starts, the shooting will start. It makes it easy to justify over-aggressive and racist policing policies that have led to so much of what we're seeing today. If we can recover an alternative view - that, as humans, we're in fact hard-wired to care, then when we see an evil act, it implies that we have to ask why it happens, it makes resistance worthwhile, and it impels us to act."
66,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10638965-robynne,5,"There is so much that I loved about this book, not the least of which is that it is written by an historian. In clear and accessible prose, Bregman challenges many of the beliefs about human nature that have shaped our social institutions. I admit that I am in complete sympathy with the arguments (so that could explain why I liked it so much). In my entire teaching and research career, I have questioned the notion that humanity is inclined to depravity and it is only the most rigid, and punishing, social structures that keep our depravity in check and stop us from killing one another. It was the political philosophy course I took as an undergraduate that began my thinking in this direction. In response to his question about why most people obey laws (why do we stop at stop signs, for instance), the professor strongly challenged students who responded that we obey laws in order not to be punished. He suggested that the reason might be more complex than the desire to avoid punishment. My research and thinking since then has shored up my position that the majority of people are not driven by self-interest. This is Bregman's premise: for the most part, humans are inclined to be good to one another. His carefully researched and clearly written book asks us to consider the possibilities of a world where ""realism"" is not cynicism but optimism.I believe that a peaceful, flourishing world is real possibility. I recognize that holding such a position requires a belief in the essential goodness of humanity. Some people consider that naive. This makes me appreciate Bregman's closing words: ""So be realistic. Be courageous. Be true to your nature and offer your trust. Do good in broad daylight, and don't be ashamed of your generosity. You may be dismissed as gullible and naive at first. But remember, what's naive today may be common sense tomorrow. / It's time for a new realism. It's time for a new view of humankind"" (397)."
67,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71618091-alexander-thomas,3,"Felt the need to write a review on this one. The title is fitting and the stories should give you a different mindset, which is a good thing.However, after giving anecdotal evidence, Bregman jumps to conclusions a lot and that bothered me.He twists the truth about the conclusions of the BBC prison experiment compared to the SPE. In the BBC prison experiment the researchers made it clear that the results were not representative for a couple of reasons; one of which was that the participants knew they would be broadcast on television and changed their behaviour accordingly.When comparing Neanderthals and chimps to humans, he gives examples of specific cognitive abilities in which the former are not inferior to the latter, and concludes they are as smart or even smarter than humans. Only to be trumped in social learning. Which is deceitful. And implying that Neanderthals were smarter than us because of their brain volume (MacBook air vs MacBook pro) is a simple fallacy, here he leaves the part in which extra brain size was used for scent and visual processing and motor control, and areas used for abstract thoughts, reasoning and language were smaller than ours. They would not beat us in a game of chess.His views about hunter gatherers who would be less aggressive and xenophobic in behaviour because they would ‘meet’ more people than the ‘tribe’ they lived in, exclude the in-group favouritism which is still inherent in humans, which is currently the reason for a lot of our problems.And another perspective on why there would be less gruesome big wars in prehistoric times is simply the amount of people living in the near vicinity.Next to this, Bregman patronizes the reader way too often, scientific articles and books he is ‘able’ to read are too difficult, boring or tedious for his readers. With this, he installs an authority bias in his readers, they should believe him solely on his word. He sounds a bit populist to me and could be compared to a Marxist in his view against Capitalism.I did really enjoy his view on empathy and the last few chapters on the new ‘realism’."
68,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5205285-jennifer-stringer,4,"In this book Rutger Bregman gives Richard Dawkins and his ""Selfish Gene"" a run for his money. His premise: that humanity made its great strides through millennia, not by acting solely in its own self-interest, but by looking out for each other and working together. He begins by pointing out that our ability to blush (we innately care what other humans think) and being the only animal with white eyes (better to communicate/track each others feelings) point to an evolution that developed to work together. He then goes through the landmark social experiments in selfishness and cruelty and assesses their procedures and outcomes. The infamous Stanford prison study and the Milgram electric shock experiment don't hold up to scrutiny. He goes into the Kitty Genevese murder and the creation of the bystander rule, and finds lack of true community as the fundamental flaw. He introduces us to the real-life Lord of the Flies boys who were stranded on deserted island for several months. It turns out, they became the best of friends and developed a bond that has lasted throughout their lives - so counter to what William Golding imagined. He even goes into the ultimate evil - the Holocaust - and shows how it's the outcome of NOT working together while only ""looking out for one's own"" when the fascists came for ""others.""In the last section he shows how societies that have adopted kindness and dignity within institutions get better results and are less expensive. It sounds Utopian, but the results are impressive.Bregman warns us that treating each other kindly in not for sissies. To suggest this as policy invites mockery and derision. You will be taken advantage and occasionally abused. But happens whether we are open and accepting of each other or suspicious and cautious of each other. Kindness is the braver choice, the cheaper choice and in most cases, the most effective choice. Just not the easiest. My only quibble - I wonder if he truly understands just how ingrained rugged individualism is in the American psyche. In some cases, it's served us well, in others, not so much. I'm not sure Americans will be early adopters, but who knows? Maybe we've had enough to the Trumpian world view and are ready for the pendulum to swing the other way.Anyway, a good read."

They come up with a thousand things, but don’t get heard because managers think that they have to go on some corporate retreat to dream up plans to present to the worker bees.""This is one of those books I’ll think about often because of the myriad topics it covers in a relatively small space. It’s a tall order to cover some of the most well-known psychological experiments, the Holocaust, politics, Lord of the Flies, the healthcare industry, and more, all while trying to convince the average cynic that “it’s not all as bad as you think.”I picked the quote at the beginning of this review because 1) relatable, and 2) there’s definitely this “us vs. them” dynamic to the book. How do you turn the Holocaust into something hopeful? The TLDR is that camaraderie is a thing, and if soldiers band together to protect one another, they’ll ultimately feel they’re doing something good. This, and some of the other conclusions drawn are a bit of a stretch. While I appreciate what Bregman is doing here, and while I understand “on the whole” maybe that people are inherently good… look at all the shitheads in this book who took advantage of good people! It’s hard to focus on one without considering the other, but I suppose that Bregman is trying to make a start by flipping the narrative around because it’s so easy for us to focus on the negative rather than the positive—especially in 2020 when every day is a new catastrophe.Anyway, this book will make you think and want to discuss.

It's only recently that I've entertained the idea that maybe pessimism isn't the best, and most realistic, route to take. Thanks to Bregman, I can better see the light. After reading this book, it seems near impossible to not be convinced of the innate goodness and compassion that we possess.Every chapter beings with recounting and explaining the origins of the supposedly most ""common-sense"" beliefs about our base inner nature--beliefs that I have easily identified with for most of my life. Then, through a combination of investigative journalism and research-based evidence, Bregman deconstructs and flips those arguments on its head to show just how misleading and malicious they were to begin with. All the events, factors, and interested parties that helped form this prevailing mentality that we are naturally evil (called ""veneer theory"") are exposed for all their deceptiveness and fallibility to prove that if anyone's naive, it's actually us cynics and pessimists. And he does all of this with humor and a contagious sense of optimism.Everyone needs to read this book. Especially those who think we're a hopeless species. In the midst of all kinds of news about inequalities, modern-day tribalism, authoritarianism, media propaganda, wars--the list goes on and on--it's easy to just flip the table in frustration and conclude fuck humanity. Are we misguided and misled sometimes? Sure. Are we capable of atrocities too? Yes. Bregman never denies them. But he nonetheless makes a strong case that we have been acting out of kindness, cooperation, and empathy. That we're still capable of more. That when push comes to shove, we still are fundamentally good. We just have to be willing to see it."

This book is, IMO, an antidote to hopelessness, cynicism and fatalism. - Bravo! Certainly not an easy task in 2020. And yet Bregmans approach is NOT hyperbole or glossing over facts, but rather to dive deep into the documents behind experiments, news-stories and trials we've most likely heard of. I hope many people will read HUMANKIND! (Not least my disillusioned ""prepper""-friends. Prepp away, but try to cultivate trust towards others also). If we have good reason to believe that humanity is - mostly - kind, we just might be able to carve out a future. This is good because ""giving up is not an option"" - Greta Thunberg Spoiler alert; While discussing over-policing Bregman mentions Eric Garners last words ""I Can't Breathe"". Poignant and quite eerie to listen to today, 13th of June 2020. (I am guessing the book was printed before May 25 and George Floyds murder).If you have not read Bregman before - also add his ""Utopia for Realists"" to your to-read-shelf. It changed my mind on a subject, which does not happen often."
72,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93434971-joseph,5,"Rutger Bergman is one of the great thinkers of our time. He challenges the notion that man is inherently evil by pointing out many of our basic perceptions and science on human behavior is either through fiction (books like lord of the flies) or flawed scientific studies (Stamford prison study..etc). He exposes many of these studies for pushing a narrative to gain attention and notoriety over truth. And he challenges the behavior expected based on a book to be quiet different when faced with an actual event of similar circumstances. Was war always part of mans life? Did Homo sapiens perpetrate an evil campaign to wash out the Neanderthals? How much does perception play in how we feel about ourselves and more importantly how we treat each other? These are just some of the questions asked and answered in Humankind to help put the idea of humans being bad on its head. Bergman believes man is good and he makes a positive argument that is welcomed in the dark times of 2020. His questions, perspective and advice are the sortof conversations that make a real impact in changing the world. I would say this book isn’t recommended reading, it’s required reading for all Humankind."

The fundamental principle of the book is something that I’ve disagreed with for a while, as I think all people have the capacity for great good as well as for evil... circumstances play a large role in how these will be expressed. I think about this quite a bit as someone who studies and has lived in conflict zones. In general, I love analyses that re-think fundamental assumptions, especially when new evidence has come to light or the original analysis could be construed in different ways but folks tend to highlight only one interpretation. I’m interested in the counter evidence he will give, as well as why he has an alternate interpretation of some famous studies. I also hope there will be a more extended description of the cast-away boys, I’d love to read an entire book only about their lives and experience, and hope someone else writes that."
74,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67710420-eric-salgado,5,"This book is fantastic. When I think about history, sociology, anthropology, and psychology books, I beg the heavens that the author can convey their arguments in an interesting, accessible, and dare I say, entertaining way. Bregman knocked this out of the park. I learned so much from this book and found the subject matter and the corresponding examples from history so compelling, it read like a novel. This is a rare feat. Bregman uses multiple disciplines to undergird his principal argument that humanity and people are inherently good. This could take the form of an arrogant or strident piece of writing. Bregman, though, tackles this Leviathan not only with great ease, but with an incredible humility often divorced from intellectual writing. He often identifies weaknesses or contradictions in his thinking and backs it all up with facts and heartwarming stories. I absolutely loved this book. I will now demand myself to shift my worldview and though I can’t promise I’ll always be successful, I will always have this book as a point of reference. "
75,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42525714-siri-andersen,5,"I think my favorite genre for reading is fantasy and YA fiction, especially with a hint of magic or supernatural stuff involved. That's why I surprised myself when I ended up buying this book at an airport book shop - but I am so glad I did. I've always had an interest in social anthropology, but I've never read about mankind's history in this way, and it has straight up blown my mind. Bregman takes a logical stance while debunking ""facts"" about humans and how we work, and forces you to think about it from a different point of view - and don't worry, there's plenty of research to back it all up. Now that I'm done reading this I feel a hunger for more literature in the same area, and I'll be scouring through the 53 pages of foot notes for tips on what to read next. I don't normally write reviews about books, but I felt like I'd be doing everyone a disservice if I didn't at least try to explain that this book has changed my life, and it most likely will change yours if you read it. I can just imagine how much we can all achieve together if we all thought about life this way! "
76,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1654645-deb-readerbuzz-nance,4,"Let me start by saying that this book rips to shreds all those negative theories about human behavior we learned in social psychology back in 1977. Bregman looks closely at the science behind those negative theories that arose from research long ago, and he discovers lots of flaws in the way the research was conducted. The author shares, in addition, lots of the research and anecdotes that support his idea that most humans are basically good. And he is able to explain the terrible things that have occurred throughout history in a way that supports this idea, noting that these occurred, in general, by people who thought they were doing things to make things better. Some of the things I took away from the book:Most guns are not fired in battle (only about 20% are).To destroy racism, people need to be around a diverse group of people.Power does corrupt good people.The twin brothers and Nelson Mandela story.Oslo prisons.Julio Diaz and his mugger.Agora, the school.Not empathy but compassion.Elinor Ostrom and her findings."
77,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98412277-kenny,0,"I strongly suggest this book. I feel like some of the reviews missed the point where it is interpreted as being overly optimistic or assuming that everything will be fine when humans are left on their own devices.It seems more like this book is to present data and/or anecdotes (which is one of the criticism, but let's admit that any books have anecdotes to support their claims too) to push a different narrative to create policies that favors better behaviors. And what we need to figure out is how to prevent the bad apples from making it worse for the rest and what led us to allow them to have a pass in their actions.We are stuck in the status quo and it isn't making things better. I wouldn't necessarily agree that we are living better in the 21st century as there is a rising level of mental health issues, depression and inequality. The threshold of the poverty line is so low as well that it's not a good metric to claim that people are less poor in the sense that they can live a dignified life.Overall, it's not a radical idea, but a much needed conversation to have in order to reassess our assumption of our human nature. Whether you're convinced or not, the book provides you with a different perspective that allows us to come up with new ideas that can possibly fix the root issue rather than applying patches over patches."
78,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93207240-anna-o-donnell,5,"Insightful and transformative. Bregman invites us to look at history from a fresh perspective and question the social sciences we’ve been told was human nature - the supposed selfish humanity. Further to this, Bregman questions the societal and political structures that we have been taught support our selfish humanity and poses alternative answers from the statistics and case studies currently available. I left this book with true hope in my neighbours and humanity as a whole. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the nature of humankind or those fascinated by some of the most well known social studies to date. I do however, hope this book is read by as many people as possible - Bregman debunks theories and poses alternative solutions to some of the major societal problems evident today."
79,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9939636-sarah,5,"I received an early copy of this book from a Goodreads giveaway. This book changed my mind about a few things. We get a full history of humans and their behaviors and tendencies. Later, Bregman breaks down a few longstanding psychology experiments and concepts that are not what they seem. I had to put the book down at this point because it made me angry, in a thoughtful way. Going back to it, there are a few more modern examples of humans coming together and what they might mean for our future. Ultimately, Bregman seems to argue that humans, when trusted and truly left alone, will be good. I do my best to trust people because it is the right thing to do. Here, you get science and history to show you why that really is the right thing to do. Give this book a read. It might change the way you think about people."
80,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6130111-janet,4,"The recent publication of this book by Rutger Bregman is so very timely. With injustice happening in so many places, we can reflect on the author's underlying premise that people are selfish and self-interested. Side-note... it makes me wonder how did someone like young Anne Frank then have the positive perspective that she shared in her diary: ""It's difficult in times like these: ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. It's a wonder I haven't abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart."" This book runs through the gamut of human history... from caveman days to now and is a psychologist's / sociologist's dream with the many studies of human nature and the impact our expectations can have on others as well as real life examples when people did and didn't do the right thing. There's a Top 10 list of to do's in the Epilogue such as... ""When in doubt, don't.... give people the benefit of the doubt; think in win-win scenarios; ask more questions; temper empathy and train your compassion; try to understand the other even if you don't know where they're coming from; avoid the news; don't hide doing good; and be realistic."" Net-net, Bregman shares that we haven't always been so horrible to one another and believes that we need to have high expectations of others to succeed."
81,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18915273-charles,3,"Inspiring Book Essentially focused on Rousseau’s idea that humans are innately good but social institutions corrupt us and make us distrustful. Fun to read, but I thought some of his anecdotes lacked strong evidence or seemed to be cherry-picking facts (e.g. his chapter on Easter Island’s civilization demise). But I thought some of the strongest chapter debunked widely known studies like the Stanford Prison Experiment and Milgram’s obedience experiments. But overall I think the book was a bit too simplistic. There are entire books written on some of the chapters he writes, and the arguments are much more nuanced than Bergman has time to cover in this book. "
82,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32853617-ana-valeria,5,"I had read Bregman's Utopia for realists a year ago and it made me rethink a lot of stuff which I thought were ""common sense"", so now I had a hunch he would do the same with this new book, and he did. Harari said Bregman challenged his views (and he did so very directly), and he has bravely done so too with Pinker, Diamond, Dawkins, etc. He is opening new debates about collective views that we call common sense or ""realistic"". I read this book in two days, and I rushed to recommend it to my friends. They told me ""I don't even want to read it, I know human beings just aren't good."" So if you're thinking the same I want to share the thesis of the book: ""This book is not a sermon on the fundamental goodness of people. Obviously, we’re not angels. We’re complex creatures, with a good side and a not-so-good side. The question is which side we turn to. My argument is simply this: that we –by nature, as children, on an uninhabited island, when war breaks out, when crisis hits– have a powerful preference for our good side."" This book hasn't given me every answer, but it has helped me raise better questions."
83,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82336049-marta,3,"Humankind is here to prove that people are kind by nature and, to some extent, I finished this book with some of my faith in humanity restored. ⁠⁠I didn't agree with everything the author said - I think his ideology was a little ""pushed"" and forced upon the reader at times, and when I checked some of his references, at least one of them didn't support his theory at all, which made me automatically question the rest of the book. ⁠⁠That being said, Rutger Bregman does have a point - while we're not all kind, selfless spirits, chances are most people aren't the calculating demons we tend to assume them to be. And even though some of his stories seemed quite irrelevant, others showed that, more often than not, we should give each other the benefit of the doubt.⁠⁠This was one of those books that, albeit interesting, took me a veeery long time to read and digest, since there was so much information being thrown my way. That being said, Bregman's writing is straight to the point and very accessible, so this isn't a difficult read in that sense.⁠⁠Do I think you should read it? Well, I think it's an interesting read that will probably teach you a few things - but I'd say to go for it with your eyes wide open, and to make sure you question what is shown to you as factual proof (as one should at all times, anyway). Thank you Bloomsbury Publishing for the free copy!⁠"
84,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40135226-aneta,5,"After reading ""Evil: inside human violence and cruelty"" I needed something to balance out these difficult emotions. These two books are like written for each other, they complement each other very well. First thing is, this book is not totally positive. Author goes deep in his reaserch and really tries to find reasons and positives in even the worst moments of history. I think for me the biggest surprise was his approach to last century social reaserches. He doesn't take anything for granted and goes through the most popular depressing reaserches, showing how manipulated they were in some cases. It's a very good read indeed."
85,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82800345-jacob-langham,4,"This was an interesting listen which really challenged my own biases and preconceptions regarding the selfishness of human nature, a notion that i too subscribed to. I can safely say that the examples provided have allowed me to understand that our future can be positive if we are able to foster communication and cooperation through compassion. Unfortunately, a sad reality is that hateful, controversial and pessimistic ideals are profitable for news media and are continually utilised for profit maximisation. Another key critique presented was a scathing review of cynicism, which was described as people justifying laziness through a weak personal philosophy. Overall, this was an impactful listen with many key statements that have definitely allowed me to see the world more openly. "
86,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43339755-maurits,5,"A must-read for everyone. Although I largely agree with Bregman, at times he gets a little too idealistic - even for me. Also, for some reason he finds it necessary to do some skull-measuring. This book could easily be the new scientific basis for race theory. Maybe he should've spent a few words on that. But besides that, it's an absolutely amazing book. Some of us already knew that humans are great, but Bregman argues it convincingly through all the scientific proof he has in his arsenal. "
87,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7885778-nadine,4,"A positive upbeat look at the positivity in humankind. I enjoyed the fact that the prologue was written by the author and actually wish he'd narrated the whole book as preferred his narration to that of the ""professional"".Some of the stories have a life already in the popular press, including that of the ""real Lord of the Flies"". I particularly liked the way in which the book was ""chunked"" and the different sections were introduced and summarised. In these difficult times it's a wonderful, upbeat book to read. "

It has more difficult language, accompanied by real life explanations and (critical thinking about) academic literature, made simple. He writes in a way to convince us, but taking on everyone's language; he is trying to convince us, but in the most friendly, Dutch way possible. He can be honest and is critical about his earlier work. Most of all: I kept thinking 'I want this and this person to read it because it can change their perspective a little more towards positive thinking'. "

I loved 'The Lucifer Effect' by Philip Zimbardo, but this book really challenges the conclusions put forth in that book and debunks a lot of Zimbardo as well as Milgrim's work.

92,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33393653-youssef-almkari,5,Outstanding. Humankind wraps our modern understanding of our species into one book. Addressing the old rhetoric with new research that helps mold why we have gotten to such a polirazed state. Rutger is a phenomenal writer who is easy to follow and who's work is a pleasure to read.

93,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62791754-kdv,5,"I loved this book. I first heard this author on Mehdi Hasan's podcast, and I liked the cut of his jib - smart, sassy, anti-authoritarian - so I looked forward to reading his books. This book, his latest, did not disappoint. Concise, engaging, and loaded with research indicating that humans don't, in fact, naturally lack kindness and compassion. We're lousy with the stuff! How freeing, to let go of our worst assumptions about our fellow man. I hope this book is widely read."

The narrative carried the material along well, lots of references... and I liked how he gave insights into how academic systems/knowledge work... and especially how he demonstrated how his own thinking had changed over time. A book with hope, combined with realism ... not sure agree with everything he says, but plenty to chew on! "
95,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81070107-grant,5,This book actually left me feeling a lot more positive about not only my future but the future of humankind. I was quick to put it down when first trying to read it as the intro left me feeling like Bregman was getting too ambitious but slowly but surely I he left me feeling a lot better about the future. Especially after spending the past year consuming Chomsky and learning about so much death and destruction. The ten rules at the end were a nice touch too.

In particular soldiers not wanting to kill enemy soldiers where he had about 4 or 5 examples and then this represented the countless conflicts throughout history. Hmm, not sure I'm convinced."

The author is willing to admit where he was wrong in his previous book (which I also enjoyed) which is a mark of scientist. We have all been subject to the conditioning that people are fundamentally selfish so this is a hard attitude to confidently discard as it obviously carries risk to our own concepts of self and society however I found the arguments persuasive so can, I think, let go of much of my learning as flawed at the time and even more obviously with hindsight."

The author writes from a left-liberal perspective, but his insights are not only thought provoking but largely convincing even for those who might have quite different political views. Bregman goes through multiple challenges to that positive view of human nature and makes a good case why we should discount them and tells us how a world that followssuch an actually realistic (positive) view of human nature looks like. Highly recommend - even more so if you’re sceptical!"
129,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10382692-tore,4,"I think this was a very good follow up read after reading Raworth's Doughnut Economics. They connect on the theme that we as a society have an overly cynical view of what humans want and what humans do. And this narrative in itself is restricting people from doing good. Based on a lot of empirical examples, and going back to original sources of famous experiments and historical moments, Bregman shows that many of the iconic images of human evil are severely misinterpreted if not straight up fabricated. People in general tend to be good to one another, and feel good about doing good. Some of the greatest reveals to me were about the over-directed Stanford Prison experiment, the sustainable Easter Island settlement, and the heroic bystanders. And I liked brief discussion on just how power corrupts (by creating dissociation from normal people).Bregman at several times confesses his bias to look specifically for positive angles on human behavior, so I appreciate those times he admits difficult aspects of humanity that cannot be refuted, such as the dark sides of otherwise posively connotated things like empathy and oxytocin. Although he obviously does not give the whole picture, I will agree that this book gives a much more ""real"" picture of humans than much else I have read."

It delves into a variety of subjects, history, genetics, social sciences, etc to determine whether or not human nature leads us to do good or not. Whether or not you agree with his final thesis or not, I guarantee it will affect the way you think about people in general. I highly recommend!"
131,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9412699-aaron,5,"The age-old debate between idealism and realism finds new and engrossing purchase courtesy of Rutger Bregman’s latest and highly engaging tome, HUMANKIND. Especially when “realism” has tipped far into cynicism for decades now, Bregman’s call for and foundation of a “new realism” is a much-needed reminder of the best instincts that we all possess. Those which have recurred all throughout human history, even in its darkest hours.While many have touted the book’s core premise as “humans are basically good”, don’t let that lull you into dismissing it as a naive or rosy-eyed take on our collective past. Indeed, Bregman approaches the subject again and again with an unwavering amount of skepticism, ever sourcing more examples to bolster the idea. At the same time, the book is just as much about how that innate goodness is easily perverted once power dynamics come into play.So are those power dynamics inevitable? Bregman posits that they are the tradeoff in our transition from a nomadic existence to modern civilization. While veneer theory holds that the latter is what keeps us from devolving into selfish savages, Bregman makes a very strong case for the collective cooperation exemplified in the hunter-gatherer societies of yesterday and still today. And we see those collectives re-emerging in the locality of neighborhood exchanges. Community gardens, farmers markets, shared subsistence.No doubt those invested in “civilization’s” established hierarchies of winners and losers will again fall back on dismissing this book’s ideas as “socialism.” It is as yet unclear how much longer that tired trope will hang on. Meanwhile Bregman has amassed a wealth of examples which demonstrate the societal success of localized togetherness, from the stiff upper lips of Londoners during the Blitz, and New Orleanians looking out for one another in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.2020 is a year which is truly putting all of these premises to the test. As always, the emphasis on “breaking” news draws our attention foremost to the most divisive aspects of the rifts splintering out of a public health crisis writ large. HUMANKIND lays out a framework for us to zoom out and recognize the larger impetus shared by people of all persuasions towards shared survival and the movement towards a more just society.The work continues. And reading HUMANKIND provides a most welcome salve to encourage those of us committed to the work. Up with humanity."

135,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109111732-katie-smith,5,"Undeniably one of my favourite non-fiction books ever. Bregman takes a unique stance in dismissing thoughts that the human kind are doomed and inherently bad. He debunks several famous experiments which are constantly cited by professors of social science such as the Stanford Prison Experiment. It just goes to show that the proof is always in the caveats, rather than the headlines. Also, its evident throughout this book the sheer amount of research that has gone into it - which is worth 5 stars alone in my opinion. I'd very strongly recommend this to anyone, particularly anyone with a keen interest in Psychology, human history and economics. It also nicely complements (or contrasts) Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari. "

It is a very deft blending of a range of genres and scholarly disciplines. It is also extremely easy to digest, with Bregman's self-effacing tone making it approachable. So here we have history, psychology, evolutionary biology, and a bit of self-help, too. When's the right time to mention Bregman is an authority in not a single one of these fields?A tasteless and ahistorical preface on the Blitz kicks off this book, and the rest tries hard to keep up with the tonal whiplash of insisting on the innate goodness of people while they cheer their sons bombing the shit out of another country's civilians. He has a go at the obvious rejoinder (if people are good then why did the Holocaust take place?) but he simply doesn't spend enough time with the subject so it reads as graceless as the rest.Bregman makes very blunted, polite criticisms of forebears of this genre of popular non-fiction like Malcolm Gladwell, Jared Diamond, Steven Pinker and Yuval Noah Harari, but Breman mythologizes as much as he myth-busts. Once Bregman throws the reader with a jaw-droppingly thin bit of analysis, there is very little reason for the reader to maintain their trust in him. As a point of fact (and no thanks to Bregman), I don't fundamentally disagree with his thesis. Rather, Bregman's undertaking of it is feeble and disingenuous. That is a shame, but also par for the course for the Smart Thinking section."

138,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2515770-justus,4,"There is a long running philosophical battle between Locke and Hume. Are humans ""noble savages"", fundamentally good at heart who have been turned bad by civilization? Or are they ""red in tooth and claw"" and only a thin veneer of civilization keeps us from regularly lying, cheating, and murdering.Bregman sets out to convince you that humans are, deep down, fundamentally good and he makes a fairly persuasive case.There is a persistent myth that by their very nature humans are selfish, aggressive and quick to panic.Most of Bregman's book can be summed up in his opening section about the book Lord of the Flies. A group of children are shipwrecked and surprisingly quickly revert to violence and savagery. Most people think this is ""true"" in a deep and fundamental sense; that it is fiction but is an accurate reflection of man's nature. Contrasted against that fictional account we have the real world account of six school boys fron Tonga who were shipwrecked for over a year in 1965-66. They never reverted to violence and savagery. They remained friends during the entire ordeal. Which account is ""realistic""? Which one paints a true picture of humankind?Since Bregman's goal is to knock down this persistent myth, much of the book is taken up with ""debunking"". Depending on how widely read you are, you may find that ""there's nothing new"" in what Bregman writes. We've probably all heard about the Stanford Prison Experiment showing how easily normal people turn into sadistic prison guards. We now know -- thanks to opened archives -- that the whole thing was a sham. We've probably all heard about the Milgram Experiment where normal people ""just followed orders"" and began torturing students. We now know that that was also a sham. We've probably all heard about Kitty Genovese being murdered while dozens of people stood by doing nothing. We now know that also isn't true.Bregman marshalls evidence to make the case that our genetics and evolution has made humans predisposed to kindness and peace. We are ""ultrasocial learning machines"". Babies have built-in senses of fairness and morality. Strangers routinely help one another, especially in times of natural disaster. That war was essentially non-existent in the distant past.While there are thousands of cave paintings from this time about hunting bison, horses and gazelles, there’s not a single depiction of war.Bregman, likes Jared Diamond and Yuval Noah Harari, pins a lot of our current woes on the rise of agriculture 10,000 years ago. Humans began settling down in fixed locations and local tyrants could start skimming off surpluses. Suddenly kicking the local bully out began harder and harder. Eventually we get a series of societies essentially run by self-interested sociopaths who assume everyone else is just like them and build a society around that assumption and around maintaining the power of a privileged elite. And it is only in the past 50 or 100 years that we've finally started to climb out of that ""dark age"".Underpinning all these books is the premise that, when civilisations fail, everything gets worse, plunging the world into ‘dark ages’. Modern scholars suggest it would be more accurate to characterise those dark ages as a reprieve, when the enslaved regained their freedom, infectious disease diminished, diet improved and culture flourished.Bregman acknowledges that bad things get done in our world. It isn't all rainbows and ponies. But instead of chalking that up to a universal bestial nature barely kept in check by civilization, Bregman suggests it is our kinder impulses getting hijacked.The road to hell is paved with good intentions. But evil doesn’t live just beneath the surface; it takes immense effort to draw it out. And most importantly, evil has to be disguised as doing good.On top of that, he argues we're seeing a ""nocebo"" at work. There's a famous finding that the more students study economics, they more selfish they become. But the same thing replicates everywhere in human interactions. His fear is that humankind started out kind and gentle and supportive but is coming to believes its own myths -- especially with the rise of modern ""if it bleeds, it leads"" news -- that it is actually brutal and selfish. And then when you treat everyone as if they are brutal and selfish...they start acting that way. You've created a self-fulfilling prophecy of human behaviour.Unfortunately after making his case, Bregman still has approximately 30% of the book to go. Okay, he's convinced you -- or at least made you willing to entertain the idea -- that humans are ""default good"". Where the book falls down -- and what keeps it from being a 5-star book for me -- is where he goes next. We get a series of thought-provoking and inspiring anecdotes from around the world of possible different paths.What makes us so eager to believe in our own corruption? Why does veneer theory keep returning in so many permutations? I suspect it has a lot to do with convenience. In a weird way, to believe in our own sinful nature is comforting. It provides a kind of absolution. Because if most people are bad, then engagement and resistance aren’t worth the effort.The whole is just a bunch of anecdotes strung together, which is never going to be especially compelling. And here especially ""there's nothing new"" in the book weighs against it. We hear about the Dutch healthcare organization Buurtzorg. We hear about the French car part firm FAVI. But I read Frederic Laloux's Reinventing Organizations back in 2014 and already know the anecdotes about these companies. We hear about Norwegian maximum security Halden prison. But back in 2012 I hear all the stories about it after Anders Breivik committed his mass murder and was sentenced there.So despite the very strong first two-thirds, I found the final one-third a bit mediocre. Perhaps if all those anecdotes are new to you, you'd find it more compelling, though.For ages, we’ve assumed that people are selfish, that we’re beasts, or worse. For ages, we’ve believed civilisation is a flimsy veneer that will crack at the merest provocation. Now we know this view of humankind, and this perspective on our history, is utterly unrealistic."
139,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105791880-george-jacobs,5,"“Most people, deep down, are pretty decent”Bregman is a historian who became a journalist and book author. His central message is that people are mostly good and should usually be trusted to do good. For example, he supports universal basic income. In the book’s, “kind” in “humankind” has the double meaning that humans, most of the time are kind to each other; he doesn’t discuss whether humans are kind to other animal species. Bregman spends much of the book attempting to debunk famous events, studies, scientific books, and fiction that have painted humans as selfish, extrinsically motivated, and naturally warlike. Let’s begin with Lord of the Flies, by Golding, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature. A group of preadolescent boys are stranded on an uninhabited island. True to the stereotype of humans as having only a thin veneer of civilization, the children turn on each other and establish a ramshackle society worthy of a cruel dictatorship. To counter this, Bregman has unearthed a true-life story of a group of boys who were shipwrecked for 15 months and established a well-ordered harmonious society (Bregman, 2020). Bregman also questions two famous studies frequently cited to support the thesis that humans can’t be trusted to act decently. In Milgram’s (1963) obedience study, participants followed the experimenter’s orders and delivered increasingly strong electric shocks to other people. In reality, no shocks were administered, but the fact that the research participants were willing to “harm” others at the experimenter’s command was seen as a confirmation that the acts of guards at WWII concentration camps was a true indication of typical human thinking. Similarly, Zimbardo and colleagues (Haney, et al., 1973) found that mistreatment of the less powerful was a phenomenon that could occur among any people where a power gap existed, rather than being due to any special traits of people who ended up in life as prisoners or took jobs as prison guards. In this study, participants were randomly assigned to be either prisoners or guards in a prison constructed especially for the research. Although the study was designed to last two weeks, sadistic treatment by the “guards” emerged on the first day and became so bad that the study needed to be stopped after only six days. These two studies, along with The selfish gene (Dawkins, 1976), one of the best-known science books of the 20th century, are still cited to justify a negative view of human nature. However, as often happens in science, the pendulum swings, and now, one-fifth of the way through the 21st century, the two studies have been broadly questioned (e.g., Hollander, 2015 and refuted, as has much of the evidence Dawkins used to support his claims. It should be emphasized that Bregman does not claim that most humans are angels, only “pretty decent”. The book’s most eye-opening part begins with a description of selective breeding of silver foxes, a notoriously fierce species, to develop a group of silver foxes who were friendlier. Not only were these foxes friendlier, they also developed childlike physical characteristics similar to those of domesticated dogs: drooping ears, shorter snouts, thinner bones, males looking more like females. Plus, they had fewer stress hormones, more “happy” hormones, serotonin and ocytocin, and, at least in some ways, more smarts. Bregman suggests that homo sapiens differ from Neanderthals in ways both physical and psychological that are similar to the differences between the control group of silver foxes and the friendlier ones (Hare, 2018). Bregman believes these changes in humans occurred about 50,000 years ago when Neanderthals disappeared and human culture leapt forward to include sharpening stones, canoes, and cave paintings. We became weaker, our brains were smaller, but we were better adapted to our environment, blessed with what Bregman labels our “true superpower,” our superior ability to do social learning. His analogy is “If Neanderthals were a super-fast computer, we were an old-fashioned PC – with wifi. We were slower but better connected.”Based on his generally positive view of people, Bregman offers ten suggestions. What strikes me about the suggestions is their overlap with suggestions from Positive Psychology (Seligman, 2011) and Social Interdependence Theory (Johnson & Johnson, 2009), the latter being a key theory behind the use of cooperative learning in which students sometimes learn together. The first suggestion is to assume the best about other people. This resonates with Seligman’s emphasis on building relationships with others as an essential aspect of a flourishing life. We cannot build close relationships if we constantly worry that others are out to cheat us. Yet, we need to accept that fact that sometimes we will be cheated, which Bregman calls “a small price to pay for the luxury of a lifetime of trusting other people.” A second suggestion by Bregman is to look for win-win solutions. This is similar to the concept of positive interdependence in cooperative learning, i.e., that our outcomes are correlated with the outcomes of others. In other words, we sink or swim together. This interdependence applies not just among humans but with our fellow animals as well. For example, human consumption of other animals for food, means that billions of chickens, fishes and others die horrible deaths in the grip of the factory farming system, while human health suffers from the harmful substances in animal-based foods, such as saturated fats and plastics (Miranda & de Carvalho-Souza, 2016). One of Bregman’s suggestions that was new to me was to replace the Golden Rule with the Platinum Rule. The Golden Rule, of course, is to do onto others as we would want them to do onto us. However, perhaps not everyone will want what we want. This where the Platinum Rule offers an improvement; we should ask people what they want. This fits well with student-centered learning, an approach to education that resonates with cooperative learning. In student-centered learning, students have input into what and how they learn (Jacobs, Renandya, & Power, 2016). "
140,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74552277-naqvi-hussain,5,"In all fairness, I didn’t think that a journalist who came to the limelight after kicking Tucker Carlson in the nuts and triggering WEF Davos’s tax-evading elites, could possibly write a book on something as important as human nature. But Bregman blew me. Maybe because I had almost no expectation from this book. “Zip, Zero, Zilch”Humankind could have been a book complementary to Pinker’s magnum opus, Better Angels of Our Nature. Yet, Bregman railed against Pinker for not being more positive! Bregman shows that Pinker got two of his data wrong. Another big shot that tastes the fist of Bregman is Jared Diamond LOL. There were things that Diamond got wrong in his book Collapse. I’m not sure how much criticism this poor guy can take in his old age. From Giridharadas to Bregman—it’s just not stopping. Speaking of Diamond, Humankind confirms us Diamond-Harari’s controversial claim “Agricultural revolution was history’s biggest fraud” IS valid. It’s debatable I guess, but Bregman just puts forward his case as to why he thinks that. Also, bashing Malcolm Gladwell seems like an easy sport to play, huh? Haha. Humankind is, in essence, a history book with a lot of modern-day case studies and psychological findings that bolster Bregman’s arguments. And speaking of psychology, Bregman showed, yet again, why some of the things Gladwell popularized in his book Tipping Point can’t be trusted.PART 2—the book is divided into 5 parts— is mostly about debunking some of the most popular psychology experiments like the Stanford Prison Experiment, Milgram’s experiment, etc. Also if pop-psychology is not your thing, you might want to think twice—those debunkings are fun at least. I see a lot of Zimbardo fans in the group—you guys should read it. I also see A LOT of books on war in this group. And when the central argument of the book is that most people deep down are nice, people instantly would ask: what about all the atrocities committed and are still being committed? Bregman has an explanation for this as well. PART 1, as much as I can remember, is mostly about history before farming, Jared Diamond, and the philosophical battle between Hobbes and Rousseau. Pinker takes Hobbes’ side and Bregman Rousseau’s. It’s an interesting argument and I think Pinker fans should definitely consider reading it—the two even sat for an interview! The interview went a little off-track but Bregman came off strong. Anyways, so the chapters in which he talks about history prior to the agricultural revolution, is NOT just about WHAT happened but also about HOW certain things came to be—which, in my opinion, is more riveting. But I also need to make this clear that Bregman doesn’t quite claim that we are all angels. And to explain that he talks about the “nocebo” effect (opposite of placebo) here. Almost all of us know about this “nocebo” effect but Bregman puts it in a much grander context. If we can get rid of the effect, the implications are quite revolutionary and there are scientists backing him up. It is PART 3 of the book that Harari fans would absolutely love. It is where Bregman metamorphoses into a Harari-esque big picture historian. This is the chapter where he explains how power corrupts. To explain that he blends Harari’s central thesis (myth/ inter-subjective entities) and Machiavelli’s Prince. He also obviously refers to psychological studies to bolster his argument. Some other sections of this part are only based on Harari (I think). Though it’s not a regurgitation of Harari’s Sapiens. And a teeny-tiny criticism of Harari exists too. Also, there’s more, not just Harari.   Don’t have much to say from Part 5.The book also ends with 10 Commandments where the author gives you some advice. Now before you scoff at the the sketchy self-helpish vibe that the book has already started giving you, the advice are more in the vein of the ones Rosling laid out in his book Factfulness but grander. Bregman also asserts the problems with some types of self-help books. PART 4 explains from where we can go from here. Now that we know all these, what do we do? So much of society is designed based on Hobbesian notion of human nature. Bregman explains on how, with this Rouseauvian view of humanity, we can create better schools to foster children’s passion, how we can create better work-place/ business/ corporations to utilize people’s talent more efficiently, on how we can create better prison system to bring down crime rate and last but not the least how we can create truer democracies. Now I understand that a lot of these big-idea books can be too naively utopian—I am very well aware of that. Also I know a lot of pretentious arm-chair historians who read detailed accounts of Roman emperors’ sex lives from vintage leather editions, would whine about the lack of nuances in the history presented by Bregman. And I would agree: there are times that the book is a little too simplistic. I also certainly don’t believe that the suggestions (like participatory budgeting proposed in part 4 of the book) would work wonders everywhere. A lot of psychology studies might not be as conclusive as Bregman makes out to be. The book is still fresh off the pot—so serious critical reviews are yet to come out that I am eagerly waiting for. I only see good ones. However, one came out in The Guardian couple of days ago but that is nothing more than a hate piece written by a man going through his mid-life crisis. But at least I think the book would help to teed up a crucial conversation. And also to Bregman’s credit, the accessibility of the book would act as a “gateway” to more serious literature for a lot of people interested in these topics.  Also yes, just like Stephen Fry, I would “hugely, highly and highly recommend” reading it  "
141,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76424465-mark-kwesi-appoh,5,"Bregman's excellent book could be the starting point for a new movement that leverages the power of trust in humanity. That might sound sappy, but while reading this book brimming with fascinating stories you start to realise how cynical and, yes, wrong our conception of humankind is. Bregman revisits loads of world-famous psychological experiments, looks at them from a different perspective and draws stunningly fresh conclusions. Strongly recommended to every member of humankind."

Biologist and anthropologist Henry Huxley, known as 'Darwin's Bulldog' called life ""one great battle of man against man and of nation against nation“; George Gervin labeled man's inclinations the 'mean world syndrome', which included qualities of cynicism, misanthropy, and pessimism. That humans are innately selfish has been philosophically anchored by thinkers like ""Thucydides , Augustine, Machiavelli, Hobbs, Luther, Calvin, Burke, Benton, nature, Freud, our Founding Fathers."" Contemporary popular culture, film, and literature continue to advance pessimistic notions. He begins with William Goldman's Lord of the Flies  that presumes children at the core are combative and competitive. Going back to evolutionary history he posits that post-Neanderthal inventions such as sharp stones, fishing lines, bows and arrows as well as canoes and painting, made man physical weaker. How to survive in this more dependent and increasingly complex world? He refers to early humans as 'homo puppies'. ""Human ￼beings, it turns out, or ultra social learning machines. We are born to learn, to bond and play. Blushing, after all is quintessentially social.: ""It’s people showing they care what others think which fosters trust and enables cooperation.”￼ One of my favorite facts is that, unlike other animals,￼ you can see the whites of our eyes: “The object of attention is plain for all to see.” It was actually the ability to grow plants that made man territorial and beset strive.Another chapter revisites the missing civilizations and monoliths of Easter Island. It was not warring tribes nor the myth that the people were ""primitive cannibals"" that caused the population to disappear. On the contrary, it was disease, a plague of rats, and ills brought from outside. Foreign visitors eventually ""pushed it off a cliff."" The rest of the book counters and debunks presumed notions about cruel human nature. Fairly well-known experiments like the Stanford Prison, an investigation on the psychological effects of perceived power, or Stanley Milgram's experiments on obedience, are shown to have been tilted toward the more sensational, coercing negative responses. He goes onto discuss the evil in places like Pol Pot's Cambodia, and German Concentration Camps. The cause for such cruelty in such places is often the basic need to belong and not inherent evil. He illustrates how goodness also thrives in the worst of circumstances. Ironically, as of this writing the former schoolteacher known as Duch, the most notorious killer during the Khmer Rouge’s reign of terror in Cambodia in the 1970s, who recently died in prison. Even this monster with his twisted ethics had psychological motivation as well as an impetus to obey. From his Times Obituary: ""A panel of court-appointed psychiatrists said that Duch was “meticulous, conscientious, control-oriented, attentive to detail and seeks recognition from his superiors,” and that he exhibited “a strong presence of obsessive traits.” It continues: “How do human beings become part of a project of mass murder?” asked Alexander Laban Hinton, the author of “Man or Monster?” (2016), a book about Duch. “It’s too easy to dismiss people as sociopaths or psychos. Instead you really have to grapple with their humanity.” Also there was the recent passing of Sophia Farrar at 92. Kitty Genovese's murder in 1964 was a notorious example of apathy, that people 'don't want to get involved'. The common report that no one came to the aid of the screaming victim was false and misleading. The lesson was applied for decades as sociological evidence of contemporary detachment from our fellow citizens. Bregman revisits the false construction of that history. Sophie Ferrar was the heroine who, according to her Times Obituary was ""the unsung heroine who cradled the body of Kitty Genovese and whispered “Help is on the way” to Genovese as she lay dying. There are many other examples that encourage reassessment of our assumptions about man's evil nature. The book is clear and simple and filled with scientific and documented evidence.Humankind , at the very least, it compels us to rethink deeply embedded pessimistic assumptions about human nature. The Epilogue offers suggestions for how we might tap into our better natures.Assume the bestOptimism breeds optimismAsks questions to understand people's motivations and perspectivesUnderstand the difference between empathy, which can be enervating, and compassion, which is 'controlled , remote and constructive'. Self awareness and confidence lead to a greater feeling for othersWatch the news in smaller dosesKill with kindness. Don't presume you need to go to battle over every squabble and disagreement."

I know I write long reviews, so I wanted to give a heads up to those who prefer a brief one. I loved this book. Why? I picked up this book based on NetGalley’s recommendations as good read for these current times when things feel quite tough and most people feel quite negative. And they were right. It’s difficult to read this book and not feel more optimistic by the end of it, even if you might not be absolutely convinced by all of the author’s arguments. It is engaging, easy to read, compelling, it includes a large variety of studies from many disciplines (criminology, sociology, anthropology, history, economics, ethnology, biology, literature…), and I think most readers will be familiar and/or intrigued by many of the topics he touches on. And it does look at all of those with new eyes. It also collects a large number of positive examples of human behaviour, so, if you need an injection of optimism, I recommend it. There is a detailed index, and plenty of notes, but as I said, it is a book written for the general public rather than for academicians or experts, and no specialist knowledge in any of the fields it touches on is necessary to enjoy it.In the acknowledgements, the author explains how the book came to be. Dutch philosopher Rob Wijnberg told him he had a project. He wanted to launch a new kind of publication “with no news, no advertising and no cynicism”. That became De Correspondent and Bregman explains that the book is the result of working there for seven years, and of many of the conversations he had with readers over these years. This explains, perhaps, why the book is so varied. Anybody who has done research (academic, for work reasons, for a specific project, or out of personal interest) knows that once you start pursuing something, it’s easy to get side-tracked by bits of interesting information and go down the rabbit hole following those, because sometimes those discoveries feel more interesting than the original story, or simply because new things keep coming to light, and, well, you just need to know more.This book is roughly divided into two main halves. One where the author, after explaining his thesis about the nature of human beings (I’ll only tell you he calls us ‘Homo Puppy’. I’ll let you read the rest yourselves), he explores a large number of studies and arguments proposing that human beings are naturally egotistical, violent, aggressive… and challenges many of those. Bombings during the war, psychology experiments (the Stanford prison experiment by Zimbardo, the Milgram experiment on obedience to authority involving electroshocks …), friendly foxes, Neanderthals, educational experiments, studies of old civilizations and ancestral bones, Easter Island, William Goldwing’s Lord of the Flies, Hobbes and Rousseau’s philosophical ideas among other, all are discussed and analysed. I was familiar with many of the studies, and even with some of the criticisms, later reappraisals and evidence against them, but not with all, and I have learned plenty and been inspired to dig deeper into some of the stories. Although he supports all of his claims and interpretations with notes, he does it in an engaging way, and the result is an accessible and clever page turner.In the second half, Bregman shares examples of people and communities who have done things differently with impressive results. I was aware of some, like the way Norway runs its prisons, but others made me pause (in particular, the reference to Jos de Blok, who runs a home healthcare organisation without heavy top-down management and allows the groups of workers to organise and manage themselves), and I particularly enjoyed part 5, ‘The Other Cheek’ . The author acknowledges that, of course, the instances he discusses are not perhaps as well-accepted and regarded as he thinks they deserve, and one example does not change everything, but he does maintain that an optimistic attitude can bring a positive change, and I hope he is right.He also includes, with some reluctance, ten rules to live by at the end of the book, and I cannot fault them, although they are not easy to implement. I have already mentioned the acknowledgments section, the notes, and the index, that occupy around 19% of the e-book.In sum, I enjoyed the book enormously, and I think most readers will get something positive out of it. I know not all reviewers are convinced by the author’s arguments, and that is to be expected, but I think no matter what conclusion you reach by the end of it, it offers plenty of food for thought. I definitely will be looking into some of the initiatives he talks about in more detail, and I will follow Bregman’s career with interest from now on.

149,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91651788-ben-jones,4,"I see a lot of the reviews for this book giving it low ratings on the inaccurate basis that Bregman's authorial objective was to establish humans as inherently good. This is not the case. Bregman is not trying to establish humans as inherently good; instead, he is trying to challenge the common view of humankind as inherently evil and offer the powerful idea that humans often behave how they are viewed (thus, opening the door for more egalitarian political, social and economic systems). 1-10 Takeaways:1) Humans are the only primates that blush and have whites in their eyes. Meaning, biologically we are better equipped to convey our emotions/intentions so as to cooperate. Overtime, humans have not only conquered out of cooperation but the most cooperative humans bred the most, resulting in modern humans being hyper cooperative (I guess not outliers like Genghis Khan, haha). 2) Political and economic systems that presuppose human immorality in fact encourage immoral behavior. The US, with mass incarceration and harsh treatment of inmates, has the highest recidivism rate. Norway, with the most amenities for inmates/positive view of inmates or humanity, has the lowest recidivism rate. The more people study economics (human selfishness in certain scenarios), the more selfish they are in economics studies. 3) Many of the ""landmark"" examples of human immorality are incorrect. The Stanford Prison Experiment has since been disproven. Those running the experiment told the ""guards"" that they were doing this experiment to show the harmful state of prisons in the US and needed them to be intense/cruel. This both egged on the guards but also shows that the focus of the experiment was never supposed to be the ""guards"" being inherently cruel. Also, the ""prisoner"" students were originally promised that they would be given time to complete homework; but, that promise was later revoked. ""Prisoners"" then began trying to get out of the experiment and learned that if they feigned break downs, they would be able to leave early so as to complete homework. The Milgram Experiment (people being told by authority figures to shock others when they didn't learn something correctly) has since been disproven as well. In Milgram's own diary, he doubted the validity of his experiment. Most participants suspected that the shocks weren't real and told the scientists this after (detail not included in the findings). Also, the participants were told repeatedly at the beginning of the importance of their participation for the benefit of society; so, many participants said that they kept delivering shocks out of a desire to help humanity as a whole (the first of many examples that human friendship/loyalty has a dark side/capacity for evil). A man named Marshal was asked to interview American soldiers after battles in WWII and found that only 15-20% of soldiers actually fired their guns at the enemy (also, in the Civil War, most muskets were found loaded with multiple shots, meaning soldiers didn't want to shoot and instead spent their time pretending to reload). This was obviously frustrating for US military leadership so they incorporated some intense tactics to encourage soldiers to fire at the enemy which led to 90% of American soldiers firing their guns at the Vietcong. Because of this, PTSD and other mental illnesses were much higher for returning Vietnam War soldiers (we ""kill"" a part of ourselves when we harm others). Nazis' diaries reveal that their loyalty to Germany was much more due to their love for each other than their hatred of anyone else. They really didn't want to let each other down. 4) The more powerful you are, the more ""damaged"" your brain has become. Powerful people (political, business, etc.) were put into a brain scanner and the portions responsible for empathy had greatly diminished. People in power are also less capable of shame (don't blush, etc.). Our political and economic systems with inherent suspicion of human immorality, are rewarding those who fight basic human empathy and slowly become shameless. 1-10 Questions: 1) Ever since WWII, has a military conflict been ""successful""?2) Is communism too far when trusting the capacity for good in humans? Or, is it not an issue in trusting human good; but instead, an issue with centralized planning?"
150,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4756170-daniel,5,"Human beings are kind and always want to do good. The author busted every single famous creed that we are all evil and are only protected from each other by civilisation. He sure stepped on all the famous experts... This is surely one of the most important books of the century! 1. Civilian bombing in World War 2: did not dampen morale at all. 2. Lord of the Flies: William Golding’s novel is just a story. Golding hated people... Real life group of shipwrecked boys from Tonga cooperated, shared work, fixed the leg fracture of one of the boys, and did not allow prolonged quarrels. 3. Selfish Gene: Dawkins is wrong. Homo sapiens prevailed over the Neanderthals (who had bigger brains) because we are friendly and can learn from each other. 4. Jared Diamond’s Easter Island people: he is wrong about the internal Collapse, infighting etc. There were never as many Easter Islanders as he thought, and they were doing fine until Europeans brought diseases, and slave Traders from Peru took away the strong. 5. During all wars, only 15% of soldiers fired and killed anybody. 6. Zimbardo’s Stanford prison: it was a hoax! One of the guards was the mastermind of the whole sadistic experiment. The guards were not left alone and then turn to become monsters; they were instructed to be harsh to the prisoners. The college students all just wanted to contribute to scientific knowledge. Do bad in order to do good. 7. Milgram’s electric shock: more than half of the subjects did not believe it was real. Almost all who believed it was real, stopped. The man in lab coat coerced the subjects. 8. Kitty Genovese’s murder in Queens: the reporters did not report the truth. Someone did call the police. She died in the arms of her neighbour and friend. The bystander effect is not real: actually more people are willing to help if they can communicate. Moseley the murder was caught a week later while burgling because a neighbour called the police. He died in prison after serving 52 years. 9. Nazi killers: the Danes just refused to kill the Jews, hiding them and helping them escape to Sweden. 10. Why are German soldiers so hard to beat? Friendship amongst its units. So are terrorists. 11. People can be trusted to manage themselves. Taylorism is nonsense. Many examples of small teams that manage themselves prove that managers are not necessary. 12. Children can learn themselves too, but standardised testing destroy these paradise. 13. Norwegian prisons prepare inmates to go back to society as a neighbour, not as sociopaths. The guards carry no weapons and mix with the inmates. It costs more, but when the inmates go back to society, recidivism rates are halved so they make good neighbours and pay taxes, and save money on further law enforcement. 14. Even in the trenches during the First World War, in Christmas 1914 German soldiers celebrated with the Allies soldiers at the frontline. Everyone on the frontline were happy except one guy called Adolf Hitler. Also the warmongers and people in power far far away. Non confrontational methods work; Nelson Mandela has forgiven all his jailers, making South Africa a revenge-free modern country post apartheid. More recently Columbia rebels in the jungle has been assimilated back to society with Christmas trees and childhood photo drops from the sky. Also lights to lead rebels out of the jungle. Eventually all the leftist rebels disappeared... to become normal Colombians again!15. Do good in public; choose Jesus’s teaching of the light on a hill, and not that of praying and fasting in secret. That is because good deeds are heart warming and can induce others to do good as well (Pass it On). "
151,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4644723-eva,5,"Rutger Bregman - of the equally excellent Utopia for Realists: How We Can Build the Ideal World - shows how we're locked in a self-fulfilling prophecy if we believe that humanity is inherently egoistic. An inverse to placebo, ""nocebo"" brings about negative effect through simple believes. History and literature wants to make us believe that war and egoism are part of our culture. Same as William Golding's Lord of the Flies was celebrated as a realistic depiction of human nature, we also believed the tale of the warring cannibalistic tribes of the Easter Island. Yet Gregman contrasts these with a real-life Lord of the Flies adventure of 6 boys who survived peacefully as castaways on a tiny island in the Pacific Ocean. And he demonstrates how the Easter Island myths were constructed on one explorer's wild imagination for bloody stories. Like the Siberian experiment in domesticating silver foxes shows, our branch of humans seem to have domesticated itself. We're slimmer, more playful, and cuter than the others. We're the ""homo puppy"" who survived other more powerful species (like the neanderthals) because of our smarter wits and our social/collaborative skills. Despite there being violence in prehistoric times, there rarely were wars. Humans lived in small to medium sized groups that simply moved on when falling into conflict with other groups. Multiple signs seem to indicate that the end of humanity's nomadic existence, the onset of agriculture and ""property"", is what introduce war and violence into man's history. The patriarchy overtook as women became a good that had to join foreign families, as men stayed put to protect their animals. Germs and virus arose from humanity's now close proximity to animals. We all know famous psychological studies that apparently demonstrate humanity's rotten core: The Milgram experiment, the Standford Prison experiment, the Robber's Cave experiment, the Kitty Genovese case, ... They show how we are able to hurt others when conforming to authority, how our prime instinct is to stirr up fights, or how lack the empathy to help people in need. Yet when you dig into all those experiments, you see how they all fall apart because of researchers with an intent, deliberate priming of subjects, the omission of facts that contradict the thesis (or the sensational headline). Believing those studies can have huge cruel consequences, especially when applied in structures of power. That's how the police restructured to become quota-obsessed by misinterpreting the broken-windows study. Some more notes from my huge list of notes:- too much empathy is not good as it strips one of one's power to forgive, or see the other's side- corruption through power turns to loss of empathy and triggers a survival of the shameless (politics)- Solnit talks about how leaders assume their constituents would act selfishly just because they wouldIn today's world the cynic is called a realist. We should reverse that. Bregman ends on the hopeful fact that the simple act of witnessing altruism makes us more altruistic ourselves. Super informative book with a wonderful intention, that hopefully causes some cynics to turn into optimistic altruists. "
152,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112531119-seventh,5,"Humankind is not just a good book, it is one of the best books I have ever read.Bregman is relentless in his efforts to show that when it comes down to it we humans aren’t hairsbreadth away from murder, violence, and evil. Instead inside most of us there is good. Bregman admits that this isn't an easy case to make - we are constantly bombarded by counter-examples and many people doubt his claims. This situation Bregman notes is ideal for those in power; through our own fears of each other, our leaders can control us. Our fears and suspicions become self-fulfilling prophecies and often end in disaster.Bregman calls this view of people being dark, dangerous, and violent just below the surface the 'veneer theory.' And more importantly, Bregman argues it's totally wrong - and he has the evidence to back it up, not just wishy-washy hippy talk but cold hard facts, data, and history. Bregman starts the book by providing new context to some of the biggest 'proofs' of our inherent evilness debunking ideas about prehistoric violence and tearing apart studies and stories which claim to show our dark side, giving us the true and often purposefully hidden story. Bregman gives our species a new name: homo puppies (I promise it makes total sense once you read the book). He argues that the reason for our success is not our strength or our intelligence but our ability to work together, to collaborate, and to make friends. Through collaboration, we have sent men to the moon, something no one person or tribe could have accomplished alone.In the second third of Humankind Bregman offers up explanations for why we do evil and takes time to explain why one of the greatest evils humans have done - namely the holocaust is the result of a perversion of our strengths. He also provides some suggestions to prevent future acts of evil and ways to push people towards our natural state of goodness. In the last part of the book, Bregman provides ways to counteract the negatives of humanity and shows how we can design new institutions with a positive view of humanity. Rather than starting out with the view that the world is filled with sinners and rogues and basing our policies off this Bregman suggests we should instead begin by viewing people as people. Bregman details ways politics, education, prison, law enforcement, and business can be radically altered and reorientated to serve the common good and become better. His mission is to redefine what we mean when we talk about ""realist"" policies. I have always harboured a feeling similar to Bregman's thesis that deep down most people are good most of the time. It's not an easy position to hold and I admit sometimes my cynicism gets the better of me. Bregman explains that this is a natural response - cynicism is an easier position to hold. It is an effective theory of everything and when we see one negative situation, event, or interaction we easily forget the 1000 positives ones. Even a third of the way into the book I still had nagging doubts, suspecting Bregman of putting too positive a spin on things but after reaching the books end those doubts had evaporated. The last remnants of my cynicism had been ripped away. A better world is not only possible, it's already here, its promise just hasn't been fully realised yet."
153,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64283333-kendal-jones,4,"2020 has been a truly difficult year for many. In Britain, we've had to contend with Brexit, storms, the threat of war and now corornavirus. In the face of all this adversity, it's times like this that we need a little hope.Fortunately, Humankind, the latest book by popular historian Rutger Bregman, has appeared on the horizon to offer an optimistic look at humanity in essence. Bregman attempts to answer looming questions on the nature of people both individually and as a whole. Are humans essentually good or bad? Do we function solely for ourselves or for the good of the people around us?Humankind is an effective rebuttal to the cynical and pessimistic perspectives on human nature presented by many sociologists, psychologists and historians across the ages. In particular, Bregman addresses the conflicting views of two behemoths of enlightenment philosophy, Hobbes and Rousseau.In this period of uncertainty and reflection, Bregman's book was a true tonic. His passion for his subject was tangible throughout his writing and his optimism was inspiring. Thoughts, opinions and facts were carefully researched and deftly argued, although occasionally obscure anecdotes seemed to do some heavy lifting when it came to defending certain points.Humankind is an easy read which shares many complex concepts in a way that is both accessible and enjoyable. I rarely felt that the book was preaching, and for the most part is read almost as a conversation with a friend (albeit one who is highly researched and deeply perceptive).I didn't agree with all of the ideas presented in the course of the book, some of which I felt were oversimplified or selective with their evidence. I also felt that the true premise of this research was not 'are humans inherently good?' but rather 'is civilization inherently bad?' Bregman seems to know with some certainty what humans and society were like between 50,000 and 10,000 years ago, the concept that palaeolithic people were entirely peaceful and egalitarian being a keystone in his arguments. Even if this were true (as it is, it's not something that could ever be proven one way or the other), I couldn't shake my perhaps cynical view that this is not now the world in which we find ourselves. Wars, violence and inequality have pervaded all of recorded human history, and I don't feel like the reasoning Bregman offered for this satisfied my skepticism.While I may not be fully converted to the author's optimictis viewpoint, I truly appreciated this book for opening up an interesting and thought-provoking dialogue and for providing insight into some of the most (in)famous psychological and philosophical experiments of the 20th century. The final chapters on how to apply new research to the redevelopment and/or complete restructuring of schools, businesses, politics and prison systems were compelling reading. I found myself reflecting consistently on the ideas and histories presented, and the sharing of some of Bregman's beliefs has incited some serious and interesting debate in my own household.If some books overgeneralise humanity's indiscretions and ills, then why not one which does the same with the opposing perspective. To look at history's moments of shame or violence through a lens of understanding and compassion is a powerful skill - sometimes uncomfortable but in many ways pivotal to real social change. Bregman's ten steps to readdressing and refocusing perspectives onto the positive aspects of human nature are an important take away, and this book will continue to have me thinking for a long time to come. Thanks to Bloomsbury and NetGalley for kindly giving me an advanced copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own. "
154,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112760558-folio,4,"2020 isn’t proving to be an easy time to remain optimistic. But if you’re looking for something that might help you feel hopeful, Humankind by Rutger Bregman, part philosophy book, part call to arms, is a stimulating and easy-to-read place to start.To paraphrase Bregman, these might be the most challenging words you read this year:“Most people, deep down, are pretty decent”.With the Cummingses and Trumps of this world filling the headlines recently, it might be hard to believe that statement, but what Bregman’s book does is walk you through lots of stories and arguments to try convince you that yes, human beings are indeed fundamentally good. Not only that, if we were to wholesale start acting if we believed in our species’ essential goodness, the world could be transformed in a truly exciting, beneficial, enriching way.Wide-ranging stories -from a real-life case echoing the Lord of the Flies basic plot line, to the puzzle of the statues on Easter Island, via gene research done on domesticating foxes and the infamous and terrifying psychological experiments carried out by Milgram and Zimbardo - form Bregman’s canvas for exploring the varied arguments in favour and against the claim that is widely made (including by many religions); that we’re born bad.And it’s a challenging read.“Belief in human kind’s sinful nature also provides a tidy explanation for the existence of evil. When confronted with hatred of selfishness you can tell yourself, ‘oh well, that’ just human nature’. But if you believe that people are essentially good, you have to question why evil exists at all. It implies that engagement and resistance are worthwhile, and it imposes an obligation to act.” To inspire us, Bregman then goes on to explore a number of ways around the world a different, more positive, constructive approach has been taken, whether that is the participatory democracy seen in the Venezuelan principality of Torres, the Norwegian prison system where inmates are treated as people not monsters, or the story of how South African avoided all out civil war in the months leading up to the inauguration of Mandela as the first President following the Apartheid era. It’s an encouraging and exhilarating read. I’ve a t-shirt which says “Read books: Complicate your point of view”. This is certainly a book to do that. Whilst much of what Bregman convincingly argues for is exciting and uplifting, at times things pop up that worry me. If you’re an introvert, Bregman’s argument that sociable people are smarter won’t sit well. If you believe changing human behaviour is a key plank to mitigating climate catastrophe, you’ll be frustrated by his rather glib faith in our ability to invent our way out of the environmental disaster we are facing. He also makes an argument for empathy being a bad thing…You may believe that it’s unrealistic or idealistic to believe that people are fundamentally kind and good, but I for one, want to believe Bregman’s arguments. Bregman’s proposal that we fundamentally restructure how we act, either as individuals, groups, organisations or countries, so that at all stages we are informed by a belief in better, in goodness, and in hope is one to make you feel optimistic even in these hard times.[Reviewed by Zoe for FOLIO]"

Bregman challenged my assumptions of human nature and society. . . did he convince me? Maybe. However, even though I still have my doubts, Bregman's book certainly made me think and challenge my previously held beliefs which in many cases, I didn't even know I possessed. Humankind asserts that contrary to modern belief, humans are inherently good and kind beings. Then, he adds that though people are good, evil comes from strident dedication to one's own group, power, and a so called ""nocebo."" Finally, Bregman presents his vision of an ideal and realistic society and how we can get there. In the beginning of the book, Bregman addresses early history and our roots, claiming that humans have biologically evolved as primarily kind animals and were for the most part, peace loving beings throughout prehistory. Then, Bregman addresses claims of inherent human evil in the modern world through refuting leading social psychological studies and case studies including the Stanford Prison Experiment, the Milgram Shock Experiment, and the case of Kitty Genovese. He argues that in all of these instances humans tried to be good, thought they were doing good, or were exploited by researchers. Bregman's argument that humans are primarily good was certainly interesting and eye opening. My one critique is that his argument in this section of the book seemed more like a series of refutations that an independent argument. Nonetheless, his refutations were strong and persuasive. Next, Bregman moves on to explain evil and why it occurs in our ""Homo puppy"" species. He argues that evil prevails when we are too dedicated to our own group, individuals accumulate too much power, or through a negativity ""nocebo."" We have all heard the power corrupts argument, so though Bregman explained it well, it was not particularly enlightening. However, Bregman's arguments on communal empathy and the negativity ""nocebo"" were very powerful. He claims that people are too empathetic and dedicated to their own group, and so, in this sense, they can end up committing evil acts against others who are not members of their group out of dedication to their compatriots. Bregman also demonstrates that since the Enlightenment, we have lived in societies that expect the worse of us, and therefore, we become our worst selves. He also argues that modern news sources which capture the rare moments of human evil also enforce this ""nocebo."" I found these arguments compelling and thought provoking. Finally, Bregman addresses his dream for a society that recognizes our goodness. In this society, Bregman argues we need to recognize our intrinsic motivation through a play based education, employee run companies, and citizen run democracies. According to Bregman, we should also foster a culture of kindness where everyone goes the extra length to be kind to and have contact with everyone, even those who have killed or are part of the""evil"" out group. I'm all for more kindness and contact, but I'm still cynical about the employee run companies or citizen run democracies. I still instinctively believe that conflict would run rampant, but maybe I'm just the cynic that Bregman spends his book trying to disprove. . . Great book, highly recommend. "
156,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,3,"Humankind's primary message is right. It needs to be written about emphatically and repeatedly. The methods used are highly dubious.We humans have a lot of good within us. Individually, most of us are far better than what we discuss or see in ourselves (in own-selves or the selves of others). Our communities and societies collectively have much more innate positive characteristics that we do not harness sufficiently while spending most energy to guard against the negatives. The author does well in discussing our highly honed tendencies to presume evil in most things around. We do not realize the negative feedback loops that start from such suspicions. With more trust, faith, and goodwill towards fellow individuals from all walks of life, we should attain far more happiness, good life, and other material aspects. However, outside the great message, the book does far more disservice in using highly dubious methods to discredit all sorts of well-known experiments and theories. The author ignores the basic social science message (unlike in physical sciences or math): there is no perfect precision in any social science conclusions or experiments. We human beings come in all varieties. Any generalized statements about our behavior could be disputed in detail. The author uses carefully picked specifics, exceptions, anecdotes, or at times mere opinions to discredit almost a dozen celebrated studies and theories. The author never realizes that his counterpoints - notwithstanding their appealing and emphatic assertions - stand on far weaker grounds than the points he debunks merrily on slim evidence.Paraphrasing, when a social science claim ""A"" is made, the precision levels are far lower than the ones found in Newtonian Physics. The moment one starts to look at the details, almost every experiment would appear imperfect, every statistical table somewhere erroneous, and every experimenter biased. No celebrated experiment in social sciences has likely gone unscathed on all these counts - and that's the nature of their businesses.The reviewer would not have minded the author doubting any number of past experiments. The author does far worse. He uses polemic and subterfuge in picking up criticisms of various theories as evident truth or proofs of his own claims. The author's romanticized claims of almost all facets of the modern civilization being responsible for the negativity and Eutopian visions of pre-historic and hunter-gatherer tribes are needless in the least.We should not kid ourselves. We humans have tremendous dark sides. We have inflicted enormous pains on each other. Despite whatever the author says, most of the pains we inflict cannot be attributed to a bunch of heinous politicians or bad apples. The author is right if the claim was only on too much focus on these negatives, but he is too quick in dismissing our sins and crimes since time immemorial. There is a need to bring in more trust in our dealings with each other. Without Rousseau-esq idealism, the author could have found new ways in modern era technologies than in playgrounds without slides! The book suffers immensely from the author's preconceived notions and nowhere more than in his suggestion lists in the end."
157,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7353442-ron-peters,3,"I wasn’t very impressed by Rutger’s Humankind. In the literature on whether humanity is inherently naughty or nice, his main recent competitors are Steven Pinker’s (2011) The Better Angels of our Nature and Robert M. Sapolsky’s (2018) Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst. Both are better books than Rutger’s: Pinker’s in terms of the overall rigour of the material he works with, and Sapolsky’s in terms of the force of his arguments.Two of the worst literatures anyone can work with (which both Rutger and Pinker rely on heavily) are those on the anthropology and archaeology of war. Pinker argues that humans started off brutish and slowly became less violent; Rutger that people started off gentle and cooperative, got worse as they became ‘civilized’, then improved somewhat. These literatures are so inherently ambiguous and inconclusive that they can be and have been read in any way an author chooses. Rutger and Pinker come to opposed conclusions, yet both say they have given these literatures the best critical reading and that, compared with others, their interpretations are definitive.Another problem with both Rutger and Pinker is that they operate from the assumption that there is one monolithic ‘human nature’ out there waiting to be discovered, and that this ‘nature’ determines human behaviour. Both pay lip-service to the idea of nature-nurture interactions, yet both lean heavily on the ‘nature’ side of the equation. Sapolsky, on the other hand, rests his whole work on the idea that human life is defined by the constant dance between nature and nurture, with each affecting the other in intricately complex ways. In this view, it is senseless to say that people are good or evil, violent or cooperative, since they have the potential to be (and have been) both. His is a far more nuanced and realistic argument than the ones put forward by either Rutger or Pinker.Rutger also dedicates whole chapters to tearing down the validity of Phil Zimbardo’s Stanford Prison Experiment and Stanley Milgram’s Obedience to Authority study. The glaring omission in all this is that that tearing down these studies does not, in the slightest degree, provide evidence for the view that the opposite conclusion – that people are inherently nice – is true.Finally, I’ll mention that Rutger has part of a chapter on the question of whether soldiers in battle ever fire their weapons and, if they do, how often they fire above the heads of their enemies. All the references, as well as the interpretation of this literature, are directly from Dave Grossman’s (1995) On Killing. Rutger references Grossman in passing on one particular point, but never acknowledges that the whole section is really Grossman’s work. In a book that is really a series of literature reviews, this is low. A scientific writer’s professional existence and reputation depend on the acknowledgement of their copyright. This bit of Rutger’s book amounts to plagiarism."

Recommended for:
1. Anyone who enjoys articles with some history, politics and psychology. 2. People who enjoyed reading books by Yuval Noah Harari  will equally take pleasure reading this very positive book. 3. Those who want a substantial understanding of what's going on in the world that isn't influenced by catchy headlines driven by advertising revenue and editorial bias. Negatives:There are only 2 things which I would remark upon (and which influenced by 4* rating instead of 5*'s):1. The writing style reminds me of articles in Cosmo. Or perhaps it's the English translation which is to blame.2. The anthropological research mentioned here doesn't seem very robust, more conjecture than fact. That said, perhaps my observation is due to comparing it to science-led books e.g. Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams, (which became rather tiresome in it's efforts to produce all the research in order to prove his points) however, at least one felt reassured that what was written had some basis of facts while with Humankind, the passages related to the nomadic tribe wasn't totally convincing. Positives:1. Debunked the Stanford prison experiment, which many people still use to justify appalling opinions and behavior (the idea that humans are inherently evil). 2. Debunking themy link text bystander effect or ""Genovese syndrome"", which had been already debanked in some articles, however it was explained really well here.3. The short stories that no one would have known about if the author hadn't mentioned them e.g. the shipwrecked boys4. The overall philosophical and steady tone of the writing was a welcome contrast the the ubiquitous scary headlines"
159,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108047597-thomas-goddard,4,"Humankind: A Hopeful History by Rutger BregmanHumankind is one of those books that comes along and really makes you look at the world a little differently. I’m a bit of a pessimist. Always have been. So my general view of the species is that we are all self-centred parasites hell-bent on draining everything good from every environment and person we thoughtlessly stumble upon. But that was before...No, I still believe that. This book didn’t really alter my mind that much. There’s got to be a limit to an open mind. You can read a book, but at the end of the day, afterwards, you still have to live in the same world you’ve experienced for however many years. And 426 pages, however well written, won’t shift the weight of personal experience.That said, I do think that I understand a little more about human nature now. And a lot of the recent happenings, the whole Covid fiasco, has shown humanity at its best and worst. But if you think about it. We did pretty well. For every news story about some prick hitting the motorway to check out some castle with his family, there were hundreds of thousands of people sat at home.It’s the same with the news in general. I look at that differently now, because of the book. I try to keep in mind that there are a million or more examples of people not being awful for every news report about a bunch of kids kicking in an old man.It doesn’t absolve us of the capacity for evil. But it is worth keeping the kindness in mind. Makes me a lot less depressed.More of a detailed review, after that tangent...The book gives a lot of scientific and historic examples of the way humans behave in times of crisis. There’s a strong point made that we developed in a really interesting way. To co-operate and also to compete. We seem to be divisively tribal. But at the same time, if we are placed into a situation of great peril, we tend to help each other out. Floods, shipwrecks, earthquakes, terror attacks... endless examples of people helping each other. Even in war, there are examples like Gettysburg. They excavated 27,574 rifles. Of the weapons that were salvaged, an incredible 24,000 rifles were still loaded (that’s either 87%) Of the total number, half had been loaded more than once, and a quarter had been reloaded multiple times. Apparently, one poor soldier had reloaded his weapon twenty-three times, but the weird thing is that he never fired a single shot. Apparently, soldiers don’t like shooting at the enemy and the best way not to face a court-martial was to look like you weren’t shooting because you were busy reloading. So no one would know.Apparently we developed to be cute looking, rather than ferocious. Kindness brings out big eyes, rounded teeth and soft voices. The author compares us to the dogs that developed from wolves. I’d say that this was required reading for anyone who is pessimistic about humanity and needs a little pick me up.Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐"
160,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7726595-tarun-rattan,5,"This book provides an alternative but highly optimistic take on human history and covers a number of research studies to hypotheseize that humans are inherently good by nature. The book is a rebuttal of Hobbesian theory that humans are by nature nasty, brutish and short and in turn supports the Rousseau’s view of human nature as intrinsically good. The hypothesis is explained through a number of stories covering reseacrh studies and some of these are really good. I, in particular liked the story where author refuted the imaginary story from William Golding in Lord of the Flies and in fact traced a similar real life story of a group of school boys who were marooned on a remote island near New Zealand. I also liked the the story where 1959 interview of Bernard Russel made an impact on author’s beliefs. The quote from Bernard Russell is self illuminating... “When you are studying any matter or considering any philosophy, ask yourself only what are the facts and what is the truth that the facts bear out. Never let yourself be diverted either by what you wish to believe or by what you think would have beneficent social effects if it were believed, but look only and solely at what are the facts.""The author’s take on human settlement, advent of human conflicts and inherent inequality in society is pretty convincing but he might be cherry picking some of the things to suits his own narrative. This is definitely not a realist view of the world and with so much blood still being spilled in the name of religion, ideologies and race issues, it is hard to believe that humans are friendly and good natured. The book is pretty well written and does make you think differently about the commonly held societal beliefs but arguments are not convincing enough. In fact the studies covered in the book are conflicting in nature, there are researchers who themselves acted selfishly while conducting their experiments which were designed to prove the unselfish nature of humans. One thing that definitely came out from the book is the sorry state of research in social and psychological fields where shady results have been accepted in academia just because it would suit their own agenda which actually disapproves the moot point of this book. Instead of this optimistic view, it would be better to be a realist and believe that though humans might be good natured but social norms and peer pressure can turn an ordinary person into a demon. And this in human history has been widely evident in so many horrific events like invasions of Huns & Mongols, loot and plunder by Vikings, blood spilled during Islamic invasions, horrific exploitation of natives by Conquistadors, brutality of crusades and in recent time during Holocaust or Partition of Subcontinent. But still it would be worthwhile to read this book as it shows that there is hope for humankind and I’m sure we as humans will get to that Utopia one day in a distant future."
161,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49895696-kelly-w,4,"I first learned of Rutger Bregman when he famously made Tucker Carlson blow up on Fox News in 2019. Since then, I’ve kept my eye on Bregman’s Twitter account, eager to see how he would talk about various issues plaguing our world. When he announced this book, I was eager to pick it up, mostly because I was (and still am) in a pretty negative place, and I wanted something that would show me that “hopefulness” was a legitimate attitude to have, without the fake, peppy, self-help tone that permeates a lot of other publications.Overall, I found Bregman’s general thesis and evidence compelling. Humankind argues that for the entirety of human history, humans are “hardwired” for compassion, kindness, and cooperation, rather than predisposed to selfishness and violence. Using examples from the hunter-gatherer era of human history to the 20th and 21st centuries, Bregman showcases anthropological, sociological, and psychological studies, rooting his case in scientific research rather than “wishful thinking.” I particularly found his section on “why good people turn bad” incredibly convincing, in part because he effectively dissects the connection between cynicism and power, as well as the (surprising and counter-intuitive) concept that empathy and xenophobia are two sides of the same coin.All of this research is presented in a clearly-organized, playfully-written manner. I don’t know exactly how much can be attributed to Bregman versus his translators, but regardless, the book is infused with nice quips that don’t overwhelm the main points or overshadow the examples. Even the complex philosophy of Hobbes and Rousseau is presented in a way that the everyday reader can understand, as well as complicated histories such as the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural lifestyles.My main criticism is perhaps the lack of direct address of ideologies that mean active harm towards others (things like white supremacy, homophobia, etc.). While Bregman discusses terrorism and has some examples pertaining to neo-Nazi rallies and the Afrikaner Volksfront, it was frankly hard for me to see a rationale for putting, say, lgbt+ people in contact with violent homophobes. Perhaps that isn’t what Bregman is advocating, but because I’m not sure, I think this book would have benefited from more concrete advice regarding reaching out to those who mean you real harm.But as a general book about kindness and changing our view of human nature, I think this is an accessible read that most people can benefit from, particularly those who are rooted in cynicism and want to change their worldview. As a whole, I think this book speaks nicely to our present moments, and I think it provides a nice jumping-off point for deeper discussions about how we should respond to each other."

164,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11594469-sara,5,"You know when sometimes books just appear in your life when you most need them? I was feeling a bit disillusioned with humankind recently. With the initial panic of the coronavirus, all I saw on twitter, were news how people were stockpiling without a second thought of what that would mean for everybody else, Americans queuing up outside gun shops to bulk-buy ammunition and guns in case the shops would run out of food and Trump trying to buy the vaccine ‘but only for Americans’. The evidence kept mounting up, and all I could think was ‘Wow, we really are a selfish bunch’. And then Bregman came and proved me wrong. ‘Humankind’ is packed with stories and interpretations and study findings which you most likely haven’t heard before. There were moments were I sat shocked as even some of the fundamental things I’d learned in my psychology and sociology classes, recently have been proven to have not been true, and well I failed to hear about them. At others times, I sat smiling, feeling a tinge of warmth as chapter after chapter I was shown the goodness that ‘homo puppy’ (as Bregman came to call our species) was capable of showing.Bregman looked at Hobbes’ and Rousseu’s views of civilisation, bystander effect, bullying, non-complementary behaviour, prison structure, participatory democracy, employees directing their own teams, kids’ playgrounds among many other fascinating stuff. There’s an overload of information in this book, but the clear and concise language and structure will make it easy to read and absorb. It’s easier if you start at the beginning and read from beginning to end, but it will also work if you pick and choose random chapters as any previous information needed for context, will be shown by the inclusion of the correct chapter number to which you can term if needed. Bregman does not come across as patronising and overbearing, but as a likeable narrator, or that cool teacher who would sometimes share jokes and anecdotes whilst still managing to deliver the context of the lesson, and keep everybody interested. Overall, I really loved this book, and there’s no question about it when I say that I will be returning to it several more times. I might have started the book as a cynic, but as I turned the last page I no longer felt like one; I learned the majority of us are actually decent despite what the newspapers will have you believe. I urge all of you to give this one a try; we all need a more positive outlook of the world and ‘Humankind’ might just be the easiest way to start. **Thank you to NetGalley and Bloomsbury Publishing for providing me with a free copy in exchange for an honest review"

Especially when it’s a book that challenges your thinking. As I read I found myself re-evaluating everything I thought I knew.Rutger Bergman’s Humankind: A Hopeful History, examines how society perceives humankind to be innately greedy and selfish. Bregman argues that people are actually innately kind. He examines and challenges theories and studies proposed by Freud and Dawkins, to Machiavelli and Hobbes and he tears them apart, leaving you questioning and re-examining your understanding of your fellow humans. I took a while to ponder this book before I wrote my review because I wanted to make sure that I could write something that would do this book the justice it deserves.In university, I was taught the theories and presented the supporting studies that all psychology and sociology courses teach. I believed I had a good understanding of humanity and understood how humans think and how we have evolved. After reading this book, a significant amount of my learning was challenged. Bregman presented evidence to show me that nothing is what it seemed, or as it was presented, and I feel like I paid a lot of money to be lied to. This is not the case, but when studies are re-examined and show evidence of a contradictory outcome, you are forced to reconsider the teaching and as a result re-evaluate your beliefs. I tend to believe people are kind, (to a fault sometimes) but I’d rather be optimistic than live in a world where we believe our neighbours and coworkers are evil. I believe that this is Bregman’s point. We all think this way; well the majority of us anyway. Throughout history, we have been spoon-fed, by all sorts of mediums, that we are innately horrible people and we want to do horrible things to each other. This is just not true!Bregman beautifully tears apart study after study, theory after theory, to show you that we are in fact innately kind. We are more inclined to help each other than we are to hurt each other. We are more inclined to support each other than we are to undermine each other but we have been conditioned to think otherwise. This pandemic is a fantastic example of how we are truly kind people. If we weren’t kind, would we be risking our lives to help one another? Would we find innovative ways to reach out and support each other if we only cared about ourselves? Let’s look again, let’s think again, let’s change the world; together.

It makes for interesting reading It looks at civilisation and history,politics,literature and the media.This is a book full of hope ,of ideas, of making you think and is not just theory but lots of science and research. It's an easy delightful read too.If we believe people can't be trusted then that's how we will treat each other so to make the world better we need to start with our view of human nature We can start with switching off the news as nice doesn't sell and news is to the mind what sugar is to the body.There is so much to learn from reading this book and opening up your mind to possibility,to trust and to change. Inspiring.Also interesting to learn that genetically we're 60% identical to banana ,80% cow and 99% chimpanzee. A must read. Excellent"

Bregman is a weird historian, an optimistic and hopeful one, and he explores the vast history of humanity to argue for an altruistic view of human nature. He tears apart the traditional points for arguing that we are selfish and dangerous beings (Stanford Prison Experiment, Broken Windows theory, Milgrim Experiment, By-Stander effect, etc.), while presenting fresh takes on WWI (Germans and British playing football and refusing to shoot each other, statistics about how few people are killed in war by gunshots) and WWII (the bombing on British and German towns leading to more social solidarity etc.). His story of the real Lord of the Flies brought me to tears, as did many beautiful moments in the book (two twins on opposite sides of Apartheid in South Africa, man taking his mugger out to dinner, Danes sitting down for tea with terrorists). At times so broad in its approach that it can be reductive. The sections on play in education, healthcare reform etc. were too brief to really get behind. I agree with him about how the media misshapes reality, but he is attacking it at a time when we need high quality journalism more than ever (I think he could have been a little more objective on this point). Auschwitz received barely a mention, and if you are arguing that we are actually good, you might need to engage with the holocaust. I assume he would conclude with Rousseau that humans aren't bad, it is our civilisation that's the issue. But I felt he needed more on this area. Also, at times I felt he was patronising, and the language could be hyperbolic and silly.But it is well worth overlooking all of this because it is such a fascinating, insightful and exciting book.I approached this from the perspective that we have our moments of solidarity, communal spirit and cooperation, but that by and large people are capable and regularly enact tremendous acts of evil. I come out feeling slightly different, not completely won over, but certainly willing to admit that the reforms of prisons, schools, companies, etc. in line with an optimistic view of human nature is a good thing. There is just such a wealth of evidence that human decency transcends any Hobbesian sides of humanity, and I am a convert to the idea that viewing the world as a peaceful place helps in getting us there. I would recommend this to everyone. Who doesn't want to read evidence that we are selfless and altruistic beings?"

What emerges, however, is that as much as they want us to believe that we are all protagonists on the island of Lord of the Flies, it is not at all true, nor is it taken for granted, nor is it the obvious end of every experience in which we are put under pressure.Rather, it would have been useful to ask ourselves who would have liked us to grow up with the conviction that we must defend ourselves from others, from all those who do not resemble us, with a frightening cynicism and with the terror that our little one would be taken away from us? Spoiler alert: those who could benefit form the capitalist society. Having said that, I would like to avoid trivializing the content of this book, but also to sanctify it, because as it is true that there were entire communities that succumbed to Nazism as well as rose from the ashes of Hurricane Kathrina, what is important is to remember that our attitude comes mostly from the information we have from the outside and as there is the placebo effect, there is also the nocebo effect.Ci sono dei libri che andrebbero messi in curriculum, specialmente per chi come me ha studiato psicologia e ha creduto per anni che gli esperimenti fatti dagli americani nella seconda metá del ´900, fossero reali/realistici e soprattutto credibili. Quello che emerge invece, é che per quanto vogliano farci credere che siamo tutti protagonisti nell'isola del signore delle mosche, non é per niente vero, né scontato, né tanto meno il finale ovvio di ogni esperienza in cui siamo messi sotto pressione.Piuttosto sarebbe stato utile chiederci a chi faceva comodo che crescessimo con la convinzione di doverci difendere dagli altri, da tutti quelli che non ci somigliano, con un cinismo spaventoso e con il terrore che il nostro piccolo ci venisse tolto? Spoiler alert: a coloro ai quali la societá capitalistica faceva comodo. Detto questo vorrei evitare di banalizzare il contenuto di questo libro, ma anche di santificarlo perché come é vero che ci sono state comunitá intere che hanno ceduto al nazismo come anche sono risorte dalle ceneri dell'uragano Kathrina, quello che é importante é comunque ricordarsi che il nostro atteggiamento nasce per la maggior parte dalle informazioni che abbiamo dall'esterno e cosí come esiste l'effetto placebo, c'é anche l'effetto nocebo."

Particular cases in point: several motivation theories, and the rational economic man. In what seems a very long book (illusion: 20% is the Reference section), Bregman examines the evidence for the assumptions and beliefs that we are basically evil, and need to be trained, honed and coerced into doing anything. System by system he dissects the evidence, the root causes of our assumptions, and comes up with some basic truths. They are all too apparent in this world of Johnson-Cummings (the Machiavelli behind our so-called Prime Minister) and Trump and his cronies.Put simply, there is a range of natural behaviour in which the norm is pretty nice, friendly and knows that co-operation works. There are extremes either side. So why are we stuck with an extreme rather than a co-operative society?  Bregman answers, supported by masses of referenced stories and debunked research papers. People with a very high sense of self-interest lie to gain power. And they are ably assisted (through the ages, not just now) by self-serving journalists and newspaper owners, who know that sensational headlines best sell papers.It's a really good read. You will know or have heard of, at least some of these theories that shape our society. You will recognise yourself and your neighbourhood. Deep down, most of your neighbours are pretty nice, you think. If only you had the time to hang out with them and get to know them better. There's a huge amount of things I could say, could lift from the book, or could quote.  But the crux is, the newspapers have fed us the lies that politicians and rich landowners want us to believe. Thay way both can get richer and more powerful. The news is a drug, so get off it. More peaceful protests have succeeded in achieving real change than violent ones, but papers will only report violent ones. All the most celebrated research we have been fed showing how nasty we are has as dubious a background as the scandalous MMR vaccine/autism research. They've been fixed, in other words.Why do I believe these things to be true, when I've just read them in a book? Because of the degree of detail the author has gone into. And yes, because it tallies with my own experiences. People are basically nice. Get to know people of different backgrounds, races, colours, creeds and preferences. Most of them are just as nice as you are. How the self-serving ones manipulate us into electing them into power is another story. Read Humankind: A Hopeful History by Rutger Bregman. It'll help you feel better, if hoodwinked throughout the generations. It might fire your soul, too."

It’s also an easy read in terms of style and Bregman’s examples are largely drawn from areas that already interested me both professionally and personally.In fact, as the book’s message is one that I already agree with, I initially chose not to buy the book last autumn when it first came out (the Dutch market is relatively small, making books expensive: this one was €25). It was the (first) article in the Guardian about how Bregman debunks the revolting ideas in The Lord of the Flies by citing a real case that changed my mind, and this alone makes the book worth reading. The less well-known details of the Milgram and Zimbardo experiments were a real eye-opener, and I also didn’t know about Zimbardo’s involvement in another famous and influential sociology theory. I really wish I could have discussed this book with my A-level psychology teacher, but unfortunately she is no longer with us. I am sure she would have found it fascinating.I still didn’t pay €25 for the book, by the way ;). I bought it directly from the publisher as an e-book for €9, also saving myself a complicated trip to a shop during our partial lockdown. This also meant I could get started immediately, and in fact I had finished it within two days. Even the extensive notes and sources in the back were a real pleasure to read afterwards - and it’s not often I say that about a book!—————————————————————————————————————Oorspronkelijke recensie (NL):Ik loop al decennia te zeggen ‘most people are nice/de meeste mensen zijn gewoon aardig’ en dit boek is één lange bevestiging daarvan. Bovendien schrijft Bregman zeer boeiend en haalt z’n voorbeelden uit gebieden waarin ik zelf al veel belangstelling bij heb. Toen ik dit boek in de AKO in de herfst zag liggen vond ik het een leuk idee maar hoefde geen € 25 neer te leggen voor iets dat ik in grote lijnen al wist. Maar recent las ik in The Guardian dat hij de ideeën in The Lord of the Flies, een boek waar ik een hekel aan heb, met een waargebeurd verhaal op z’n kop zet. Dat alleen al maakt dit boek het lezen waard! De minder bekende details van de Milgram en Zimbardo experimenten waren een echte eye-opener, en dat Zimbardo ook achter een andere ‘hot item’ in de sociologie zat, wist ik ook niet. Ik wou dat ik dit boek had kunnen bespreken met m’n docent psychologie van de middelbare school, maar helaas is zij inmiddels overleden. Ze had dit ook zeer interessant gevonden.Ik heb trouwens nog steeds geen € 25 betaald: het ebook is maar € 9 en is van De Correspondent rechtstreeks te koop. Dan heb je het ook meteen in handen - ik las het binnen twee dagen uit. Om na te genieten loop ik nu door de aantekeningen achterin - en er zijn weinig boeken waarover ik dat zou kunnen zeggen!"
171,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4332701-matthew-trevithick,4,"This is a thought provoking book. There are parts I disagree with, as well as parts that I think are written too glibly and breezily (the note that other reviewers have made about a kind of ‘internet writing’ is exactly correct) but the overall concept is very intriguing. The dismantling of long standing concepts about human nature are very interesting (Milgram studies, Zimbardo prison experiment, Easter Island as metaphor, the ‘tragedy of the commons’, the alleged NYC night where 38 people watched someone be stabbed without acting, and so on - turns out there is much, much more to consider, and there has been a lot of bad science and research done with disastrous consequences) is why this book gets 4 stars. I enjoy living in an era where we don’t need to theorize quite as much about human nature (so many of these studies predicted human nature from truly warped and badly run research projects) - we can simply observe humanity and work backwards from those observations. I particularly enjoyed his section on business schools and MBA degrees being a lot of nonsense because they get the fundamental incentive structure of humanity (carrots and sticks) completely wrong. I also liked his idea about why the ‘veneer’ theory of civilization is not quite right - and the inclusion of Solnit’s quote that elites tend to think human decency is skin deep because elites aggressively compete with each other and so assume all humans are thin skinned and insecure like they are (great point). The author does a good job of aggressively footnoting all his points, and while some are weaker than others, opponents will find it hard to dismiss this book. My guess is it will likely open up much more research from this perspective. On the political front, both conservatives and progressives will find a lot to enjoy in this book: if people are inherently good and not evil, there is far less need for overarching state institutions, because people essentially know how to take care of themselves and their neighbors, so the more you engage them as peers and let them run their own lives without interference, the better the results are. On the other hand, if people are hardwired to seek out meaning and collaboration and not profits and destructive competition as much as the individualistic view of societal actors indicates, a more communal approach to living seems to follow as well. "
172,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12147733-david-stephens,4,"In his newest book, Rutger Bregman, the hero of Davos, takes on the age old question of whether human nature is inherently good or bad. He frames the debate between Thomas Hobbes, who wrote of the ""solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short"" lives of people when they live in their natural state as well as their unending desire for self-interest and power, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who believed people were essentially good until civilization came along and corrupted them. In the end, Bregman largely agrees with Rousseau, positing that people, in and of themselves, are fundamentally decent. It was only when humans settled on specific tracts of land and amassed private property that the species' tribalism kicked in and corrupt and shameless leaders were able to foster wars and other atrocities.To make his argument, Bregman combines and connects works from various disciplines, from history to social psychology to anthropology to political philosophy. The depth and thoroughness of his research used to debunk famous experiments must be the most impressive aspect of the book. He shows how Philip Zimbardo colluded with his ""guards"" in the Stanford prison experiment and how people wanted to do the right thing in Stanley Milgram's famous faux shock therapy session and also while witnessing the death of Kitty Genovese in her Kew Gardens neighborhood in Queens. He refutes the civil war and cannibalism that allegedly happened at Easter Island and provides a real life counter example to William Golding's beliefs about how pre-pubescent boys would act if they were stranded without the supervision of adults.To some extent, all of this is a welcomed bright spot in a modern world that continually looks bleak. But Bregman's solutions (and I'm piggybacking off of Anton Jäger writing at Jacobin Magazine here) focus only on people's goodness at the level of the individual or small group. He encourages people to assume the best about others and act with compassion, which is all fine and good, but it dodges the issue of larger societal change. If civilization is a major corrupting force, it will take more than positive thinking to combat it.And while I think Bregman overstates the decency of human beings overall, I will admit he has at least nudged me (a real negative Nancy) closer to believing people may actually mean well, which is no small feat."

174,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72826583-simon-haisell,0,"Hope in the Time of CoronaIn a crisis, do humans become angels or devils?This book is about the gap between our rather dismal view of humanity and the lack of evidence to support it.On the way, we learn some eye-opening things.The majority of soldiers at Gettysburg (the bloodiest battle of the American Civil War) were doing their very best not to kill anyone.In 1965, a group of boys were shipwrecked just like those in Lord of the Flies - with completely different results.The unfortunate people of Easter Island did not destroy their civilisation by deforestation and war.Despite high-profile psychology experiments, people will not electrocute others just because they are told to, or torture others just because they're assigned the role of ""prison guard"".And despite our fear that bystanders will not intervene when we're in trouble - most in fact will.Bregman knows he's going to be accused of being a utopian pollyanna. Which is why he tries to get the word ""realist"" in early and often. His argument: the evidence just doesn't support the belief that humans are selfish and cruel.So when the going gets tough, the humans get kind?Covid-19 has shown this to be true. We get angry about a few people not social distancing, but the far more outstanding feature of the lockdown is the great length most have gone to protect the vulnetable. And as the crisis heated up, communities extended and adapted their support networks. Rather than selfishness - waves of compassion and concern spread through society, much faster and more virulent than the virus itself.But Bregman's book is only partly convincing. It is more like a corrective counter-argument than a complete theory.News and social media recycles and regurgitates the edited low-lights of the worst things humans do to each other. A book of hope has to be shrill to be heard over the pessimistic din.But as avid readers, attune to how humans are complex and conflicted, we're in search of visions of humanity that encompass love and hate, hope and despair - and anything less than ambiguity, in the end will feel like another fairy story."

Bregman highlights and connects so many thoughts, and one of my favorite aspects of this book is the way he develops his big idea, which is calling for a major shift in thinking, by looking closely and connecting things that are already known, rather than seeking to invent something new; but then he pieces them together and applies them in a different direction then they are generally taken.Some of the things he looks at are misunderstandings in studies like: Easter Island, interactions between homosapiens and neanderthals, developments of agriculture, The Stanford Prison Experiment, Stanley Milgram's ""obedience"" shock experiment, and ""broken windows"" policing. As counterpoint he brings up stories of people banding together during bombings in WW2, a real life Lord of the Flies, studies of different animal species that cooperate well, the ways people banded together during and after hurricane Katrina, and soldiers natural inclination against killing their enemies. Something he brings up, that tends to give us a pessimistic view of humanity, is the way we tend to fixate on bad stories. At a given time in the world, the vast majority of events happening are positive; however, the vast majority of news stories are negative, as we view this, it skews our perspective. He also talks about a nocebo effect, where the expectation of a negative interaction with another person, can actually cause a negative interaction; this then, can easily move from self fulfilling prophesy, into a feedback loop that is incredibly challenging to escape.I really enjoyed reading this book, and especially in the summer of 2020, when the world seems to be trying hard to implode, I have reveled in the optimism that Bregman posits is actually realism. He subtitles the book ""A Hopeful History"" and I think we all need that right now... well, I guess I won't speak for everyone, but I know it was what I needed right now."

He uses captivating examples of well known experiments and events, completely unpickIng their portrayal, thereby reframing our understanding. He discusses the real-life Lord of the Flies story, community and cooperation in the Blitz, the reality of Easter Island’s demise, the Kitty Genovese murder, Auschwitz and some famous flawed prison experiments..I’ve too many thoughts for this caption, so I’ll just focus on what I’ve taken away from this book. Firstly, it was a slower read for me as there is so much to process, and it’s a beast of a book! I also felt it slightly ran out of puff towards the end but....This impressed upon me that it’s vital to be discerning and have a healthy cynicism about the news, accounts and documents we rely on for information. I was shocked by the extent to which key facts had been originally omitted or misrepresented in these events, but I wouldn’t say that the author has necessarily *proven* that people have a core decency with these stories, rather than presented a counter-position. To what extent can we even trust his observations and bias?🤔.I’m still thinking about the book and not sure it really answers why all the evil things happen. And yet, as if you didn’t know, I’m an optimist (a realistic one, I think), and want to believe that there is an innate goodness in humankind. That’s been my experience during the saddest times in my life. So I’d say that this is a timely beacon of light for these very uncertain, unsettling days. I can’t fault the author for wanting to inject hope and faith into humanity, and I like his ten rules to live by. I agree that “Kindness is catching”.

178,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96417621-mira,5,"Is man by nature good or evil?In his excellent second book, Rutger Bregman argues the case for the intrinsic goodness of man, backed with a wealth of heartwarming stories. Like his previous work, this book is well-researched, with around 30% of the book dedicated to citations. He presents balanced evidence from both sides of the debate, which is admirable. However, as he switches back and forth to examples of man’s evil and good nature, you will at some point wonder whether the author is lost in his own argument. Considering the amount of evidence supporting the evil side, this debate seems to be a nonstarter and the author may have struggled as well.Man’s natural inclination towards goodness may be an evolutionary trait. He cites a review study that concluded that our survival is linked to our friendliness. It’s survival of the “friendliest”, not the fittest. It’s a trait that we have perfected throughout history, which made us distinct from other animals. He tries to explain how men turned to evil, citing the birth of civilization and evil leaders as one of the root causes. Our diverse appearance and beliefs also divides us. We are drawn to people like us, and mistrust people who are different from us. But through contact with others, ultimately, our intrinsic goodness emerges.  In the epilogue, he shares ten rules to live by. Somehow these rules reminds me of Hans Rosling’s Factfulness. The world isn’t so bad. The news and social media have distorted reality and manipulated us for years. Sometimes, we are the ones feeding our own miseries.Humankind offers a different look at human history over the years. The evidence may not be a landslide towards an intrinsically good man, but it gives us hope. Personally, I am not convinced that man is naturally good. Our propensity to socialize and conform (we are after all, Homo puppy) can makes us do both good and bad things. I believe that man is capable of transforming into being good, in the same way that it is also capable of falling into evil. What this book affirmed, however, is that our world not awash with monsters out to steal, kill and oppress. There is evil, but it’s not as bad as it looks."
179,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12786924-andrew-spink,4,"This book not only proclaims the title message but with numerous anecdotes, examples and studies makes a pretty though job of proving it. It was more thought-provoking than I had expected (this is a good thing!), for example in highlighting the role that Protestant Christianity (my own background) has had in emphasizing the idea that people are basically negative. The book is easy to read and the author does well in making complex ideas, especially critical looks at psychological experimental data, easy to understand. A big surprise is that out of nowhere he quotes the original rules (from 1748) of the school I went to, about how playing is a waste of time. Fortunately that idea was long gone by the time I went there although there was still a stained-glass window outside the headmaster's study with 'spare the rod and spoil the child'! We were fortunately at that school because there were pupils from all over the world, so we learnt anti-racism in just the way that Bregman would approve of.There are some points of criticism of the book that can be made. It is a bit repetitive sometimes and I would have appreciated a bit more editing to make it a little less rambling in parts. He doesn't quite understand correctly what the 'commons' in 'tragedy of the commons' is about. More seriously, he points out at one stage that you really cannot extrapolate from how hunter-gatherer societies live today to what a vaguely similar society might have been like in the past, but nevertheless then goes on to do that extensively. The idea that hunter-gatherer societies were an idyll may be correct, I don't know, but unfortunately I still don't know after reading his book, there is not really a lot of evidence produced. The bottom line is that I'm very happy that this book is selling so well and being read now starting to be translated. It certainly has the potential to make the world a better place. "
180,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39507552-bill-mak,5,"Bregman preempted his readers throughout his book from dropping it for the simple message that it aims to deliver -- believe in the human kindness that is in our nature despite what the cynics say. He did so by telling a series of highly engaging stories that would indeed change the cynics in our mind. The Lord of the Flies is fiction when there were the boys from the atoll doing just fine. Experiments of social psychology such as that of Stanford prison and shock-the-stranger turn out to be frauds. Even the law-and-order broken window theory turns out to do more bad than good. Then there is the Norwegian prison system that treat their prisoners like ""humans"" by turning the prisons into holiday camp with flat-screen TV, sunbathing chairs, art and music classes where they can make their own recording and even produce their own records under the label ""Criminal Record"" (no kidding!).Was I convinced? The take-home message for me indeed is not fall prey to cynicism and negativities pumped out by news media and also news media where someone makes money by your clicks. It is a luxury to be kind and to be trusting when bad things do happen, not just on your screen but in peoples very lives. The Machiavellians don't disappear just because you don't wish them that way. Nor can evil be wished away either. This is especially true considering that the last book I read was Chris Hedges' America: The Farewell Tour. Hedges didn't really have a solution and it was more like brace-yourself-before-we-crash kind of scenario. But indeed there may be a way out and that is giving peace and kindness a chance because that is who we are, whether from the point of view of evolution, history, or psychology.So rather than saying that I was convinced by Bregman's message. I would say that this is the right way forward. Humankind is just the beginning and not the end.A must-read for everyone."

182,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3077522-s-ashok,4,"Recently read Rutger Bregman's Humankind a hopeful history, a book that argues that contrary to belief Human beings are not brutal/violent creatures who are only civilized due to the presence of punishments and civil society, humans are in general friendly and nice to each other. The book takes on the Hobbesian belief and challenges the way we organize societies, companies based on a fundamental belief in this negative shade of human behavior. The writing is accessible, and the book itself goes into tons of psychological research, evolutionary theory to argue that humans managed to conquer the world not due to their intelligence, but due to this innate tendency to be nice and to cooperate in large scale compared to other species like say the Neanderthals. The book mentions various research in how when consistently nice variants are chosen in say wild foxes, they over the years evolved to show improved intelligence, like how domesticated dogs always have child-like features like the tail, humans this book argues evolved by domesticating themselves. Our faces show a remarkable feminine evolution, we have eyes that are very unique compared to primates with a predominant white portion this helps us understand other people's gaze. We are probably the only primates that blush, so these are proofs that the book argues that over years the nicest human survived to evolve.  The book says that the stories that we say ourselves can become a self-fulfilling prophecy with a fundamental belief in human cruelty can make us bad. The book also explores some of the cruel events of the last century and tries to understand if humans evolved to be nice why such acts happen and some of the reasons behind them Like Racism or Genocide etc what are some of the psychological reasons behind them. On the whole an excellent book which calls to a belief in human goodness."

The news is not an accurate representation of the world, so I was very pleased to see it compared with crack cocaine or sugar within these covers. There's no doubt in my mind that it can poison a public discourse if it becomes too much like propaganda and I've always thought that, in fact, most people are, on balance, good. When you walk down a garden path to meet someone for the first time it is usually a pleasant experience pretty much wherever you are in the world. But I'm not sure that this is very emotionally appealing to all the drama queens in my life – or to self-important journalists.This book is a good counterweight to the cynicism of social media that begins by dismantling the assumptions about human nature that underpin Lord of the Flies, suggesting that they actually tell you more about William Golding's life at a British public school than they do about the real world. Unfortunately the hegemony of the expensively educated men whose world view that book apparently represents, still has a stranglehold on a lot of people's imaginations. So in terms of dismantling it, Human Kind is what you call ""a good start"".Bregman has read a lot of Malcolm Gladwell and refers to him and some other popular behaviouralists, which gave the book more of an academic feel than I was expecting, a re-treading of familiar ground with different conclusions. I didn't mind this. But if it had been less derivative I would have given it five stars.Highly recommended to anyone who has ever been accused of cynicism."
184,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13687692-niamh,3,"I was very kindly given an e-arc of this book via Bloomsbury Publishing and Netgalley.3.5/5 stars.Wow. This book takes all of my brain and then some. This is not the kind of thing you want to read when you're looking for something comforting or easy. Bregman presents dense, meticulously researched evidence to support his claims that humans are intrinsically good, even when we believe they're bad. He combs anthropology, psychology, philosophy, sociology - and puts it all into this tome about humankind. This book is a lot and right now, I was just not in the right mindset. For about half of it, I was on-board, paying attention, absorbing the information, but after 200+ pages without a break from the intensity of this book, I got really fatigued by it. Picking it up felt like a real chore. There's nothing inherently wrong with the book, but I managed to get through his first book - 'Utopia for Realists' - with a bit more speed and comprehension. In fact, this book is almost OVER populated with information, analyses and cases. You quickly lose your footing as an avalanche of evidence comes tumbling over you.If you can get along with dense nonfiction, there's really no better time to read something like this. It praises humanity's ability to come together in a crisis and debunks studies and experiments that have attempted to provide a more cynical view on humanity. There are moments of great joy and epiphany in this book, but it's so easy to get worn out by it constantly being 'on'. It's like reading an academic textbook cover to cover.'Humankind: A Hopeful History' will be released on May 19th. "
185,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/829466-sara,4,"I would count myself as a fan of Rutger Bregman, who is a really up and coming author. I liked Utopia for Idealists better than Humankind, but I did enjoy it overall. I actually find myself... perhaps more cynical than Bregman is in his view of humankind. (Just wait to see how people treat you in your 30s, kiddo). He starts off comparing and contrasting Rousseau with Hobbes, which is the opposing views of civilization's effect on human kindness. He uses a few examples of the 'noble savage' and tries to convince the reader that people are bigger assholes once we obtained property and income disparity became a thing. I wasn't entirely convinced by his take down of Pinker's view on the idea humans have become more docile over time and they were more savage before civilization. For one, as he stated himself, Pinker's tome is 800 pages and he spends a small section of the book critiquing part of his thesis. My favorite parts have to be his debunking of the psych studies about the 'banality of evil'. He had a particularly strong take down of Zimbardo's prison experiment that did make you think. Another strong chapter was about the real Lord of the Flies in which (surprise!) no one died. That one is a particularly gripping tale. When he does actually have to tackle evil in the book, as with war, some parts of his arguments are convincing and some less so. One piece I enjoyed was the Christmas time peace events during WWII. However, while he pins a lot of the more egregious behaviors on a limited number of bad actors, he skims over their psychology to save the 'meek majority'. So, it did feel a bit incomplete. Overall, I found his exploration interesting (always- he is a very engaging writer), but not always convincing. I think people do suck more than he wants to admit, but he does convince the reader that there is more to the droves of books on human nature that already exist out there. It's hard not to like Bregman no matter what you think of his arguments because his views on humanity and his general positive outlook on how to reform society should be lauded. I think there is something to self fulfilling prophecies... Hoping that November will bring more utopian ideals and KINDNESS, because ugh. No more needs to be said about that. "

As a result, we often distrust each other. But it’s neither civilization nor the fear of punishment that prevents violent and selfish behavior. In evolutionary terms, we are neither egoists nor murderers: we are friendly and cooperative, as we can see in the way we behave during crises. So it's high time for a new, more positive view of humanity.• Crises like war don’t automatically make us barbarians.• The idea persists that humans are, at bottom, selfish.• News and fictional stories worsen our view of humanity’s nature.• Humans aren’t evil by nature.• Human evolution isn't about survival of the fittest, but survival of the friendliest.• Civilization turned humans violent. • Our capacity for empathy also has a dark side.• Humans avoid violence whenever possible, even in life-or-death situations.• We need a new, more realistic view of humanity. What to read next: Utopia for Realists, by Rutger BregmanHow can there be so much poverty and injustice in a world with so much material prosperity?

187,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/119595687-aussch,2,"I liked learning about some of the studies and I enjoyed the dose of optimism. I liked how he often framed an opposing interpretation strongly before revealing more information and giving his own new interpretation. However, I couldn’t get through the whole book... by 70% through i just gave up and here are some reasons:1) His premise is never really defined and i find that really confuses the point.Sure, he says that he’s defending the idea that people are, generally speaking, decent and have a “good nature”. I think it would have helped a lot to define what “good nature” in a human means to the author, which as far as i can tell boils down to “willing to cooperate with others” and “has an aversion to violence”, but that is left up to the reader to ascertain. I think this isn’t that wild of a premise... i can agree that this is true of most people.2) I’m not convinced by the ways he interprets evidence.He seems to gloss over things that don’t fit well and interpret with a lot of bias toward making his point.3) His conclusions are too extreme.I agree with the basic premise, but he takes it so far as to essentially say we that if we were hunter gatherers living without any government we’d be great. I think this falls way too far on the Rousseau side of the argument.4) Some of the ways he supports his premise put me on the defensive.He inaccurately juxtaposes his perspective with a straw man of christian religion various times, pretending they are opposites (as if “sin” simply means “isn’t willing to cooperate” and “likes violence”). I wish he would have treated this with a lot more nuance and defended the premise without the atheist-humanist bias."
188,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107843602-rachel-h,3,"In Humankind, Bregman sets out to prove that, despite our global history of war, people are in fact naturally kind to one another. He describes Hobbes and Rousseau and pits their differing viewpoints against each other. At times I found his explanations simplistic and almost patronising. His insistence on referring to humans as Homo puppy for a lot of the book was very irritating.Bregman provides examples of events where one might expect people to turn on one another but where they have instead cooperated with each other. He convincingly debunks numerous scientific experiments that allegedly prove that human nature is naturally evil or unkind. Then he explains selected historical events (e.g. Christmas in the 1914 trenches, the election of Nelson Mandela) through his lens of the kind human. There is no shortage of empirical evidence presented to support his hypothesis. At times I found the seemingly endless examples tiresome to read.I became interested in this book after reading a newspaper article about the ""real Lord of the Flies"" account described in it. This is certainly one of the most exciting parts of the book and I would love to read more about this particular case. Overall, his theory is interesting, and if we all took note of his epilogue of ten rules to live by, perhaps we would all be kinder to one another. But, for me, the style of writing fell into a frustrating in-between space between patronisingly simple and dry academic, and that's why this gets 3 stars instead of 4.I'm grateful to NetGalley for the opportunity to read and review this book."
189,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/723528-donna-boyd,5,"Thank you to #NetGallely, Rutger Bregman and Little, Brown and Company for providing me with a digital copy of this book prior to publication in exchange for my review. Humankind: A Hopeful History by Rutger Bregman is one of the best books I have read in 2020. Bregman put an incredible amount of research into this book and presents it to the reader in an understandable, easy to read format. He builds a case that people are inherently good and that if we approach life with that assumption, then we can change the way we all live together on this planet. Bregman claims that rather than people cracking under pressure, known as the ""Veneer theory"", people are actually at their best in a crisis. And research has shown that even when disaster strikes, such as the New Orleans flood, and there is rampant looting in the aftermath, the looting is insignificant when compared to the huge outpouring of ""giving and sharing of goods and services"" that comes afterwards. And while not everyone will agree with him, Bregman uses evidence from a wide variety of sources, including all those landmark studies like the Milgram electric shock study or the Stanford Prison study, to back up his theories. He is very precise and logical in presenting his arguments and they are both informative and entertaining. He goes into great detail letting us know the problems but then he also provides solutions, finishing up the book his own ten rules to live by. This is a hopeful, timely, and thought provoking book and I highly recommend it."
190,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36727584-jane-dubin,5,"I began reading this in May - as many of us were coming to grips with the Coronavirus pandemic. I’d heard the author interviewed on the ABC podcast: Conversations, and I immediately pre-ordered the book. Rutger Bregman comes across as a lighthearted, compassionate and intelligent young man; I wanted to immerse myself for a while in something positive and hopeful for humanity.I have to say that I do believe in the good in people, and had noticed that the fears and challenges of the pandemic were (on the whole) bringing out the best in people and, strangely, bringing people together. (At least, that has been my personal experience and a general observation). The book (written, of course, pre-pandemic) provided some good, well-researched explanations for that phenomenon.What I did not expect was that I would finish this book as protests and riots were sweeping the world following the death of George Floyd. The final section of Mr Bregman’s book contains information and passages which, honestly, gave me goosebumps. He was so on top of it and ahead of the issue - it’s a little spooky.Philosophically I was open and eager to absorb his ideas, so I can’t really say it was life changing. But, to me, it was a gift of comfort and compassion, filled with great stories and plenty of humor, and just a touch of horror, disapproval and dismay (but never despair). And it helped me to crystallize thoughts and ideas which I look forward to sharing with my children - so, in that sense, I am empowered by it and very grateful for the read."
191,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44021795-reader-variety,3,"Are humans inherently good or bad? Bregman presents the case for the natural goodness in humans, with the most interesting parts of the book where he examines some of the famous experiments or cases (the Stanford Prison experiment, the Kitty Genovese case) concluding that humans are by nature not good. He also examines the Ata island case (where 6 shipwrecked boys managed to live peacefully) as counter to Lord of the Flies.Interesting ""Silver Fox"" experiment in Soviet Union where that notoriously aggressive animal was bred based on any sign of friendliness to humans, and eventually the foxes developed the physical traits of domesticated dogs, apparently due to hormonal changes (fewer stress hormones and more serotonin and oxytocin).Kitty Genovese case conclusions: - of the ""38 eye witnesses,"" most saw nothing, or saw a (presumably drunk) woman staggering up the street yelling- 2 bystanders did call the police, but the police did not come- one woman rushed to help at the end and Kitty died in her armsTests of babies reveal that they are naturally kind, but they also are naturally kinder to others who have their same characteristics - we have a tribal nature, though it can be overcomeStudies of soldiers and wars show that many, if not most, soldiers are averse to killing directly, and that most combat deaths are by indirect firePygmalion Effect - high expectations lead to high outcomes (named after sculptor who loved his creation so much that the gods brought the sculpture to life). Golem Effect - opposite of Pygmalion."
192,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5693583-james-jd-dittes,4,"I want to believe!Rutger Bregman has been looking at the Evidence: stories from sources like the Bible that certainly make ""mankind"" seem more or less like ""man-cruel;"" psychological studies and best-selling novels that affirm that civilization is just a thin veneer below which our animal natures seethe.This is the idea behind this ""hopeful history."" It is redolent of Stephen Pinker's The Better Angels of Our Nature, which showed that mankind had grown less violent over time. And I felt that the overall scope, fell in line with Yuval Noah Hariri's Sapiens. Bregman's ability to spin a good anecdote into a working theory of humankind echoes Malcolm Gladwell at his finest. Mankind is actually pretty conscientious, Bregman asserts. It's just civilization that holds us back.To get here, though, Bregman takes a few too many leaps of faith. Like Rousseau his observations of pre-civilized, pre-historic mankind are full of speculation (women had rights, people looked out for one another, etc.). I'm not saying it's fantasy, but it is a blank canvas that Bregman uses to his advantage. On the other hand, the record of civilization is rife with examples of slavery, exploitation and state-sanctioned cruelty.I was fascinated by Bregman's book. Encouraged, if not convinced. He includes chapters on management and on education that broaden his thesis into actionable approaches that readers might take. After listening to the book, I went out and bought a copy for my principal/supervisor."
193,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103815869-paddy-pikala,5,"Can a book on history be sweet? Can it be hopeful? In this sweet, sometimes even cloying book, Rutger Bregman scans history in order to find proof that we are in fact not that bad of a species. That in cases of disaster or faced with tragedy, we don't think only about ourselves and that we come together to help the weakest. He refutes studies that were designed to prove that we're essentially evil, and finds hope and acts of decency in even the darkest moments of human history.It's a book written in a way that makes it easy to read in one sitting. And it was especially heartwarming to read it in this difficult time.I would like to believe Bregman's arguments. They are clear and convincing, and yet there is something so deep in me trying to question them. Is it because we remember the bad things that happens to us better than the good ones? Nowadays I hear of people coming together to make masks and protective gear for medical personnel, I hear about people delivering groceries to the elderly, and yet the only thing I think about is one community in my city trying get a doctor kicked out from her apartment, because they thought that she somehow threatens their safety.Maybe the book doesn't prove we're essentially good, but it at least proves that we're better than we think. And it's not that difficult to be a decent person. In the end, I'll take the Ten Rules to Live By Bregman offered in his epilogue over Harari's 21 lessons any day."
194,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52156156-mark-p,3,"A powerfully written book, helping provide SOME strong research to debunk many of the psychological experiments that have been the cornerstone of academia for the best part of 50 years. There does remain however an outcome to dismiss evidence that has poor academic rigour, with similar poor rigour. For example, in chapter 6 we see Bergman dismiss Jared Diamond’s methods used to derive the population of Easter Island by quoting analysis by Jan Boersema. Using such terms as “say the population grew...”, “could have been..” , and presented a conclusion - seemingly based upon number equally estimated, albeit with only slightly more credibility.The chapter concludes by saying the real story of Easter Island is “...the story of a resourceful and resilient people, or persistence in the face of odds...” to support the argument that people are kind. This, despite pages and pages of evidence showing how mankind had slaughtered the population of Easter Island, and sold them into slavery. The kindness shown be Easter Islanders counts for all; whereas the ‘evil’ of outsiders is given little weight in the overall assessment of ‘a hopeful history’.I have enjoyed reading the book, although readers are encouraged to challenge the perception of balance presented, and assess the ‘whole’ of the evidence narrated in the pages. Do you find your conclusions sit at odds (at times) with the conclusions drawn by Bergman?"

Are we at heart sociable animals forced to operate in societal structures and situations which assume that we are brutish by nature?Are we innately selfish, rational and self-serving, living lives that are ""solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short""? Or are we innately sociable, friendly, playful, kind and trusting but made cynical, selfish, egotistical and greedy by the circumstances of modern life?Big questions which have been studied for most of the modern era. Spoiler alert, the stance of this book is decidedly more in line with Rousseau than it is Hobbesian.This book is packed with well evidenced examples of the benefits of treating people positively and well. It takes aim at many of the most famous examples, supposedly scientifically proven, from the last century of unpleasant human traits and characteristics coming to the fore. From Stanford Prison to Stanley Milgram, from Easter Island to Lord of the Flies the author comprehensively undermines the basis of all of them.With positive counter examples from dealing with Columbian FARC rebels to Dutch education experiments, from Nelson Mandela to participatory democracy, from follow the rules to free your compassion this book is a wonderful paean to the power of reason, compassion, communication, sociability and kindness.It deserves to be widely read, discussed, debated, and acted upon."
196,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40758735-miguel,3,"One really needs to put on the rose-colored glasses to read this one and then possibly connect them to an external source powered by unicorn farts to match the sentiments present in this book. Bregmen has made some notable positive media appearances recently, namely where he berates billionaires at the World Economic Forum to pay more in taxes and hands Tucker Carlson his rear end in an interview from 2019. Utopia for Realists was a pretty good read. And it’s not that this is a bad book per se, it’s just so bright eyed and bushy tailed and so often approaching mawkish in an eye rolling way. Bregman takes wide aim at a host of different socio and psychological experiments and long-held notions in those fields and along the way criticizes fellow pontificators like himself (Malcolm Gladwell being the common target, and not that I would want to stan Gladwell) that it’s tough to decide whether this is a new gospel or just a wish fulfillment treatise. It would be great to live in the world that Bregmen outlines here, to believe that ‘our natural inclination is for solidarity’ and many of the other upbeat expressions here. And it could very well be that man’s nature bends toward justice and harmony in spite of what we experience every day on the subway. Again, this wasn’t a bad book and it’s not as if his ten rules to live by are complete hokum, but it’s rather difficult to take them at face value and harder still to expect a world to return the same."

The main thesis is that humans are kind in general, and that there is no express need for a state to rein in forces of selfishness. He narrates how the news around us, with its various biases, has made us think that humans are fundamentally selfish. He describes real examples of a group of people who were stuck in a remote island and how they survived well for 14 months. He, however, says that there are some limits to the kindness and altruism. We behave better to people who are like us, than to people who are less like us. This, he believes, explains the various violences in the 20th century. He makes some other assertions, though less compellingly, that compassion is easier than empathy. He also brings up several examples in which self-configuring teams have led to great success, and why top-down constraints could actually cause more harm than good. One of the more interesting stories he talks about is that of the 2009 nobel prize winner who challenged the 'tragedy of the commons'. Towards the end, he gives some life advice, which is useful, but perhaps not the best part of the book. A very lovely read. Some parts of it are story narrations which are gripping, some others are more of formal concepts. Overall, a great book for the times we live in!"
198,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2507413-ymfoo1,3,"Bregman suggests that there is an innate kindness and compassion in each of us and that civilization, slavery, climate change , greed , etc have bring the evil and monster in each of us. But in my view, the root of the problem is the attachment to ""self"". Nature is such that each living animal and person wants to survive, and this survival instinct places self above others. A tiger will kill to feed its hunger to survive. Man will kill if he finds his own existence to be threaten. Man lives in group/society of his own kind so they as a group can survive together. They are peaceful and loving to each other as long as they can survive together. They will fight against another group if their own survival is threatened. The only way to bring out the innate kindness in each one of us is to shed away this attachment to self. If one can stop putting self as IMPORTANT, UNIQUE, SPECIAL, and focus on others, then the innate goodness will arise to the surface. Society is not helping by placing emphasis on competition and on individualism. This encouragement to focus on self-importance is what drives greed and selfish behaviour. Mother Theresa, Florence Nightangle and Mahatma Gandhi are great examples of human being who focuses on others rather than self; and they bring peace and joy to those lives they touched. The question is how can one emulate them? And I think the most difficult challenge is how not to focus on ""self"" when ""I"" have to survive. "
199,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66550807-ethan-gardner,5,"This book was a delightful and engaging read, and was one of the most hopeful books I have read in a long time. It makes an unflinching case for a kinder world, to build institutions on trusting our fellow citizens, and reimagining our history. Bregman takes on some of the biggest names in political philosophy and social psychology, and does a very good job breaking down their flaws. Some of the biggest hits in social psychology, from the Stanford prison experiment to the murder of Kitty Genovese, are based on some very weak experimental design that does not hold up as well under a more critical look.He makes a broad case against what can be called “veneer theory” which is the notion that civilization is nothing more than a thin veneer waiting to crack and allow humans to devolve back into barbarism (think Lord of the Flies). It’s a harsh take on human nature that is surprisingly commonplace in our understanding of the world. But when examining topics as wide ranging as ancient history of hunter gatherer cultures to the ways that modern humans respond to crisis and tragedy, that idea really doesn’t hold up at all. The case being made in this book seems very pie in the sky, but that’s exactly the point of the idea of “a new realism.” Humans as kind, cooperative, hopeful, and altruistic in nature is more realistic. We need to build a society that accentuates those aspects of our nature in public policy, our social programs, and our institutions of democratic engagement."
200,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6678196-olga,4,"(I’m a fluent Dutch reader, but not a fluent Dutch writer, hence a review in English).Rutger makes it look as if writing a book is easy. You sit down and put down on a page everything you have learned the way you would tell it to a friend. Nothing is more difficult of course, especially writing a book that goes against the current of common perceptions and is well on course to change people’s minds about something as fundamental as human nature. I enjoyed it mightily, all of it: the main premise that people are by nature good, the building of the evidence, the self-critical look at Rutger’s own earlier work. Yes, there are passages, where I’d want a bit more depth or nuance, but even in those passages the main argument was on point (e.g. when writing about Broken Windows theory and how NYC police chief Bratton applied it to terrorize my city - you cannot talk about it without talking about the American brand of racism, which Rutger mentions more as a side matter rather than the root problem. But in the end it doesn’t change the argument Rutger makes: broken windows policing is bad and evidence proves that). An excellent read, that gives hope and ideas that a better organization of our world is possible. I read it out in just a couple days and it filled me with joy. Can’t wait for it to come out in English so I can recommend it to my non-Dutch friends. "
201,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33448264-duncan-bahr,5,"In Humankind: A Hopeful History, author Rutger Bregman posits that humans are, deep down, good natured bucking conventional wisdom.We were essentially neighborly, good willed and natured to one another as hunter-gatherers until the corrupting influence of the exploitative agrarian revolution with it’s kings, patriarchy, armies and private property. However, over the past ten thousand years since the ‘Garden of Eden period, humankind’s innate good nature has shown through, in war and in day to day experiences, of which Bregman provides many non-fictional but captivating stories where people did the right things not because of the civilizing effect of culture, laws and religion but because we simply have evolved to be ‘Homo Puppy.’ While some may find Bregman’s point of view too sunshiny, there is an exhaustive amount of research provided to back up his ideas, which are compelling and quite persuasive.It is refreshing to read such a positive point of view about humanity but Rutger Bregman calls himself a ‘realist’... a ‘new realist.’Look out Thomas Hobbs and Adam Smith! This Dutchman has got you in his crosshairs and his weapon may just be a Christmas carol sung in the trenches of World War I, an honest humanizing conversation or basketball game between wardens and prisoners in Norway or dinner with your mugger in the Bronx.Terrific read! Perfect for our times!"
202,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10277474-saswati-saha-mitra,4,"Humankind by Rutger Bergman is an interesting pop psychology book which helps you retrain your thinking around the thing that matters- having faith in the goodness of human beings.A book that’s highly relevant for our times, Bergman’s research challenges the definition of man as selfish and violent from Hobbes to Philip Zimbardo of the Stanford Jail experiment fame. He looks at alternative research and business models like the prison system in Norway or the Buurtzorg health system in the Netherlands where, by focusing on taking care of people, the entire social system benefits from less crime, increased productivity and enhanced pride in one’s work.What’s fascinating about this book is its attempt at recasting world events from a positive perspective. Instead of assuming, people will kill during warfare, Bergman’s research shows how averse is mankind to killing and if we can truly engage with each other beyond superficial empathy, we have the potential to achieve long term change. Humankind is a call to the possibility of a different reality if we can all take a step back from our loss aversion mindset and veneer theory of human beings giving into our worst at the slightest challenge. Super relevant in our times with black lives matter and the community engagement we have seen the world over with Covid -19 for instance."
203,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69909681-jonathan,5,"Rutger Bregman's ""Humankind"" reads like something by Malcolm Gladwell if Gladwell was younger, Dutch, even more straightforward, and perhaps slightly more optimistic. As a result, Bregman employs the same superb format Gladwell is known for: taking a plethora of intriguing anecdotes from around the world and using them to demonstrate a greater theme. The result is a masterfully-woven piece of text that pulls together a variety of narratives to denounce the widespread cynicism that has infected society, jettisoning it in favor of a much more productive, positive view of humanity. I particularly enjoyed the parts in which Bregman showcases parts of the world where positive views of humanity have overcome negativity and created a better system, whether turning Neo-Nazi marches into charity walks or the miraculous prison systems in the Nordic countries. I admittedly went into the book with a pretty cynical view, and I'm not going to say that I had some kind of epiphany, but I certainly found it exceptionally uplifting and eye-opening in certain facets of society where I previously took the current system as a given. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking to read some interesting stories, reconsider their view of humanity, or even just experience a new perspective."
204,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11380981-josh-hogan,5,"Many of us in the modern world are inclined to think that humanity is intrinsically bad, immoral and untrustworthy; that life is getting progressively worse with ever heightening dangers at the door. Rutger Bregman asks us to stop and reconsider this view, arguing that humans are in fact fundamentally good. By looking at the evidence from archaeology, sociology and other sciences, he finds that many famous studies that supposedly showed our 'evil' nature were actually flawed, from the Stanford prison experiment to Milgram's electric shock test. Setting out to debunk everything we thought we knew about ourselves, Bregman tries to show that even the most heinous acts of cruelty, including the holocaust, were rooted in the perpetrator's mistaken good intentions, rather than some innate evil.I think Bregman makes a good case, he certainly tells a good story and has done well to present a great deal of scientific evidence in a fun, readable format. Whether's he right or not, I need more time to decide. From time to time his tone can come across a little light when you consider the subject matter at hand. His cutesy way of referring to humans as 'homo puppy' all the time, even in a chapter about the Nazi death camps, is quite cloying. But in the end I liked the book and think it should give all of us food for thought."
205,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67338172-kriss,5,"An excellent read, offering a different analysis of research projects which have dominated the social and political landscapes for decades. He offers hope to the disillusioned who have grown weary of swimming against the tide of popular beliefs and opinions despite knowing that they are dancing to different music from the sleeping majority. He writes in a humorous way, inviting the reader to explore a different perspective on the human race; offering a different narrative to the usual gloom and doom of opinion and the biased media. He challenges the propaganda of the mainstream underpinnings of social policy without losing his integrity and remaining transparent. It is an invitation into becoming Alice Walker’s, “We are the people we have been waiting for” if we can only have the courage to open our eyes and really look at our compatriots and see our common humanity. His antidote to the “Lord of the Flies” sets the tone so buckle up for an amazing spectacle of truth that will set you thinking and speculating. You will enjoy and learn a lot from this book, his analysis may not always be spot on but it is an invitation to critically think about how we arrived here and in this particular time, we need to hone our skills. "
206,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8367962-lorelei,4,"This is an interesting read and a well-researched one. Also, it's nice to read a social psychology book with a bright side. I agree with him about the mainstream media skewing things towards the bleak and as a result, limit myself. That said, it's a polemic. Bregmen really, really wants us to believe we are all naturally good and that evil is a social construction; citing power, private ownership and the switch from hunter gatherer groups, and it just isn't that simple.Even in packs of animals such as wolves, some will not conform to the rules of the group & behave selfishly. It is naive, given the last hundred years of wars, genocide, imposed famines and dictatorships to say, ""society made them do it"". The worldwide assault rates also remind us of the same thing. There are cruel people who consistently act in their ow self-interest. Period.To see the good in people is a nice trait but it doesn't mean closing our eyes or instinct to the reality that some are evil. Inherently evil. To behave as if they are would result in a life of mistreatment and pain. Yes, there are bright spots on history but in some eras they are truly only spots.(BA Sociology, MA Cultural Studies)."
207,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4749257-mike-clinton,4,"Although part of me suspects that it may be due more to confirmation bias than to the unimpeachable reasoning and evidence of Bregman's argument, I found this ambitious book compelling and rewarding. Even if it is a matter of confirmation bias, Bregman proposes making the Pascalian wager to believe that people are essentially kind, mean well, and thrive more in win-win environments than a zero-sum ones. The tone has that breezy appeal similar to the way Thomas Friedman presents ideas, as if each one is a brand being marketed. That's another element that tugs at my skeptical side. The evidence comes across as serious and diverse, taken from a range of scholarly and popular-anecdotal sources. Still, the breadth of Bregman's thesis--nothing less than a recalibration of the dominant narrative about human nature itself--left an impression that the evidence supporting it was a mile wide and an inch deep. It also felt as though he was overreaching, too, by seeking to replace one view of human nature with another view of human nature--whereas the very concept of a human nature is itself unconvincing. Far from any of these criticisms or qualifications keeping me from finding the book worthwhile, though, they indicate how engaging I found it."
208,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72660138-manuela,5,"Among other things, Bregman discredits famous social psychology experiments and events that are being presented to social sciences students in universities. However, Milgram and Stanford Prison experiments were never presented to me, as a student, as proof that people left on their own were vile, ruthless creatures. They merely showed that we are capable of inflicting great harm to others in certain circumstances (when authority is involved), which is true and doesn’t necessarily annul the good nature of people. I liked the fact that the author involves the reader in the process of his research and lets us see that he is also struggling with these questions about human nature. I took his book as in invitation to further reading on the researches he mentions and the real-life examples he provides. I think, in the end, the merit and aim of this book is to stimulate people to be an active part of their community and democracy by making them see their similarities rather than their differences. It encourages people towards cooperation for a better future by showing we are not a hopelessly selfish species, but on the contrary."

This book explains everything. And I mean, everything. Forget ‘49’, the meaning of life is homo puppy, our garden of Eden the long, leisurely days of nomadic wandering, the Fall the discovery of agriculture and our current predicament, repeated attempts the fit the square peg of homo puppy into the round hole of civilisation. People are emotional vacuum cleaners, says Bergman at one point, ‘always sucking up other people’s feelings.’ We’re like barometers of those around us. And it’s this aspect of our social development that accounts for so much of where we find ourselves today, for both good and ill. The best books, in my opinion, take a long time to read not because they’re obscure or unclear; because they’re so utterly compelling and thought-provoking. This is just such a book. ‘Think as carefully about what information you feed your mind as you do about what food you feed your body’, the author says at one point. And there’s no better mind food than this book! "

However, the author suggests in this book the concept of ‘New Realism’, the idea that actually people are kind and good. The author describes famous events in history such as the Blitz and WW1 and popular psychological studies such as the Stanford Prison Experiment but focuses on them from this new perspective of human kindness.I think this is a very good book to read in the current times we are going through, it’s so easy to get lost in all the negativity in the world rather than focusing on helping others. I found the stories in this book truly inspirational and it certainly gave me hope for humanity. The arguments presented were a lot less cynical and pessimistic towards human nature than the view that is usually presented be scientists, psychologists, sociologists etc. Overall I did enjoy this book and would definitely recommend if you are looking for an uplifting non-fiction. The only thing I disliked about the book was I did find that it was longer than needed to be and it felt like it dragged in some places.My rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️✨ (3.5/5)"
211,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/888868-hannah-crowther,4,"A hopeful book built on the premise that “most people, deep down, are pretty decent.” While it felt oversimplified at times (such as the fairly romanticized version of the peace and tranquility among hunter-gatherer societies), it also put familiar stories in new light and challenged lots of assumptions. It told the story behind the infamous Stanford prison experiments (spoiler alert: it was staged) to the real-life Norwegian prison where guards are taught that it’s “better to make friends with inmates than to patronize and humiliate them” and which has one of the lowest recidivism rates in the world. From the Christmas truce of 1914 during World War 1, to radically rethinking schools and businesses in ways that assume people want opportunities for creativity and meaningful work, this book pulls from history, anthropology, economics, politics, Jesus, terrorists, Nelson Mandela, media, Nazis, policing and psychology, in ways that sometimes felt disconnected and anecdotal, but which ultimately presented a hopeful, optimistic, kind view of human nature. This book was a welcome respite."
212,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100635-naomi,4,Bregman's analysis of the three most famous psychological experiments of the 20th century were very interesting and thought provoking. I was more than willing to be engaged and was very interested to hear the back story on the experiments themselves as well as alternate studies which gave a different interpretation. Overall this was the most researched and thought-out part of the book. The later chapters of the book were more of a stretch (you could feel that Bregman really wanted a particular outcome. He leapt for conclusions that weren't properly argued or weren't apparent) but worth analysing the role the media and academia has in pushing a certain cynical view on their audience either for feeding the ravening wolf of the media readership (who seem to want proof of man's fundamental selfish nature) or because the outcome of man the self interested being is what gets published. Overall this book lived up to its title and i recommend it to anyone dragged down by a humanitarian education where human nature a weak and futile thing. I really did feel uplifted having read it. His summary of 15 points at the end were well worth the effort of reading the book as a whole.
213,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92692465-dani-l-nelson,2,"Berger attempts to demonstrate the goodness of humanity. Are people inherently good? He revisits the 'textbook examples' that support the opposite – that people are bad. His research confounds many ideas about humankind's maliciousness. Questions he answers are:– What exactly happened during the Stanford Prison Experiment?– How aggressive were soldiers actually during the World Wars? – What if there was a real life Lord of the Flies?– Were early humans savages? Berger's reexamines these questions interestingly. He confutes many evidences about 'human evil'. This is, however, where I dislike the book. Berger mostly explains why people are NOT bad. He gives less attention to why people ARE good. I still wonder why people have war. Why are we capable of torture? Why are there high-school bullies? Why do we live comfortably in disparity? Why is there child abuse? Berger largely neglects these questions. He is too busy disproving textbooks, but skips over large questions. He tends to be utopian. His revisitation of some examples is apparently enough proof humankind is inherently good. "
214,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8332449-rimjhim-roy,5,"This is a book that wants you to believe that in spite of the outright, everyday terribleness that we are surrounded by, people are fundamentally decent. We're a species oriented to kindness and goodness; that it is the systems around us, systems that govern us, systems that feed us information, that take the view that humans need extrinsic motivation and are terrible that have made us so terrible. He takes on case after terrible case in human history to tear it down and show us flawed assumptions and make us believe that only if we look under the surface, humans are actually created for cooperation.To be honest, I found this to be a difficult book to read. I do believe that humans are fundamentally decent and honest, yet I faced a lot of mental resistance to the central premise. I took extensive notes and had my own ""Yes, but"" caveats to his theories. But the author does a really good job of at least convincing me that if we just treat people with the idea that they are fundamentally decent and motivated and build systems around it, it will be a self fulfilling prophecy.Would recommend reading to at least help us imagine a different world."
215,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110219041-alp-akir,4,"Would recommend it to read, a must read for realistic and cynical people. The book is like a combination of three theme's: a big history on humans, psychological analyses of our behavior and an essay about how mankind functions in societies. The author has the tendency to falsify a wide range of assumptions and past research on why mankind has a tendency towards doing wrong. Definitely a game changer.It was an unexpectedly good book. The book has a lot of background research and is pleasant to read. This combination is possible because the author's curiosity and background research turns each chapter into a surprising story. Before I knew it the book was finished. The only backside I could think of is that stories are pleasant to read (and to remember) but also result in a lightly unstructured writing style and methodology. The book might have been written in a more concise manner. Sometimes, I also got the feeling that this book was written accidentally. Well done if this was the case."
216,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6334314-rebecca-rouillard,5,"Rutger Bregman sets out to debunk the ‘veneer theory’, the idea that humans have a thin facade of civilisation that easily cracks under pressure to reveal the evil creature within all of us, as depicted in William Golding’s classic novel, The Lord of the Flies.Some of the examples Bregman investigates are fascinating, from the Christmas truce in the trenches of World War I, to the history of Easter Island, to the psychological thought experiments that supposedly proved how evil we are: the Stanford Prison Experiment and the Milgram Shock Machine experiment. This is not a blindly, naively optimistic book. Bregman addresses the evils that humans do perpetrate, but he is also clear on the role that newspapers and social media play in creating clickbait content that incites fear and prejudice and doesn’t in fact accurately reflect how most of us live. Humankind is, however, a book with a purpose—to raise our expectations of humanity and to inspire us to hope that we can create a better society. It is a thoroughly inspiring book as well as being very readable and engaging."

Kindness is a fascinating topic, and and I found this exploration genuinely compelling.I think what works best about Humankind is its structure. It's perfectly paced and logically moves from theory to theory. Bregman doesn't just present key philosophical concepts, but pulls them apart and breaks them down into comprehensible pieces - without the use of jargon. Humankind covers a lot of ground, but it does so in such a measured way that I never felt lost or overwhelmed by information. There are a few too many black-and-white comparisons (theories that were presented just to be neatly overturned), but this is a topic which has attracted a lot of contradictory ideas, so perhaps that shouldn't be surprising.Humankind is a refreshing, intelligent and thought-provoking read.*Thank you to Netgalley for the arc in exchange for an honest review*"

I have found that introducing myself to my classes and using strategies to allow my students to get to know each other means a co-operative group dynamic. And yes, forecasting bright futures and praise and kindness allow all students to shine.Rutger Bregman is the man for our times. I recognised almost every “fact” about which he wrote - and then was shocked at the way reports and studies had been manipulated and distorted to prove the opposite and negatively pessimistic view of human beings and their motivations - to serve business and political ends. If Minneapolis in this time of George Floyd can dismiss their largely racist police force and invest the money in community-based and community-serving systems - this book will surely be an important guide.

219,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3323688-derrick-trimble,5,"Before I finished chapter 1, I had ordered copies to send to both of my sons. I could not put this book down. Although I am a slow reader, I finished the book over the weekend. Page after page my belief in humanity was affirmed. Time and again I was transported to the childlike faith I had as a boy that people are good and one should do no harm. There are a few books and authors on my bookshelves that create a resonance in my being. This is now one of them. Bregman cites several other authors in Humankind of whose work I have read. Is my affection for the content simply a mirroring of my own beliefs or does it genuinely reflect universal qualities of humanity? With every leading question I'd pose in a face-to-face, he was one step ahead responding to my next condition. So much so, that I found myself early on quoting the X-File tagline ""I want to believe"" before each argument I may have presented. From historic researcher, philosopher, or ordinary person Humankind offers an alternate take on what people are capable in terms of good and bad behaviour. Does Bregman's research nullify the institutionally accepted theorems pervasive in the infrastructures of society and the institutions that perpetuate those theories? To my satisfaction, yes. Without digging through the catalogues of cited research, early on I gladly assumed a position of trust. How did he maintain my trust throughout?How easily he could have hammered well-known researchers for their poorly devised and analysed work. More so, for how the destructive influence those researchers theories sway institutional ideology centuries and decades after those theories were touted and failed as revolutionary solutions to what ails society. Instead, Bregman stays the course of the good nature of humanity by exposing the flaws while not sugar coating baser qualities that history and our memories highlight. Many of the books I read either cite the same stories or follow a similar pattern of layered disclosure. Humankind took those same stories and gave them a twist like looking at a diamond under sunlight. A slight turn of the wrist and a whole new perspective came into view. For the open-minded reader, that slight turn should expose facets of their humanity that inspires awe, affirmation, and positive action for change. 100% and wholeheartedly recommend this book."

(i.e. hunter-gatherer) Or better in many ways. I think most of us recognize that what Bregman argues is true (thank goodness), but the book doesn't really address how to allow this 'truth' to become dominant and therefore improve things. It seems to me that the crux of the problem is how contemporary society can banish or diffuse the influence of those narcissists and psychopaths that so often become powerful (like the !Kung). That is the trick: some kind of required leadership by people known to be competent and fair? Guided by A.I. perhaps? That is, how do all of us nice guys finish first, directing resources most equitably and efficiently? Kudos for reframing the dialogue."

Thank you, thank you, Rutger Bregman!My life motto has always been; ""Everybody is good, at least until the opposite is proven, many many times"" And I've also come to realise (thanks to Robert Sapolsky and other neurologists) that if its proven some people are bad, or acting bad, there is probably a neurological and environment explaination behind it.Bregman presents this view on humanity in this book, and backs it up with many evidences, great stories and debunked psychological studies wich at earlier times were supposed to prove our ""selfish nature"". Bregman instead claims we are hardwired for friendship, cooperation and goodness.I've called humanitys greatest superpower empathy, and Bregman says thats misleading and says it is compassion we should use. I think Einstein also has said that we should expand our circle of compassion. I'm onboard with that, and try to do my best. And I think this is essential for a better future for, not just humans, but all living organisms on our planet. Read it - everybody!"
222,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14190845-mitch,5,"Bregman does a great job at tearing down Lord of the Flies and various popular social experiments that goad us to believe the ""veneer"" theory of human nation—that without government authority, we'd just kill each other. This is like the pop-sci version of Rebecca Solnit's A Paradise Built in Hell (which he references, and which I recommend over this book). 5 stars for the importance of the ideas here, but there are some things I wish were better. Mainly that it never says ""we don't know."" It's all too neat of a package. The book tends to be as definitive as any This One Idea Changes Everything book (re: Malcolm Gladwell, Chip & Dan Heath), which frankly makes it less convincing. The is especially true of the last third of the book, which he tried to proscribe changing the world without having to change too much in doing so. He's on strong ground when he's using social research to debunk social research, but I'm also skeptical about his uses of prehistory and his conclusions about war. "
223,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50154090-marc-menz,5,"A glass half full, the author paints a realistic picture and quite a clear cut argument for optimism when it comes to people. He puts into words what I believe a lot of us are thinking - that most of us are pretty good human beings. I’ve never really seen violence, I’ve been to many countries and rarely have I felt unsafe. Just about everyone I’ve met has been hospitable, kind and friendly. Perhaps one in a hundred encounters may be with someone grumpy, but I don’t know that person and there could very well be a reason for it. Regardless, humans are pretty decent all told.The bad apples are clearly a minority. This book helps make that point with some fantastic examples. I would have liked some more criticism of the news and media - but really we know they’re a mess that are selling fear and outrage. I like this book. It makes me feel like things are possible, that we can achieve a lot more if we just shift our attitudes slightly. Recommending it to my mum who watches far too much news "
224,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7326414-colin-marks,5,"This is a fantastic read.Bregman's premise is that humans are a pretty decent species, and not the monsters that the media portrays through dodgy reporting and dubious science. The sections where he tears into widely reported examples of human selfishness and aggression - such as the Stanford Prison Experiment, the Milgram experiment, the self-destruction of Easter Island, Kitty Genovese's murder (all of which I'd heard of and believed the established narratives) - was eye-opening and shocking, shocking in the sense that they're still being used today, decades later, in school text books.Right now, where societal divisions are being utilised for politcal gain, and it's too easy accept that society would implode without the controlling hand of the state, it's refreshing to read that humands are better than that. Leaders have to try hard to instill the hatred that's the cancer of our current time, so when that leadership changes, there's hope for us all.An excellent book, read it.Book supplied by Netgalley for an honest review."

In ""Humankind"", Bregman takes on another group of people who think they have it all figured out, cynics. Through a curated combination of anecdotes and social science, Bregman makes a compelling argument that humankind is fundamentally good. In the process, he punches holes in a number of famous social science experiments and theories including the Stanford Prison Experiment, the Milgram Shock Experiments, the Bystander Effect, and the Broken Windows Theory. Each case is either flagrantly bad science (Stanford), woefully misunderstood (Milgram), or just plain wrong (Bystander and Broken Windows). Bregman's writing (and the Dutch to English translation) is at once casual and precise which makes ""Humankind"" an enjoyable, quick read despite its 400+ pages. Sure to be one of my most frequently recommended books for readers looking for some optimistic, realistic, and well-written nonfiction."

The topic seems too big for 400 pages.When it comes to my own field, education, Bergman becomes less critical. A few pages after he quotes Betrand Russel (""never let yourself be diverted either by what you wish to believe or by what you think would have beneficent social effects if it were believed"") he swallows Drummen's story on Agora without question, which is strange, because in every other field he doubts single examples and searches for back ups (I know he mentions two other schools in two sentences, but these are not that easily comparable to Agora). Also, some information provided about Agora is incorrect and easy to discover (likes grades, which do exist at Agora).But one of the major things I missed was social media. Internet trolls do get a paragraph, Facebook is mentioned as a side note in the epilogue, but, in my opinion if there is one force playing with our humanity for the last 10 years it is social media and role Google has played in enforcing our prejudices."

The idea is, we didn’t evolve to live in a world organized like ours, and while we think we have a realistic view, we’re (mostly) mistaken. It’s a hopeful book – if we can learn to look at the world correctly, we can make a much better world. At times, Bregman’s analysis seems convincing, but at other times, it feels a little artificial. It’s maybe too easy to say, for instance, the criminal justice system doesn’t work, so let’s just do the opposite (or the education system, or employment, health care, playgrounds, etc), and it’s a fun argument, a fun way to look at things… and sure, he digs up some studies that back up his views, and pokes holes in other studies that said the opposite. In any case, I’m inclined to think it’s a worthwhile read, even if not quite as completely convincing as the author seems to believe, the ideas explored are mostly worth spending the time with."

He shares anecdotes that support the idea that people are instead good natured and will do right by each other. He also spends time reviewing and examining aspects of social psychology and debunking related popular experiments and studies. I was excited to learn that the Stanford prisoner experiment was invalidated a few years ago. It's an experiment I've heard about multiple times and that always stuck with me in a negative way given its horrendous outcome.He explores areas such as confirmation bias and negativity bias, competing philosophies as they pertain to human behavior, early civilization, the media, and other concepts such as prison reform and people management theories. I had heard many of the stories and theories previously, but it was nice to have them all in one place and linked together to support an optimistic premise. I was also glad he offered his lessons learned/tips at the end of the book"

Even though I've always been a very optimistic person, it's quite nice to know that there is some substantial evidence for the theory that says humans are inherently good. This book gave me some insight in how even I as an optimist am (unconsciously) still stuck in some pessimistic behaviour. I'm a teacher and I can say I'll be changing some of that behaviour asap. So thank you, Rutger Bregman, for opening my eyes to some things I wasn't able to see before. P.S. Though I understand why some people were bothered by the writing style, I myself had no problem with it. It actually made me feel understood by and connected with the writer. And besides, isn't Bregman's overall message way more important than some of his writing mannerisms? Let's focus on what he's trying to say, instead of how he's trying to say it. "

Rousseau in the eighteenth century felt that left to ourselves we'd get along fine. In this wonderfully uplifting book Rutger Bregman sides with Rousseau. For 95% of human history we were nomads and the archaeological record suggests we valued cooperation over conflict. Then came farming, settled communities and what my RE teacher in the 1970s Mr. Croskerry used to refer to as 'so- called civilisation' and that's when it all started to go wrong. I agree that most people are decent and want to get along with others. Really we should be creating economic, political and social structures that support that. Instead we have, for example, an economic order that encourages us to want more and more for ourselves.In this book Rutger suggests some ways in which me might help our better angels fly.

Bregman presents an optimistic view of human beings, and backs this up with many, many examples. He writes like Malcolm Gladwell, though his only mentions of Gladwell in this book are critical. I would have liked to see references here to some examples of self-managed, democratic societies of the kind that Bregman advocates, including Georgia's experiment in democratic socialism (1918-21), the kibbutz movement in Israel, Mondragon in Spain, and the cooperative movement more generally. Having lived many years on a kibbutz myself, I can also see some of the weaknesses in Bregman's argument. It is not enough to just have weekly meetings of the entire community; over time, fewer and fewer people may attend those meetings. But on the whole, a beautifully written, convincing argument for a kind of anarchist-libertarian-socialist world."

Every few pages I would be so astounded by something I read that I would have to stop and recount it to anyone in the room with me. Examining how flawed many of the studies that have taken place which supposedly proved that humans are intrinsically bad as well as looking at what happens when people are treated with trust and understanding, Humankind is a real eye opener.I finished this book filled with optimism about what the future of the human race could look like. At a time of great change in the world, when people have supported each other through a pandemic that has swept the entire worlds, and when so many people are coming together to demand an end to racism, this book is a very timely read. The notion that left to their own devices people will treat each other well and with kindness and compassion may seem revolutionary but this is what the world needs."

Many broad and sparsely substantiated claims particularly about our predecessor hunter gatherers being peaceful cooperators living more secure and less stressful and less violent lives. Chapters where he debunks the famous and highly impactful Zimbardo prisoner-guard experiment and the Milgram shock machine experiment are important but could be more convincing. I don’t disagree with the major premise but I did not find his recommendations and characterizations of student-directed schools or citizen budgeting to be totally credible or scalable. The description of the effective and humane Scandinavian “prisons” were convincing as I had seen them described elsewhere. Thought provoking but some of the less substantiated claims make it a bit less convincing. Would have to follow up and read up on the references to believe it totally credible.

A powerful look at the Machiavellian lens through which our culture has viewed human nature, despite mounds of evidence to contrary. I didn’t truly realize how much the idea of veneer theory had colored my view of the world.There are certainly flaws in some of the individual arguments made, and Bregman’s simplistic treatment of the psychological literature leaves out or downplays some important counterpoints. But the overall message is valid and revolutionary, and the evidence of the book is convincing—humans are fundamentally cooperative, and our trust, rather than being naive as is commonly assumed, is actually the source of human exceptionalism. Furthermore, our beliefs in others create a self-fulfilling prophecy, causing one to wonder “what could be accomplished if we flip the cultural propaganda that says humans are selfish upside down?”"

What if the desire to believe that we are barely constrained monsters, selfish, quick to panic is a convenient fiction from which those who find themselves at the top profit when the masses believe that we need forceful elite guidance in order to be safe. What if instead of monsters, humans are intrinsically motivated to help each other. What if during a disaster like Sandy or 911 or unfair state sponsored brutality our instinct is to help.Bregman, citing a great slew of examples - historical, biological, psychological, philosophical, shows just that. I found Humankind a lot of fun to read. A credible, extensively researched reminder that there is more to be gained by looking for examples of effective resistance and by choosing to look for the good in people, than by surrendering to the divisiveness and fear being pushed by certain bullies.

The author sets out to determine if man is inherently competitive and 'evil' or inherently kind. Spoiler alert, many of the studies that have set out to prove the nature of man is mean spirited, were flawed, or not unbiased. I found this book really intriguing and interesting. And very timely. The author also discusses the reasons why we all might think that left to our own devices, man is a scheming and manipulative animal. Mainstream media focuses attention on the more spectacular results (nothing we don't already know) but fails to point out or spotlight when the results don't fit the fantastical agenda. There were many examples given of the human KIND ness, nature of man. One memorable one is the truce on Christmas Day during WW1 when opposing soldiers lay down their weapons and exchanged songs and fellowship. I would highly recommend this book. "

This is something that I believe to some extent, although it’s a premise that has been sorely tested in the UK over the past few years when you consider the whole Brexit debate. Bergman does touch upon big issues, such as immigration and war, but in a way that shows us how we might combat negative thinking. He shares some fantastic stories of kindness and inspiration and also takes apart some of the psychological experiments of the 60s to consider flawed scientific methods. The end of the book provides some thoughts about moving forwards. I wavered for a bit with my rating. Very nearly 5 stars, but sometimes a bit more nuanced thinking might have been useful.

The stories presented are powerful and work to hold up the main argument. The data presented also works in favor of the thesis.Cons:The main problem I had with this book is more of a personal preference. The book focuses more on stories than on data. While I think stories are important in getting people to accept certain truths, I can't get myself to believe something if the data doesn't check out.

I have never taken so many quotes from a book, it has inspired me to take all sorts or action and I am recommending it to so many people to read! This is the perfect antidot to the ‘fear’ that is constantly banded around in the media/news about how humans are so ‘bad’, I have never believed this and from my personal experience of travelling all over the world meeting people from all demographics I have found people to be so friendly!

Humankind is full of interesting illustrations of human nature, often brushed under the rug to push a certain narrative. Rutger weaves these patches into a very cohesive quilt that is both comforting and beautiful--something the world really needs right now. There could have been more examinations of the data behind the idea that people are generally decent, but due to what has been funded and where money gravitates, I feel a lot of effort has been wasted on gathering the wrong data. Rutger does a good job showing this by looking into various famous ideas and studies that have become doctrine for human nature and illuminates how we've very possibly gone wrong.I recommend this book to everyone and hope its ideas are continued to be explored and built upon, leading to a better world."

Some of the points that made an impact on me were:•	nocebo effect  If we believe most people can't be trusted, that's how we'll treat each other, to everyone's detriment•	Veneer theoryas per Dutch biologist Frans de Waal, there is a persistent myth that by their very nature, humans are selfish, aggressive, and quick to panic.•	Hobbes  The man who asserted that civil society alone could save us from our baser instincts•	Rousseau Who declared that in our heart of hearts we're all good” and that “'civilization' is what ruins usThe books provides several examples to prove that quick theories that we all rely on are not the right way to judge people and how those theories are fundamentally flawed.

In the fight between the victorious Hobbesian view (the beast with a veneer of humanity), Bregman sides with the Rousseau idea of the 'noble savage' - we are born nice and made evil by civilisation.Skilfully, Bregman makes his case by demonstrating, mostly through case histories and debunking those who show our beastly side, how wrong Hobbes was and how right is the more benign view. Unfortunately for Bregman, civilisation has done its work, and their is evil in the world. Maybe we are better than we think, but so what? He agues that if we are seen to be good, we will treat people better and everyone will be happier. Maybe he is right.Bregman is an outstanding public intellectual, like Hariri and Pinker, and deserves to be read."

Some of his arguments are quite compelling, but it seems that his Bregman is willing to apply his own sophistry to absolutely anything. Too much evil is skimmed over in this book and it makes for a naive and somewhat annoying read. Bergman also paints with broad brush strokes and categorises all evil without referring to deterministic mutations in the brain that cause psychopathy in individuals such as Bundy, Hitler. It seems that the author swerved away from true, individual evil as a means of trying to convince you that we are ALL good.

Probably not, if you were educated in the schools that have been teaching faulty research, or by headlines that always seek for the shocking.

Sometimes, Bregman uses his world vision a bit too easily, which makes this book more of a story that is backed up by science than science that is told by stories, but I guess that is inherent to the matter at hand.This book challenged me and gave me a different view to look at the world.

For so long psychologists and the likes have been waging war on our human nature, saying we’re selfish and governed by our own self interests.

I love the tone and I love the content. You might not. That is fine, although I hope we can find common ground in that the approach is really rather good. Facts and findings are delved into and cross-examined rather than being assumed to be bonafide fact. Realism is called into question. Whether you agree with findings is up to you but psychological studies are put under the microscope in a way I really wish A Level Psychology had done. Sometimes what we think of as realist is just another kind of fiction.If you read one non-fiction book this year, make it this one."

Bregman supplies lots of interesting examples of how we erroneously believe that we are intrinsically bad or aggressive and then offers alternative views (and findings) on these scenarios, these events. He talks about how the soldiers on the Western Front during WWI spontaneously celebrated Xmas together in 1914 and talks at length about the false claims made by scientists re the collapse of the Easter Island population.

Told in a series of real life stories from the past along with scientific studies it was a captivating read that meant I didn’t want to put the book down. There were moments that perhaps needed more backing up or more explanation but overall most of the points were well researched and persuasive. It was also more of a general overview of the whole history of humankind which was great to put the arguments into a time frame - too often history is told in isolated parts. I now just want to tell everyone about the other side of the stories they think they know.

On top of that it, for me personally, it confirms my view on life and people namely that most people don't have bad intentions.I loved it so much that i bought the audiobook to listen with my more sceptical partner and he enjoyed it immensly too. He still is more sceptical but willing to give more people a chance.Because like the author says at the end of the book: If you assume someone doesn't mean well and you treat him/her that way it is unlikely you'll ever find out if you were wrong and you might miss out on all kinds of learning and connection. (well that's how i'd paraphrase what he says anyway)"
263,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66335067-virgil-mitrea,5,"Another lovely book from Rutger Bregman. I already liked his ""Utopia for Realists"", so looked forward to read ""Humankind"" (great title, suggesting ""Human Kindness""). And I liked it from the very first page: ""This is a book about a radical idea [...] that most people, deep down, are pretty decent"".The goodness is intrinsic to human nature and, as a rule, we tend to be kind with our fellow men. Badly behaving is an exception induced by unfavorable circumstances. It's disturbing and damaging, so very visible, but however outnumbered by the good deeds and thoughts. So, there are no evil men, but ordinary men doing bad deeds triggered by certain conditions. Dealing with them shouldn't suppose hate, but compassion."
264,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38549326-sue,5,"I enjoyed this book as it was a much needed tonic for the times we are in. Genuinely hard to argue with the logic and the evidence put forth, and therefore offers a valid and inspiring argument that all is not lost and that we are (mostly) all kind, caring, cooperative and good natured at heart. There is some really fascinating information, so much so I will need to begin my own research into it. The author promotes humankind should believe in good, do good and see good in order to achieve a better world for all. We should not believe everything we are presented with, we should question the news, which is, as he states, the biggest drug around. This book is a very easy read and a much needed tonic, especially for times we are in at the moment. (COVID 19 and lockdown)"
265,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16070872-melissa-muirhead,4,"I really enjoyed this book. It debunked much of the ""research"" that has been used in recent decades to reinforce how horrible people are and it made me think. It covers many topics and ideas and there are some chapters that I would have preferred a whole book on as it felt that it was just scraping the surface. I would appreciate a bit more about gender and race, you can tell this is written from a white man's perspective and how I also wish writers would stop using the word ""man"" to denote humanity.Well worth a read though. Really compelling and interesting and I listened to the audio version but bought the hard copy book as I wanted to be able to easily refer to some of the points in the future."
266,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34687772-maryam-nada,5,"I enjoyed this book because it tackled the issue at hand differently.The ideas that the author shared, were not necessarily correct or incorrect (there is no right or wrong here, everyone has a prospective), rather they were invigorating. They invited the reader to think differently. I think he follows the concept of layered thinking - thereby inviting the reader to put a plug in at each layer; to benchmark in some way.I particularly enjoyed how he attempts to peal of the myth from highly esteemed and well respected research in the area of psychology and even sociology. He also attempts to demystify some of the popularly accepted stories.I conclude this summary by saying, i was invigorated. Which is not to say i was convinced or not convinced, but pleasantly tickled. This suits me really well, because it is nice to be left to your own thoughts and to create ur own narrative (aka critical thinking) based on a sum of new prospectives that u had just added to ur thinking vault!"
267,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15305610-nick-keane,4,"The central theme of Rutger Bregman’s Humankind a hopeful history, is “that most people, deep down are pretty decent.” He goes on to demonstrate how we are often led to think more negatively about humanity whether through fiction e.g. ‘The Lord of the Flies’, social science e.g. The Stanford Prison Experiment, Broken Windows theory or just our exposure to regular news reporting. Bergman presents evidence that counters these works with a good eye for the anecdote and a nice amount of humour. Finally he cites examples that demonstrate alternative more hopeful views of humanity.This is a warm and positive book which provides a reminder that, even in these unsettling times, it is good to be remember that both near and distant neighbours are capable doing good to us."
268,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1750565-bart,5,"Excellent book and seriously worth reading. Of necessity very broad in scope and therefore performing rather thin examinations in places, but leaving the implicit invitation to look further for yourself. An extensive catalogue of references and footnotes is provided, and otherwise use the material offered and follow your own observations and intuitions.The Dutch version had been on my ""to read"" list for a long time, but for some strange reason and on an impuls I bought the English version which I discovered to be the same book (I'm bilingual, Dutch and English), the translation has been very well done and is excellently suited for an English audience.See this book as a starting point for a re-evaluation of many issues you'd taken for granted, you won't be disappointed!"

If there’s one thing I’ve sought to do with this book, it’s to change the meaning of the word ‘realism’. Isn’t it telling that in modern usage the realist has become synonymous with the cynic–for someone with a pessimistic outlook? In truth, it’s the cynic who’s out of touch. In truth, we’re living on Planet A, where people are deeply inclined to be good to one another. So be realistic. Be courageous. Be true to your nature and offer your trust. Do good in broad daylight, and don’t be ashamed of your generosity. You may be dismissed as gullible and naive at first. But remember, what’s naive today may be common sense tomorrow. It’s time for a new realism. It’s time for a new view of humankind.“"
270,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15848827-jl,5,"A mind boggling read! I highly recommend this book, though to fully appreciate it, you need to maintain an open mind and a willingness to explore the extremely radical premise that humans in general might actually be good!I personally found it challenging at first, but Bregman offers plenty of interesting studies (and in depth research into misrepresented studies) that explores both sides of the argument. He also doesn't shrink from criticizing his own past beliefs based on the evidence he has unearthed since then--that's the true mark of someone in search of the truth. It's not easy to change society, but this book is a great step towards convincing even the cynics among us that it's possible and worthwhile to try."
271,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52929288-stephanie,0,"Needed this read. Can’t say I’m entirely convinced by his case studies but I do now believe that there’s no benefit to being cynical.“If your faith in someone has been misplaced, the truth will surface sooner or later. You’ll discover that your best friend has fled the country with your life savings or after six weeks of using the Ab King Pro you still don’t have the six pack promised on TV...Accept and account for the fact that you’ll occasionally be cheated. That’s a small price to pay for the luxury of a lifetime of trusting other people.”His epilogue for ten rules to live by made me laugh multiple times. Also, learned the importance of being compassionate rather than empathetic. Haven’t felt this uplifted after a book in a long time."
272,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48392670-paul-mclaughlin,5,"What a wonderful, insightful and thought provoking book. Reading it makes me Re-think my own interactions with people that who I have found annoying or spiteful when I could have looked at them with more compassion and thought about the why they are like this? I do believe that we are all good and some people show this more than others but I am still surprised when I see it from people I have judged to be selfish and distant. I want to try and implement more kindness initiatives with students to see if that creates a more conducive working environment and if they work better together towards their exams. It will be interesting to put things like this in place. I highly recommend this book! Thank you for writing it Rutger! "
273,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4257850-wesley,5,"In this book which I hope/think will be translated to English and other language, Bregman convincingly argues that the general image we have of others is way too negative. And that in reality people are mostly good. He gives a lot of examples from history (from wars and famous crimes to little known events) but also criticizes a few studies. For example both the Milgram and the Prison-experiment were highly manipulated. While convincing that our image of our fellow humans is too negative. There is one flaw I think in his argument. While explaining two incidents where people DID come to the rescue. He doesn't really acknowledge the fact that even when this is true (which it is), the majority still did nothing to help. So is 'not-doing-good' a bad thing? I think so. But all in all... this is a very good book that finds that fine balance between objective science and personal judgment. "
274,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80650542-pam-chantrell,4,"This is an interesting take on some of those famous experiments (e.g. Stamford Prison experiment) or new stories, including additional information or new experiments. It was a bit of a slog at times but it's written so that's accessible to the masses. I wouldn't re-read it but it was interesting. It is already out of date though - talks about how the human race hasn't had to deal with a massive viral outbreak in almost a century, for example. That's a shame as it automatically made me wonder what else has changed since he wrote it. Probably not a lot to be fair. I'd be interested to read an new chapter once COVID-19 has run its course evaluating the human response to it."

The segments on American policing ends up being quite relevant for the current moment, which just made me want to read more about that. (That Zimbardo showed up as a villain in policing as well was a truly shocking moment. He, along with so many others mentioned in this book, are basically anonymous monsters of history.)The part about ""not punching Nazis"" in the epilogue did really bother me, though. His point was right in a lot of cases, but in many others...punching Nazis is necessary. "

It's not something I usually pick up, especially in a time when escaping to a fictional world is so tempting, but I'm happy I did!This is a well researched piece of non-fiction which is both fascinating and informative. At the core, Rutger Bregman argues that all human beings are basically good. He does this by referring to the great evils and depressing examples of humans at their worst and counters them by busting the myths and putting forward contrasting evidence to support the good natured Homo puppy. Would recommend."
277,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4236601-popup-ch,4,"The economist view that all people are utility-maximizing automata is wrong. Instead most people are nice, and even nicer if you are nice to them.Bregman looks at various old classic experiments, such as the Stanford Prison experiment and Stanley Milgram's shock experiment. He concludes that the behaviour that they managed to elicit from supposedly normal test subject was in fact only arrived at after considerable harassment and forcing. He contrasts the Norwegian and American prison systems, and shows that the Norwegian recidivism numbers are much (much!) lower than in the US, and that in the end it actually ends up cheaper to treat felons like people rather than like cattle."

I’ll get that out of the way to begin with, because it was my only difficulty with this massively encouraging book. And it didn’t come up often in the book, that it was an issue. Over and over, I wanted to rush to my FB or Twitter and quote him. I read pages of the book out loud to anyone within earshot.I expect to spend some decent money on this book, because I will be gifting it for a long while to come. And while I’m willing to loan it out, I’m also willing to buy copies.This book felt like a breath of fresh air in the rank sea of societal hate we are fed every day on social media, and the news. "
279,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21979165-agne,4,"I like the depth that this goes into when discussing lots of different experiments and stories and what they actually say about human nature (like the bystander effect). The author has really tried hard to look for the ""receipts"" or refers to others who have done so. The statistics (which seem to be verifiable) about guns not being used in the battles of the great wars were fascinating and counterintuitive. But maybe it's a bit too hopeful, as it's the 1% that are shitty people that tend to ruin it for the rest of us. And that really doesn't come up. Still, it would be a good read for anyone cynical enough to believe that we are fundamentally evil, greedy, selfish etc. "

The author argues that the quality that homo sapiens had that made them stand out was friendliness. This was what helped them one up everything and everyone else. The author debunks some standout popular psychology experiments like the Stanford Prison experiment, the shock experiment. He criticises older theories about policing and prisons. This book really makes you believe in the humanity of people. The goodness in all of us. In these crazy times when u try to latch on to any semblance of kindness and compassion, comes a book stating that it was always there, it has been there so as long as there were humans. Loved it."

A truly hopeful history about how our human nature is actually good, cooperative, and compassionate as opposed to our false intuition that it is ""nasty brutish and short."" It turned alot of of long standing ideas in psychology on their heads (bogus conclusions of Stanford prison experiment, Milgram's shock experiment, and Kitty Genoese's death), and shed light on many other real events that have been buried throughout history (like the real Lord of the Flies event and how soldiers generally don't want to kill, or even celebrate Christmas with the enemy as in 1914 during WW1). Highly recommend. "

In this case, challenging, pretty convincingly, established theories of human nature. This includes successfully breaking down and providing doubt and sometimes outright destroying of famous experiments. His conclusion being, we aren’t so bad, despite what we’re told. The historian has an impressive grasp in psychology, philosophy, anthropology and sociology, and synthesises such disciplines in what feels like a ‘hybrid genre’. One that Jared Diamond and Yuval Noah Harari also examine with forensic detail. "

In one fell swoop, Bregman questions multiple theories that we take for granted - such as Darwin's survival of the fittest and Hawkins' view of the selfish gene. With riveting anecdotes and thrilling research that span vast horizons, Bregman weaves an inspiring worldview for the future. You'll be introduced to bite sized revolutions that are popping up all over the world - in the fields of management, governance, education and more.

This book examines why that is, why it is fundamentally factually incorrect and why we suffer because of that. Contains fascinating anecdotes I had never heard of such as a real life ""Lord of the Flies"" scenario (the kids did great and in some cases began friendships that lasted 60+ years) and an episode in WWI in the middle of brutality that killed millions soldiers on the front for a day laid down their arms ate and drank and sang Christmas carols together."

The author has done a great job in researching and the book he mentioned, I'm definitely gonna pick them. I was already 10 pages, and I was in LOVE. He talks about greater good in human.

This is not the reality, it is what we are trained to believe. But there is another way, even though it is hard.

I love Bergman’s assessment that we have had a negative view of human nature and it has led to negative policies and systems. Why if we believed we were more? This is the most hopeful book and it’s packed with research and retelling of stories and events that were misleading. A takeaway for me was that when an author, researcher, journalist concludes humans are bad and things are hopeless they are more likely to get rich and famous, because to tell the boring undramatic truth would not be good for profits."
288,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7345516-rik,4,"'A hopeful history' probably sums this book up better than a long review! We've been indoctrinated into a negative view of others for so long that it really is difficult to absorb the premise of this book without continually saying 'but...' I particularly enjoyed the chapter which said that people in positions of leadership act as those suffering from a brain injury (seems to sum up most managers I know!), and found the exposé of the various famous behavioural studies insightful. It would be easy to fill a book with horror stories about how we deal with each other, but this careful selection of positive tales and optimistic analysis is truly inspiring. "

I want to read it again and then also look into al the discussed sources, to see for myself what I think of the whole discussion. Sometimes I find it hard to believe certain statements. Not because the author or the book seems unreliable or anything, but because it seems almost too good to be true. It also really suits my way of thinking. "

Multidisciplinary, this book draws on history, geography and the social sciences to discuss how the view that human nature is innately selfish should be revisited and as a species, humans are cooperative and well, generally good.This book does contain quite complex themes and philosophical ideas. You don’t necessarily need an in-depth knowledge of the roots of human nature, but having an idea of Hobbes and Rousseau and how they’ve shaped government did make for easier understanding."

This book is a grand sweep about human nature in its many facets. What's so fascinating about it is that it takes very familiar case studies (such as the Stanford prison experiment, and the bystander effect) and goes through the reality of them, point by point. It's shocking, the misleading claims about these studies that have been perpetuated. The book makes you believe in the humanity of people again, with so many amazing stories."

And it did. And it feels great! And I now have a pile of sources to quote from next time someone calls me naive. We are made to believe one thing, but history proves another. And just as we might never act on it, we might also very well start a revolution.Let yourself be educated by this powerful book!"

However, were found flawed or inaccurate from further studies. It illustrates how we are conditioned to think the “worlds is bad” based on what is portrayed in the media. For example, I read this book during the 2020 Black Lives Matters protest and the media focused more was on the looters and rioters the countless people gathering together in solidarity for positive changes. Again, this book teaches you to limit your media consumption."

His main premise is that, at our core, all humans are decent, and he made an effort to disprove many of the most famous studies that counter this idea (think: the Stanford Prison Experiment) but at times it seemed an over simplification of human history. A bifurcation into inherently good vs inherently bad, Rousseau vs Hobbs etc. etc. BUT I did like all the points he made and definitely relearned some things about history/psychology/sociology.

People that will say it's far to ""feel-good"" to be true. But it IS true. He uses data to back that up.People will say his evidence is anecdotal, not based in fact. But it IS based in fact, and he's notated the studies and the articles and the research that supports his theories. I mean, what is easier to understand? An anecdote or a 700 page research paper. Even Jesus spoke in parables. I liked this book. And I feel more hopeful of the human race for having read it."

Some of the stories were familiar to me (I read The Tipping Point many years ago) but it was great to be reminded of them and to hear them in a different context. There were also lots of new stories and ideas. It is hugely relevant for the strange times in which we are currently living.I teach media and English in a secondary school and will definitely be adding this title to our wider reading lists for both subjects.

It felt like the first few chapters were much more grounded by scientific research I especially liked the reexamination of some of the most famous sociological experiments - that had a real resonance and changed perspective well. But the second half of the book seemed very anecdotal. The stories were good but seemed disjointed and didn’t seem to add up to a holistic argument, apart from a general “being nice is good”.

With much convincing evidence, Bregman argues that it is the optimists who are the true realists. Human nature, while casting dark shadows, is primarily good. By expecting the worst from people, we are setting ourselves up to get it. Bregman recommends instead treating people like human beings, not monsters—because that’s what we actually are. Also written with fun and common sense, despite the author being a philosopher. Highly recommend."
