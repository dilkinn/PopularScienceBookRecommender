Measured claims about the complexity of life and our ignorance of its determinants are not show biz. For an example of complicated and uncertain, take Lewontin's lecture ""All the in the Genes"" in which he states in regards to the nature-vs-nurture debate that (if I'm reading this correctly) both genetics and environment play a role in intellectual capacity and other unfixed characteristics of human individuals, but that it is impossible to assign a precise statistical weight to one or the other and that even if you take two genetically identical organisms and subject then to the same environmental factors while developing, they won't necessarily turn out the same. There is no connection whatsoever between the variation that can be ascribed to genetic differences as opposed to environmental differences and whether a chance in environment will affect performance and by how much. [page 29]The vulgar error that confuses heritability and fixity has been, over the years, the single most powerful weapon that biological ideologues have had in legitimating a society of inequality. [page 37]Science is molded by society because it is a human productive activity that takes time and money, and so is guided by those forces in the world that have control over time and money. Science use commodities and is part of the process of commodity production. These institutions [agricultural experiment stations] might be expected to develop alternative methods since they are not concerned with profit and are working at public expense... A purely commercial interest has so successfully clothed itself in claims of pure science that those claims are now taught as scientific gospel."
1,0060975199,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"This is the forth book based on the Massey Lectures that I’ve read. There has only been one that I didn’t really enjoy. All of the others have been utterly fascinating. This is particularly interesting – not least because for a couple of years now I’ve been meaning to finish reading Dawkins’ The Extended Phenotype and have struggled because I fundamentally disagree with its premise. Dawkins wrote The Extended Phenotype as a more strictly scientific defence of his idea that we are essentially large transport systems for our genes, that in as far as evolution is about replication that it is genes that replicate and that genes are essentially selfish (though, as he repeatedly points out – this doesn’t mean WE have to be). All of this is familiar territory from his The Selfish Gene. From this, and although Dawkins does not literally say this, it is not a great leap to saying that all of human culture is an extension of the needs of our selfish genes – or what he does literally say, “The doctrine of the extended phenotype is that the phenotypic effect of a gene (genetic replicator) is best seen as an effect upon the world at large, and only incidentally upon the individual organism—or any other vehicle—in which it happens to sit.”To make this clear, although Dawkins says, “I agree with Pulliam and Dunford (1980) that cultural evolution 'owes its origin and its rules to genetic evolution, but it has a momentum all its own’” it seems to me an odd thing for him to say in a book called The Extended Phenotype. The main thesis of which does seem to be that much of what we see in the world is our genes extended out before us.Lewontin and Dawkins come from opposite ends of biological spectrum and their arguments are bitter and acrimonious. Something both of them claim gives comfort to the real enemy – Creationism. I think they are both wrong here, as Creationist don’t even try to understand the arguments of either side and just congratulate themselves on the fact that scientist can disagree. Whereas to me the fact there is this argument is the best defence of the scientific method against mindlessness of faith that I can think of.When this book was written the hype about the Human Genome Project was in full swing – Lewontin quotes dozens of books that came out at the time spruiking this most important scientific project since the Apollo mission. But being a sceptic when it comes to the extent that we are determined by our genes (the other book of his I have read is bluntly called Not In Our Genes) meant his being much less convinced that the supposed benefits of this project would automatically appear once the map had been produced.The ‘promise’ of a mapped genome is that we will be able to cure a series of genetic disorders and illnesses once we compare its contours with those of a sick individual’s map. The logic of the argument runs a bit like this. We map the genetic code of a standardised human. We find people with genetic disorders. We compare their genes to those of the standardised human’s genes we have mapped. Any difference between the two is where the problem lies. Genes make proteins. So, when we work out which protein isn’t being made or is being improperly made due to the genetic stuff-up we can correct it and all shall be well and all manner of things shall be well.The problem is that this ‘simple’ model of how things will go papers over the cracks of the difficulties – and not just the practical difficulties, but also the deep theoretical problems this model raises.Firstly, we have mapped the DNA of a kind of no man – a kind of standardised person. What we did not do was find the perfect human being and map their DNA – not only because such an individual does not exist, but also because such a concept simply doesn’t make sense. So, what do we have in our map of the human DNA? Well, this isn’t as easy a question to answer as it might seem. Let’s say you have a disease. We find the gene we think might be responsible for your disease and compare it with the mapped gene taken from the Genome Project. The idea is that the error will be immediately obvious, except when we have tried this the error isn’t at all obvious. The example given in the book is of people with haemophilia - that is, a disorder we know to have a genetic origin and one in which we can even identify the gene responsible. But we still have been unable to see what is wrong with the gene despite being readily able to compare ‘good’ and ‘bad’ genes. The problem seems to be that there are lots of ways these genes can be either ‘good’ or ‘bad’ and it is not all that clear what makes one good and the other bad.The other problem is that genes come in pairs. So you get one pair from mum and one from dad. Let’s say the one you get from mum is faulty – well, then there is a pretty good chance the one you got from dad will be just fine and all will be well with the world. Except, that the Genome project mapped one of this pair of genes. So, which one has been mapped? What are the chances that the gene on the standard map is a dysfunctional gene? Well, that’s the question, isn’t it? A question I guess that will only be answered after a very long time and many, many comparisons between well and unwell people.Lewontin makes a very strong case that what get called genetic disorders are much more complicated than just problems with our genes and often ought to be called social disorders. This is mostly the case because it is very hard to tell what is genetic and what is environmental. In fact, Lewontin feels this distinction (the nature / nurture distinction) is overstated or rather a misstatement of the issues that are better looked at as social issues.Organisms often literally make there own environment. This was one of the most interesting ideas in the book, and one at least superficially similar to that quoted from Dawkins above. What is the environment that organisms live in? This sounds like an all too obvious question, except it is not nearly as obvious as it seems. We don’t live in THE environment and not just because we have built houses and cities, but because our bodies produce their own environment. He gives the example of wind chill. We literally create our own environment around our bodies, a warm coat of moist air. But given a little wind this environment is blown away and it makes us feel uncomfortable. More than this he points out that two organisms living in the same ‘place’ do not live in the same ‘environment’. He gives the example of phoebes and thrushes that may live in the same place, but for one a stone is not part of its ‘environment’ as the existence of the stone is quite irrelevant to it – but to the other, which may use the stone to break open a snail’s shell, it definitely is part of its environment. Often books on genetics and evolution make a much more strict boundary between internal gene and external environment – it seems this boundary is anything but fixed and obvious.Dawkins, in The Extended Phenotype, makes the somewhat disingenuous statement that, “Homosexuality is, of course, a problem for Darwinians only if there is a genetic component to the difference between homosexual and heterosexual individuals.” I think this is disingenuous because this is exactly the kind of example that is always thrown up in support of Sociobiology. Sociobiology rarely has a problem with declaring just about everything has a genetic foundation. This is made very clear from a quote Lewontin provides from Daniel Koshland in defending the Human Genome Project from claims the money would have been better spent on the homeless, “What these people don’t realise is that the homeless are impaired … Indeed, no group will benefit more from the application of human genetics.” I, for one, find the implications of this nonsense chilling. In my world we fought the Second World War to overcome such monstrous ideas, but admittedly, that probably is only true in my world. Our culture’s obsession with eugenics has been washed clean of its stink of death and now parades in fresh garb re-branded as evolutionary psychology or meme theory. I find the whole thing quite disturbing and admit to being unable to ignore the heredity of these ideas.This is a short, powerful and fascinatingly interesting book. What he has to say about medicine’s rather meagre impact on our increased lifespan is worth the price of the book alone. We have been promised much by those who believe in the doctrine of DNA, we have spent many billions of public money that has gone into the pockets of many of those most likely to tout its benefits – but whether a mapped genome is capable of living up to such promises is something only time will tell. As ideology it has many problems. Ideologically, I prefer the biology offered by Lewontin, where we are the interplay of our genes and our environment in a dialectical relationship of mutual interconnection and change. We are social creatures and society operates on quite other rules than those that manifest from our genes. If the choice is between Lewontin’s view that society creates relations for humans that are inexplicable by our genes and Dawkins view that society is to a great extent the extension of our genes - not just of a multiplication of individuals, but of individual genes then I’m always going to be more drawn to Lewontin. "
2,0060975199,http://goodreads.com/user/show/248667-christy,3,"This is a short book, written for a general audience. This has its advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, it is very clearly written and organized, with lots of concrete examples. This makes it an ideal introduction for a reader who is not familiar with science studies. Lewontin presents science not as the objective, universal field we are taught as children to revere, but as a practical field that is inextricably tied to social and economic development. On the other hand, however, if you have already been introduced to this way of thinking about science, have already been given the tools with which to question the assumption that science is non-ideological, then this book will not really add anything new to the discussion. "
3,0060975199,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8325737-philipp,3,"An interesting look into how we abuse biology for ideological reasons, it's just clearly old (1993) - for example, the bulk of the book is an argument against a reductionist view of biology based on single genes, but we've since moved on to systems biology, synthetic biology etc. that try and view organisms as systems. In other areas he uses twin studies to argue against a gene-centric explanation of various human traits, but since 1993 numerous more (and bigger) studies using twins have been published that show a direct genetic link to various traits. Lewontin is very far in the ""not by genes alone"" corner, and many of the arguments he brings up have since become obsolete.Sometimes however, he's bringing up arguments ten years too soon - he has arguments against Wilson et al.'s sociobiology that fit to the more modern evolutionary psychology, too: When we combine individual selective advantage with the possibility of kin selection and reciprocal altruism, it is hard to imagine any human trait for which a plausible scenario for its selective advantage could not be invented. The real problem is to find out whether any of these stories is true. One must distinguish between plausible stories, things that might be true, and true stories, things that actually have happened. [...] At the very minimum, we might ask whether there is any evidence that such selective processes are going on at the present, but in fact no one has ever measured in any human population the actual reproductive advantage or disadvantage of any human behavior.Or against the ""gay gene"":First, the sociobiologist makes the assumption that homosexuals leave fewer offspring. This implies a description of human sexual behavior in which the world is divided between heterosexuals and homosexuals, one class that leaves offspring and the other that does not. This description, however, does not correspond to our knowledge of human sexuality. [...]Or on the problems of the then just-proposed Human Genome Project:And an average gene that is, say, 3,000 nucleotides long will differ between any two normal individuals by about 20 nucleotides. Who’s genome, then, is going to provide the sequence for the catalog for the normal person? [...] It would be necessary to look at a large population of normal and diseased people to see if one could find some common difference between them, but even this may not happen if the disease in question has a multiple genetic cause so that different people have the same disease for different reasons, even if all those reasons are a consequence of genetic changes.We've only now started to move away from the ""genome for everyone"" to ""personal genomics"" where everyone's genome is sequenced and analyzed, instead of compared to one reference genome. Here he also describes the problem we're 23 years later facing with genome-wide association studies - we need to recruit a ton of people that show a ""nice"" variation in the trait, and even then all we get is risk alleles, not actual genetic causes. The more genes are involved, the muddier it gets.It's most interesting when he draws out the ideology behind various biological theories - Darwin's theory of natural selection, for example, can be interpreted in the light of the Victorian image of human society (""What Darwin did was take early-nineteenth-century political economy and expand it to include all of natural economy."").Similarly, the ""modern entrepreneurial competitive hierarchical society"" with ""the priority of the individual over the collective"" is reflected in reductionist ""the gene did it"" theories that are nowadays accepted by society, but less by science. In other words, ideology subtly influences scientific endeavors.Perhaps I shouldn't make the error to discuss this book from the point of view of modern science, but maybe from the point of view of how modern society interprets science, because there the ""only-gene""-centric view is still a common thing. Just have a look at the weekly news - ""fat gene found"", ""gene for colon cancer"", ""gene for gray hair"" etc. pp. None of these genes need to cause these phenotypes, they may just under specific circumstances of the study appear more in individuals with that phenotype (there are various statistical technologies to minimize but not eliminate random influences, such as population history). It's still extremely hard to then find the actual A -> B, gene -> phenotype link. This is a problem since people are getting disillusioned about scientific progress - the news, politics, scientists tells them every week how much progress science makes, but they don't see the progress, they still die of the same old cancer.Anyway, it's not a long read, but it hasn't aged well."
4,0060975199,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,3,"Lewontin offers a critique of the genetic determinism of Richard Dawkins, E.O. Wilson and others like them. He makes the case that arguments that emphasize the immutability of inherited characteristics are, at best, highly misguided, and, at worst, an ideological ploy to defend the status quo. It is useful to be reminded that the genome is not destiny and that society can be transformed for the better. It is empowering to think that society can affect economic and social outcomes. And racist, sexist, homophobic and classist world views certainly influence the practice of science.But Lewontin fails to do justice to the findings of modern genetics. In an effort to defend the power of nurture (with developmental ""semi-environmental"" mutations added to the mix), he overstates the power of education and social mores to refine human nature. He claims that the evidence for the very existence of a fixed human nature is ambiguous. But today it is quite clear that the empirical evidence is overwhelming for a strong genetic component in almost all aspects of social outcomes, individual differences, etc.The low point of his argument is to argue against the sequencing of the human genome (what later became the Human Genome Project). Today we can see that the field of genetic medicine and gene manipulation has incredible potential. Had we listened to Lewontin's argument, we would have been deprived of great advances in this area of transformative science. While he makes some reasonable points about genes being the trend du jour, these should not blind us to reject an opportunity to learn more about life - and ourselves.Indeed, the genetic story is not a right-wing conspiracy to keep poor people, black people and women in their place. Rather, it is a transformative power that can be used to revolutionize social relations, medicine and even morality itself. As it turns out, we should take control over our genes in order to enhance, rather than dampen, the efforts of social reformers to improve society."
5,0060975199,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2459318-deniz-cem-nduygu,4,"Lewontin is a leftist and he couldn’t be more obvious about it. When he unconvincingly accuses all science of being ideological, it seems like he is preparing the ground for and justifying the strong ideology behind his own writing. He refuses the extreme idea that genes are the source of all causation in the human sphere, only to replace them with bourgeoisie and capitalism! Yes, he takes particular delight in linking everything from reductionism as a scientific tool to the information-theoretical paradigm in biology back to “the bourgeois revolutions of the eighteenth century”. It’s funny how reductionistic leftists can become when trying to refute reductionism.It’s one thing to dream of a more egalitarian, more democratic and more fair society; it’s another to filter facts according to that dream. I find this confusion especially troubling for a scientist: everything he writes suggests that if ever science shows beyond dispute that intelligence – or some other “good” quality – is differentially inherited, he will reject that conclusion just because it’s not in line with his precious ideals of equality and fairness. (He actually has a go at it in the book, and maybe this isn’t much of a problem for him since he admits that scientists are inevitably ideological creatures.)Speaking of fairness, I actually loved the book (1) because it is nicely designed and (2) because Lewontin certainly has a rare gift of balancing our thinking against the sometimes lazy Dawkins-Dennett line of thought by pointing out neglected perspectives and offering a lot of food for thought. The problem is that – just like his ally Gould – often he’s pushing it too far, to the point that the poor arguments injected at those specific points compromise his otherwise amazing authorship."
6,0060975199,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61056478-happyharron,3,"Lewontin is a polarizing figure, nevertheless he comes off quite reasonable in these lectures. The one part I scratched my head and called ""bullshit"" was when Lewontin discussed intra-racial adoption studies but didn't bring up the famous Minnesota adoption study. Keeping in mind that bit of intellectual dishonestly on the whole Lewontin makes up for it by pointing out problems in the reductionist approach of modern evolutionary theory revolving around developmental variation, reaction norms, epigenetic's, geography etc. Towards the end of the lectures Lewontin's touches on the four laws of constructivism. This is pretty brilliant, and is pertinent to debates about the role of evolution and freedom. Constructivism allows for a space of freedom in organisms (and an especially large one in humans who can take conscious rational control of their social organization) while the range of freedom being necessarily limited by the limits of DNA. Lewontin goes into greater detail about how DNA and environment are reciprocally related at a deeper level and I am doing his exposition injustice. It's worth noting that Lewontin's Marxism is evidently vulgar (characterized by his love of Engels dialectic). The use of dialectic as an adjective which appears every 3 sentences in Marxist lit is a leftover of the codification of Marixsm into a worldview/system. It's disappointing to see that Lewontin has adapted this approach to science in other publications. The Constructivist view that Lewontin lays out in his lectures would be much better served in the framework of Marx's ""metabolic interaction between humans and nature"" as opposed to Engels dialectics of nature."
7,0060975199,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22327118-felix,2,"The points this book makes are basically good, but I absolutely don't recommend reading it these days, except as a curious historical document. It is essentially a refutation of a number of racist / classist theories posited in earlier phases of DNA research. There's a strong Marxist undercurrent, but it doesn't often get in the way of the science.The problem, however, is that the core of what Lewontin is arguing for has been largely accepted. Genetic determinism isn't the dominant thought in DNA research (and I'm not sure that it was when this was written either), and the complex interrelation between environmental and hereditary factors is now much better understood, both in the scientific community and in mainstream society.The impassioned calls for social change now look dated. They're fine, and I often agree with the author on the need for social change, but these parts are now a distraction from the scientific discussion, being rooted as they are in a certain time and place. This whole book feels 'of its time'. The scientists which argued for nuance in DNA research have won the discussion, so mostly this book is kinda redundant now. Does anyone even think about The Bell Curve anymore?"

9,0060975199,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91251632-jordan,3,I had to read this for a class and it definitely has a lot of interesting topics but I wish he would have taken out some of the smaller topics and delved deeper into the more controversial topics. This book is almost 30 years old and society sadly still has a lot of the same problems. 
10,0060975199,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16108004-kaamesh-singam,4,"I think he is a Marxist/communist. But he is not a dogmatist, people. Not only does he criticise the mainstream view of evolutionary biology, he also offers his own view of evolutionary biology: According to his view, organisms are not only passive recipients but are also active creators. That is, organisms have the ability to create their own environment. So, his view is constructivist while those he criticises hold an adaptationist view of evolutionary biology. In that way, genes play only a negligible role in forming the characteristics of the organisms. It is the social and environmental conditioning that play a major role. So, the nature of an individual is largely determined not by genes but by the social environment in which he or she is brought up. It should be noted that there is a dialectical interaction between the genes and the environment. Now, with this theory in place, status-quoists can no longer justify capitalism by claiming that humans are ultimately selfish organisms. If the environment is created in such a way that will allow room for humans to be selfless and co-operative and fraternal, the nature of humans will itself be modified to such an extent that there may even be no trace of selfishness in their behavioural traits. And this is the reason that Lewontin argues for the establishment of a communist society, where there will be no class or caste distinctions and the environment of production and consumption will be in a healthy state that will give humans freedom to be selfless and creative and productive. He also goes on in his book to state where the adaptationist biologists make mistakes or errors in their methods.He seems honest enough in his book. (He has even admitted that his political beliefs, which is of communism, has interfered in his scientific works. Such is his honesty.) And his sentences are not obscure, most of all. He employed a great deal of common sense. So the reader won't feel cheated or stupified or mystified after reading the book.One thing that I want to know is whether these scientists, who are allegedly maintaining the status quo, are propagating these biased views intentionally or unintentionally. Since they are under the influence of the socio-political atmosphere (structure), they could have been doing it unknowingly too.Also, one may get the feeling that, since Science ultimately rests on the socio-political atmosphere, it has lost its sceptre of objectivity. (Here I am reminded of Paul Feyerabend.) Well, one will have to simply have faith in Science or will have to wait for the post-scientific era. For what other sane options do we really have?"
11,0060975199,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7605433-stephen-palmer,5,"In The Doctrine Of DNA - Biology As Ideology, famed geneticist and evolutionary scientist Professor Richard Lewontin demolishes the widespread notion that human nature - including a whole panoply of social factors such as hierarchical societies - is determined by our genes. It's a superb polemical attack on the crazed ideology of biological determinism, with more than a few swipes at how Western societies put the individual at the centre of things instead of having a more reasonable balance between individual and community.The book is concise. Based on a series of lectures given in 1990, it develops the themes of skepticism, the uses of genetics, the scientific relationships between cause and effect, the social uses of science, and the relationship between the perception of science as pure and neutral and how it is actually used. Some pretty extraordinary examples are given of this latter relationship, showing how capitalist users of technology exploit both the environment and the people they leech off.The author's ire then falls on the human genome programme, pointing out the inherent flaws in a plan that involves creating a ""normal human genome"" description when we're all genetically different. He concludes by pointing out how science education via textbooks simply repeats biological deterministic ideology as though it were proven fact.A fantastic read, a devastating critique of the nonsense spouted by many, and a required read for anyone in the field of science. I almost never give 5* reviews: this is getting the full five. "
12,0060975199,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11487807-eugene,4,"20 years on, Richard Lewontin's commentary is still very much relevant to public perceptions of biology and our environment. By plainly laying out his social views in this lecture series, Lewontin forfeits the privileged guise of an unbiased expert in order to engage directly with his concerns. Being familiar with issues in biology, I found his first chapter to be the most effective in framing the discussion, and he proves an able guide through a series of topics. The final chapter does illustrate the larger implications of what we've learned, but leaves the future role of biological science unresolved."
13,0060975199,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5893735-joseph-sverker,0,"I find this an excellent book. It is well written and not too scholarly for a non-biology student like me. It also debunks the sociobiologists arguments about the humans being a puppet of the genes. In all honesty, I love all books that are critical against Richard Dawkins reductionist views. Lewontin's argument for the human being as first and foremost a social being is very convincing."

15,0060975199,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55415347-sarah,3,"This book was not my cup of tea. It was interesting at times, because Lewontin talks about sociobiology and I am working to get a sociology minor, but for the most part I thought it was just a glorified rant. But, then again, I am not big on scientific reads."

17,0060975199,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2526106-jason,4,"In this slender book, Harvard geneticist and zoologist R.C. Lewontin lays out a much needed corrective against genetic determinism, the notion that human beings are ""nothing more than"" meat robots compelled toward particular behaviors, both individual and collective, by our genes. Lewontin reserves much of his scorn for the ""just so stories"" of sociobiology, with its uncritical (and unscientific) ""discoveries"" of particular cultural norms--like racism, sexism, and imperialism--being universally hardwired into human biology, and so seemingly part of our collective destiny, like it or not. In the introductory chapter, Lewontin lays out the foundation for the rest of the book. He presents philosophy, sociology, and political theory of science:For an institution to explain the world so as to make the world legitimate, it must possess several features. First, the institution as a whole must appear to derive from sources outside of ordinary human social struggle. It must not seem to be the creation of political, economic, or social forces, but to descend into society from a supra-human source. Second, the ideas, pronouncements, rules, and results of the institution's activity must have a validity and a transcendent truth that goes beyond any possibility of human compromise or human error. Its explanations and pronouncements must seem to be true in an absolute sense and to derive somehow from an absolute source. They must be true for all time and all place. And finally, the institution must have a certain mystical and veiled quality so that its innermost operation is not completely transparent to everyone. It must have an esoteric language, which needs to be explained to the ordinary person by those who are especially knowledgeable and who can intervene between everyday life and mysterious sources of understanding and knowledge. The Christian Church or indeed any revealed religion fits these requirements perfectly, and so religion has been an ideal institution for legitimating society.... But this description also fits science and has made it possible for science to replace religion as the chief legitimating force in modern society. Science claims a method that is objective and nonpolitical, true for all time. Scientists truly believe that except for the unwanted intrusions of ignorant politicians, science is above the social fray....Not only the methods and institutions of science are said to be above ordinary human relations but, of course, the product of science is claimed to be a kind of universal truth. The secrets of nature are unlocked. Once the truth about nature is finally revealed, one must accept the facts of life... Finally, science speaks in mysterious words. No one except an expert can understand what scientists say and do, and we require the mediation of special people... to explain the mysteries of nature because otherwise there is nothing but indecipherable formulas....Despite its claim to be above society, science, like the Church before it, is a supremely social institution, reflecting and reinforcing the dominant values and views of society at each historical epoch. (7-9)Lewontin takes specific exception to the uses to which biology has been put, in justifying human systems of inequality and repression:The vulgar error that confuses heritability and fixity has been, over the years, the most powerful single weapon that biological ideologues have had in legitimating a society of inequality. Since as biologists they must know better, one is entitled to at least a suspicion that the beneficiaries of a system of inequality are not to be regarded as objective experts. (37)Bioinformatics is regularly hailed as a game-changing science, bringing genetic information to bear on everything from health care to public policy, but does this new knowledge empower individuals or institutions?Increasingly, knowledge about the genome is becoming an element in the relation between individuals and institutions, generally adding to the power of institutions over individuals. The relations of individuals to the providers of health care, to the schools, to the courts, to employers are all affected by knowledge, or the demand for knowledge, about the state of one's DNA. (76)Sociobiology and ""Just So"" stories:At the surface this theory of human nature [i.e., sociobiology] is the obvious ideological commitment to modern entrepreneurial competitive hierarchical society. Yet underneath is a deeper ideology, and that is the priority of the individual over the collective. Despite the name sociobiology, we are dealing with a theory not of social causation but of individual causation. The characteristics of society are seen as caused by the individual properties that its members have, and those properties ... are said to derive from the members' genes. If human societies engage in war, that is because each individual in the society is aggressive. If men as a group dominate women or white Blacks, it is because each man as an individual is desirous of dominating each woman and each white person has feelings of personal hostility set off by the sight of Black skin. The structures of society simply reflect these individual predispositions. Society is nothing but the collection of individuals in it, just as culture is seen as nothing but the collection of disarticulated bits and pieces, individual preferences and habit. (93)The real difficulty with the process of explanation that allows direct advantage, or kin selection, or reciprocal altruism when one of the other is useful in the explanation, is that a story can be invented that will explain the natural selective advantage of any trait imaginable. When we combine individual selective advantage with the possibility of kin selection and reciprocal altruism, it is hard to imagine any human trait for which a plausible scenario for its selective advantage could not be invented. The real problem is to find out whether any of these stories is true. One must distinguish between plausible stories, things that might be true, and true stories, things that actually have happened. How do we know that human altruism arose because of kin selection or reciprocal altruistic selection? At the very minimum, we might ask whether there is any evidence that such selective processes are going on at the present, but in fact non one has ever measured in any human population the actual reproductive advantages or disadvantages of any human behavior. All of the sociobiological explanations of the evolution of human behavior are like Rudyard Kipling's Just So stories of how the camel got his hump and how the elephant got his trunk. They are just stories. Science has been turned into a game. (100)In conclusion:Our DNA is a powerful influence on our anatomies and physiologies. In particular, it makes possible the complex brain that characterizes human beings. But having made that brain possible, the genes have made possible human nature, a social nature whose limitation and possible shapes we do not know except insofar as we know what human consciousness has already made possible....History far transcends any narrow limitations that are claimed for either of power of genes or the power of the environment to circumscribe us.... [T]he genes, in making possible the development of human consciousness, have surrendered their power both to determine the individual and its environment. They have been replaced by an entirely new level of causation, that of social interaction with its own laws and its own nature that can be understood and explored only through that unique form of experience, social action.

It debunks the commonly view of science as the 'value-free' pursuit of truth, with a more modest - but realistic - view of science as continuous with other social institutions. Science, Lewontin says, 'consists, in large part, of what scientists say about the world whatever the true state of the world might be' (n.b. this isn't coming from a postmodern professor of gender studies, but a Harvard lecturer in zoology). At a practical level, the focus is on examining 'the doctrine of DNA'. We are well familiar with claims about *the* gene for cancer, homosexuality, even liberalism & conservatism. Some of this is simply bad journalism, but some of it might be misguided techno-optimism on the part of the scientists themselves. (Take, for example, the gene-editing tool called CRISPR, the ""huge story"" of 2017, with a 'dizzying potential' to 'upend science'. Which, by the way, introduced hundreds of unintented  mutations. And this is just mice. Nevermind humans.)Part of the problem, Lewontin argues, is a narrow methodological focus on causes at the lowest possible level (ideally, genes), from which you're supposed to work upwards to more complex phenomena. To take one of his interesting examples, the death rates from diseases like tuberculosis were falling at the end of the nineteenth century, and the introduction of the germ theory of disease by Koch seems not to have made much difference. Why? Because of general improvements in nutrition and raises in wages. 'Although one may say that the tubercle bacillus causes tuberculosis, we are much closer to the truth when we say it was the conditions of unregulated nineteenth-century competitive capitalism [...] that was the cause of tuberculosis. But social causes are not in the ambit of biological science'.The book is particularly illuminating on the threefold cord of genes, environment and developmental noise and why it is hard conceptually, not just practically, to disentangle their causal roles. (The last chapter foreshadows current biological research on 'niche construction', the idea being that organisms actively *shape* their environment, not simply respond to it). Particularly since humans, unlike fruit flies, make for impure control groups - at least when it observing rather murky traits like intelligence, sexuality etc. I'm sure some parts of the book might have since become outdated, but to me it was a tour de force."
19,0060975199,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10738827-rishab,4,"Short and very readable. Published 30 years ago but the societal changes since have only strengthened Lewontin's arguments. Science a social institution, just like family, state, media, etc. It is not only a means of knowledge production but also explaining the natural world in ways that reinforce ruling class ideology. The particular scientific discoveries at period in time are influenced by and influence the political and social realms. Inequality is attributed to and legtimated by genetic differences. These differences are said to not only be heritable but also immutable and inevitable. Darwin's theory of natural selection (irrespective of its accuracy) gave rise to beliefs that nature and environment were discrete, separable entities, and that organisms only passively experience their environment rather than actively constructing it. It also lead to structures of atomization, which in turn produced attitudes of reducing individuals down to their genes. ""The demand for biological information and the implied assumption that society needs to be guided, in the end, by a technocratic elite who understand genetics totally confounds the properties and limitations of individuals with the properties and limitations of the social institutions that they create. It is the ultimate political manifestation of the belief that individual autonomous units determine the properties of the collectivities in which they assemble.""As a result, social explanations take the backseat. Agents of disease become reduced to ""causes"" without regard to material conditions. The role of industrial capitalism in causing tuberculosis, which was very common in 1800s sweatshops, would never be found in a single biology textbook, though neither tubercle bacillus nor poor working conditions is a greater cause than the other. There are a few things that didn't go as predicted, for example he thought that the Human Genome Project would take 30-50 years. But his critiques on the HGP itself are worth reading."
20,0060975199,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83047526-jeffrey-romine,5,"Although I wouldn't go so far as to subscribe to his accusations regarding motives, I do think Lewontin does a fantastic job of characterizing the naturalistic worldview occupying academic institutions. He does a great job of debunking Dawkin's gene ideology and related nonsense that suggests morality is encoded within our genes. He shows the weakness of reductionism and determinism and provides insight by balancing arguments for nature versus nurture, additionally offering useful distinctions between agent and cause. It's an older book, so I certainly suspect some of his admonitions against the Human Genome project haven't borne out. Still, his readiness and ableness to raise questions merit reading. Is science above criticism? Or, is this not the type of criticism that makes for a healthy establishment?"

24,0060975199,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11224755-maarya-abbasi,4,"TLDR: This book should be read by *all* who are students of science. Including bio/chem/physics students who are often too trapped within the minutiae of their research to contextualize their position as a scientist and the impact of their work.This!!!!! book!!!!!! I very reluctantly read this strange looking book in high school only b/c it was *highly* suggested reading for a lab I briefly joined one summer. Looking back, I can say this, along with Said's Orientalism, are the two *most* formative texts out of everything I've read in my high school years, which have irrevocably 1) shaped my worldview, & 2) set off a spiral of academic interest (in this case, in science and technology studies and, more specifically, biopolitics). Lewontin, famed geneticist and evolutionary scientist, demolishes the widespread notion that human nature is determined by our genes. It's a total middle-finger to the works of assholes like richard dawkins who are zealous in their biological determinism and reductive sociobiology.Because it's written for a popular audience, it's an ideal intro for those who are new to science and technology studies. Lewontin unpacks the pervasive assumption that science is objective and non-ideological by writing v succinctly about how it is inextricably linked to political, social, and economic worlds. Some useful examples are given to this effect, including the political machinations behind the human genome project and the ways in which capitalist users of technology exploit both the environment and the people they leech off.As a high schooler unexposed to critical discourse on science, reading all of this opened a pandora's box for me and kind of rocked my world. I will say, though, that if you have already been exposed to this way of thinking about science (most of us haven't tho b/c our society sucks lol), then this text doesn't bring much else to the table."
25,0060975199,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6006061-stephen-wong,4,"The character and strength of the book, which was the 1990 Massey Lecture, lie in its mereological analysis (concerning part-whole relations), in its polemical attitude towards a type of monadism, and in what strikes me as a manner of thought found in Teilhard de Chardin, the noogenesis, which Lewontin extends to social activity encompassing science and its claims of truth. This latter extension is closely knit with Giambattista Vico's verum factum principle, unsurprisingly of course. What I found ineffective in the set opposition is the author's use of all this preceding in his attacks on sociobiology, and this is perhaps just a case of the nature of the polemic itself if not anything to do about a straw man argument set up. The message that Lewontin articulates is an important one, one that is often lost in society's postures in relation to the scientific milieu of the times, especially one rooted in reductionism and atomism of causes, specifically surrounding biology. I reckon that the author's use of the term *ideology* is not a materialist one, but I am not so certain that what he appears to intend to substitute instead, the closet idealist one, is no less *determined*. The lecture concludes rather succinctly in a call to praxis (the unique experience of social action) that is either the effect or the cause of an overcoming of biological determinism -- and so I feel that in this way it is rather like the horse and its bit, and the bit though not really there in the horse's mouth still remains thoroughly there for the horse to whinny about."
26,0060975199,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1003237-terri,3,"  This is a series of lectures given by the author. I averaged out my rating to three stars, but I enjoyed some of the sections very much, and was unhappy with others, so can't accurately rate this one. The last Lecture, ""Science as Social Action"" was a great read, and I'm glad I finished off the book with that one. Overall, I agree deeply with the idea that complex issues deserve and require complex solutions. Discussions regarding these complex questions should not be dumbed down. That will lead to the wrong solution or no solution. I very much appreciate that Lewontin makes a clear point of the complexities, and that narrowing the issues down to one or two ""causes"" will not got us any closer to a solution. "
27,0060975199,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4380049-shane,5,"This short book was a bit challenging for me when I read it for my very first anthropology class. Nonetheless, I am thankful to have taken the time to read this book, because it offers a lucid and convincing critique of how biology had been misused in terms of genetic determinism and such. R. C. Lewontin is a former Harvard professor who writes with great insight and wit, and though this book is somewhat challenging, it is highly rewarding."
28,0060975199,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549698-nathan,4,"A great take on science. Lewontin sees it participating in a dance: society on one side, science on the other. They're shaped for each other, they move in response to each other. He writes well and the perspective is mind blowing, but I found it very exhausting to work through. I've abandoned it, but I'll keep returning and digging through it because it's so bloody good."
29,0060975199,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38489187-william,2,Yeah: I don't feel you are being honest. Sociobiology is a series of slogans but attacking the idea that diseases emerge only from biological factors but they also emerge from social and cultural factors doesn't land to the fact that ONLY social and cultural factors (such as: XIX century capitalism) are the primary cause of diseases (such as TBC).
