0,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,"The Amusing UniverseIn this series of seven easy-going essays Lightman uses musings on the many curious aspects of modern Physics and the way they change our perspectives - not to discuss Science, but to philosophize on Life. Surprisingly, the most unintuitive parts of Physics are pretty normal when it comes to Life. Perhaps because we expected more order from Science than was there in the first place, more than the Universe was ever willing to give us. We can come away from these musings with the pleasant yet unsettling feeling that most likely all of Science is going to turn out to be as messy as our everyday life of dealing with stuff like ethics and responsibilities. That should be fun.The musings take unexpected turns, almost Montaigne-like in their capacity for starting in one place and veering sharply off the track:1. The Accidental Universe: Uses the fact that most of the physical conditions that allowed this universe to sustain life or even exist could be purely accidental (the multiverse conjecture) and thus goes onto to wonder about the beauty and randomness of our lives on this small speck of dust.2. The Temporary Universe: Looks at the eternal human quest for immortality and permanence in everything in the midst of decay by looking at the radical impermanence of everything in the physical universe. 3. The Spiritual Universe: Understands the human quest to go beyond the natural laws by peeking behind the actual laws of the universe. Perhaps the universe too is beyond mere laws? (Plenty of sharp digs at Dawkins here. Don't miss the fun!)4. The Symmetrical Universe: Equates the human and the cosmos in their shared appreciation and fascination of symmetry. Maybe the mind is the cosmos…5. The Gargantuan Universe: The immensity of the universe and the impossibility of grasping it is compared with our inborn tendency to shoot big. But most likely the universe is too big for our comprehension, but then, what is not? 6. The Lawful Universe: The human mind is evolved to seek out laws. Any organism in a lawful corner of the universe has to be born with this tendency to be able to manipulate surroundings or survive, propagate, etc in any meaningful way. But should we really be projecting this tendency onto the entire breadth of the universe? To the Multiverse? To the beginnings and endings?We spontaneously see people as purposeful, and this is the central act of the practical imagination required for social interaction of any sort. We extended this to the physical world. This was the origin and basis of religion - and that is now considered superstition.Similarly we accord laws spontaneously to the perceivable physical world, which in fact does behave predictably - at least as far as the physical world of our senses is concerned. This is the origin and basis of science. But to extend that to the rest of the universe, macro and micro, is that also not a form of superstition then?7. The Disembodied Universe: The universe requires us to think conceptually.Nt a single important fact about the physical universe is immediate anymore. A disembodied universe can only be understood by an imaginative species. ALien intelligent life might be more common than we are brought up to believe, but how common would imaginative intelligence be out there?In the end though, the essays are too wise to be as much fun as Einstein’s Dreams. And that is the benchmark for Lightman."
1,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,3,"Alan Lightman is incapable of writing a bad book, but I'm afraid fans of the magical Einstein's Dreams will be disappointed all the same: this slim collection of essays about Life, the Universe and Everything is not in the same class. People who have been following the faith/science debate will have seen most of it before. Worse, and I hardly know how to say this, the book contains mistakes. The rotation of the Earth means that someone on the equator is travelling at 24,000 miles a day, not 24,000 miles an hour; even more distressingly, snowflakes are not, as stated here, always hexagonally symmetric. If I didn't know better I'd suspect he was just a mortal human being.Oh well... my fault for buying the wrong one. I'd actually meant to get his autobiography, Mr g, but changed my mind at the last minute. That'll teach me to second-guess myself."
2,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"Alan Lightman is the first professor at MIT to have a dual appointment in the science and humanities faculties. He has compiled a sampling of essays into a short book. The essays focus on the philosophical implications of scientific discoveries. The essays are written in a light, easy-to-read, engaging style.In his first essay, titled The Accidental Universe, Lightman tackles the anthropic paradox. Why do the fundamental laws of nature and physical properties seem to be fine-tuned just perfectly for life to be able to arise? Lightman has a definite predilection for a solution to this paradox; I won't spoil your suspense by revealing it here!In the second essay, titled The Temporary Universe, Lightman discusses the impermanence of life, of the Earth, and the universe. Then in the essay The Spiritual Universe, he tackles the relationship between science and religion. He writes that the address separate sets of questions; science addresses the questions that can be answered objectively, while religion addresses questions that can only be answered subjectively.I enjoyed reading this book, but I must admit that I didn't learn very much. Even though Lightman is a theoretical physicist, one should not read this book to learn about physics. Read it to learn about how a philosophy is shaped by physics. "
3,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1608649-laurie,1,"Terrible! After reading Einstein's Dreams, I was really looking forward to this, especially as it's been a while since I've read a book on quantum physics and wanted an update or new insight into any new theories, especially since the discovery of the Higgs field. I am confused about all the rave reviews. There is no science in this book. Just a consistent rant from a pedantic author telling us all how we should live our lives and put down our cell phones to appreciate the green grass and blue skies. Really? This was more an article than a book. He even insults his own daughter in his depressing take on the eventual decay of all things, describing how he could see wrinkles on her face on her wedding day as she is all of 30 years old. Thanks dad! Wonder how that went over in the Lightman house. Do not recommend!"
4,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,2,"This is a short, well-written, easy-to-read collection of seven essays—five of which were previously published. The connecting theme between them is Lightman's attempt to reconcile science with religion, spirituality, mysticism, art, music, literature...essentially, all the subjective human feelings and thoughts we have every day which are as yet unexplained by science. But he disappointingly offers little more than a politically-correct presentation of Stephen Jay Gould's ""separate magisteria"" argument, where science is cordoned off in a separate domain outside of which it is assumed to have no explanatory power and even doesn't have a ""right"" to try. Even though Lightman declares himself an atheist in the essay ""The Spiritual Universe,"" he nevertheless states that science should not be used to question religious faith or other ""transcendent"" experiences. Indeed, he seems to say (again these claims have been made for centuries) that any ""personal experience"" not shared, not witnessed, and thus not subject to experiment, cannot be rationally criticized and must be accepted on faith.It's curious that a professor of theoretical physics and humanities at MIT (my alma mater, too) would be so retrograde. A freer attitude, one where science is not restrained, one that I share, is that everything is explainable—unless, and until, proven otherwise. It is obvious we don't understand everything now, but that which we don't understand should not automatically be assumed to belong to another ""magisterium"" and off-limits. To think otherwise is to impose—in certain institutions—censorship. Furthermore, investigation in no way denigrates any unexplainable experience. To put it subjectively—and this is at the core of most scientists' being—as beautiful as a transcendent experience might be, it is even more beautiful once it's understood without recourse to the supernatural. My problems with this book are not, in fact, the philosophical arguments, but rather the author's pessimism. It is not clear exactly what readers Lightman is targeting, but I prefer a more optimistic view. And the scientific ideas presented are current, to be sure, but are told at such an elementary level that is has little educational value. Still, you will find a pleasing literary voice."
5,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1895570-jim,5,"I have not read such an eye-opening book by a scientist since I used to read Loren Eiseley's work years ago. This short book of essays by MIT scientist Alan Lightman looks at the universe from several points of view, first from the point of view of its origin, its evanescence, the spiritual dimension, symmetry, size, the laws of nature, and ending up with our strange disembodied universe in which we use electronic tools that somehow mirror the discombobulation associated with quantum mechanics. At one point, he writes:Evidently, our impression that solid matter can be localized, that it occupies only one position at a time, is erroneous. The reason that we have not noticed the ""wavy"" behavior of matter is because such behavior is pronounced only at the small size of atoms. At the relatively large sizes of our bodies and other objects that we can see and touch, the wavy behavior of particles is only a tiny effect. But if we were subatomic in size, we would realize that we and all other objects do not exist at one place at a time but instead are spread out in a haze of simultanous existences at many places at once.This reminds me of Einstein's own problems with quantum entanglement, which he called ""spooky action at a distance."" The Accidental Universe: The World You Thought You Knew is full of insights like these. What is more, it puts them together is a neat package that does not require mathematical formulas and complicated graphs and charts. Lightman deals with his subject matter using easily understood concepts and plain, simple language.This is a book to be read and re-read."

in our constant search for meaning in this baffling and temporary existence, trapped as we are within our three pounds of neurons, it is sometimes hard to tell what is real. we often invent what isn't there. or ignore what is. we try to impose order, both in our minds and in our conceptions of external reality. we try to connect. we try to find truth. we dream and we hope. and underneath all of these strivings, we are haunted by the suspicion that what we see and understand of the world is only a tiny piece of the whole.
alan lightman's the accidental universe is a slim collection of seven scientific essays. as the first mit professor to receive dual appointments in science and the humanities, lightman is not only knowledgeable about physics, but also has the literary wherewithal to convey his insights with clarity and graceful prose. these seven essays focus mainly on cosmology and our ever-shifting understanding of the universe - serving as a philosophically-minded primer on a number of related concepts including dark energy, multiverse, inflation, entropy, impermanence, religion, wave-particle duality, symmetry, beauty, and technology.after all, our minds are made of the same atoms and molecules as everything else in nature. the neurons in our brains obey the same physical laws as planets and snowflakes. most important, our brains developed out of nature, out of hundreds of millions of years of sensory response to sunlight and sound and tactile connection to the world around our bodies. and the architecture of our brains was born from the same trial and error, the same energy principles, the same pure mathematics that happen in flowers and jellyfish and higgs particles. viewed in this way, our human aesthetic is necessarily the aesthetic of nature. viewed in this way, it is nonsensical to ask why we find nature beautiful. beauty and symmetry and minimum principles are not qualities we ascribe to the cosmos and then marvel at in their perfection. they are simply what is, just like the particular arrangement of atoms that make up our minds. we are not observers on the outside looking in. we are on the inside too.while anyone with a cursory understanding of astrophysics and the recent science thereof may not find any new material in the accidental universe, the essays are nonetheless thought-provoking and beautifully composed. lightman is adept at sharing his sense of wonder, be it in contemplation of the scientific or the spiritual (as an atheist himself). the book's final entry, ""the disembodied universe,"" takes aim at the disconnection that results from the ubiquity of technology - especially smartphones. lightman is certainly no luddite, but he does have reservations about the pervasiveness of technological distraction and what it means for our relationship(s) with the natural world around us and the cosmos above. the accidental universe, like so much of lightman's writing, is a stimulating foray into scientific inquiry; imbued with humility, curiosity, and awe.
today, with various ""back to nature"" movements attempting to resist dislocations brought about by modern technology, and with a worldwide awareness of global warming and other environmental problems, many people feel a new sympathy with the natural world on this planet. but the gargantuan cosmos beyond remain remote. we might understand at some intellectual level that those tiny points of light in the night sky are similar to our sun, made of the same atoms as our bodies, and that the cavern of outer space extends from our galaxy of stars to other galaxies of stars, to distances that would take light rays millions and billions of years to traverse. we might understand these discoveries in intellectual terms, but they are baffling abstractions, even disturbing, like the notion that each of us once was the size of a dot, without mind or thought. science has vastly expanded the scale of our cosmos, but our emotional reality is still limited by what we can touch with our bodies in the time span of our lives.
"
7,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22189980-belhor,2,Few interesting parts. Other than that nothing worth noticing. Lame aesthetic observations and mistakes at times. Very disappointing. 
8,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83139-jennifer,3,"I have been biased towards Alan Lightman ever since the brilliantly incandescent Einstein's Dreams, so I snatched this off of the library shelf as soon as I saw it, despite the size of my stack already and the state of my to-read shelf. Of course, this is no Einstein's Dreams, but a collection of essays about the nature of the universe. Most of the theories and interpretations discussed were not new to me, so I found little about this book to be groundbreaking. But in general I enjoy Lightman's writing style, and enjoy thinking about these sorts of things, so it was a pleasant enough read.I most enjoyed the essay ""The Symmetrical Universe,"" which closes thusly: ""Viewed in this way, it is nonsensical to ask why we find nature beautiful. Beauty and symmetry and minimum principles are not qualities we ascribe to the cosmos and then marvel at in their perfection. They are simply what is, just like the particular arrangement of atoms that make up our minds. We are not observers on the outside looking in. We are on the inside too."" And also ""The Disembodied Universe,"" which contained a lovely contextualized explanation of Foucault's pendulum, which I know I have read/learned about before, but somehow not grasped how radical and beautiful it was in its day. This last essay is also an interesting meditation on progress and technology and the ever-changing human condition.Some small complaints, but overall a good read. "
9,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14811808-liz,5,"In this, rather short and light, book Lightman explores the different perspectives when it comes to our universe. There is science as there is philosophy and religion. The most important discoveries and the author's personal musings. I immensely enjoyed this one, especially the fact that Lightman refrained from favouring one of the 'universes'. Most of them overlap anyway. But again, the fact that he stated that it all comes down to the matter of personal belief, was probably one of the aspects I enjoyed most. A highly informative read that I'd recommend to everyone regardless of your field of interest and/or study. It's worth it. "
10,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22443749-debbie,4,"3.5 starsThis book was lent and recommended to me by a coworker/friend, because we share a similar taste in non-fiction books. While I didn’t agree with all of the arguments Lightman presented, I can’t deny that he has a way with words and presented a compelling read whether you agree with his principals or not.This book would have been improved with a bit of trimming off the excess semi-unrelated ramblings in some areas, while bolstering his viewpoint in others with a deeper explanation and exploration of the scientific principles he referenced, rather than a surface-level discussion of said principles.——“The mind is certainly it’s own cosmos.” (ix-x)“In our constant search for meaning in this baffling and temporary existence, trap as we are within our three pounds of neurons, it is sometimes hard to tell what is real. We often invent what isn’t there. Or ignore what is. We try to impose order, both in our minds in our conceptions of external reality. We try to connect. We try to find truth. We dream and we hope. And underneath all of the strivings, we are haunted by the suspicion that what we see and understand of the world is only a tiny piece of the whole. Modern science has certainly revealed a hidden cosmos not visible to our senses.” (x)We now know so much more about the universe than we used to because there are aspects that we can’t see or sense: the colors of light, the structure of DNA, dark matter, the incongruity of time.“Science does not reveal the meaning of our existence, but it does draw back some of the veils.” (xi)“According to the current thinking of many physicists, we are living in one of a vast number of universes. We are living in an accidental universe. We are living in a universe uncalculable by science.” (7)Dark energy makes up 75% of the total energy in the universe. It is the energy that is accelerating the expansion of our universe when we would anticipate that expansion to be slowing down. “If the amount of dark energy in our universe were only a little bit different than what it actually is, then life could never have emerged. A little larger, and the universe would have accelerated so rapidly that matter in the young universe could never have pulled itself together to form stars and hence complex atoms made in stars. And, going into negative values of dark energy, a little smaller and the universe would have decelerated so rapidly that it would have recollapsed before there was time to form even the simplest atoms.” (17-18)We live in an “accidental universe,” wherein everything just so happens to be just right to support life. There are two explanations for this: Intelligent Design, and the multiverse (because the multiverse theory explains that there’s so many different universes out there where all the elements that make up a universe are tuned slightly differently, and thus we just happen to live in one where the tuning supports life). My own comment: But why do they need to be mutually exclusive? Can’t we have a multiverse created by an Intelligent Designer?“Not only must we accept that basic properties of our universe are accidental and uncalculable. In addition, we must believe in the existence of many other universes. But we have no conceivable way of observing these other universes and cannot prove their existence. Thus, to explain what we have seen in the world and in our mental deductions, we must believe in what we cannot prove.” (21-22)Eventually, cosmic gas will be used up, new stars will stop being born, and old stars will slowly all go out, leaving us with a dark day and night sky.“To my mind, it is one of the profound contradictions of human existence that we long for immortality, indeed fervently believe that something must be unchanging and permanent, when all of the evidence in nature argues against us... Either I am delusional...or there is some realm of immortality that exists outside nature. If the first alternative is right, then I need to have a talk with myself and get over it...the human mind has a famous ability to create its own reality. If the second alternative is right, then it is nature that has been found wanting...Perhaps this immortal thing we wish for exists beyond time and space. Perhaps it is God. Perhaps it is what made the universe.” (35)“ Science can never know what created our universe. Even if tomorrow we observed another universe spawned from our universe, as could hypothetically happen in certain theories of cosmology, we would not know what created our universe. And as long as God does not intervene in the contemporary universe in such a way as to violate physical laws, science has no way of knowing whether God exists or not. The believe or disbelieve in such a Being is therefore a matter of faith.” (49-50)“Faith is the willingness to give ourselves over, at times, to things we do not fully understand. Faith is the belief in things larger than ourselves. Faith is the ability to honor stillness at some moments and at others to ride the passion and exuberance that is the artistic impulse, the flight of the imagination, the full engagement with this strange and shimmering world.” (51-52)“One physical principle that governs nature over and over is the ‘energy principle’: nature evolves to minimize energy. If you place some marbles on a flat table, after some time has passed you will find most of the marbles on the floor. That’s because a marble on the floor is closer to the center of the Earth and has lower gravitational energy than on the table. Snowflakes have six-sided symmetry because or the angles that the two hydrogen atoms make with the oxygen atom in each water molecule. Those angles minimize the total electrical energy of the water molecule. Any other angles would produce greater energy. Large bodies, like the planet Saturn, are round because a spherical shape minimizes the total gravitational energy.” (75-76)Honeycombs are symmetrical hexagons because they’re one of only 3 shapes with equal sides (triangles, hexagons, squares) that can fit together on a flat surface without wasting space. They need to be symmetrical so multiple bees can work on the hive at the same time; they’re hexagons because that shape has the smallest perimeter for the area and therefore uses the least amount of wax.“...Symmetry represents order, and we crave order in this strange universe we find ourselves in. The search for symmetry, and the emotional pleasure we derive when we find it, must help us make sense of the world around us, just as we find satisfaction in the repetition of the seasons and the reliability of friendships. Symmetry is also economy. Symmetry is simplicity. Symmetry is elegance. And however we define the mysterious quality that we call beauty, we associate symmetry with beauty.” (78-79)“...our minds te made of the same atoms and molecules as everything else in nature. The neurons in our brains obey the same physical laws as planets and snowflakes. Most important, our brains developed out of nature, out of hundreds of millions of years of sensory response to sunlight and sound and tactile connection to the world around our bodies. And the architecture of our brains was born from the same trial and error, the same energy principles, the same pure mathematics that happens in flowers and jellyfish and Higgs particles. Viewed in this way, our human aesthetic is necessarily the aesthetic of nature. Viewed in this way, it is nonsensical to ask why we find nature beautiful.” (83)“The totality of living matter on Earth—not only humans but all animals, plants, bacteria, and pond scum—makes up about 0.00000001% of the mass of the planet. Combining this figure with the results from the Kepler spacecraft [3% of stars have a planet in the habitable zone], and assuming that all life-sustaining planets do indeed have life, we can conclude that the fraction of stuff in the visible universe that exists in living form is something like 0.000000000000001%, or one-millionth of one-billionth of 1%.” (100-101)“We will have freedom at any cost. We delight in discovering a rational universe as long as we ourselves are exempt from the rules. We worship order and rationality, but we also have a fondness for disorder and irrationality “ (122)“I believe that we are inspired and goaded on by what we don’t understand. And I hope that there will always be an edge between the known and the unknown, beyond which lies strangeness and unpredictability and life.” (124)“What we see with our eyes, what we hear with our ears, what we feel with our fingertips, is only a tiny sliver of reality. Little by little, using artificial devices; we have uncovered a hidden reality. It is often a reality that violates our common sense. It is often a reality strange to our bodies. It is a reality that forces us to re-examine our most basic concepts of how the world works. And it is a reality that discounts the present moment and our immediate experience of the world.” (128)“A second on your clock is only 0.014 seconds to a particle tracking past you at 99.99 percent of the speed of light. If we were able to move about at such high speeds, time would have a completely different meaning to us. We would constantly need to reset our watches after journeys. When we made a high-speed trip, our children might be older than we were when we returned. When it comes to our bodily experience of time, we are Flatlanders, unable to fathom Einstein’s world of relativity.” (133)Ok so many of these physics books I’m reading are referencing Flatland. Maybe it’s time I read it...“Perhaps the most startling discovery of a reality beyond sensory perception is that al Matter behaves both like particles and like waves. A particle, such as a grain of sand, occupies only one location at each moment of time. By contrast, a wave, such as a water wave, is spread out; it occupies many locations at once. All of our sensory experience with the world tells us that a material thing must be either a particle or a wave, but not both. However, experiments in the first half of the twentieth century conclusively showed that al Matter has a ‘wave-particle duality,’ sometimes acting like a particle and sometimes acting as a wave.Evidently, our impression that solid matter can be localized, that it occupies only one position at a time, is erroneous. The reason that we have not noticed the ‘wavy’ behavior of matter is because such behavior is pronounced only at the small size of atoms... If we were subatomic in size, we would realize that we and all other objects do not exist at one place at a time but instead are spread out in a haze of simultaneous existences at many places at once.” (134-135)"
11,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2621599-shaun,4,"Professor Alan Lightman is one of the brightest and, frankly, most interesting cosmologists and science writers living today. His work is simply phenomenal! ""Einstein's Dreams"" and ""Mr. g"" are among my all time favorites. Thought provoking, candid and well-written prose on exceptionally difficult concepts. I truly wish I could be a student in any one of his classes. He is that good. Sadly, however, this one did not trip my trigger. Kindly note that I have NOT yet read ""The Varieties of Religious Experiences"" which, I believe, to some extent may have influenced Professor Lightman's work here. The premise here is that we really do not and cannot understand our Universe . . . yet. Why? Probably because it is so freaking huge and our ability to perceive the Universe is within an exceptionally narrow range that precludes the possibility of better, more complete perception. Over time, our ability and understanding has increased, all the while raising more questions than answers. But eventually he predicts that we may be able to understand a bit more, and a bit more, and a bit more. The curtain is being lifted ever so slowly. At the same time, humans are uniquely qualified to begin to comprehend the great duality, disparity and incongruity that exists within and throughout the Universe. Edward O. Wilson wrote about this kind of duality, disparity and incongruity in ""The Meaning of Human Existence"" which was nominated for a National Book Award last fall. Professor Lightman and Edward O. Wilson are assuredly on my short list for a ""dream dinner"" as are Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha, Lincoln, Churchill, Victor Hugo, Herman Melville, Marcus Aurelius, Elizabeth I, Catherine the Great, Einstein and my dearly departed Dad, Jerry F. Kenney, May God rest his soul. But I digress.Each chapter is a self-contained essay about some aspect of the Universe. The chapter/essays even seem, at times, to be antithetical to each other, for example, the chapter/essay on ""The Accidental Universe"" seems directly antithetical to ""The Spiritual Universe"" as does ""The Disembodied Universe"" which seems directly antithetical to ""The Symmetrical Universe."" I walk away thinking, ""You're right, Professor Lightman. We really do not and cannot understand our Universe because it is simply too complex."" What he may be aiming at here is that our Universe is not really a ""Uni-""verse at all; more like a ""Multi-""verse. Capable of being many things at the same time. He put his cards on the table as an atheist and I will put mine down as well. I am of the opinion that it's complexity confirms for me: (A) our Universe was created by an intelligent being -- the evidence is just too great not favoring that presumption (i.e., the energy that attracts sub-atomic particles are just right -- not too strong and not too loose); and (B) the fact that our huge Universe is so freaking big and complex confirms it was designed by an intelligent, extremely omnipotent being capable of something far greater than we can and will ever hope to comprehend. In law, we call that reasoning a priori and sometimes ""res ipsa loquitur"" or ""the thing speaks for itself."" Granted, that seems to be a circular argument and you would be right. I don't want to get into that whole Immanuel Kant bit about epistemology or ""how do we know we know"" something. That makes my 54 year old brain hurt. But I cannot help but feel in its vastness and complete and utter lack of the proof of the existence of life on other planets to date confirms for me that we hold a unique and special place in the Universe/Multiverse; some would call that ""grace"" but I look at is a burden for which we are ill-equipped to handle unless we grow up, like one another (note: like, not necessarily ""love"") and put on our ""big boy"" and ""big girl"" pants and start acting responsibly toward our special planet and stop acting so reprehensibly toward each other or we are assuredly going to blow the only game in town. Again, I digress.Nevertheless, read this one in conjunction with Edward O. Wilson's newly minted book but don't expect the level of absolute brilliance you may have come to expect from Professor Lightman. Having met Professor Lightman in person and having attended a lecture he gave here in Tucson at the 2015 Book Festival at University of Arizona campus, I can assure you, he is darned interesting, has a heck of North Carolina slang and sleepy ""Mayberry RFD"" style and argot, and is a true blue gentleman. I could sit there and listen to him read the Physician's Desk Reference all day long and walk away feeling ""smarter"". But this book, like all things in this ""Uni-""/""Multi-""verse (hedging my bets there), is either pretty much all illusion or pretty much obvious depending upon your particular angle of perception. Me thinks that may be his point. "
12,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7481196-rizwan,4,"A series of insightful essays by Alan Lightman, who just happens to be a MIT professor of both physics and the humanities.He briefly discusses the ideas of the multiverse and our place in it - without getting too much into the science of it; inflation and dark energy; the latest discovery from CERN (the Higgs Boson); quantum physics and the wave-particle duality; entropy and the nature of time.Additionally he offers a more nuanced discussion on religion and the sciences and though he considers himself an atheist, he criticizes Dawkins for the his extreme views and rhetoric, and acknowledges that some of his most intelligent colleagues are profoundly religious.The essays are also social commentary, and he ends it with a half-diatribe against cell phones, and current technology that have taken away from good ol' social interaction. But he also admits that this dislike of technology has existed for the better part of three centuries and that he may be in the minority complaining about a romanticized vision of the past. In the end it is a quick read. And a thought provoking one. "
13,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31668840-roger-k,2,"The language of this book is often quite beautiful, and there are many wonderful passages. Alan Lightman is an MIT professor and is comfortable with both the sciences and humanities. It is a good primer for those fascinated by cosmology, yet not up on its latest developments.However, the book suffers from the author's inability to imagine a non-dualist world. He admits as much in the book, and spends the rest of the book dealing with the bind he has put himself into. The struggle is interesting to observe, yet it feels like watching a mime in an imaginary box that doesn't realize he can step out of the box whenever he wants.I feel it is apparent that quantum physics show the idea that science is about discovering a fixed set of underlying principles does not stand up to scrutiny. Instead, science is a construction of human thinking that is informed by the world, yet cannot underpin it for the simple reason that the universe was here long before thinking ever existed. Regardless, the book is a quick read and worthwhile for those interested in cosmology and the big questions of existence, even if I disagree with the conclusions."
14,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,0,"Started listening to this. It's well read & seems well done, but the subject matter is too far out there for me. Sure, a slight change in atomic cohesive force would make for a different universe where we couldn't live. Dark energy & dark matter might be part of a multiverse. (Personally, I think they just point out holes in our knowledge.) The accelerating expansion of the universe is definitely weird.I just can't find any reason to really care & fill my head with this trivia, especially when the philosophical maunderings are used to take too little data & spin it into intricate, impractical, & ultimately meaningless (to me) webs. I have enough problems with what is to worry too much about what might be on these scales."

I personally did not learn any new science, and the science explained is of a general nature, as befits an overall philosophical treatment. However, that's not to say that other readers won't learn some science from the science-related portions. The best parts for me were the discussions of the relationship between science and the arts. That Lightman's being a writer of fiction as well as a scientist qualifies him to speak to the interface between the two can hardly be questioned, but I thought that his observations, as pithy as they sometimes are, nevertheless sometimes were a bit superficial or obvious, or both. That didn't detract much from my enjoyment of the book, however, and I still heartily recommend it."
17,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11318655-scott,5,"Theoretical Physicist (what a great job title) Alan Lightman has put together a fun book here, full of scientific information and philosophical ponderings about our mysterious universe (or multiple universes). He has broken the book into chapters discussing various ideas, such as the 'accidental universe', the 'temporary universe', the 'spiritual universe’, etc. And in general I found each one to be very interesting. I especially enjoyed the grand scope of ""the gargantuan universe"" and the non-scientific ponderings of “the spiritual universe”. The latter is where Lightman makes the case for science and religion peacefully coexisting...since “spiritual types” are generally just harmless 'seekers' themselves (which I agree with...but I do NOT feel that way about most organized religions, which I believe are still dangerous, dishonest, obstructionist, and intentionally misleading regarding science). Overall, each of these chapters gave me quite a bit to ponder regarding the various debates about the universe that we are a tiny part of. Is it chaos? Is it accidental? Is it ordered and structured? Is it ""spiritual""? Lightman makes a plausible case for each of these concepts to be “theoretically possible”. Of course, what else would you really expect from a “Theoretical Physicist”? This was a fairly quick read, mainly because it was a fun page turner that I didn't want to put down. I highly reccomend this book for anyone who has more than a passing interest in our vast and mysterious universe."
18,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6309342-bruce,3,"The Accidental Universe is a collection of seven contemplative essays on different aspects of the universe: the Accidental Universe, the Temporary Universe, the Spiritual Universe, the Symmetrical Universe, the Gargantuan Universe, the Lawful Universe, and the Disembodied Universe. If you are well versed in astrophysics and religion, there's really no new information. Instead, Lightman poses questions and provokes thought, blurring the lines between religion, science, philosophy, and humanities. This is a breezy and quick read, but don't let that fool you. While you can read this book in just a couple of hours, it will take a lifetime and perhaps more to understand. Written in beautiful prose that is almost poetry, Lightman takes a nuanced approach to life, science, religion, and philosophy, providing many questions and very few answers. He admits to being an atheist, yet argues the spiritual aspects of life against the strictures of physics, and that no one can be sure of theism or atheism. I like to come away with something more when I read a book such as this one. Although it was certainly graceful and balanced, I felt it also missed something important. It felt too safe. When I read a book like this, I want my beliefs to be challenged. I want to come away changed. But I wasn't. "
19,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1532590-zach,3,"This book consists of what are more like casual musing than essays. Certainly, Lightman has earned the right to muse, but I was hoping for something a little more concrete in terms of content. The book's greatest strength is its moderate position, and if there is one central theme it's that people who seek knowledge should also cultivate understanding.The last section ends on a weak note, which unfortunately made my final evaluation of the book a little less positive than it might have otherwise been. This last essay begins with the history and a discussion of our physical detachment from modern physics and the dual particle/wave nature of quantum physics, but somehow ends with a denunciation of modern cell phone culture. There's nothing really wrong with the observations about our reliance on technology, but it seems like a very small, very already-done place to end a book, especially for a book by an author with a well-deserved reputation for originality."
20,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/214234-dan,4,"I've long enjoyed Lightman's fiction, so I was pretty excited when I came across this book. It's a quick read, which is pretty typical for him, but (also typical) it gets across some pretty mind-expanding ideas. Accidental Universe is a series of essays, each taking on a different scientific topic with philosophical implications. For instance, there's an interesting exploration of what the instance of intelligent life means in a random iteration of a potentially multi-verse. Others examine the arguments for and against a creator.Ultimately, Lightman steers clear of answers. A smart move considering the potentially incendiary nature of a lot of the material here. I recommend this for people looking for a 1,000 foot view on a lot of the human aspects of the cutting edge of cosmology. Very little math and science!If you liked this, make sure to follow me on Goodreads for more reviews!"

Lightman's prose are quiet, elegant, a joy to read, and the ideas he ponders swirl through the mind long after each piece is done. It's subtitled ""The Word You Thought You Knew."" While the actual science discussed did not show me anything really new (except for the discussions about the Higgs Boson) it was the way he interwove our reactions and our contemplations into all this that made the experience unique. It was the universe of our apprehension and comprehension that he is talking about, but in such a way that it slips in and makes perspectival shifts leading to a new way of regarding ourselves as much as the universe. Highly recommended."
22,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/439937-jim,3,"I think I have had more than my required dose of cosmology and brain warping. In addition to Hawking, I picked this book up, accidentally. :) Quite interesting, and thought provoking, and surprisingly it didn't really shake me up with the ginormous expanses and physics explanations. But I thought: Why can't there be many dark energies? Why can't light have multiple speeds, in different parts of the galaxy? Why isn't there energies and other phenomena we just haven't discovered yet. I know it will take generations probably, but those smart people keep finding stuff, which is exciting to me (if they can explain it at my level, which is why we have people like Lightman), and I am hopeful humanity will keep developing, before we wink out of existence.

24,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13249932-fred,5," This book is a collection of essays in which Lightman examines a host of engaging topics. Founded in scientific ideas, for Lightman is a physicist, this book is a far cry from the egg-headed offerings of an academician. Clearly drawing on his dual experience as a creative writing professor, Lightman delivers, among several ideas, a well-crafted conversation about such things as the validity of scientific thought existing along side religious sensibilities. As a self-professed atheist and admirer of Dr. Richard Dawkins, Lightman takes exception with the notion that one world view necessitates the denial of the other. His position is somewhat centrist noting that each camp has value within its sphere of utility.  Other ideas include the dichotomy of our struggle for permanence in the onward-marching lifecycle of the universe. "" Even though we struggle and howl against the brief flash of our lives, might we find something majestic in that brevity?""Lightman poses this contemplative question not as a lead-in for discourse on religion, but as commentary on the scientifically verified historical development and predicted continuance of our universe. In a feat of seamless logic, Lightman links a wholly digestible mention of Particle Theory with his astonishment, and chagrin, at the conflicting truth that technological advances -- ie cell phones, Internet, et al -- have both served up the ability to more closely experience the world while also separating us from it. This brief discussion alone is worth the price of the book and more. Throughout, the author deftly injects writings from Einstein and Foucoult to Dostoyevsky and Thorea, succeeding in his effort to foster meaningful discourse framed by careful observation and tempered with contributions from aesthetic thinkers. Computer programmers often speak of ""elegant code"" when referring to work that is brilliantly constructed with forethought of application yet succinct and efficient in its flow. That accolade can be easily bestowed on this book. One last comment, if I have given you the impression that this is a nerd book full of equation justifications and math proofs, I have done you a great disservice. This book is the antithesis. The writing is beautiful and the ideas accessible. Any one with a sense of wonder will likely enjoy this book. Give it a try"

This was my first time reading Lightman's work and I was delighted by his style, his clear understanding of physics and his delightfully clear, easy-to-understand prose. I would recommend this collection of essays as a beautiful primer on the challenges facing physics today and the great strides in understanding that we have made in that field. The last essay was particularly striking to me and was a wonderful way to finish this book and apply the themes from these essays to my own life."

He constantly illuminates his readers to the wonders of the universe by simplistically explaining complex scientific systems/theories and threading the with psychological and sociological theories on how mankind is and has to deal with these truths. It's a fascinating collection of questions and wonderings, but that was the extent to which I felt engaged. Lightman presents some interesting insight on mankind's need for structure, the laws of nature, and a dimming of the ""vitality of the visible"" realm...but it was nothing monumental. Rather, it felt like general psychological deductions, and the book echoed nothing more, to me, than an effort to get Lightman's readers to awe at the universe and question it as he has. That's not to say he didn't craft beautiful connections between philosophy, literature, science, and religion, but the beauty lay more in the idea of their interconnectedness rather than in the points he was trying to make. If someone were unfamiliar with the scientific truths about the physical universe that Lightman points out, then I can see reading this novel as an enlightening and illuminating experience. However, I already spent a brief portion of my life fascinated by these truths, and though I continue to be dazzled and perplexed by exactly what Lightman illustrates, I hoped to read this and come away with a new fascination to chew on, and that did not occur. Therefore, as an introductory reading (and given the second half of the title, I can't help but assume such was purposed), this is an excellent choice for readers of any age and level of experience in the fields of math/science or the humanities. It'll open your eyes to our broken, self-made realities in order to reveal the startling and nonsensical possibilities of the universe and hopefully motivate you to look at the world through a completely different lens.

32,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22117564-douglas-lord,5,"Lightman, a physics professor at MIT, has a brain roughly twice the size of an average person’s; fortunately for humankind, he has sworn to only use his powers for good. He starts this fantastic collection of previously published essays by relating how he met the Dalai Lama at MIT, and it’s exactly this kind of cross-pollinating of the spiritual world with the scientific one that exemplifies this title. “Science,” he writes, “does not reveal the meaning of our existence, but it does draw back some veils.” Much veil-pulling ensues, and like über-dude Isaac Asimov, the good professor focuses on explaining/exploring various topics within cosmology and physics, like dark energy. Mind-boggling facts appear; “If the theoretically possible values for dark energy were marked on a ruler stretching from here to the sun, the value of dark energy actually found in our universe … (10 -8 ergs per cubic centimeter) would be closer to the zero end than the width of an atom.” This title will infuriate intelligent design advocates, for Lightman holds, per the title, that “we are an accident.” And yet the writing is a real and searching investigation at the crux of science and faith. Where else might you read the spiritual version of the second law of thermodynamics—the “arrow of time”—explicated in a way that includes toupees and Botox? VERDICT Part philosophy, part science, this little book is a big fat pleasure to read.

I stopped after the Prologue and a few pages of the first chapter. I just couldn't.This book, instead of trying to tackle microcosms of ""What Is Science?"", goes straight after our own existence, and how our uncertainties of the past turned to certainties only lead to more uncertainties today.Lightman has a wonderful knack for relating the unfathomable and wholly abstract--the size of our universe, the nature of quantum mechanics, unending entropy--to the fathomable yet wholly abstract in our lives--that tiny feeling near the ocean, love, pondering non-existence.In a sense, he does what Canon attempts. He dives deep into one realm of our existence that defines everything else in our existence: what is our universe and what is our consciousness, but together, in their whole tangled mess.His conclusion is a bit too much of a concrete cop-out rant on electronics and being present. I believe his real conclusion is that we know what we know, much abstractly, but furthermore that whatever is outside of our observable universe--literally the space beyond the distance that light could have travelled in the universe's existence--is unknowable. For now, at least.Also, his writing is superb.Read it.Tossing it on the Religion shelf because he deals with religion quite a bit."
34,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,0,"Description:  Comprised of a number of essays, The Accidental Universe documents recent discoveries about our universe, the quest for a complete Standard Model of physics to explain, literally, everything, and the recently uncovered Higgs boson, the so-called ""God particle"" that grants subatomic particles their mass. This is balanced by Lightman's reflections on human nature, our mutual condition, and our place in a vast cosmos beyond our reach. This creates an interesting tension that runs throughout the collection, beginning right at the beginning in the titular essay. Lightman starts with that: ""The history of science can, in fact, be viewed as the recasting of phenomena that were once accepted as 'givens' as phenomena that can now be understood in terms of fundamental causes and principles."" Science peels away layers that obscure the truth at the heart of our universe. However, after centuries of constant triumph, scientists have run into a brick wall. For every new discovery, new questions arise that science may not also be able to answer. After affirming what science has done, he pulls away the table cloth: ""According to the current thinking of many physicists, we are living in one of a vast number of universes. We are living in an accidental universe. We are living in a universe incalculable by science."""

The last essay in particular, ""The Disembodied Universe,"" veers off into a weird anti-technological rant about how kids these days just Instagram pictures of nature instead of just being in the moment, or something (although I admit the story he recounts about one of his adult daughter's friends playing a song on her iPhone during a dinner he took them out too seemed pretty rude).

It was a further explanation of the state of Physics, written in a very accessible way. I understood almost all of it. There was only one concept that left me scratching my head; I just couldn't quite get it.I like how this author, an atheist, nevertheless treats the Christian point of view with respect, and concedes that Science will never tell us Why, only What and How, and the why, along with the moral uses of science, lies with other ways of knowing, such as religious faith.

Alan Lightman makes reading about some of the advances in science easy and illuminating, not just stating how they came about, but what it means to each of us as human beings. What does it mean that our idea of how big the universe is keeps expanding, what does it mean that we interact with these forces through technology as our senses are no longer able to perceive without assistance the newest findings.

Individually, the essays are a bit slight, and the book itself is a trim little document. But it all moves so quickly and even joyfully that the slightness becomes a part of its charm.

It's an essay collection that references physics old and new to explore what's on Alan Lightman's mind--forms of knowledge, questions of faith, the effects of technology on contemporary life. It's what happens when a theoretical physicist takes the Montaignian approach to writing, using it to compare, deduce, wander, and complicate in a manner that's personal, yet accessible to readers. It has not profoundly altered my life (a tall order for any book), but it has added to the ever-present chorus in my head another voice that will feed the music."

There's one essay on how screens mediate our reality too much, with a shout out to Sherry Turkle, and a general sense of aaaaAAAAAAAHHHHHH and our post-human future.So, like Rovelli's book, this covers the cosmic weirdnesses of modern physics - specifically, the multiverse, quantum mechanics, and the time-bendy wavey nature of things very very very great or very very very small. We dwell on why there is anything, and Lightman kinda shook my foundations a little bit by answering it in the usual ways: the multiverse (i.e. this highly improbable, intelligent life-sustaining universe exists because every other possible universe also exists) or, gah, GOD. Theism has all of zero social prestige in my liberal/secular circles, and so I found Lightman's (who notes he is an atheist) discussion of how cosmically improbable a medium zone planet being birthed from a Big Bang with perfectly calibrated levels of hydrogen, ergo First Mover, spooky and disquieting. I mean, when the choice is inscrutable First Mover vs. multiverse, BOTH ARE VERY STRANGE CHOICES. People, it's this or this!? Lightman also sticks it to Dawkins, which was satisfying (Lord, grant me the patience to tolerate Richard frickin Dawkins), and his whole social, professional and spiritual life is centralized around MIT, which was ALSO very satisfying. (Glory, glory be to MIT!) But those two bits are just icing on the cake.Wonderfully written, inspiring, and YES WE SPEND TOO MUCH TIME IN OUR SCREENS. Even though Lightman sounds like a 60+ curmudgeon when he complains about young people ""emailing their Facebooks"" with pictures of nature walks (thus defeating the purpose of the nature walk), I did - basically - 200% AGREE. YA DAMN KIDS WITH YER DAMN BOOK OF FACE!Strongly recommended. Do not wait 11 years to read this."
56,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27614432-justin-tapp,3,"I have read several of Brian Greene's and Stephen Hawking's books detailing the history of modern physics, string theory in its various iterations, and the theoretical possibilities of a multiverse. Lightman does a much better job summing up the philosophical implications of theoretical physics in very stark form. He is also much more transparent about the fact that there are Nobel prize-winning physicists who don't buy the multiverse theory and believe in a Creator and an intelligence behind the design of our universe rather than a theoretically infinite number of universes created by no intelligence. Lightman admits the ""fine-tuning"" of the cosmological constants necessary for our universe to be the way it is are astronomically improbable. While charitable to his colleagues who believe in a higher power, Lightman disagrees with them. In Lightman's view, we are simply a random collection of molecules put together by chance. ""We are an accident,"" he states, a mathematical improbability in our own universe -- ""one millionth of one billionth of a percent in our universe is life"" -- but when the denominator is infinity (the infinite multiverse) improbable is relative. ""Science can never know how universe was created,"" yet he's certain how it was not created.He details early in the book what this means for humans. He loves his daughter, feels attached to her, cares for her. But then he remembers that she's just a random collection of atoms and, like his own atoms, will one day be nothing more than scattered into the universe. He admits this is hard to wrap his mind around, his mind longs for eternity and he is ""self-delusional"" in his longing for immortality. But since everything in the universe decays or dies and the law of entropy says that everything moves from order to disorder there can be nothing more than this. Life is therefore meaningless, absurd. Not since Hawking wrote in Black Holes and Baby Universes that we have two options: God, or grand unifying theory that explains everything from the Big Bang to why I ate a salad for lunch. Hawking rejected the former and later recanted on the GUT (which was supposed to bridge quantum mechanics with the standard model), basically the multiverse via string theory has replaced his GUT. Meaning, again, that both the big bang and my salad were random and need no explanation.It's odd that Lightman even uses the word ""life"" in the book since how do you define a random collection of atoms whose extinguishing means nothing as ""life""? What is consciousness? If I were to kill his daughter, why would that be wrong, I'm just scattering her atoms about the universe? The fact that his brain has evolved to find that idea repulsive is his own problem. Atoms have no ethics and it's silly to call things that are random ""evil."" For an MIT professor who also teaches philosophy he surprisingly doesn't raise the question. Odder still is that he later heralds natural selection and the ability of millions of cells to transmit information when reproducing without noting that some atheist biologists have concluded that this is impossible without some sort of guided process. How did the basic building blocks of life know that they needed to survive? These biologists have followed Lightman's logic to its conclusion, apparently unknown to Lightman himself, that we are the result of a completely random process.I have also read physicist Lee Smolin's The Trouble with Physics, critiquing string theory and modern physics in general. I highly recommend that book to anyone who thinks string theory is all that there is. There are alternative, testable theories out there. Which is another irony because Lightman writes that science ""must be verified and tested"" but doesn't apply this to either string theory or the multiverse. Stephen Hawking wrote in The Universe in a Nutshell that you would need a particle collider larger than the size of the universe to test some aspects of string theory. Yet Lightman hails theoretical physics as ""the purest form of science.""Cosmologist George Ellis was quoted recently in Scientific American criticizing physicists like Lightman and Lawrence Krauss who have moved away from physics and science to pure metaphysical hypotheses which are not testable.""Krauss does not explain in what way these entities could have pre-existed the coming into being of the universe, why they should have existed at all, or why they should have had the form they did. And he gives no experimental or observational process whereby we could test these vivid speculations of the supposed universe-generation mechanism. How indeed can you test what existed before the universe existed? You can’t.""Lightman's essays contradict themselves in this regard: he praises scientific measurement and cheering on the work of phsyics toward a complete set of the fundamental laws of our universe while earlier saying that if the multiverse is true them most of physics is ""useless"" as there is ""no point"" in explaining why things in our universe are the way they are-- it was just random. Other universes are flat, some are round, some are finite, some are infinite, some contain the null set, and in some universes every law that holds in ours doesn't hold, and vice-versa.Lightman contends that a God ""consistent with science"" can only exist outside the universe, never intervening in its immutable, unchangeable laws. This rules out anything miraculous, whether there is evidence or not to the contrary-- and he examines no evidence or testimony of the physically unexplainable. (I read Eric Metaxas' Miracles just prior to this book, the first bit of which argues philosophically against Lightman's conclusions.) God is the watchmaker who let the universe wind up, go and never intervenes, somehow can't intervene without the entire universe falling apart according to Lightman. Lightman rejects the ""immanentism"" of Spinoza and Einstein.The essays also contain brief explanations of the importance of symmetry and discovery of the Higgs-Boson. There is also some overview of philosophical history but nothing in-depth. As I wrote above, he ignores his own theory's implications for ethics and the problem of evil. He writes of how he had somehow a sort of mental connection with a bird once, yet seemingly forgets that this, like his daugher, was purely random and meaningless. He cites plenty of deist scientists along the way, and criticizes Lawrence Krauss for being critical of faith. He considers faith to be rational, and rightly notes many scientific, economic, and political achievements that have come forth from theists who felt their exploration of science was a way to understand better how God created things, wrong-headed though they were. But this again ignores the fact that it's hard to define what is ""ethical"" or an ""advancement"" when we're purely random and there are no consequences, ultimately, for our actions.He concludes the book with some futurist silliness that reminded me of Lightman's fellow multiverse proponent Brian Greene in The Hidden Reality where Greene writes that another plausible alternative to the multiverse is that nothing in our world is actually real, we could all be living in a simulated multiverse. A ""software glitch"" explains why we can't reconcile quantum mechanics and the standard model or discover all of the fundamental laws. We are just Sims in someone's video game, and those playing us are also likely Sims, who are being played by Sims and so on. Physics has truly set philosophy back millenia.As I wrote above, Lightman's work does a great job showing the logical conclusion of the multiverse in a succinct fashion. I recommend reading it for yourself, but only 3.5 stars because as another sympathetic reviewer writing for the left-leaning magazine Salon pointed out: ""Perhaps Lightman contradicts himself."""
57,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103275991-emilie-marshall,0,"Was inspired to pick up this book from some excerpts discussed by David Byrne in his Bicycle Diaries. Some intriguing ideas, as I usually find new curiosities in books about physics made digestible for the common folk such as myself. If I remember correctly there was much scrutiny of the idea that our brains are finite, and that something must always be lost in order to gain something else. I think... Here is the one and only quote I copied down during my reading:""Most of us will adapt to this new way of living the same way that the people of today have adapted to cell phones and Skype. It will be the natural and normal way of being in the world. But here and there, small pockets of people will rebel and establish protected communes, where the newer technologies are left at the front gate-- in the same way that some people today still send handwritten letters and take long walks without their cellphones. In such enclaves, people will feel that they are living a more immediate and authentic life, that they are more connected with themselves and their surroundings. And that will be partly true. Yet they will be also disconnected from the larger world just outside of their gate, invisible in their own way,"" -pg 145While this thought is certainly nothing new or terribly provoking, I think it's an important thought to remind oneself to remember. It's easily one of those things you store away in your ""things I am aware of"" closet where it collects dust and gets forgotten. So pull it off the shelf every once in a while and think about it again!! In my opinion it is a truth that will continue to morph in relevance at constant intervals in one's life."
58,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81065199-caleb,3,"While this book offers an exciting and poetic journey into some of the larger questions of life, existence and our universe, it is barely a scratch at the surface which poses more problems than it answers. Do not pick up this book expecting a scientifically rigorous look at cosmology or dimensionality, as I made the mistake of doing. You need nothing more than a basic understanding of physics and astronomy to grasp a lot of the concepts in this book. On one hand that is good because it makes it accessible to everyone and anyone who wants to get into this sort of philosophical questioning. On the other hand, it makes me wonder what, if anything, this book adds that hasn't already been said before in so many ways. The lyricism in this book is beautiful and enthralling. The way the words come together to form something cohesive is impressive with such disparate and far reaching ideas and anecdotes. I'm never sure where Lightman will take me until I've arrived there. From personal experiences in his own life to vast stretching quasars deep in the cosmos, he somehow relates those things which I thought unrelatable. In that way, I am impressed with his skillful writing and lucid imagery.I am, however, always left feeling as though I've missed something. Each essay reaches an altogether unsatisfying conclusion which I had hoped it would surpass. I wonder, what more is there to say about this topic? Perhaps that is Lightman's clever way of getting me to explore these ideas on my own. Yet, I wanted more than what I got. Something more deeply scientific, some theories about how and why, instead of questions that lead to no answers but instead to casual ""maybe""s and ""we don't know""s. Pick up this book for some poetic stellar imagination, but leave it on the shelf in favor of Hawking or Kaku if you want something that provokes your deeper scientific spirit. The short length and easy narrative makes this book a great starting point for anyone new to physics, philosophy and cosmology. "

This is the exact kind of thing I like to read: not pure science, but a way to think about science. Writing about science that is beautiful and thought-provoking, even inspiring, is rare (Carl Sagan was the very best at this, in my opinion). This book hits all the right notes.The author is a physicist and a fiction writer, so he manages to write about the universe with deep, satisfying prose. In seven short chapters, Mr. Lightman manages to cover the weirdness of the universe, the lawfulness of the universe, the spiritual depth of the universe, and the way that our observation of the universe is entirely dependent on the observers. I am not doing it justice by trying to describe the depth of this man's insights. They are profound.Why is there so much symmetry in the universe? Is there really a multiverse? Why does everything change, and decay? What is consciousness? What is relationship between experiences of transcendence and religion? As I read, I found that both my humanist and pantheist leanings were being highly stimulated. My take away from this book is an astonishing sense of wonder, and reverence. That I am here at all, on this planet, and conscious, is a miracle. My existence, my ability to reason, to observe, and to ponder, is...sacred. Numinous indeed. Literally my favorite kind of writing.

61,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45699572-nadisha,3,"It's clear Alan Lightman is enthralled by what he had discovered in his work as physicist and professor, and that enthusiasm seeps off each page of this book. He constantly illuminates his readers to the wonders of the universe by simplistically explaining complex scientific systems/theories and threading the with psychological and sociological theories on how mankind is and has to deal with these truths. It's a fascinating collection of questions and wonderings, but that was the extent to which I felt engaged. Lightman presents some interesting insight on mankind's need for structure, the laws of nature, and a dimming of the ""vitality of the visible"" realm...but it was nothing monumental. Rather, it felt like general psychological deductions, and the book echoed nothing more, to me, than an effort to get Lightman's readers to awe at the universe and question it as he has. That's not to say he didn't craft beautiful connections between philosophy, literature, science, and religion, but the beauty lay more in the idea of their interconnectedness rather than in the points he was trying to make. If someone were unfamiliar with the scientific truths about the physical universe that Lightman points out, then I can see reading this novel as an enlightening and illuminating experience. However, I already spent a brief portion of my life fascinated by these truths, and though I continue to be dazzled and perplexed by exactly what Lightman illustrates, I hoped to read this and come away with a new fascination to chew on, and that did not occur. Therefore, as an introductory reading (and given the second half of the title, I can't help but assume such was purposed), this is an excellent choice for readers of any age and level of experience in the fields of math/science or the humanities. It'll open your eyes to our broken, self-made realities in order to reveal the startling and nonsensical possibilities of the universe and hopefully motivate you to look at the world through a completely different lens.

62,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22117564-douglas-lord,5,"Lightman, a physics professor at MIT, has a brain roughly twice the size of an average person’s; fortunately for humankind, he has sworn to only use his powers for good. He starts this fantastic collection of previously published essays by relating how he met the Dalai Lama at MIT, and it’s exactly this kind of cross-pollinating of the spiritual world with the scientific one that exemplifies this title. “Science,” he writes, “does not reveal the meaning of our existence, but it does draw back some veils.” Much veil-pulling ensues, and like über-dude Isaac Asimov, the good professor focuses on explaining/exploring various topics within cosmology and physics, like dark energy. Mind-boggling facts appear; “If the theoretically possible values for dark energy were marked on a ruler stretching from here to the sun, the value of dark energy actually found in our universe … (10 -8 ergs per cubic centimeter) would be closer to the zero end than the width of an atom.” This title will infuriate intelligent design advocates, for Lightman holds, per the title, that “we are an accident.” And yet the writing is a real and searching investigation at the crux of science and faith. Where else might you read the spiritual version of the second law of thermodynamics—the “arrow of time”—explicated in a way that includes toupees and Botox? VERDICT Part philosophy, part science, this little book is a big fat pleasure to read.

I stopped after the Prologue and a few pages of the first chapter. I just couldn't.This book, instead of trying to tackle microcosms of ""What Is Science?"", goes straight after our own existence, and how our uncertainties of the past turned to certainties only lead to more uncertainties today.Lightman has a wonderful knack for relating the unfathomable and wholly abstract--the size of our universe, the nature of quantum mechanics, unending entropy--to the fathomable yet wholly abstract in our lives--that tiny feeling near the ocean, love, pondering non-existence.In a sense, he does what Canon attempts. He dives deep into one realm of our existence that defines everything else in our existence: what is our universe and what is our consciousness, but together, in their whole tangled mess.His conclusion is a bit too much of a concrete cop-out rant on electronics and being present. I believe his real conclusion is that we know what we know, much abstractly, but furthermore that whatever is outside of our observable universe--literally the space beyond the distance that light could have travelled in the universe's existence--is unknowable. For now, at least.Also, his writing is superb.Read it.Tossing it on the Religion shelf because he deals with religion quite a bit."

This is balanced by Lightman's reflections on human nature, our mutual condition, and our place in a vast cosmos beyond our reach. This creates an interesting tension that runs throughout the collection, beginning right at the beginning in the titular essay. Lightman starts with that: ""The history of science can, in fact, be viewed as the recasting of phenomena that were once accepted as 'givens' as phenomena that can now be understood in terms of fundamental causes and principles."" Science peels away layers that obscure the truth at the heart of our universe. However, after centuries of constant triumph, scientists have run into a brick wall. For every new discovery, new questions arise that science may not also be able to answer. After affirming what science has done, he pulls away the table cloth: ""According to the current thinking of many physicists, we are living in one of a vast number of universes.

The last essay in particular, ""The Disembodied Universe,"" veers off into a weird anti-technological rant about how kids these days just Instagram pictures of nature instead of just being in the moment, or something (although I admit the story he recounts about one of his adult daughter's friends playing a song on her iPhone during a dinner he took them out too seemed pretty rude).

It was a further explanation of the state of Physics, written in a very accessible way. I understood almost all of it. There was only one concept that left me scratching my head; I just couldn't quite get it.I like how this author, an atheist, nevertheless treats the Christian point of view with respect, and concedes that Science will never tell us Why, only What and How, and the why, along with the moral uses of science, lies with other ways of knowing, such as religious faith.

What does it mean that our idea of how big the universe is keeps expanding, what does it mean that we interact with these forces through technology as our senses are no longer able to perceive without assistance the newest findings.

Fun fact, but I've had him on my TO-READ list since TWO THOUSAND SIX. 11 years!!!Anyway, this book is kinda similar to Carlo Rovelli's Sette brevi lezioni di fisica (Seven brief lessons in physics), in that it's short, dense, deep, and loving. Very heartening! It's a collection of essays/meditations on cutting edge physics and its intersections with philosophy, cosmic mysteries. There's one essay on how screens mediate our reality too much, with a shout out to Sherry Turkle, and a general sense of aaaaAAAAAAAHHHHHH and our post-human future.So, like Rovelli's book, this covers the cosmic weirdnesses of modern physics - specifically, the multiverse, quantum mechanics, and the time-bendy wavey nature of things very very very great or very very very small. We dwell on why there is anything, and Lightman kinda shook my foundations a little bit by answering it in the usual ways: the multiverse (i.e. this highly improbable, intelligent life-sustaining universe exists because every other possible universe also exists) or, gah, GOD. Theism has all of zero social prestige in my liberal/secular circles, and so I found Lightman's (who notes he is an atheist) discussion of how cosmically improbable a medium zone planet being birthed from a Big Bang with perfectly calibrated levels of hydrogen, ergo First Mover, spooky and disquieting. I mean, when the choice is inscrutable First Mover vs. multiverse, BOTH ARE VERY STRANGE CHOICES. People, it's this or this!? Lightman also sticks it to Dawkins, which was satisfying (Lord, grant me the patience to tolerate Richard frickin Dawkins), and his whole social, professional and spiritual life is centralized around MIT, which was ALSO very satisfying. (Glory, glory be to MIT!) But those two bits are just icing on the cake.Wonderfully written, inspiring, and YES WE SPEND TOO MUCH TIME IN OUR SCREENS. Even though Lightman sounds like a 60+ curmudgeon when he complains about young people ""emailing their Facebooks"" with pictures of nature walks (thus defeating the purpose of the nature walk), I did - basically - 200% AGREE. YA DAMN KIDS WITH YER DAMN BOOK OF FACE!Strongly recommended. Do not wait 11 years to read this."
86,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27614432-justin-tapp,3,"I have read several of Brian Greene's and Stephen Hawking's books detailing the history of modern physics, string theory in its various iterations, and the theoretical possibilities of a multiverse. Lightman does a much better job summing up the philosophical implications of theoretical physics in very stark form. He is also much more transparent about the fact that there are Nobel prize-winning physicists who don't buy the multiverse theory and believe in a Creator and an intelligence behind the design of our universe rather than a theoretically infinite number of universes created by no intelligence. Lightman admits the ""fine-tuning"" of the cosmological constants necessary for our universe to be the way it is are astronomically improbable. While charitable to his colleagues who believe in a higher power, Lightman disagrees with them. In Lightman's view, we are simply a random collection of molecules put together by chance. ""We are an accident,"" he states, a mathematical improbability in our own universe -- ""one millionth of one billionth of a percent in our universe is life"" -- but when the denominator is infinity (the infinite multiverse) improbable is relative. ""Science can never know how universe was created,"" yet he's certain how it was not created.He details early in the book what this means for humans. He loves his daughter, feels attached to her, cares for her. But then he remembers that she's just a random collection of atoms and, like his own atoms, will one day be nothing more than scattered into the universe. He admits this is hard to wrap his mind around, his mind longs for eternity and he is ""self-delusional"" in his longing for immortality. But since everything in the universe decays or dies and the law of entropy says that everything moves from order to disorder there can be nothing more than this. Life is therefore meaningless, absurd. Not since Hawking wrote in Black Holes and Baby Universes that we have two options: God, or grand unifying theory that explains everything from the Big Bang to why I ate a salad for lunch. Hawking rejected the former and later recanted on the GUT (which was supposed to bridge quantum mechanics with the standard model), basically the multiverse via string theory has replaced his GUT. Meaning, again, that both the big bang and my salad were random and need no explanation.It's odd that Lightman even uses the word ""life"" in the book since how do you define a random collection of atoms whose extinguishing means nothing as ""life""? What is consciousness? If I were to kill his daughter, why would that be wrong, I'm just scattering her atoms about the universe? The fact that his brain has evolved to find that idea repulsive is his own problem. Atoms have no ethics and it's silly to call things that are random ""evil."" For an MIT professor who also teaches philosophy he surprisingly doesn't raise the question. Odder still is that he later heralds natural selection and the ability of millions of cells to transmit information when reproducing without noting that some atheist biologists have concluded that this is impossible without some sort of guided process. How did the basic building blocks of life know that they needed to survive? These biologists have followed Lightman's logic to its conclusion, apparently unknown to Lightman himself, that we are the result of a completely random process.I have also read physicist Lee Smolin's The Trouble with Physics, critiquing string theory and modern physics in general. I highly recommend that book to anyone who thinks string theory is all that there is. There are alternative, testable theories out there. Which is another irony because Lightman writes that science ""must be verified and tested"" but doesn't apply this to either string theory or the multiverse. Stephen Hawking wrote in The Universe in a Nutshell that you would need a particle collider larger than the size of the universe to test some aspects of string theory. Yet Lightman hails theoretical physics as ""the purest form of science.""Cosmologist George Ellis was quoted recently in Scientific American criticizing physicists like Lightman and Lawrence Krauss who have moved away from physics and science to pure metaphysical hypotheses which are not testable.""Krauss does not explain in what way these entities could have pre-existed the coming into being of the universe, why they should have existed at all, or why they should have had the form they did. And he gives no experimental or observational process whereby we could test these vivid speculations of the supposed universe-generation mechanism. How indeed can you test what existed before the universe existed? You can’t.""Lightman's essays contradict themselves in this regard: he praises scientific measurement and cheering on the work of phsyics toward a complete set of the fundamental laws of our universe while earlier saying that if the multiverse is true them most of physics is ""useless"" as there is ""no point"" in explaining why things in our universe are the way they are-- it was just random. Other universes are flat, some are round, some are finite, some are infinite, some contain the null set, and in some universes every law that holds in ours doesn't hold, and vice-versa.Lightman contends that a God ""consistent with science"" can only exist outside the universe, never intervening in its immutable, unchangeable laws. This rules out anything miraculous, whether there is evidence or not to the contrary-- and he examines no evidence or testimony of the physically unexplainable. (I read Eric Metaxas' Miracles just prior to this book, the first bit of which argues philosophically against Lightman's conclusions.) God is the watchmaker who let the universe wind up, go and never intervenes, somehow can't intervene without the entire universe falling apart according to Lightman. Lightman rejects the ""immanentism"" of Spinoza and Einstein.The essays also contain brief explanations of the importance of symmetry and discovery of the Higgs-Boson. There is also some overview of philosophical history but nothing in-depth. As I wrote above, he ignores his own theory's implications for ethics and the problem of evil. He writes of how he had somehow a sort of mental connection with a bird once, yet seemingly forgets that this, like his daugher, was purely random and meaningless. He cites plenty of deist scientists along the way, and criticizes Lawrence Krauss for being critical of faith. He considers faith to be rational, and rightly notes many scientific, economic, and political achievements that have come forth from theists who felt their exploration of science was a way to understand better how God created things, wrong-headed though they were. But this again ignores the fact that it's hard to define what is ""ethical"" or an ""advancement"" when we're purely random and there are no consequences, ultimately, for our actions.He concludes the book with some futurist silliness that reminded me of Lightman's fellow multiverse proponent Brian Greene in The Hidden Reality where Greene writes that another plausible alternative to the multiverse is that nothing in our world is actually real, we could all be living in a simulated multiverse. A ""software glitch"" explains why we can't reconcile quantum mechanics and the standard model or discover all of the fundamental laws. We are just Sims in someone's video game, and those playing us are also likely Sims, who are being played by Sims and so on. Physics has truly set philosophy back millenia.As I wrote above, Lightman's work does a great job showing the logical conclusion of the multiverse in a succinct fashion. I recommend reading it for yourself, but only 3.5 stars because as another sympathetic reviewer writing for the left-leaning magazine Salon pointed out: ""Perhaps Lightman contradicts himself."""
87,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103275991-emilie-marshall,0,"Was inspired to pick up this book from some excerpts discussed by David Byrne in his Bicycle Diaries. Some intriguing ideas, as I usually find new curiosities in books about physics made digestible for the common folk such as myself. If I remember correctly there was much scrutiny of the idea that our brains are finite, and that something must always be lost in order to gain something else. I think... Here is the one and only quote I copied down during my reading:""Most of us will adapt to this new way of living the same way that the people of today have adapted to cell phones and Skype. It will be the natural and normal way of being in the world. But here and there, small pockets of people will rebel and establish protected communes, where the newer technologies are left at the front gate-- in the same way that some people today still send handwritten letters and take long walks without their cellphones. In such enclaves, people will feel that they are living a more immediate and authentic life, that they are more connected with themselves and their surroundings. And that will be partly true. Yet they will be also disconnected from the larger world just outside of their gate, invisible in their own way,"" -pg 145While this thought is certainly nothing new or terribly provoking, I think it's an important thought to remind oneself to remember. It's easily one of those things you store away in your ""things I am aware of"" closet where it collects dust and gets forgotten. So pull it off the shelf every once in a while and think about it again!! In my opinion it is a truth that will continue to morph in relevance at constant intervals in one's life."
88,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81065199-caleb,3,"While this book offers an exciting and poetic journey into some of the larger questions of life, existence and our universe, it is barely a scratch at the surface which poses more problems than it answers. Do not pick up this book expecting a scientifically rigorous look at cosmology or dimensionality, as I made the mistake of doing. You need nothing more than a basic understanding of physics and astronomy to grasp a lot of the concepts in this book. On one hand that is good because it makes it accessible to everyone and anyone who wants to get into this sort of philosophical questioning. On the other hand, it makes me wonder what, if anything, this book adds that hasn't already been said before in so many ways. The lyricism in this book is beautiful and enthralling. The way the words come together to form something cohesive is impressive with such disparate and far reaching ideas and anecdotes. I'm never sure where Lightman will take me until I've arrived there. From personal experiences in his own life to vast stretching quasars deep in the cosmos, he somehow relates those things which I thought unrelatable. In that way, I am impressed with his skillful writing and lucid imagery.I am, however, always left feeling as though I've missed something. Each essay reaches an altogether unsatisfying conclusion which I had hoped it would surpass. I wonder, what more is there to say about this topic? Perhaps that is Lightman's clever way of getting me to explore these ideas on my own. Yet, I wanted more than what I got. Something more deeply scientific, some theories about how and why, instead of questions that lead to no answers but instead to casual ""maybe""s and ""we don't know""s. Pick up this book for some poetic stellar imagination, but leave it on the shelf in favor of Hawking or Kaku if you want something that provokes your deeper scientific spirit. The short length and easy narrative makes this book a great starting point for anyone new to physics, philosophy and cosmology. "

This is the exact kind of thing I like to read: not pure science, but a way to think about science. Writing about science that is beautiful and thought-provoking, even inspiring, is rare (Carl Sagan was the very best at this, in my opinion). This book hits all the right notes.The author is a physicist and a fiction writer, so he manages to write about the universe with deep, satisfying prose. In seven short chapters, Mr. Lightman manages to cover the weirdness of the universe, the lawfulness of the universe, the spiritual depth of the universe, and the way that our observation of the universe is entirely dependent on the observers. I am not doing it justice by trying to describe the depth of this man's insights. They are profound.Why is there so much symmetry in the universe? Is there really a multiverse? Why does everything change, and decay? What is consciousness? What is relationship between experiences of transcendence and religion? As I read, I found that both my humanist and pantheist leanings were being highly stimulated. My take away from this book is an astonishing sense of wonder, and reverence. That I am here at all, on this planet, and conscious, is a miracle. My existence, my ability to reason, to observe, and to ponder, is...sacred. Numinous indeed. Literally my favorite kind of writing.

91,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45699572-nadisha,3,"It's clear Alan Lightman is enthralled by what he had discovered in his work as physicist and professor, and that enthusiasm seeps off each page of this book. He constantly illuminates his readers to the wonders of the universe by simplistically explaining complex scientific systems/theories and threading the with psychological and sociological theories on how mankind is and has to deal with these truths. It's a fascinating collection of questions and wonderings, but that was the extent to which I felt engaged. Lightman presents some interesting insight on mankind's need for structure, the laws of nature, and a dimming of the ""vitality of the visible"" realm...but it was nothing monumental. Rather, it felt like general psychological deductions, and the book echoed nothing more, to me, than an effort to get Lightman's readers to awe at the universe and question it as he has. That's not to say he didn't craft beautiful connections between philosophy, literature, science, and religion, but the beauty lay more in the idea of their interconnectedness rather than in the points he was trying to make. If someone were unfamiliar with the scientific truths about the physical universe that Lightman points out, then I can see reading this novel as an enlightening and illuminating experience. However, I already spent a brief portion of my life fascinated by these truths, and though I continue to be dazzled and perplexed by exactly what Lightman illustrates, I hoped to read this and come away with a new fascination to chew on, and that did not occur. Therefore, as an introductory reading (and given the second half of the title, I can't help but assume such was purposed), this is an excellent choice for readers of any age and level of experience in the fields of math/science or the humanities. It'll open your eyes to our broken, self-made realities in order to reveal the startling and nonsensical possibilities of the universe and hopefully motivate you to look at the world through a completely different lens.

92,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22117564-douglas-lord,5,"Lightman, a physics professor at MIT, has a brain roughly twice the size of an average person’s; fortunately for humankind, he has sworn to only use his powers for good. He starts this fantastic collection of previously published essays by relating how he met the Dalai Lama at MIT, and it’s exactly this kind of cross-pollinating of the spiritual world with the scientific one that exemplifies this title. “Science,” he writes, “does not reveal the meaning of our existence, but it does draw back some veils.” Much veil-pulling ensues, and like über-dude Isaac Asimov, the good professor focuses on explaining/exploring various topics within cosmology and physics, like dark energy. Mind-boggling facts appear; “If the theoretically possible values for dark energy were marked on a ruler stretching from here to the sun, the value of dark energy actually found in our universe … (10 -8 ergs per cubic centimeter) would be closer to the zero end than the width of an atom.” This title will infuriate intelligent design advocates, for Lightman holds, per the title, that “we are an accident.” And yet the writing is a real and searching investigation at the crux of science and faith. Where else might you read the spiritual version of the second law of thermodynamics—the “arrow of time”—explicated in a way that includes toupees and Botox? VERDICT Part philosophy, part science, this little book is a big fat pleasure to read.

I stopped after the Prologue and a few pages of the first chapter. I just couldn't.This book, instead of trying to tackle microcosms of ""What Is Science?"", goes straight after our own existence, and how our uncertainties of the past turned to certainties only lead to more uncertainties today.Lightman has a wonderful knack for relating the unfathomable and wholly abstract--the size of our universe, the nature of quantum mechanics, unending entropy--to the fathomable yet wholly abstract in our lives--that tiny feeling near the ocean, love, pondering non-existence.In a sense, he does what Canon attempts. He dives deep into one realm of our existence that defines everything else in our existence: what is our universe and what is our consciousness, but together, in their whole tangled mess.His conclusion is a bit too much of a concrete cop-out rant on electronics and being present. I believe his real conclusion is that we know what we know, much abstractly, but furthermore that whatever is outside of our observable universe--literally the space beyond the distance that light could have travelled in the universe's existence--is unknowable. For now, at least.Also, his writing is superb.Read it.Tossing it on the Religion shelf because he deals with religion quite a bit."

This is balanced by Lightman's reflections on human nature, our mutual condition, and our place in a vast cosmos beyond our reach. This creates an interesting tension that runs throughout the collection, beginning right at the beginning in the titular essay. Lightman starts with that: ""The history of science can, in fact, be viewed as the recasting of phenomena that were once accepted as 'givens' as phenomena that can now be understood in terms of fundamental causes and principles."" Science peels away layers that obscure the truth at the heart of our universe. However, after centuries of constant triumph, scientists have run into a brick wall. For every new discovery, new questions arise that science may not also be able to answer. After affirming what science has done, he pulls away the table cloth: ""According to the current thinking of many physicists, we are living in one of a vast number of universes.

The last essay in particular, ""The Disembodied Universe,"" veers off into a weird anti-technological rant about how kids these days just Instagram pictures of nature instead of just being in the moment, or something (although I admit the story he recounts about one of his adult daughter's friends playing a song on her iPhone during a dinner he took them out too seemed pretty rude).

It was a further explanation of the state of Physics, written in a very accessible way. I understood almost all of it. There was only one concept that left me scratching my head; I just couldn't quite get it.I like how this author, an atheist, nevertheless treats the Christian point of view with respect, and concedes that Science will never tell us Why, only What and How, and the why, along with the moral uses of science, lies with other ways of knowing, such as religious faith.

What does it mean that our idea of how big the universe is keeps expanding, what does it mean that we interact with these forces through technology as our senses are no longer able to perceive without assistance the newest findings.

Sometimes books meet you right where you are and you have, basically, a perfect date with a book. I just had a great, great date with this book. It's brief - <200 pages, or only a couple audiobook commutes. I want to read it again! And everything else by Lightman! Fun fact, but I've had him on my TO-READ list since TWO THOUSAND SIX. 11 years!!!Anyway, this book is kinda similar to Carlo Rovelli's Sette brevi lezioni di fisica (Seven brief lessons in physics), in that it's short, dense, deep, and loving. Very heartening! It's a collection of essays/meditations on cutting edge physics and its intersections with philosophy, cosmic mysteries. There's one essay on how screens mediate our reality too much, with a shout out to Sherry Turkle, and a general sense of aaaaAAAAAAAHHHHHH and our post-human future.So, like Rovelli's book, this covers the cosmic weirdnesses of modern physics - specifically, the multiverse, quantum mechanics, and the time-bendy wavey nature of things very very very great or very very very small. We dwell on why there is anything, and Lightman kinda shook my foundations a little bit by answering it in the usual ways: the multiverse (i.e. this highly improbable, intelligent life-sustaining universe exists because every other possible universe also exists) or, gah, GOD. Theism has all of zero social prestige in my liberal/secular circles, and so I found Lightman's (who notes he is an atheist) discussion of how cosmically improbable a medium zone planet being birthed from a Big Bang with perfectly calibrated levels of hydrogen, ergo First Mover, spooky and disquieting. I mean, when the choice is inscrutable First Mover vs. multiverse, BOTH ARE VERY STRANGE CHOICES. People, it's this or this!? Lightman also sticks it to Dawkins, which was satisfying (Lord, grant me the patience to tolerate Richard frickin Dawkins), and his whole social, professional and spiritual life is centralized around MIT, which was ALSO very satisfying. (Glory, glory be to MIT!) But those two bits are just icing on the cake.Wonderfully written, inspiring, and YES WE SPEND TOO MUCH TIME IN OUR SCREENS. Even though Lightman sounds like a 60+ curmudgeon when he complains about young people ""emailing their Facebooks"" with pictures of nature walks (thus defeating the purpose of the nature walk), I did - basically - 200% AGREE. YA DAMN KIDS WITH YER DAMN BOOK OF FACE!Strongly recommended. Do not wait 11 years to read this."
116,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27614432-justin-tapp,3,"I have read several of Brian Greene's and Stephen Hawking's books detailing the history of modern physics, string theory in its various iterations, and the theoretical possibilities of a multiverse. Lightman does a much better job summing up the philosophical implications of theoretical physics in very stark form. He is also much more transparent about the fact that there are Nobel prize-winning physicists who don't buy the multiverse theory and believe in a Creator and an intelligence behind the design of our universe rather than a theoretically infinite number of universes created by no intelligence. Lightman admits the ""fine-tuning"" of the cosmological constants necessary for our universe to be the way it is are astronomically improbable. While charitable to his colleagues who believe in a higher power, Lightman disagrees with them. In Lightman's view, we are simply a random collection of molecules put together by chance. ""We are an accident,"" he states, a mathematical improbability in our own universe -- ""one millionth of one billionth of a percent in our universe is life"" -- but when the denominator is infinity (the infinite multiverse) improbable is relative. ""Science can never know how universe was created,"" yet he's certain how it was not created.He details early in the book what this means for humans. He loves his daughter, feels attached to her, cares for her. But then he remembers that she's just a random collection of atoms and, like his own atoms, will one day be nothing more than scattered into the universe. He admits this is hard to wrap his mind around, his mind longs for eternity and he is ""self-delusional"" in his longing for immortality. But since everything in the universe decays or dies and the law of entropy says that everything moves from order to disorder there can be nothing more than this. Life is therefore meaningless, absurd. Not since Hawking wrote in Black Holes and Baby Universes that we have two options: God, or grand unifying theory that explains everything from the Big Bang to why I ate a salad for lunch. Hawking rejected the former and later recanted on the GUT (which was supposed to bridge quantum mechanics with the standard model), basically the multiverse via string theory has replaced his GUT. Meaning, again, that both the big bang and my salad were random and need no explanation.It's odd that Lightman even uses the word ""life"" in the book since how do you define a random collection of atoms whose extinguishing means nothing as ""life""? What is consciousness? If I were to kill his daughter, why would that be wrong, I'm just scattering her atoms about the universe? The fact that his brain has evolved to find that idea repulsive is his own problem. Atoms have no ethics and it's silly to call things that are random ""evil."" For an MIT professor who also teaches philosophy he surprisingly doesn't raise the question. Odder still is that he later heralds natural selection and the ability of millions of cells to transmit information when reproducing without noting that some atheist biologists have concluded that this is impossible without some sort of guided process. How did the basic building blocks of life know that they needed to survive? These biologists have followed Lightman's logic to its conclusion, apparently unknown to Lightman himself, that we are the result of a completely random process.I have also read physicist Lee Smolin's The Trouble with Physics, critiquing string theory and modern physics in general. I highly recommend that book to anyone who thinks string theory is all that there is. There are alternative, testable theories out there. Which is another irony because Lightman writes that science ""must be verified and tested"" but doesn't apply this to either string theory or the multiverse. Stephen Hawking wrote in The Universe in a Nutshell that you would need a particle collider larger than the size of the universe to test some aspects of string theory. Yet Lightman hails theoretical physics as ""the purest form of science.""Cosmologist George Ellis was quoted recently in Scientific American criticizing physicists like Lightman and Lawrence Krauss who have moved away from physics and science to pure metaphysical hypotheses which are not testable.""Krauss does not explain in what way these entities could have pre-existed the coming into being of the universe, why they should have existed at all, or why they should have had the form they did. And he gives no experimental or observational process whereby we could test these vivid speculations of the supposed universe-generation mechanism. How indeed can you test what existed before the universe existed? You can’t.""Lightman's essays contradict themselves in this regard: he praises scientific measurement and cheering on the work of phsyics toward a complete set of the fundamental laws of our universe while earlier saying that if the multiverse is true them most of physics is ""useless"" as there is ""no point"" in explaining why things in our universe are the way they are-- it was just random. Other universes are flat, some are round, some are finite, some are infinite, some contain the null set, and in some universes every law that holds in ours doesn't hold, and vice-versa.Lightman contends that a God ""consistent with science"" can only exist outside the universe, never intervening in its immutable, unchangeable laws. This rules out anything miraculous, whether there is evidence or not to the contrary-- and he examines no evidence or testimony of the physically unexplainable. (I read Eric Metaxas' Miracles just prior to this book, the first bit of which argues philosophically against Lightman's conclusions.) God is the watchmaker who let the universe wind up, go and never intervenes, somehow can't intervene without the entire universe falling apart according to Lightman. Lightman rejects the ""immanentism"" of Spinoza and Einstein.The essays also contain brief explanations of the importance of symmetry and discovery of the Higgs-Boson. There is also some overview of philosophical history but nothing in-depth. As I wrote above, he ignores his own theory's implications for ethics and the problem of evil. He writes of how he had somehow a sort of mental connection with a bird once, yet seemingly forgets that this, like his daugher, was purely random and meaningless. He cites plenty of deist scientists along the way, and criticizes Lawrence Krauss for being critical of faith. He considers faith to be rational, and rightly notes many scientific, economic, and political achievements that have come forth from theists who felt their exploration of science was a way to understand better how God created things, wrong-headed though they were. But this again ignores the fact that it's hard to define what is ""ethical"" or an ""advancement"" when we're purely random and there are no consequences, ultimately, for our actions.He concludes the book with some futurist silliness that reminded me of Lightman's fellow multiverse proponent Brian Greene in The Hidden Reality where Greene writes that another plausible alternative to the multiverse is that nothing in our world is actually real, we could all be living in a simulated multiverse. A ""software glitch"" explains why we can't reconcile quantum mechanics and the standard model or discover all of the fundamental laws. We are just Sims in someone's video game, and those playing us are also likely Sims, who are being played by Sims and so on. Physics has truly set philosophy back millenia.As I wrote above, Lightman's work does a great job showing the logical conclusion of the multiverse in a succinct fashion. I recommend reading it for yourself, but only 3.5 stars because as another sympathetic reviewer writing for the left-leaning magazine Salon pointed out: ""Perhaps Lightman contradicts himself."""
117,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103275991-emilie-marshall,0,"Was inspired to pick up this book from some excerpts discussed by David Byrne in his Bicycle Diaries. Some intriguing ideas, as I usually find new curiosities in books about physics made digestible for the common folk such as myself. If I remember correctly there was much scrutiny of the idea that our brains are finite, and that something must always be lost in order to gain something else. I think... Here is the one and only quote I copied down during my reading:""Most of us will adapt to this new way of living the same way that the people of today have adapted to cell phones and Skype. It will be the natural and normal way of being in the world. But here and there, small pockets of people will rebel and establish protected communes, where the newer technologies are left at the front gate-- in the same way that some people today still send handwritten letters and take long walks without their cellphones. In such enclaves, people will feel that they are living a more immediate and authentic life, that they are more connected with themselves and their surroundings. And that will be partly true. Yet they will be also disconnected from the larger world just outside of their gate, invisible in their own way,"" -pg 145While this thought is certainly nothing new or terribly provoking, I think it's an important thought to remind oneself to remember. It's easily one of those things you store away in your ""things I am aware of"" closet where it collects dust and gets forgotten. So pull it off the shelf every once in a while and think about it again!! In my opinion it is a truth that will continue to morph in relevance at constant intervals in one's life."
118,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81065199-caleb,3,"While this book offers an exciting and poetic journey into some of the larger questions of life, existence and our universe, it is barely a scratch at the surface which poses more problems than it answers. Do not pick up this book expecting a scientifically rigorous look at cosmology or dimensionality, as I made the mistake of doing. You need nothing more than a basic understanding of physics and astronomy to grasp a lot of the concepts in this book. On one hand that is good because it makes it accessible to everyone and anyone who wants to get into this sort of philosophical questioning. On the other hand, it makes me wonder what, if anything, this book adds that hasn't already been said before in so many ways. The lyricism in this book is beautiful and enthralling. The way the words come together to form something cohesive is impressive with such disparate and far reaching ideas and anecdotes. I'm never sure where Lightman will take me until I've arrived there. From personal experiences in his own life to vast stretching quasars deep in the cosmos, he somehow relates those things which I thought unrelatable. In that way, I am impressed with his skillful writing and lucid imagery.I am, however, always left feeling as though I've missed something. Each essay reaches an altogether unsatisfying conclusion which I had hoped it would surpass. I wonder, what more is there to say about this topic? Perhaps that is Lightman's clever way of getting me to explore these ideas on my own. Yet, I wanted more than what I got. Something more deeply scientific, some theories about how and why, instead of questions that lead to no answers but instead to casual ""maybe""s and ""we don't know""s. Pick up this book for some poetic stellar imagination, but leave it on the shelf in favor of Hawking or Kaku if you want something that provokes your deeper scientific spirit. The short length and easy narrative makes this book a great starting point for anyone new to physics, philosophy and cosmology. "
119,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3506592-michael,5,"Marvelous book about science, and wonder. This is the exact kind of thing I like to read: not pure science, but a way to think about science. Writing about science that is beautiful and thought-provoking, even inspiring, is rare (Carl Sagan was the very best at this, in my opinion). This book hits all the right notes.The author is a physicist and a fiction writer, so he manages to write about the universe with deep, satisfying prose. In seven short chapters, Mr. Lightman manages to cover the weirdness of the universe, the lawfulness of the universe, the spiritual depth of the universe, and the way that our observation of the universe is entirely dependent on the observers. I am not doing it justice by trying to describe the depth of this man's insights. They are profound.Why is there so much symmetry in the universe? Is there really a multiverse? Why does everything change, and decay? What is consciousness? What is relationship between experiences of transcendence and religion? As I read, I found that both my humanist and pantheist leanings were being highly stimulated. My take away from this book is an astonishing sense of wonder, and reverence. That I am here at all, on this planet, and conscious, is a miracle. My existence, my ability to reason, to observe, and to ponder, is...sacred. Numinous indeed. Literally my favorite kind of writing.

121,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45699572-nadisha,3,"It's clear Alan Lightman is enthralled by what he had discovered in his work as physicist and professor, and that enthusiasm seeps off each page of this book. He constantly illuminates his readers to the wonders of the universe by simplistically explaining complex scientific systems/theories and threading the with psychological and sociological theories on how mankind is and has to deal with these truths. It's a fascinating collection of questions and wonderings, but that was the extent to which I felt engaged. Lightman presents some interesting insight on mankind's need for structure, the laws of nature, and a dimming of the ""vitality of the visible"" realm...but it was nothing monumental. Rather, it felt like general psychological deductions, and the book echoed nothing more, to me, than an effort to get Lightman's readers to awe at the universe and question it as he has. That's not to say he didn't craft beautiful connections between philosophy, literature, science, and religion, but the beauty lay more in the idea of their interconnectedness rather than in the points he was trying to make. If someone were unfamiliar with the scientific truths about the physical universe that Lightman points out, then I can see reading this novel as an enlightening and illuminating experience. However, I already spent a brief portion of my life fascinated by these truths, and though I continue to be dazzled and perplexed by exactly what Lightman illustrates, I hoped to read this and come away with a new fascination to chew on, and that did not occur. Therefore, as an introductory reading (and given the second half of the title, I can't help but assume such was purposed), this is an excellent choice for readers of any age and level of experience in the fields of math/science or the humanities. It'll open your eyes to our broken, self-made realities in order to reveal the startling and nonsensical possibilities of the universe and hopefully motivate you to look at the world through a completely different lens. "
122,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22117564-douglas-lord,5,"Lightman, a physics professor at MIT, has a brain roughly twice the size of an average person’s; fortunately for humankind, he has sworn to only use his powers for good. He starts this fantastic collection of previously published essays by relating how he met the Dalai Lama at MIT, and it’s exactly this kind of cross-pollinating of the spiritual world with the scientific one that exemplifies this title. “Science,” he writes, “does not reveal the meaning of our existence, but it does draw back some veils.” Much veil-pulling ensues, and like über-dude Isaac Asimov, the good professor focuses on explaining/exploring various topics within cosmology and physics, like dark energy. Mind-boggling facts appear; “If the theoretically possible values for dark energy were marked on a ruler stretching from here to the sun, the value of dark energy actually found in our universe … (10 -8 ergs per cubic centimeter) would be closer to the zero end than the width of an atom.” This title will infuriate intelligent design advocates, for Lightman holds, per the title, that “we are an accident.” And yet the writing is a real and searching investigation at the crux of science and faith. Where else might you read the spiritual version of the second law of thermodynamics—the “arrow of time”—explicated in a way that includes toupees and Botox? VERDICT Part philosophy, part science, this little book is a big fat pleasure to read. Carefully chosen words are always wonderful, and these have the bonus of embiggening your brain.Find this review and others at Books for Dudes, the online reader's advisory column for men from Library Journal: see http://reviews.libraryjournal.com/cat....

123,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9323532-johnny,4,"Great, awesome, light science book for everyone who likes science but didn't really get past the 101 classes.I started reading Canon, which people love, and I found it preachy and frantic. I stopped after the Prologue and a few pages of the first chapter. I just couldn't.This book, instead of trying to tackle microcosms of ""What Is Science?"", goes straight after our own existence, and how our uncertainties of the past turned to certainties only lead to more uncertainties today.Lightman has a wonderful knack for relating the unfathomable and wholly abstract--the size of our universe, the nature of quantum mechanics, unending entropy--to the fathomable yet wholly abstract in our lives--that tiny feeling near the ocean, love, pondering non-existence.In a sense, he does what Canon attempts. He dives deep into one realm of our existence that defines everything else in our existence: what is our universe and what is our consciousness, but together, in their whole tangled mess.His conclusion is a bit too much of a concrete cop-out rant on electronics and being present. I believe his real conclusion is that we know what we know, much abstractly, but furthermore that whatever is outside of our observable universe--literally the space beyond the distance that light could have travelled in the universe's existence--is unknowable. For now, at least.Also, his writing is superb.Read it.Tossing it on the Religion shelf because he deals with religion quite a bit."
124,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,0,"Description:  Comprised of a number of essays, The Accidental Universe documents recent discoveries about our universe, the quest for a complete Standard Model of physics to explain, literally, everything, and the recently uncovered Higgs boson, the so-called ""God particle"" that grants subatomic particles their mass. This is balanced by Lightman's reflections on human nature, our mutual condition, and our place in a vast cosmos beyond our reach. This creates an interesting tension that runs throughout the collection, beginning right at the beginning in the titular essay. Lightman starts with that: ""The history of science can, in fact, be viewed as the recasting of phenomena that were once accepted as 'givens' as phenomena that can now be understood in terms of fundamental causes and principles."" Science peels away layers that obscure the truth at the heart of our universe. However, after centuries of constant triumph, scientists have run into a brick wall. For every new discovery, new questions arise that science may not also be able to answer. After affirming what science has done, he pulls away the table cloth: ""According to the current thinking of many physicists, we are living in one of a vast number of universes. We are living in an accidental universe. We are living in a universe incalculable by science."""
125,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4485647-joni-baboci,5,"A short yet complex and absorbing account of the universe we live in. The author creates a simplistic and highly readable account of modern physics using clear comparisons in creating a perfect frame of reference for people having their first bout with quantum physics, time dilation and the edge of the observable universe.Lightman covers a number of important topics starting with entropy, the finite universe, the spiritual and religious aspect of humanity, symmetry as both innate to the rules of the universe and a consequence of evolution, the unfathomable macro size of space and micro size of the atom, the universal rules that run our universe and finally the impossibility of currently understanding and personally witnessing what we postulate and accept as the scientific truth; and yet our innate ability to adapt and rationalize the possibility of disembodied experiences. A fast and thrilling trip through 13.8 billion years of mostly invisible history."
126,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12273050-joshua,2,"Advertised as an exploration of scientific and religious/humanist compatibility, this book does a lot of hand-waving and false equivalence to argue for ultimate compatibility. That being said, the book is well-written, and makes good ancillary points about the limits of scientific and religious understanding.I wasn't sold on the book's structure, a series of seven essays all of the form ""The [adjective] Universe."" The last essay in particular, ""The Disembodied Universe,"" veers off into a weird anti-technological rant about how kids these days just Instagram pictures of nature instead of just being in the moment, or something (although I admit the story he recounts about one of his adult daughter's friends playing a song on her iPhone during a dinner he took them out too seemed pretty rude). All in all, it's clear that I am not the intended audience for this book, so that probably explains the low rating."
127,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/994755-kathryn-bashaar,4,"Reading the last couple of chapters of The Passion of the Western Mind got me interested in the newest ideas in Physics, and then I just happened upon this book in the library. It was a further explanation of the state of Physics, written in a very accessible way. I understood almost all of it. There was only one concept that left me scratching my head; I just couldn't quite get it.I like how this author, an atheist, nevertheless treats the Christian point of view with respect, and concedes that Science will never tell us Why, only What and How, and the why, along with the moral uses of science, lies with other ways of knowing, such as religious faith. (Similarly, I will only read Christian non-fiction if it shows respect for the FACTS that the earth is 14 billion years old, and we are evolved from earlier creatures). "

I thought the essays were all insightful and informative, and the content was fascinating to me. The multiverse theory is something that I want to do a lot more research on now that I've read this book.My favorite essays of the book were ""Accidental Universe"" and ""Spiritual Universe."" Both essays floored me, and it really made me reflect on my own place in this vast universe. I also liked the rest of the essays too. ""Symmetrical Universe"" was probably my least favorite, it didn't really grip me as much as the other essays.All in all, this was a very enjoyable read. If you love science and philosophy, or if you just want a book to make you think, this book is for you. Check it out, you'll have a good time with it!"

If you want to read a non-didactic discussion of the intersections of science, religion, and the humanities, you will not. I especially enjoyed the explanation of the lack of religious faith in most scientists along with respect for the ardent belief of some.The breadth of Lightman's knowledge is astounding--my brain wants to marry his brain; his ability to write clearly, sometimes lyrically is, too.

If you are curious about science and enjoy philosophical discussions about science than run to get this book. Alan Lightman makes reading about some of the advances in science easy and illuminating, not just stating how they came about, but what it means to each of us as human beings. What does it mean that our idea of how big the universe is keeps expanding, what does it mean that we interact with these forces through technology as our senses are no longer able to perceive without assistance the newest findings. These ideas and more are looked at with a seeking eye, and one able to argue against his own thoughts. Read if you enjoy science, philosophy, and history of the two. You won't be sorry."

He has a light touch. These are not the discourses of an MIT professor (although Lightman is one). They are the musings of a smart, engaged, informed humanist. Individually, the essays are a bit slight, and the book itself is a trim little document. But it all moves so quickly and even joyfully that the slightness becomes a part of its charm. By the end, you're wondering how he manages to pack so much into a set of essays that resemble extended blog posts. Lightman would be a terrific blogger."

Lightman explains concepts (like string theory and dark matter) in a way the layperson can at least get a gist of, if not a strong understanding, but it is not really a book about science as much as how technology itself is as much a part of the human experience as art, philosophy or religion. Highly enjoyable, it is inspiring me to learn more about the dark areas of my knowledge of the world. "
133,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5702557-n,3,"This is not a formulae-drenched textbook meant to bolster one's physics nerd cred. It's an essay collection that references physics old and new to explore what's on Alan Lightman's mind--forms of knowledge, questions of faith, the effects of technology on contemporary life. It's what happens when a theoretical physicist takes the Montaignian approach to writing, using it to compare, deduce, wander, and complicate in a manner that's personal, yet accessible to readers. It has not profoundly altered my life (a tall order for any book), but it has added to the ever-present chorus in my head another voice that will feed the music."

145,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4061006-angela,5,"A brief, beautiful book - ho man, it hit me right here, right in the heart. And the brain. Lovely. Sometimes books meet you right where you are and you have, basically, a perfect date with a book. I just had a great, great date with this book. It's brief - <200 pages, or only a couple audiobook commutes. I want to read it again! And everything else by Lightman! Fun fact, but I've had him on my TO-READ list since TWO THOUSAND SIX. 11 years!!!Anyway, this book is kinda similar to Carlo Rovelli's Sette brevi lezioni di fisica (Seven brief lessons in physics), in that it's short, dense, deep, and loving. Very heartening! It's a collection of essays/meditations on cutting edge physics and its intersections with philosophy, cosmic mysteries. There's one essay on how screens mediate our reality too much, with a shout out to Sherry Turkle, and a general sense of aaaaAAAAAAAHHHHHH and our post-human future.So, like Rovelli's book, this covers the cosmic weirdnesses of modern physics - specifically, the multiverse, quantum mechanics, and the time-bendy wavey nature of things very very very great or very very very small. We dwell on why there is anything, and Lightman kinda shook my foundations a little bit by answering it in the usual ways: the multiverse (i.e. this highly improbable, intelligent life-sustaining universe exists because every other possible universe also exists) or, gah, GOD. Theism has all of zero social prestige in my liberal/secular circles, and so I found Lightman's (who notes he is an atheist) discussion of how cosmically improbable a medium zone planet being birthed from a Big Bang with perfectly calibrated levels of hydrogen, ergo First Mover, spooky and disquieting. I mean, when the choice is inscrutable First Mover vs. multiverse, BOTH ARE VERY STRANGE CHOICES. People, it's this or this!? Lightman also sticks it to Dawkins, which was satisfying (Lord, grant me the patience to tolerate Richard frickin Dawkins), and his whole social, professional and spiritual life is centralized around MIT, which was ALSO very satisfying. (Glory, glory be to MIT!) But those two bits are just icing on the cake.Wonderfully written, inspiring, and YES WE SPEND TOO MUCH TIME IN OUR SCREENS. Even though Lightman sounds like a 60+ curmudgeon when he complains about young people ""emailing their Facebooks"" with pictures of nature walks (thus defeating the purpose of the nature walk), I did - basically - 200% AGREE. YA DAMN KIDS WITH YER DAMN BOOK OF FACE!Strongly recommended. Do not wait 11 years to read this."
146,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27614432-justin-tapp,3,"I have read several of Brian Greene's and Stephen Hawking's books detailing the history of modern physics, string theory in its various iterations, and the theoretical possibilities of a multiverse. Lightman does a much better job summing up the philosophical implications of theoretical physics in very stark form. He is also much more transparent about the fact that there are Nobel prize-winning physicists who don't buy the multiverse theory and believe in a Creator and an intelligence behind the design of our universe rather than a theoretically infinite number of universes created by no intelligence. Lightman admits the ""fine-tuning"" of the cosmological constants necessary for our universe to be the way it is are astronomically improbable. While charitable to his colleagues who believe in a higher power, Lightman disagrees with them. In Lightman's view, we are simply a random collection of molecules put together by chance. ""We are an accident,"" he states, a mathematical improbability in our own universe -- ""one millionth of one billionth of a percent in our universe is life"" -- but when the denominator is infinity (the infinite multiverse) improbable is relative. ""Science can never know how universe was created,"" yet he's certain how it was not created.He details early in the book what this means for humans. He loves his daughter, feels attached to her, cares for her. But then he remembers that she's just a random collection of atoms and, like his own atoms, will one day be nothing more than scattered into the universe. He admits this is hard to wrap his mind around, his mind longs for eternity and he is ""self-delusional"" in his longing for immortality. But since everything in the universe decays or dies and the law of entropy says that everything moves from order to disorder there can be nothing more than this. Life is therefore meaningless, absurd. Not since Hawking wrote in Black Holes and Baby Universes that we have two options: God, or grand unifying theory that explains everything from the Big Bang to why I ate a salad for lunch. Hawking rejected the former and later recanted on the GUT (which was supposed to bridge quantum mechanics with the standard model), basically the multiverse via string theory has replaced his GUT. Meaning, again, that both the big bang and my salad were random and need no explanation.It's odd that Lightman even uses the word ""life"" in the book since how do you define a random collection of atoms whose extinguishing means nothing as ""life""? What is consciousness? If I were to kill his daughter, why would that be wrong, I'm just scattering her atoms about the universe? The fact that his brain has evolved to find that idea repulsive is his own problem. Atoms have no ethics and it's silly to call things that are random ""evil."" For an MIT professor who also teaches philosophy he surprisingly doesn't raise the question. Odder still is that he later heralds natural selection and the ability of millions of cells to transmit information when reproducing without noting that some atheist biologists have concluded that this is impossible without some sort of guided process. How did the basic building blocks of life know that they needed to survive? These biologists have followed Lightman's logic to its conclusion, apparently unknown to Lightman himself, that we are the result of a completely random process.I have also read physicist Lee Smolin's The Trouble with Physics, critiquing string theory and modern physics in general. I highly recommend that book to anyone who thinks string theory is all that there is. There are alternative, testable theories out there. Which is another irony because Lightman writes that science ""must be verified and tested"" but doesn't apply this to either string theory or the multiverse. Stephen Hawking wrote in The Universe in a Nutshell that you would need a particle collider larger than the size of the universe to test some aspects of string theory. Yet Lightman hails theoretical physics as ""the purest form of science.""Cosmologist George Ellis was quoted recently in Scientific American criticizing physicists like Lightman and Lawrence Krauss who have moved away from physics and science to pure metaphysical hypotheses which are not testable.""Krauss does not explain in what way these entities could have pre-existed the coming into being of the universe, why they should have existed at all, or why they should have had the form they did. And he gives no experimental or observational process whereby we could test these vivid speculations of the supposed universe-generation mechanism. How indeed can you test what existed before the universe existed? You can’t.""Lightman's essays contradict themselves in this regard: he praises scientific measurement and cheering on the work of phsyics toward a complete set of the fundamental laws of our universe while earlier saying that if the multiverse is true them most of physics is ""useless"" as there is ""no point"" in explaining why things in our universe are the way they are-- it was just random. Other universes are flat, some are round, some are finite, some are infinite, some contain the null set, and in some universes every law that holds in ours doesn't hold, and vice-versa.Lightman contends that a God ""consistent with science"" can only exist outside the universe, never intervening in its immutable, unchangeable laws. This rules out anything miraculous, whether there is evidence or not to the contrary-- and he examines no evidence or testimony of the physically unexplainable. (I read Eric Metaxas' Miracles just prior to this book, the first bit of which argues philosophically against Lightman's conclusions.) God is the watchmaker who let the universe wind up, go and never intervenes, somehow can't intervene without the entire universe falling apart according to Lightman. Lightman rejects the ""immanentism"" of Spinoza and Einstein.The essays also contain brief explanations of the importance of symmetry and discovery of the Higgs-Boson. There is also some overview of philosophical history but nothing in-depth. As I wrote above, he ignores his own theory's implications for ethics and the problem of evil. He writes of how he had somehow a sort of mental connection with a bird once, yet seemingly forgets that this, like his daugher, was purely random and meaningless. He cites plenty of deist scientists along the way, and criticizes Lawrence Krauss for being critical of faith. He considers faith to be rational, and rightly notes many scientific, economic, and political achievements that have come forth from theists who felt their exploration of science was a way to understand better how God created things, wrong-headed though they were. But this again ignores the fact that it's hard to define what is ""ethical"" or an ""advancement"" when we're purely random and there are no consequences, ultimately, for our actions.He concludes the book with some futurist silliness that reminded me of Lightman's fellow multiverse proponent Brian Greene in The Hidden Reality where Greene writes that another plausible alternative to the multiverse is that nothing in our world is actually real, we could all be living in a simulated multiverse. A ""software glitch"" explains why we can't reconcile quantum mechanics and the standard model or discover all of the fundamental laws. We are just Sims in someone's video game, and those playing us are also likely Sims, who are being played by Sims and so on. Physics has truly set philosophy back millenia.As I wrote above, Lightman's work does a great job showing the logical conclusion of the multiverse in a succinct fashion. I recommend reading it for yourself, but only 3.5 stars because as another sympathetic reviewer writing for the left-leaning magazine Salon pointed out: ""Perhaps Lightman contradicts himself."""
147,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103275991-emilie-marshall,0,"Was inspired to pick up this book from some excerpts discussed by David Byrne in his Bicycle Diaries. Some intriguing ideas, as I usually find new curiosities in books about physics made digestible for the common folk such as myself. If I remember correctly there was much scrutiny of the idea that our brains are finite, and that something must always be lost in order to gain something else. I think... Here is the one and only quote I copied down during my reading:""Most of us will adapt to this new way of living the same way that the people of today have adapted to cell phones and Skype. It will be the natural and normal way of being in the world. But here and there, small pockets of people will rebel and establish protected communes, where the newer technologies are left at the front gate-- in the same way that some people today still send handwritten letters and take long walks without their cellphones. In such enclaves, people will feel that they are living a more immediate and authentic life, that they are more connected with themselves and their surroundings. And that will be partly true. Yet they will be also disconnected from the larger world just outside of their gate, invisible in their own way,"" -pg 145While this thought is certainly nothing new or terribly provoking, I think it's an important thought to remind oneself to remember. It's easily one of those things you store away in your ""things I am aware of"" closet where it collects dust and gets forgotten. So pull it off the shelf every once in a while and think about it again!! In my opinion it is a truth that will continue to morph in relevance at constant intervals in one's life."
148,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81065199-caleb,3,"While this book offers an exciting and poetic journey into some of the larger questions of life, existence and our universe, it is barely a scratch at the surface which poses more problems than it answers. Do not pick up this book expecting a scientifically rigorous look at cosmology or dimensionality, as I made the mistake of doing. You need nothing more than a basic understanding of physics and astronomy to grasp a lot of the concepts in this book. On one hand that is good because it makes it accessible to everyone and anyone who wants to get into this sort of philosophical questioning. On the other hand, it makes me wonder what, if anything, this book adds that hasn't already been said before in so many ways. The lyricism in this book is beautiful and enthralling. The way the words come together to form something cohesive is impressive with such disparate and far reaching ideas and anecdotes. I'm never sure where Lightman will take me until I've arrived there. From personal experiences in his own life to vast stretching quasars deep in the cosmos, he somehow relates those things which I thought unrelatable. In that way, I am impressed with his skillful writing and lucid imagery.I am, however, always left feeling as though I've missed something. Each essay reaches an altogether unsatisfying conclusion which I had hoped it would surpass. I wonder, what more is there to say about this topic? Perhaps that is Lightman's clever way of getting me to explore these ideas on my own. Yet, I wanted more than what I got. Something more deeply scientific, some theories about how and why, instead of questions that lead to no answers but instead to casual ""maybe""s and ""we don't know""s. Pick up this book for some poetic stellar imagination, but leave it on the shelf in favor of Hawking or Kaku if you want something that provokes your deeper scientific spirit. The short length and easy narrative makes this book a great starting point for anyone new to physics, philosophy and cosmology. "

This is the exact kind of thing I like to read: not pure science, but a way to think about science. Writing about science that is beautiful and thought-provoking, even inspiring, is rare (Carl Sagan was the very best at this, in my opinion). This book hits all the right notes.The author is a physicist and a fiction writer, so he manages to write about the universe with deep, satisfying prose. In seven short chapters, Mr. Lightman manages to cover the weirdness of the universe, the lawfulness of the universe, the spiritual depth of the universe, and the way that our observation of the universe is entirely dependent on the observers. I am not doing it justice by trying to describe the depth of this man's insights. They are profound.Why is there so much symmetry in the universe? Is there really a multiverse? Why does everything change, and decay? What is consciousness? What is relationship between experiences of transcendence and religion? As I read, I found that both my humanist and pantheist leanings were being highly stimulated. My take away from this book is an astonishing sense of wonder, and reverence. That I am here at all, on this planet, and conscious, is a miracle. My existence, my ability to reason, to observe, and to ponder, is...sacred. Numinous indeed. Literally my favorite kind of writing.

151,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45699572-nadisha,3,"It's clear Alan Lightman is enthralled by what he had discovered in his work as physicist and professor, and that enthusiasm seeps off each page of this book. He constantly illuminates his readers to the wonders of the universe by simplistically explaining complex scientific systems/theories and threading the with psychological and sociological theories on how mankind is and has to deal with these truths. It's a fascinating collection of questions and wonderings, but that was the extent to which I felt engaged. Lightman presents some interesting insight on mankind's need for structure, the laws of nature, and a dimming of the ""vitality of the visible"" realm...but it was nothing monumental. Rather, it felt like general psychological deductions, and the book echoed nothing more, to me, than an effort to get Lightman's readers to awe at the universe and question it as he has. That's not to say he didn't craft beautiful connections between philosophy, literature, science, and religion, but the beauty lay more in the idea of their interconnectedness rather than in the points he was trying to make. If someone were unfamiliar with the scientific truths about the physical universe that Lightman points out, then I can see reading this novel as an enlightening and illuminating experience. However, I already spent a brief portion of my life fascinated by these truths, and though I continue to be dazzled and perplexed by exactly what Lightman illustrates, I hoped to read this and come away with a new fascination to chew on, and that did not occur. Therefore, as an introductory reading (and given the second half of the title, I can't help but assume such was purposed), this is an excellent choice for readers of any age and level of experience in the fields of math/science or the humanities. It'll open your eyes to our broken, self-made realities in order to reveal the startling and nonsensical possibilities of the universe and hopefully motivate you to look at the world through a completely different lens.

152,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22117564-douglas-lord,5,"Lightman, a physics professor at MIT, has a brain roughly twice the size of an average person’s; fortunately for humankind, he has sworn to only use his powers for good. He starts this fantastic collection of previously published essays by relating how he met the Dalai Lama at MIT, and it’s exactly this kind of cross-pollinating of the spiritual world with the scientific one that exemplifies this title. “Science,” he writes, “does not reveal the meaning of our existence, but it does draw back some veils.” Much veil-pulling ensues, and like über-dude Isaac Asimov, the good professor focuses on explaining/exploring various topics within cosmology and physics, like dark energy. Mind-boggling facts appear; “If the theoretically possible values for dark energy were marked on a ruler stretching from here to the sun, the value of dark energy actually found in our universe … (10 -8 ergs per cubic centimeter) would be closer to the zero end than the width of an atom.” This title will infuriate intelligent design advocates, for Lightman holds, per the title, that “we are an accident.” And yet the writing is a real and searching investigation at the crux of science and faith. Where else might you read the spiritual version of the second law of thermodynamics—the “arrow of time”—explicated in a way that includes toupees and Botox? VERDICT Part philosophy, part science, this little book is a big fat pleasure to read.

I stopped after the Prologue and a few pages of the first chapter. I just couldn't.This book, instead of trying to tackle microcosms of ""What Is Science?"", goes straight after our own existence, and how our uncertainties of the past turned to certainties only lead to more uncertainties today.Lightman has a wonderful knack for relating the unfathomable and wholly abstract--the size of our universe, the nature of quantum mechanics, unending entropy--to the fathomable yet wholly abstract in our lives--that tiny feeling near the ocean, love, pondering non-existence.In a sense, he does what Canon attempts. He dives deep into one realm of our existence that defines everything else in our existence: what is our universe and what is our consciousness, but together, in their whole tangled mess.His conclusion is a bit too much of a concrete cop-out rant on electronics and being present. I believe his real conclusion is that we know what we know, much abstractly, but furthermore that whatever is outside of our observable universe--literally the space beyond the distance that light could have travelled in the universe's existence--is unknowable. For now, at least.Also, his writing is superb.Read it.Tossing it on the Religion shelf because he deals with religion quite a bit."

This is balanced by Lightman's reflections on human nature, our mutual condition, and our place in a vast cosmos beyond our reach. This creates an interesting tension that runs throughout the collection, beginning right at the beginning in the titular essay. Lightman starts with that: ""The history of science can, in fact, be viewed as the recasting of phenomena that were once accepted as 'givens' as phenomena that can now be understood in terms of fundamental causes and principles."" Science peels away layers that obscure the truth at the heart of our universe. However, after centuries of constant triumph, scientists have run into a brick wall. For every new discovery, new questions arise that science may not also be able to answer. After affirming what science has done, he pulls away the table cloth: ""According to the current thinking of many physicists, we are living in one of a vast number of universes. We are living in an accidental universe. We are living in a universe incalculable by science."""

The last essay in particular, ""The Disembodied Universe,"" veers off into a weird anti-technological rant about how kids these days just Instagram pictures of nature instead of just being in the moment, or something (although I admit the story he recounts about one of his adult daughter's friends playing a song on her iPhone during a dinner he took them out too seemed pretty rude). All in all, it's clear that I am not the intended audience for this book, so that probably explains the low rating."

It was a further explanation of the state of Physics, written in a very accessible way. I understood almost all of it. There was only one concept that left me scratching my head; I just couldn't quite get it.I like how this author, an atheist, nevertheless treats the Christian point of view with respect, and concedes that Science will never tell us Why, only What and How, and the why, along with the moral uses of science, lies with other ways of knowing, such as religious faith. (Similarly, I will only read Christian non-fiction if it shows respect for the FACTS that the earth is 14 billion years old, and we are evolved from earlier creatures). "

Alan Lightman makes reading about some of the advances in science easy and illuminating, not just stating how they came about, but what it means to each of us as human beings. What does it mean that our idea of how big the universe is keeps expanding, what does it mean that we interact with these forces through technology as our senses are no longer able to perceive without assistance the newest findings.

Individually, the essays are a bit slight, and the book itself is a trim little document. But it all moves so quickly and even joyfully that the slightness becomes a part of its charm.

175,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4061006-angela,5,"A brief, beautiful book - ho man, it hit me right here, right in the heart. And the brain. Lovely. Sometimes books meet you right where you are and you have, basically, a perfect date with a book. I just had a great, great date with this book. It's brief - <200 pages, or only a couple audiobook commutes. I want to read it again! And everything else by Lightman! Fun fact, but I've had him on my TO-READ list since TWO THOUSAND SIX. 11 years!!!Anyway, this book is kinda similar to Carlo Rovelli's Sette brevi lezioni di fisica (Seven brief lessons in physics), in that it's short, dense, deep, and loving. Very heartening! It's a collection of essays/meditations on cutting edge physics and its intersections with philosophy, cosmic mysteries. There's one essay on how screens mediate our reality too much, with a shout out to Sherry Turkle, and a general sense of aaaaAAAAAAAHHHHHH and our post-human future.So, like Rovelli's book, this covers the cosmic weirdnesses of modern physics - specifically, the multiverse, quantum mechanics, and the time-bendy wavey nature of things very very very great or very very very small. We dwell on why there is anything, and Lightman kinda shook my foundations a little bit by answering it in the usual ways: the multiverse (i.e. this highly improbable, intelligent life-sustaining universe exists because every other possible universe also exists) or, gah, GOD. Theism has all of zero social prestige in my liberal/secular circles, and so I found Lightman's (who notes he is an atheist) discussion of how cosmically improbable a medium zone planet being birthed from a Big Bang with perfectly calibrated levels of hydrogen, ergo First Mover, spooky and disquieting. I mean, when the choice is inscrutable First Mover vs. multiverse, BOTH ARE VERY STRANGE CHOICES. People, it's this or this!? Lightman also sticks it to Dawkins, which was satisfying (Lord, grant me the patience to tolerate Richard frickin Dawkins), and his whole social, professional and spiritual life is centralized around MIT, which was ALSO very satisfying. (Glory, glory be to MIT!) But those two bits are just icing on the cake.Wonderfully written, inspiring, and YES WE SPEND TOO MUCH TIME IN OUR SCREENS. Even though Lightman sounds like a 60+ curmudgeon when he complains about young people ""emailing their Facebooks"" with pictures of nature walks (thus defeating the purpose of the nature walk), I did - basically - 200% AGREE. YA DAMN KIDS WITH YER DAMN BOOK OF FACE!Strongly recommended. Do not wait 11 years to read this."
176,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27614432-justin-tapp,3,"I have read several of Brian Greene's and Stephen Hawking's books detailing the history of modern physics, string theory in its various iterations, and the theoretical possibilities of a multiverse. Lightman does a much better job summing up the philosophical implications of theoretical physics in very stark form. He is also much more transparent about the fact that there are Nobel prize-winning physicists who don't buy the multiverse theory and believe in a Creator and an intelligence behind the design of our universe rather than a theoretically infinite number of universes created by no intelligence. Lightman admits the ""fine-tuning"" of the cosmological constants necessary for our universe to be the way it is are astronomically improbable. While charitable to his colleagues who believe in a higher power, Lightman disagrees with them. In Lightman's view, we are simply a random collection of molecules put together by chance. ""We are an accident,"" he states, a mathematical improbability in our own universe -- ""one millionth of one billionth of a percent in our universe is life"" -- but when the denominator is infinity (the infinite multiverse) improbable is relative. ""Science can never know how universe was created,"" yet he's certain how it was not created.He details early in the book what this means for humans. He loves his daughter, feels attached to her, cares for her. But then he remembers that she's just a random collection of atoms and, like his own atoms, will one day be nothing more than scattered into the universe. He admits this is hard to wrap his mind around, his mind longs for eternity and he is ""self-delusional"" in his longing for immortality. But since everything in the universe decays or dies and the law of entropy says that everything moves from order to disorder there can be nothing more than this. Life is therefore meaningless, absurd. Not since Hawking wrote in Black Holes and Baby Universes that we have two options: God, or grand unifying theory that explains everything from the Big Bang to why I ate a salad for lunch. Hawking rejected the former and later recanted on the GUT (which was supposed to bridge quantum mechanics with the standard model), basically the multiverse via string theory has replaced his GUT. Meaning, again, that both the big bang and my salad were random and need no explanation.It's odd that Lightman even uses the word ""life"" in the book since how do you define a random collection of atoms whose extinguishing means nothing as ""life""? What is consciousness? If I were to kill his daughter, why would that be wrong, I'm just scattering her atoms about the universe? The fact that his brain has evolved to find that idea repulsive is his own problem. Atoms have no ethics and it's silly to call things that are random ""evil."" For an MIT professor who also teaches philosophy he surprisingly doesn't raise the question. Odder still is that he later heralds natural selection and the ability of millions of cells to transmit information when reproducing without noting that some atheist biologists have concluded that this is impossible without some sort of guided process. How did the basic building blocks of life know that they needed to survive? These biologists have followed Lightman's logic to its conclusion, apparently unknown to Lightman himself, that we are the result of a completely random process.I have also read physicist Lee Smolin's The Trouble with Physics, critiquing string theory and modern physics in general. I highly recommend that book to anyone who thinks string theory is all that there is. There are alternative, testable theories out there. Which is another irony because Lightman writes that science ""must be verified and tested"" but doesn't apply this to either string theory or the multiverse. Stephen Hawking wrote in The Universe in a Nutshell that you would need a particle collider larger than the size of the universe to test some aspects of string theory. Yet Lightman hails theoretical physics as ""the purest form of science.""Cosmologist George Ellis was quoted recently in Scientific American criticizing physicists like Lightman and Lawrence Krauss who have moved away from physics and science to pure metaphysical hypotheses which are not testable.""Krauss does not explain in what way these entities could have pre-existed the coming into being of the universe, why they should have existed at all, or why they should have had the form they did. And he gives no experimental or observational process whereby we could test these vivid speculations of the supposed universe-generation mechanism. How indeed can you test what existed before the universe existed? You can’t.""Lightman's essays contradict themselves in this regard: he praises scientific measurement and cheering on the work of phsyics toward a complete set of the fundamental laws of our universe while earlier saying that if the multiverse is true them most of physics is ""useless"" as there is ""no point"" in explaining why things in our universe are the way they are-- it was just random. Other universes are flat, some are round, some are finite, some are infinite, some contain the null set, and in some universes every law that holds in ours doesn't hold, and vice-versa.Lightman contends that a God ""consistent with science"" can only exist outside the universe, never intervening in its immutable, unchangeable laws. This rules out anything miraculous, whether there is evidence or not to the contrary-- and he examines no evidence or testimony of the physically unexplainable. (I read Eric Metaxas' Miracles just prior to this book, the first bit of which argues philosophically against Lightman's conclusions.) God is the watchmaker who let the universe wind up, go and never intervenes, somehow can't intervene without the entire universe falling apart according to Lightman. Lightman rejects the ""immanentism"" of Spinoza and Einstein.The essays also contain brief explanations of the importance of symmetry and discovery of the Higgs-Boson. There is also some overview of philosophical history but nothing in-depth. As I wrote above, he ignores his own theory's implications for ethics and the problem of evil. He writes of how he had somehow a sort of mental connection with a bird once, yet seemingly forgets that this, like his daugher, was purely random and meaningless. He cites plenty of deist scientists along the way, and criticizes Lawrence Krauss for being critical of faith. He considers faith to be rational, and rightly notes many scientific, economic, and political achievements that have come forth from theists who felt their exploration of science was a way to understand better how God created things, wrong-headed though they were. But this again ignores the fact that it's hard to define what is ""ethical"" or an ""advancement"" when we're purely random and there are no consequences, ultimately, for our actions.He concludes the book with some futurist silliness that reminded me of Lightman's fellow multiverse proponent Brian Greene in The Hidden Reality where Greene writes that another plausible alternative to the multiverse is that nothing in our world is actually real, we could all be living in a simulated multiverse. A ""software glitch"" explains why we can't reconcile quantum mechanics and the standard model or discover all of the fundamental laws. We are just Sims in someone's video game, and those playing us are also likely Sims, who are being played by Sims and so on. Physics has truly set philosophy back millenia.As I wrote above, Lightman's work does a great job showing the logical conclusion of the multiverse in a succinct fashion. I recommend reading it for yourself, but only 3.5 stars because as another sympathetic reviewer writing for the left-leaning magazine Salon pointed out: ""Perhaps Lightman contradicts himself."""
177,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103275991-emilie-marshall,0,"Was inspired to pick up this book from some excerpts discussed by David Byrne in his Bicycle Diaries. Some intriguing ideas, as I usually find new curiosities in books about physics made digestible for the common folk such as myself. If I remember correctly there was much scrutiny of the idea that our brains are finite, and that something must always be lost in order to gain something else. I think... Here is the one and only quote I copied down during my reading:""Most of us will adapt to this new way of living the same way that the people of today have adapted to cell phones and Skype. It will be the natural and normal way of being in the world. But here and there, small pockets of people will rebel and establish protected communes, where the newer technologies are left at the front gate-- in the same way that some people today still send handwritten letters and take long walks without their cellphones. In such enclaves, people will feel that they are living a more immediate and authentic life, that they are more connected with themselves and their surroundings. And that will be partly true. Yet they will be also disconnected from the larger world just outside of their gate, invisible in their own way,"" -pg 145While this thought is certainly nothing new or terribly provoking, I think it's an important thought to remind oneself to remember. It's easily one of those things you store away in your ""things I am aware of"" closet where it collects dust and gets forgotten. So pull it off the shelf every once in a while and think about it again!! In my opinion it is a truth that will continue to morph in relevance at constant intervals in one's life."
178,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81065199-caleb,3,"While this book offers an exciting and poetic journey into some of the larger questions of life, existence and our universe, it is barely a scratch at the surface which poses more problems than it answers. Do not pick up this book expecting a scientifically rigorous look at cosmology or dimensionality, as I made the mistake of doing. You need nothing more than a basic understanding of physics and astronomy to grasp a lot of the concepts in this book. On one hand that is good because it makes it accessible to everyone and anyone who wants to get into this sort of philosophical questioning. On the other hand, it makes me wonder what, if anything, this book adds that hasn't already been said before in so many ways. The lyricism in this book is beautiful and enthralling. The way the words come together to form something cohesive is impressive with such disparate and far reaching ideas and anecdotes. I'm never sure where Lightman will take me until I've arrived there. From personal experiences in his own life to vast stretching quasars deep in the cosmos, he somehow relates those things which I thought unrelatable. In that way, I am impressed with his skillful writing and lucid imagery.I am, however, always left feeling as though I've missed something. Each essay reaches an altogether unsatisfying conclusion which I had hoped it would surpass. I wonder, what more is there to say about this topic? Perhaps that is Lightman's clever way of getting me to explore these ideas on my own. Yet, I wanted more than what I got. Something more deeply scientific, some theories about how and why, instead of questions that lead to no answers but instead to casual ""maybe""s and ""we don't know""s. Pick up this book for some poetic stellar imagination, but leave it on the shelf in favor of Hawking or Kaku if you want something that provokes your deeper scientific spirit. The short length and easy narrative makes this book a great starting point for anyone new to physics, philosophy and cosmology. "

This is the exact kind of thing I like to read: not pure science, but a way to think about science. Writing about science that is beautiful and thought-provoking, even inspiring, is rare (Carl Sagan was the very best at this, in my opinion). This book hits all the right notes.The author is a physicist and a fiction writer, so he manages to write about the universe with deep, satisfying prose. In seven short chapters, Mr. Lightman manages to cover the weirdness of the universe, the lawfulness of the universe, the spiritual depth of the universe, and the way that our observation of the universe is entirely dependent on the observers. I am not doing it justice by trying to describe the depth of this man's insights. They are profound.Why is there so much symmetry in the universe? Is there really a multiverse? Why does everything change, and decay? What is consciousness? What is relationship between experiences of transcendence and religion? As I read, I found that both my humanist and pantheist leanings were being highly stimulated. My take away from this book is an astonishing sense of wonder, and reverence. That I am here at all, on this planet, and conscious, is a miracle. My existence, my ability to reason, to observe, and to ponder, is...sacred. Numinous indeed. Literally my favorite kind of writing.

181,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45699572-nadisha,3,"It's clear Alan Lightman is enthralled by what he had discovered in his work as physicist and professor, and that enthusiasm seeps off each page of this book. He constantly illuminates his readers to the wonders of the universe by simplistically explaining complex scientific systems/theories and threading the with psychological and sociological theories on how mankind is and has to deal with these truths. It's a fascinating collection of questions and wonderings, but that was the extent to which I felt engaged. Lightman presents some interesting insight on mankind's need for structure, the laws of nature, and a dimming of the ""vitality of the visible"" realm...but it was nothing monumental. Rather, it felt like general psychological deductions, and the book echoed nothing more, to me, than an effort to get Lightman's readers to awe at the universe and question it as he has. That's not to say he didn't craft beautiful connections between philosophy, literature, science, and religion, but the beauty lay more in the idea of their interconnectedness rather than in the points he was trying to make. If someone were unfamiliar with the scientific truths about the physical universe that Lightman points out, then I can see reading this novel as an enlightening and illuminating experience. However, I already spent a brief portion of my life fascinated by these truths, and though I continue to be dazzled and perplexed by exactly what Lightman illustrates, I hoped to read this and come away with a new fascination to chew on, and that did not occur. Therefore, as an introductory reading (and given the second half of the title, I can't help but assume such was purposed), this is an excellent choice for readers of any age and level of experience in the fields of math/science or the humanities. It'll open your eyes to our broken, self-made realities in order to reveal the startling and nonsensical possibilities of the universe and hopefully motivate you to look at the world through a completely different lens.

182,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22117564-douglas-lord,5,"Lightman, a physics professor at MIT, has a brain roughly twice the size of an average person’s; fortunately for humankind, he has sworn to only use his powers for good. He starts this fantastic collection of previously published essays by relating how he met the Dalai Lama at MIT, and it’s exactly this kind of cross-pollinating of the spiritual world with the scientific one that exemplifies this title. “Science,” he writes, “does not reveal the meaning of our existence, but it does draw back some veils.” Much veil-pulling ensues, and like über-dude Isaac Asimov, the good professor focuses on explaining/exploring various topics within cosmology and physics, like dark energy. Mind-boggling facts appear; “If the theoretically possible values for dark energy were marked on a ruler stretching from here to the sun, the value of dark energy actually found in our universe … (10 -8 ergs per cubic centimeter) would be closer to the zero end than the width of an atom.” This title will infuriate intelligent design advocates, for Lightman holds, per the title, that “we are an accident.” And yet the writing is a real and searching investigation at the crux of science and faith. Where else might you read the spiritual version of the second law of thermodynamics—the “arrow of time”—explicated in a way that includes toupees and Botox? VERDICT Part philosophy, part science, this little book is a big fat pleasure to read.

I stopped after the Prologue and a few pages of the first chapter. I just couldn't.This book, instead of trying to tackle microcosms of ""What Is Science?"", goes straight after our own existence, and how our uncertainties of the past turned to certainties only lead to more uncertainties today.Lightman has a wonderful knack for relating the unfathomable and wholly abstract--the size of our universe, the nature of quantum mechanics, unending entropy--to the fathomable yet wholly abstract in our lives--that tiny feeling near the ocean, love, pondering non-existence.In a sense, he does what Canon attempts. He dives deep into one realm of our existence that defines everything else in our existence: what is our universe and what is our consciousness, but together, in their whole tangled mess.His conclusion is a bit too much of a concrete cop-out rant on electronics and being present. I believe his real conclusion is that we know what we know, much abstractly, but furthermore that whatever is outside of our observable universe--literally the space beyond the distance that light could have travelled in the universe's existence--is unknowable. For now, at least.Also, his writing is superb.Read it.Tossing it on the Religion shelf because he deals with religion quite a bit."

This is balanced by Lightman's reflections on human nature, our mutual condition, and our place in a vast cosmos beyond our reach. This creates an interesting tension that runs throughout the collection, beginning right at the beginning in the titular essay. Lightman starts with that: ""The history of science can, in fact, be viewed as the recasting of phenomena that were once accepted as 'givens' as phenomena that can now be understood in terms of fundamental causes and principles."" Science peels away layers that obscure the truth at the heart of our universe. However, after centuries of constant triumph, scientists have run into a brick wall. For every new discovery, new questions arise that science may not also be able to answer. After affirming what science has done, he pulls away the table cloth: ""According to the current thinking of many physicists, we are living in one of a vast number of universes.

The last essay in particular, ""The Disembodied Universe,"" veers off into a weird anti-technological rant about how kids these days just Instagram pictures of nature instead of just being in the moment, or something (although I admit the story he recounts about one of his adult daughter's friends playing a song on her iPhone during a dinner he took them out too seemed pretty rude).

It was a further explanation of the state of Physics, written in a very accessible way. I understood almost all of it. There was only one concept that left me scratching my head; I just couldn't quite get it.I like how this author, an atheist, nevertheless treats the Christian point of view with respect, and concedes that Science will never tell us Why, only What and How, and the why, along with the moral uses of science, lies with other ways of knowing, such as religious faith.

What does it mean that our idea of how big the universe is keeps expanding, what does it mean that we interact with these forces through technology as our senses are no longer able to perceive without assistance the newest findings.

205,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4061006-angela,5,"A brief, beautiful book - ho man, it hit me right here, right in the heart. And the brain. Lovely. Sometimes books meet you right where you are and you have, basically, a perfect date with a book. I just had a great, great date with this book. It's brief - <200 pages, or only a couple audiobook commutes. I want to read it again! And everything else by Lightman! Fun fact, but I've had him on my TO-READ list since TWO THOUSAND SIX. 11 years!!!Anyway, this book is kinda similar to Carlo Rovelli's Sette brevi lezioni di fisica (Seven brief lessons in physics), in that it's short, dense, deep, and loving. Very heartening! It's a collection of essays/meditations on cutting edge physics and its intersections with philosophy, cosmic mysteries. There's one essay on how screens mediate our reality too much, with a shout out to Sherry Turkle, and a general sense of aaaaAAAAAAAHHHHHH and our post-human future.So, like Rovelli's book, this covers the cosmic weirdnesses of modern physics - specifically, the multiverse, quantum mechanics, and the time-bendy wavey nature of things very very very great or very very very small. We dwell on why there is anything, and Lightman kinda shook my foundations a little bit by answering it in the usual ways: the multiverse (i.e. this highly improbable, intelligent life-sustaining universe exists because every other possible universe also exists) or, gah, GOD. Theism has all of zero social prestige in my liberal/secular circles, and so I found Lightman's (who notes he is an atheist) discussion of how cosmically improbable a medium zone planet being birthed from a Big Bang with perfectly calibrated levels of hydrogen, ergo First Mover, spooky and disquieting. I mean, when the choice is inscrutable First Mover vs. multiverse, BOTH ARE VERY STRANGE CHOICES. People, it's this or this!? Lightman also sticks it to Dawkins, which was satisfying (Lord, grant me the patience to tolerate Richard frickin Dawkins), and his whole social, professional and spiritual life is centralized around MIT, which was ALSO very satisfying. (Glory, glory be to MIT!) But those two bits are just icing on the cake.Wonderfully written, inspiring, and YES WE SPEND TOO MUCH TIME IN OUR SCREENS. Even though Lightman sounds like a 60+ curmudgeon when he complains about young people ""emailing their Facebooks"" with pictures of nature walks (thus defeating the purpose of the nature walk), I did - basically - 200% AGREE. YA DAMN KIDS WITH YER DAMN BOOK OF FACE!Strongly recommended. Do not wait 11 years to read this."
206,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27614432-justin-tapp,3,"I have read several of Brian Greene's and Stephen Hawking's books detailing the history of modern physics, string theory in its various iterations, and the theoretical possibilities of a multiverse. Lightman does a much better job summing up the philosophical implications of theoretical physics in very stark form. He is also much more transparent about the fact that there are Nobel prize-winning physicists who don't buy the multiverse theory and believe in a Creator and an intelligence behind the design of our universe rather than a theoretically infinite number of universes created by no intelligence. Lightman admits the ""fine-tuning"" of the cosmological constants necessary for our universe to be the way it is are astronomically improbable. While charitable to his colleagues who believe in a higher power, Lightman disagrees with them. In Lightman's view, we are simply a random collection of molecules put together by chance. ""We are an accident,"" he states, a mathematical improbability in our own universe -- ""one millionth of one billionth of a percent in our universe is life"" -- but when the denominator is infinity (the infinite multiverse) improbable is relative. ""Science can never know how universe was created,"" yet he's certain how it was not created.He details early in the book what this means for humans. He loves his daughter, feels attached to her, cares for her. But then he remembers that she's just a random collection of atoms and, like his own atoms, will one day be nothing more than scattered into the universe. He admits this is hard to wrap his mind around, his mind longs for eternity and he is ""self-delusional"" in his longing for immortality. But since everything in the universe decays or dies and the law of entropy says that everything moves from order to disorder there can be nothing more than this. Life is therefore meaningless, absurd. Not since Hawking wrote in Black Holes and Baby Universes that we have two options: God, or grand unifying theory that explains everything from the Big Bang to why I ate a salad for lunch. Hawking rejected the former and later recanted on the GUT (which was supposed to bridge quantum mechanics with the standard model), basically the multiverse via string theory has replaced his GUT. Meaning, again, that both the big bang and my salad were random and need no explanation.It's odd that Lightman even uses the word ""life"" in the book since how do you define a random collection of atoms whose extinguishing means nothing as ""life""? What is consciousness? If I were to kill his daughter, why would that be wrong, I'm just scattering her atoms about the universe? The fact that his brain has evolved to find that idea repulsive is his own problem. Atoms have no ethics and it's silly to call things that are random ""evil."" For an MIT professor who also teaches philosophy he surprisingly doesn't raise the question. Odder still is that he later heralds natural selection and the ability of millions of cells to transmit information when reproducing without noting that some atheist biologists have concluded that this is impossible without some sort of guided process. How did the basic building blocks of life know that they needed to survive? These biologists have followed Lightman's logic to its conclusion, apparently unknown to Lightman himself, that we are the result of a completely random process.I have also read physicist Lee Smolin's The Trouble with Physics, critiquing string theory and modern physics in general. I highly recommend that book to anyone who thinks string theory is all that there is. There are alternative, testable theories out there. Which is another irony because Lightman writes that science ""must be verified and tested"" but doesn't apply this to either string theory or the multiverse. Stephen Hawking wrote in The Universe in a Nutshell that you would need a particle collider larger than the size of the universe to test some aspects of string theory. Yet Lightman hails theoretical physics as ""the purest form of science.""Cosmologist George Ellis was quoted recently in Scientific American criticizing physicists like Lightman and Lawrence Krauss who have moved away from physics and science to pure metaphysical hypotheses which are not testable.""Krauss does not explain in what way these entities could have pre-existed the coming into being of the universe, why they should have existed at all, or why they should have had the form they did. And he gives no experimental or observational process whereby we could test these vivid speculations of the supposed universe-generation mechanism. How indeed can you test what existed before the universe existed? You can’t.""Lightman's essays contradict themselves in this regard: he praises scientific measurement and cheering on the work of phsyics toward a complete set of the fundamental laws of our universe while earlier saying that if the multiverse is true them most of physics is ""useless"" as there is ""no point"" in explaining why things in our universe are the way they are-- it was just random. Other universes are flat, some are round, some are finite, some are infinite, some contain the null set, and in some universes every law that holds in ours doesn't hold, and vice-versa.Lightman contends that a God ""consistent with science"" can only exist outside the universe, never intervening in its immutable, unchangeable laws. This rules out anything miraculous, whether there is evidence or not to the contrary-- and he examines no evidence or testimony of the physically unexplainable. (I read Eric Metaxas' Miracles just prior to this book, the first bit of which argues philosophically against Lightman's conclusions.) God is the watchmaker who let the universe wind up, go and never intervenes, somehow can't intervene without the entire universe falling apart according to Lightman. Lightman rejects the ""immanentism"" of Spinoza and Einstein.The essays also contain brief explanations of the importance of symmetry and discovery of the Higgs-Boson. There is also some overview of philosophical history but nothing in-depth. As I wrote above, he ignores his own theory's implications for ethics and the problem of evil. He writes of how he had somehow a sort of mental connection with a bird once, yet seemingly forgets that this, like his daugher, was purely random and meaningless. He cites plenty of deist scientists along the way, and criticizes Lawrence Krauss for being critical of faith. He considers faith to be rational, and rightly notes many scientific, economic, and political achievements that have come forth from theists who felt their exploration of science was a way to understand better how God created things, wrong-headed though they were. But this again ignores the fact that it's hard to define what is ""ethical"" or an ""advancement"" when we're purely random and there are no consequences, ultimately, for our actions.He concludes the book with some futurist silliness that reminded me of Lightman's fellow multiverse proponent Brian Greene in The Hidden Reality where Greene writes that another plausible alternative to the multiverse is that nothing in our world is actually real, we could all be living in a simulated multiverse. A ""software glitch"" explains why we can't reconcile quantum mechanics and the standard model or discover all of the fundamental laws. We are just Sims in someone's video game, and those playing us are also likely Sims, who are being played by Sims and so on. Physics has truly set philosophy back millenia.As I wrote above, Lightman's work does a great job showing the logical conclusion of the multiverse in a succinct fashion. I recommend reading it for yourself, but only 3.5 stars because as another sympathetic reviewer writing for the left-leaning magazine Salon pointed out: ""Perhaps Lightman contradicts himself."""
207,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103275991-emilie-marshall,0,"Was inspired to pick up this book from some excerpts discussed by David Byrne in his Bicycle Diaries. Some intriguing ideas, as I usually find new curiosities in books about physics made digestible for the common folk such as myself. If I remember correctly there was much scrutiny of the idea that our brains are finite, and that something must always be lost in order to gain something else. I think... Here is the one and only quote I copied down during my reading:""Most of us will adapt to this new way of living the same way that the people of today have adapted to cell phones and Skype. It will be the natural and normal way of being in the world. But here and there, small pockets of people will rebel and establish protected communes, where the newer technologies are left at the front gate-- in the same way that some people today still send handwritten letters and take long walks without their cellphones. In such enclaves, people will feel that they are living a more immediate and authentic life, that they are more connected with themselves and their surroundings. And that will be partly true. Yet they will be also disconnected from the larger world just outside of their gate, invisible in their own way,"" -pg 145While this thought is certainly nothing new or terribly provoking, I think it's an important thought to remind oneself to remember. It's easily one of those things you store away in your ""things I am aware of"" closet where it collects dust and gets forgotten. So pull it off the shelf every once in a while and think about it again!! In my opinion it is a truth that will continue to morph in relevance at constant intervals in one's life."
208,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81065199-caleb,3,"While this book offers an exciting and poetic journey into some of the larger questions of life, existence and our universe, it is barely a scratch at the surface which poses more problems than it answers. Do not pick up this book expecting a scientifically rigorous look at cosmology or dimensionality, as I made the mistake of doing. You need nothing more than a basic understanding of physics and astronomy to grasp a lot of the concepts in this book. On one hand that is good because it makes it accessible to everyone and anyone who wants to get into this sort of philosophical questioning. On the other hand, it makes me wonder what, if anything, this book adds that hasn't already been said before in so many ways. The lyricism in this book is beautiful and enthralling. The way the words come together to form something cohesive is impressive with such disparate and far reaching ideas and anecdotes. I'm never sure where Lightman will take me until I've arrived there. From personal experiences in his own life to vast stretching quasars deep in the cosmos, he somehow relates those things which I thought unrelatable. In that way, I am impressed with his skillful writing and lucid imagery.I am, however, always left feeling as though I've missed something. Each essay reaches an altogether unsatisfying conclusion which I had hoped it would surpass. I wonder, what more is there to say about this topic? Perhaps that is Lightman's clever way of getting me to explore these ideas on my own. Yet, I wanted more than what I got. Something more deeply scientific, some theories about how and why, instead of questions that lead to no answers but instead to casual ""maybe""s and ""we don't know""s. Pick up this book for some poetic stellar imagination, but leave it on the shelf in favor of Hawking or Kaku if you want something that provokes your deeper scientific spirit. The short length and easy narrative makes this book a great starting point for anyone new to physics, philosophy and cosmology. "

This is the exact kind of thing I like to read: not pure science, but a way to think about science. Writing about science that is beautiful and thought-provoking, even inspiring, is rare (Carl Sagan was the very best at this, in my opinion). This book hits all the right notes.The author is a physicist and a fiction writer, so he manages to write about the universe with deep, satisfying prose. In seven short chapters, Mr. Lightman manages to cover the weirdness of the universe, the lawfulness of the universe, the spiritual depth of the universe, and the way that our observation of the universe is entirely dependent on the observers. I am not doing it justice by trying to describe the depth of this man's insights. They are profound.Why is there so much symmetry in the universe? Is there really a multiverse? Why does everything change, and decay? What is consciousness? What is relationship between experiences of transcendence and religion? As I read, I found that both my humanist and pantheist leanings were being highly stimulated. My take away from this book is an astonishing sense of wonder, and reverence. That I am here at all, on this planet, and conscious, is a miracle. My existence, my ability to reason, to observe, and to ponder, is...sacred. Numinous indeed. Literally my favorite kind of writing.

211,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45699572-nadisha,3,"It's clear Alan Lightman is enthralled by what he had discovered in his work as physicist and professor, and that enthusiasm seeps off each page of this book. He constantly illuminates his readers to the wonders of the universe by simplistically explaining complex scientific systems/theories and threading the with psychological and sociological theories on how mankind is and has to deal with these truths. It's a fascinating collection of questions and wonderings, but that was the extent to which I felt engaged. Lightman presents some interesting insight on mankind's need for structure, the laws of nature, and a dimming of the ""vitality of the visible"" realm...but it was nothing monumental. Rather, it felt like general psychological deductions, and the book echoed nothing more, to me, than an effort to get Lightman's readers to awe at the universe and question it as he has. That's not to say he didn't craft beautiful connections between philosophy, literature, science, and religion, but the beauty lay more in the idea of their interconnectedness rather than in the points he was trying to make. If someone were unfamiliar with the scientific truths about the physical universe that Lightman points out, then I can see reading this novel as an enlightening and illuminating experience. However, I already spent a brief portion of my life fascinated by these truths, and though I continue to be dazzled and perplexed by exactly what Lightman illustrates, I hoped to read this and come away with a new fascination to chew on, and that did not occur. Therefore, as an introductory reading (and given the second half of the title, I can't help but assume such was purposed), this is an excellent choice for readers of any age and level of experience in the fields of math/science or the humanities. It'll open your eyes to our broken, self-made realities in order to reveal the startling and nonsensical possibilities of the universe and hopefully motivate you to look at the world through a completely different lens.

212,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22117564-douglas-lord,5,"Lightman, a physics professor at MIT, has a brain roughly twice the size of an average person’s; fortunately for humankind, he has sworn to only use his powers for good. He starts this fantastic collection of previously published essays by relating how he met the Dalai Lama at MIT, and it’s exactly this kind of cross-pollinating of the spiritual world with the scientific one that exemplifies this title. “Science,” he writes, “does not reveal the meaning of our existence, but it does draw back some veils.” Much veil-pulling ensues, and like über-dude Isaac Asimov, the good professor focuses on explaining/exploring various topics within cosmology and physics, like dark energy. Mind-boggling facts appear; “If the theoretically possible values for dark energy were marked on a ruler stretching from here to the sun, the value of dark energy actually found in our universe … (10 -8 ergs per cubic centimeter) would be closer to the zero end than the width of an atom.” This title will infuriate intelligent design advocates, for Lightman holds, per the title, that “we are an accident.” And yet the writing is a real and searching investigation at the crux of science and faith. Where else might you read the spiritual version of the second law of thermodynamics—the “arrow of time”—explicated in a way that includes toupees and Botox? VERDICT Part philosophy, part science, this little book is a big fat pleasure to read.

I stopped after the Prologue and a few pages of the first chapter. I just couldn't.This book, instead of trying to tackle microcosms of ""What Is Science?"", goes straight after our own existence, and how our uncertainties of the past turned to certainties only lead to more uncertainties today.Lightman has a wonderful knack for relating the unfathomable and wholly abstract--the size of our universe, the nature of quantum mechanics, unending entropy--to the fathomable yet wholly abstract in our lives--that tiny feeling near the ocean, love, pondering non-existence.In a sense, he does what Canon attempts. He dives deep into one realm of our existence that defines everything else in our existence: what is our universe and what is our consciousness, but together, in their whole tangled mess.His conclusion is a bit too much of a concrete cop-out rant on electronics and being present. I believe his real conclusion is that we know what we know, much abstractly, but furthermore that whatever is outside of our observable universe--literally the space beyond the distance that light could have travelled in the universe's existence--is unknowable. For now, at least.Also, his writing is superb.Read it.Tossing it on the Religion shelf because he deals with religion quite a bit."

This is balanced by Lightman's reflections on human nature, our mutual condition, and our place in a vast cosmos beyond our reach. This creates an interesting tension that runs throughout the collection, beginning right at the beginning in the titular essay. Lightman starts with that: ""The history of science can, in fact, be viewed as the recasting of phenomena that were once accepted as 'givens' as phenomena that can now be understood in terms of fundamental causes and principles."" Science peels away layers that obscure the truth at the heart of our universe. However, after centuries of constant triumph, scientists have run into a brick wall. For every new discovery, new questions arise that science may not also be able to answer. After affirming what science has done, he pulls away the table cloth: ""According to the current thinking of many physicists, we are living in one of a vast number of universes.

The last essay in particular, ""The Disembodied Universe,"" veers off into a weird anti-technological rant about how kids these days just Instagram pictures of nature instead of just being in the moment, or something (although I admit the story he recounts about one of his adult daughter's friends playing a song on her iPhone during a dinner he took them out too seemed pretty rude).

It was a further explanation of the state of Physics, written in a very accessible way. I understood almost all of it. There was only one concept that left me scratching my head; I just couldn't quite get it.I like how this author, an atheist, nevertheless treats the Christian point of view with respect, and concedes that Science will never tell us Why, only What and How, and the why, along with the moral uses of science, lies with other ways of knowing, such as religious faith.

What does it mean that our idea of how big the universe is keeps expanding, what does it mean that we interact with these forces through technology as our senses are no longer able to perceive without assistance the newest findings.

Individually, the essays are a bit slight, and the book itself is a trim little document. But it all moves so quickly and even joyfully that the slightness becomes a part of its charm.

235,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4061006-angela,5,"A brief, beautiful book - ho man, it hit me right here, right in the heart. And the brain. Lovely. Sometimes books meet you right where you are and you have, basically, a perfect date with a book. I just had a great, great date with this book. It's brief - <200 pages, or only a couple audiobook commutes. I want to read it again! And everything else by Lightman! Fun fact, but I've had him on my TO-READ list since TWO THOUSAND SIX. 11 years!!!Anyway, this book is kinda similar to Carlo Rovelli's Sette brevi lezioni di fisica (Seven brief lessons in physics), in that it's short, dense, deep, and loving. Very heartening! It's a collection of essays/meditations on cutting edge physics and its intersections with philosophy, cosmic mysteries. There's one essay on how screens mediate our reality too much, with a shout out to Sherry Turkle, and a general sense of aaaaAAAAAAAHHHHHH and our post-human future.So, like Rovelli's book, this covers the cosmic weirdnesses of modern physics - specifically, the multiverse, quantum mechanics, and the time-bendy wavey nature of things very very very great or very very very small. We dwell on why there is anything, and Lightman kinda shook my foundations a little bit by answering it in the usual ways: the multiverse (i.e. this highly improbable, intelligent life-sustaining universe exists because every other possible universe also exists) or, gah, GOD. Theism has all of zero social prestige in my liberal/secular circles, and so I found Lightman's (who notes he is an atheist) discussion of how cosmically improbable a medium zone planet being birthed from a Big Bang with perfectly calibrated levels of hydrogen, ergo First Mover, spooky and disquieting. I mean, when the choice is inscrutable First Mover vs. multiverse, BOTH ARE VERY STRANGE CHOICES. People, it's this or this!? Lightman also sticks it to Dawkins, which was satisfying (Lord, grant me the patience to tolerate Richard frickin Dawkins), and his whole social, professional and spiritual life is centralized around MIT, which was ALSO very satisfying. (Glory, glory be to MIT!) But those two bits are just icing on the cake.Wonderfully written, inspiring, and YES WE SPEND TOO MUCH TIME IN OUR SCREENS. Even though Lightman sounds like a 60+ curmudgeon when he complains about young people ""emailing their Facebooks"" with pictures of nature walks (thus defeating the purpose of the nature walk), I did - basically - 200% AGREE. YA DAMN KIDS WITH YER DAMN BOOK OF FACE!Strongly recommended. Do not wait 11 years to read this."
236,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27614432-justin-tapp,3,"I have read several of Brian Greene's and Stephen Hawking's books detailing the history of modern physics, string theory in its various iterations, and the theoretical possibilities of a multiverse. Lightman does a much better job summing up the philosophical implications of theoretical physics in very stark form. He is also much more transparent about the fact that there are Nobel prize-winning physicists who don't buy the multiverse theory and believe in a Creator and an intelligence behind the design of our universe rather than a theoretically infinite number of universes created by no intelligence. Lightman admits the ""fine-tuning"" of the cosmological constants necessary for our universe to be the way it is are astronomically improbable. While charitable to his colleagues who believe in a higher power, Lightman disagrees with them. In Lightman's view, we are simply a random collection of molecules put together by chance. ""We are an accident,"" he states, a mathematical improbability in our own universe -- ""one millionth of one billionth of a percent in our universe is life"" -- but when the denominator is infinity (the infinite multiverse) improbable is relative. ""Science can never know how universe was created,"" yet he's certain how it was not created.He details early in the book what this means for humans. He loves his daughter, feels attached to her, cares for her. But then he remembers that she's just a random collection of atoms and, like his own atoms, will one day be nothing more than scattered into the universe. He admits this is hard to wrap his mind around, his mind longs for eternity and he is ""self-delusional"" in his longing for immortality. But since everything in the universe decays or dies and the law of entropy says that everything moves from order to disorder there can be nothing more than this. Life is therefore meaningless, absurd. Not since Hawking wrote in Black Holes and Baby Universes that we have two options: God, or grand unifying theory that explains everything from the Big Bang to why I ate a salad for lunch. Hawking rejected the former and later recanted on the GUT (which was supposed to bridge quantum mechanics with the standard model), basically the multiverse via string theory has replaced his GUT. Meaning, again, that both the big bang and my salad were random and need no explanation.It's odd that Lightman even uses the word ""life"" in the book since how do you define a random collection of atoms whose extinguishing means nothing as ""life""? What is consciousness? If I were to kill his daughter, why would that be wrong, I'm just scattering her atoms about the universe? The fact that his brain has evolved to find that idea repulsive is his own problem. Atoms have no ethics and it's silly to call things that are random ""evil."" For an MIT professor who also teaches philosophy he surprisingly doesn't raise the question. Odder still is that he later heralds natural selection and the ability of millions of cells to transmit information when reproducing without noting that some atheist biologists have concluded that this is impossible without some sort of guided process. How did the basic building blocks of life know that they needed to survive? These biologists have followed Lightman's logic to its conclusion, apparently unknown to Lightman himself, that we are the result of a completely random process.I have also read physicist Lee Smolin's The Trouble with Physics, critiquing string theory and modern physics in general. I highly recommend that book to anyone who thinks string theory is all that there is. There are alternative, testable theories out there. Which is another irony because Lightman writes that science ""must be verified and tested"" but doesn't apply this to either string theory or the multiverse. Stephen Hawking wrote in The Universe in a Nutshell that you would need a particle collider larger than the size of the universe to test some aspects of string theory. Yet Lightman hails theoretical physics as ""the purest form of science.""Cosmologist George Ellis was quoted recently in Scientific American criticizing physicists like Lightman and Lawrence Krauss who have moved away from physics and science to pure metaphysical hypotheses which are not testable.""Krauss does not explain in what way these entities could have pre-existed the coming into being of the universe, why they should have existed at all, or why they should have had the form they did. And he gives no experimental or observational process whereby we could test these vivid speculations of the supposed universe-generation mechanism. How indeed can you test what existed before the universe existed? You can’t.""Lightman's essays contradict themselves in this regard: he praises scientific measurement and cheering on the work of phsyics toward a complete set of the fundamental laws of our universe while earlier saying that if the multiverse is true them most of physics is ""useless"" as there is ""no point"" in explaining why things in our universe are the way they are-- it was just random. Other universes are flat, some are round, some are finite, some are infinite, some contain the null set, and in some universes every law that holds in ours doesn't hold, and vice-versa.Lightman contends that a God ""consistent with science"" can only exist outside the universe, never intervening in its immutable, unchangeable laws. This rules out anything miraculous, whether there is evidence or not to the contrary-- and he examines no evidence or testimony of the physically unexplainable. (I read Eric Metaxas' Miracles just prior to this book, the first bit of which argues philosophically against Lightman's conclusions.) God is the watchmaker who let the universe wind up, go and never intervenes, somehow can't intervene without the entire universe falling apart according to Lightman. Lightman rejects the ""immanentism"" of Spinoza and Einstein.The essays also contain brief explanations of the importance of symmetry and discovery of the Higgs-Boson. There is also some overview of philosophical history but nothing in-depth. As I wrote above, he ignores his own theory's implications for ethics and the problem of evil. He writes of how he had somehow a sort of mental connection with a bird once, yet seemingly forgets that this, like his daugher, was purely random and meaningless. He cites plenty of deist scientists along the way, and criticizes Lawrence Krauss for being critical of faith. He considers faith to be rational, and rightly notes many scientific, economic, and political achievements that have come forth from theists who felt their exploration of science was a way to understand better how God created things, wrong-headed though they were. But this again ignores the fact that it's hard to define what is ""ethical"" or an ""advancement"" when we're purely random and there are no consequences, ultimately, for our actions.He concludes the book with some futurist silliness that reminded me of Lightman's fellow multiverse proponent Brian Greene in The Hidden Reality where Greene writes that another plausible alternative to the multiverse is that nothing in our world is actually real, we could all be living in a simulated multiverse. A ""software glitch"" explains why we can't reconcile quantum mechanics and the standard model or discover all of the fundamental laws. We are just Sims in someone's video game, and those playing us are also likely Sims, who are being played by Sims and so on. Physics has truly set philosophy back millenia.As I wrote above, Lightman's work does a great job showing the logical conclusion of the multiverse in a succinct fashion. I recommend reading it for yourself, but only 3.5 stars because as another sympathetic reviewer writing for the left-leaning magazine Salon pointed out: ""Perhaps Lightman contradicts himself."""
237,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103275991-emilie-marshall,0,"Was inspired to pick up this book from some excerpts discussed by David Byrne in his Bicycle Diaries. Some intriguing ideas, as I usually find new curiosities in books about physics made digestible for the common folk such as myself. If I remember correctly there was much scrutiny of the idea that our brains are finite, and that something must always be lost in order to gain something else. I think... Here is the one and only quote I copied down during my reading:""Most of us will adapt to this new way of living the same way that the people of today have adapted to cell phones and Skype. It will be the natural and normal way of being in the world. But here and there, small pockets of people will rebel and establish protected communes, where the newer technologies are left at the front gate-- in the same way that some people today still send handwritten letters and take long walks without their cellphones. In such enclaves, people will feel that they are living a more immediate and authentic life, that they are more connected with themselves and their surroundings. And that will be partly true. Yet they will be also disconnected from the larger world just outside of their gate, invisible in their own way,"" -pg 145While this thought is certainly nothing new or terribly provoking, I think it's an important thought to remind oneself to remember. It's easily one of those things you store away in your ""things I am aware of"" closet where it collects dust and gets forgotten. So pull it off the shelf every once in a while and think about it again!! In my opinion it is a truth that will continue to morph in relevance at constant intervals in one's life."
238,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81065199-caleb,3,"While this book offers an exciting and poetic journey into some of the larger questions of life, existence and our universe, it is barely a scratch at the surface which poses more problems than it answers. Do not pick up this book expecting a scientifically rigorous look at cosmology or dimensionality, as I made the mistake of doing. You need nothing more than a basic understanding of physics and astronomy to grasp a lot of the concepts in this book. On one hand that is good because it makes it accessible to everyone and anyone who wants to get into this sort of philosophical questioning. On the other hand, it makes me wonder what, if anything, this book adds that hasn't already been said before in so many ways. The lyricism in this book is beautiful and enthralling. The way the words come together to form something cohesive is impressive with such disparate and far reaching ideas and anecdotes. I'm never sure where Lightman will take me until I've arrived there. From personal experiences in his own life to vast stretching quasars deep in the cosmos, he somehow relates those things which I thought unrelatable. In that way, I am impressed with his skillful writing and lucid imagery.I am, however, always left feeling as though I've missed something. Each essay reaches an altogether unsatisfying conclusion which I had hoped it would surpass. I wonder, what more is there to say about this topic? Perhaps that is Lightman's clever way of getting me to explore these ideas on my own. Yet, I wanted more than what I got. Something more deeply scientific, some theories about how and why, instead of questions that lead to no answers but instead to casual ""maybe""s and ""we don't know""s. Pick up this book for some poetic stellar imagination, but leave it on the shelf in favor of Hawking or Kaku if you want something that provokes your deeper scientific spirit. The short length and easy narrative makes this book a great starting point for anyone new to physics, philosophy and cosmology. "

This is the exact kind of thing I like to read: not pure science, but a way to think about science. Writing about science that is beautiful and thought-provoking, even inspiring, is rare (Carl Sagan was the very best at this, in my opinion). This book hits all the right notes.The author is a physicist and a fiction writer, so he manages to write about the universe with deep, satisfying prose. In seven short chapters, Mr. Lightman manages to cover the weirdness of the universe, the lawfulness of the universe, the spiritual depth of the universe, and the way that our observation of the universe is entirely dependent on the observers. I am not doing it justice by trying to describe the depth of this man's insights. They are profound.Why is there so much symmetry in the universe? Is there really a multiverse? Why does everything change, and decay? What is consciousness? What is relationship between experiences of transcendence and religion? As I read, I found that both my humanist and pantheist leanings were being highly stimulated. My take away from this book is an astonishing sense of wonder, and reverence. That I am here at all, on this planet, and conscious, is a miracle. My existence, my ability to reason, to observe, and to ponder, is...sacred. Numinous indeed. Literally my favorite kind of writing.

241,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45699572-nadisha,3,"It's clear Alan Lightman is enthralled by what he had discovered in his work as physicist and professor, and that enthusiasm seeps off each page of this book. He constantly illuminates his readers to the wonders of the universe by simplistically explaining complex scientific systems/theories and threading the with psychological and sociological theories on how mankind is and has to deal with these truths. It's a fascinating collection of questions and wonderings, but that was the extent to which I felt engaged. Lightman presents some interesting insight on mankind's need for structure, the laws of nature, and a dimming of the ""vitality of the visible"" realm...but it was nothing monumental. Rather, it felt like general psychological deductions, and the book echoed nothing more, to me, than an effort to get Lightman's readers to awe at the universe and question it as he has. That's not to say he didn't craft beautiful connections between philosophy, literature, science, and religion, but the beauty lay more in the idea of their interconnectedness rather than in the points he was trying to make. If someone were unfamiliar with the scientific truths about the physical universe that Lightman points out, then I can see reading this novel as an enlightening and illuminating experience. However, I already spent a brief portion of my life fascinated by these truths, and though I continue to be dazzled and perplexed by exactly what Lightman illustrates, I hoped to read this and come away with a new fascination to chew on, and that did not occur. Therefore, as an introductory reading (and given the second half of the title, I can't help but assume such was purposed), this is an excellent choice for readers of any age and level of experience in the fields of math/science or the humanities. It'll open your eyes to our broken, self-made realities in order to reveal the startling and nonsensical possibilities of the universe and hopefully motivate you to look at the world through a completely different lens.

He starts this fantastic collection of previously published essays by relating how he met the Dalai Lama at MIT, and it’s exactly this kind of cross-pollinating of the spiritual world with the scientific one that exemplifies this title. “Science,” he writes, “does not reveal the meaning of our existence, but it does draw back some veils.” Much veil-pulling ensues, and like über-dude Isaac Asimov, the good professor focuses on explaining/exploring various topics within cosmology and physics, like dark energy. Mind-boggling facts appear; “If the theoretically possible values for dark energy were marked on a ruler stretching from here to the sun, the value of dark energy actually found in our universe … (10 -8 ergs per cubic centimeter) would be closer to the zero end than the width of an atom.” This title will infuriate intelligent design advocates, for Lightman holds, per the title, that “we are an accident.” And yet the writing is a real and searching investigation at the crux of science and faith. Where else might you read the spiritual version of the second law of thermodynamics—the “arrow of time”—explicated in a way that includes toupees and Botox? VERDICT Part philosophy, part science, this little book is a big fat pleasure to read.

I stopped after the Prologue and a few pages of the first chapter. I just couldn't.This book, instead of trying to tackle microcosms of ""What Is Science?"", goes straight after our own existence, and how our uncertainties of the past turned to certainties only lead to more uncertainties today.Lightman has a wonderful knack for relating the unfathomable and wholly abstract--the size of our universe, the nature of quantum mechanics, unending entropy--to the fathomable yet wholly abstract in our lives--that tiny feeling near the ocean, love, pondering non-existence.In a sense, he does what Canon attempts. He dives deep into one realm of our existence that defines everything else in our existence: what is our universe and what is our consciousness, but together, in their whole tangled mess.His conclusion is a bit too much of a concrete cop-out rant on electronics and being present. I believe his real conclusion is that we know what we know, much abstractly, but furthermore that whatever is outside of our observable universe--literally the space beyond the distance that light could have travelled in the universe's existence--is unknowable. For now, at least.Also, his writing is superb.Read it.Tossing it on the Religion shelf because he deals with religion quite a bit."

This is balanced by Lightman's reflections on human nature, our mutual condition, and our place in a vast cosmos beyond our reach. This creates an interesting tension that runs throughout the collection, beginning right at the beginning in the titular essay. Lightman starts with that: ""The history of science can, in fact, be viewed as the recasting of phenomena that were once accepted as 'givens' as phenomena that can now be understood in terms of fundamental causes and principles."" Science peels away layers that obscure the truth at the heart of our universe. However, after centuries of constant triumph, scientists have run into a brick wall. For every new discovery, new questions arise that science may not also be able to answer. After affirming what science has done, he pulls away the table cloth: ""According to the current thinking of many physicists, we are living in one of a vast number of universes.

The last essay in particular, ""The Disembodied Universe,"" veers off into a weird anti-technological rant about how kids these days just Instagram pictures of nature instead of just being in the moment, or something (although I admit the story he recounts about one of his adult daughter's friends playing a song on her iPhone during a dinner he took them out too seemed pretty rude).

It was a further explanation of the state of Physics, written in a very accessible way. I understood almost all of it. There was only one concept that left me scratching my head; I just couldn't quite get it.I like how this author, an atheist, nevertheless treats the Christian point of view with respect, and concedes that Science will never tell us Why, only What and How, and the why, along with the moral uses of science, lies with other ways of knowing, such as religious faith.

What does it mean that our idea of how big the universe is keeps expanding, what does it mean that we interact with these forces through technology as our senses are no longer able to perceive without assistance the newest findings.

265,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4061006-angela,5,"A brief, beautiful book - ho man, it hit me right here, right in the heart. And the brain. Lovely. Sometimes books meet you right where you are and you have, basically, a perfect date with a book. I just had a great, great date with this book. It's brief - <200 pages, or only a couple audiobook commutes. I want to read it again! And everything else by Lightman! Fun fact, but I've had him on my TO-READ list since TWO THOUSAND SIX. 11 years!!!Anyway, this book is kinda similar to Carlo Rovelli's Sette brevi lezioni di fisica (Seven brief lessons in physics), in that it's short, dense, deep, and loving. Very heartening! It's a collection of essays/meditations on cutting edge physics and its intersections with philosophy, cosmic mysteries. There's one essay on how screens mediate our reality too much, with a shout out to Sherry Turkle, and a general sense of aaaaAAAAAAAHHHHHH and our post-human future.So, like Rovelli's book, this covers the cosmic weirdnesses of modern physics - specifically, the multiverse, quantum mechanics, and the time-bendy wavey nature of things very very very great or very very very small. We dwell on why there is anything, and Lightman kinda shook my foundations a little bit by answering it in the usual ways: the multiverse (i.e. this highly improbable, intelligent life-sustaining universe exists because every other possible universe also exists) or, gah, GOD. Theism has all of zero social prestige in my liberal/secular circles, and so I found Lightman's (who notes he is an atheist) discussion of how cosmically improbable a medium zone planet being birthed from a Big Bang with perfectly calibrated levels of hydrogen, ergo First Mover, spooky and disquieting. I mean, when the choice is inscrutable First Mover vs. multiverse, BOTH ARE VERY STRANGE CHOICES. People, it's this or this!? Lightman also sticks it to Dawkins, which was satisfying (Lord, grant me the patience to tolerate Richard frickin Dawkins), and his whole social, professional and spiritual life is centralized around MIT, which was ALSO very satisfying. (Glory, glory be to MIT!) But those two bits are just icing on the cake.Wonderfully written, inspiring, and YES WE SPEND TOO MUCH TIME IN OUR SCREENS. Even though Lightman sounds like a 60+ curmudgeon when he complains about young people ""emailing their Facebooks"" with pictures of nature walks (thus defeating the purpose of the nature walk), I did - basically - 200% AGREE. YA DAMN KIDS WITH YER DAMN BOOK OF FACE!Strongly recommended. Do not wait 11 years to read this."
266,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27614432-justin-tapp,3,"I have read several of Brian Greene's and Stephen Hawking's books detailing the history of modern physics, string theory in its various iterations, and the theoretical possibilities of a multiverse. Lightman does a much better job summing up the philosophical implications of theoretical physics in very stark form. He is also much more transparent about the fact that there are Nobel prize-winning physicists who don't buy the multiverse theory and believe in a Creator and an intelligence behind the design of our universe rather than a theoretically infinite number of universes created by no intelligence. Lightman admits the ""fine-tuning"" of the cosmological constants necessary for our universe to be the way it is are astronomically improbable. While charitable to his colleagues who believe in a higher power, Lightman disagrees with them. In Lightman's view, we are simply a random collection of molecules put together by chance. ""We are an accident,"" he states, a mathematical improbability in our own universe -- ""one millionth of one billionth of a percent in our universe is life"" -- but when the denominator is infinity (the infinite multiverse) improbable is relative. ""Science can never know how universe was created,"" yet he's certain how it was not created.He details early in the book what this means for humans. He loves his daughter, feels attached to her, cares for her. But then he remembers that she's just a random collection of atoms and, like his own atoms, will one day be nothing more than scattered into the universe. He admits this is hard to wrap his mind around, his mind longs for eternity and he is ""self-delusional"" in his longing for immortality. But since everything in the universe decays or dies and the law of entropy says that everything moves from order to disorder there can be nothing more than this. Life is therefore meaningless, absurd. Not since Hawking wrote in Black Holes and Baby Universes that we have two options: God, or grand unifying theory that explains everything from the Big Bang to why I ate a salad for lunch. Hawking rejected the former and later recanted on the GUT (which was supposed to bridge quantum mechanics with the standard model), basically the multiverse via string theory has replaced his GUT. Meaning, again, that both the big bang and my salad were random and need no explanation.It's odd that Lightman even uses the word ""life"" in the book since how do you define a random collection of atoms whose extinguishing means nothing as ""life""? What is consciousness? If I were to kill his daughter, why would that be wrong, I'm just scattering her atoms about the universe? The fact that his brain has evolved to find that idea repulsive is his own problem. Atoms have no ethics and it's silly to call things that are random ""evil."" For an MIT professor who also teaches philosophy he surprisingly doesn't raise the question. Odder still is that he later heralds natural selection and the ability of millions of cells to transmit information when reproducing without noting that some atheist biologists have concluded that this is impossible without some sort of guided process. How did the basic building blocks of life know that they needed to survive? These biologists have followed Lightman's logic to its conclusion, apparently unknown to Lightman himself, that we are the result of a completely random process.I have also read physicist Lee Smolin's The Trouble with Physics, critiquing string theory and modern physics in general. I highly recommend that book to anyone who thinks string theory is all that there is. There are alternative, testable theories out there. Which is another irony because Lightman writes that science ""must be verified and tested"" but doesn't apply this to either string theory or the multiverse. Stephen Hawking wrote in The Universe in a Nutshell that you would need a particle collider larger than the size of the universe to test some aspects of string theory. Yet Lightman hails theoretical physics as ""the purest form of science.""Cosmologist George Ellis was quoted recently in Scientific American criticizing physicists like Lightman and Lawrence Krauss who have moved away from physics and science to pure metaphysical hypotheses which are not testable.""Krauss does not explain in what way these entities could have pre-existed the coming into being of the universe, why they should have existed at all, or why they should have had the form they did. And he gives no experimental or observational process whereby we could test these vivid speculations of the supposed universe-generation mechanism. How indeed can you test what existed before the universe existed? You can’t.""Lightman's essays contradict themselves in this regard: he praises scientific measurement and cheering on the work of phsyics toward a complete set of the fundamental laws of our universe while earlier saying that if the multiverse is true them most of physics is ""useless"" as there is ""no point"" in explaining why things in our universe are the way they are-- it was just random. Other universes are flat, some are round, some are finite, some are infinite, some contain the null set, and in some universes every law that holds in ours doesn't hold, and vice-versa.Lightman contends that a God ""consistent with science"" can only exist outside the universe, never intervening in its immutable, unchangeable laws. This rules out anything miraculous, whether there is evidence or not to the contrary-- and he examines no evidence or testimony of the physically unexplainable. (I read Eric Metaxas' Miracles just prior to this book, the first bit of which argues philosophically against Lightman's conclusions.) God is the watchmaker who let the universe wind up, go and never intervenes, somehow can't intervene without the entire universe falling apart according to Lightman. Lightman rejects the ""immanentism"" of Spinoza and Einstein.The essays also contain brief explanations of the importance of symmetry and discovery of the Higgs-Boson. There is also some overview of philosophical history but nothing in-depth. As I wrote above, he ignores his own theory's implications for ethics and the problem of evil. He writes of how he had somehow a sort of mental connection with a bird once, yet seemingly forgets that this, like his daugher, was purely random and meaningless. He cites plenty of deist scientists along the way, and criticizes Lawrence Krauss for being critical of faith. He considers faith to be rational, and rightly notes many scientific, economic, and political achievements that have come forth from theists who felt their exploration of science was a way to understand better how God created things, wrong-headed though they were. But this again ignores the fact that it's hard to define what is ""ethical"" or an ""advancement"" when we're purely random and there are no consequences, ultimately, for our actions.He concludes the book with some futurist silliness that reminded me of Lightman's fellow multiverse proponent Brian Greene in The Hidden Reality where Greene writes that another plausible alternative to the multiverse is that nothing in our world is actually real, we could all be living in a simulated multiverse. A ""software glitch"" explains why we can't reconcile quantum mechanics and the standard model or discover all of the fundamental laws. We are just Sims in someone's video game, and those playing us are also likely Sims, who are being played by Sims and so on. Physics has truly set philosophy back millenia.As I wrote above, Lightman's work does a great job showing the logical conclusion of the multiverse in a succinct fashion. I recommend reading it for yourself, but only 3.5 stars because as another sympathetic reviewer writing for the left-leaning magazine Salon pointed out: ""Perhaps Lightman contradicts himself."""
267,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103275991-emilie-marshall,0,"Was inspired to pick up this book from some excerpts discussed by David Byrne in his Bicycle Diaries. Some intriguing ideas, as I usually find new curiosities in books about physics made digestible for the common folk such as myself. If I remember correctly there was much scrutiny of the idea that our brains are finite, and that something must always be lost in order to gain something else. I think... Here is the one and only quote I copied down during my reading:""Most of us will adapt to this new way of living the same way that the people of today have adapted to cell phones and Skype. It will be the natural and normal way of being in the world. But here and there, small pockets of people will rebel and establish protected communes, where the newer technologies are left at the front gate-- in the same way that some people today still send handwritten letters and take long walks without their cellphones. In such enclaves, people will feel that they are living a more immediate and authentic life, that they are more connected with themselves and their surroundings. And that will be partly true. Yet they will be also disconnected from the larger world just outside of their gate, invisible in their own way,"" -pg 145While this thought is certainly nothing new or terribly provoking, I think it's an important thought to remind oneself to remember. It's easily one of those things you store away in your ""things I am aware of"" closet where it collects dust and gets forgotten. So pull it off the shelf every once in a while and think about it again!! In my opinion it is a truth that will continue to morph in relevance at constant intervals in one's life."
268,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81065199-caleb,3,"While this book offers an exciting and poetic journey into some of the larger questions of life, existence and our universe, it is barely a scratch at the surface which poses more problems than it answers. Do not pick up this book expecting a scientifically rigorous look at cosmology or dimensionality, as I made the mistake of doing. You need nothing more than a basic understanding of physics and astronomy to grasp a lot of the concepts in this book. On one hand that is good because it makes it accessible to everyone and anyone who wants to get into this sort of philosophical questioning. On the other hand, it makes me wonder what, if anything, this book adds that hasn't already been said before in so many ways. The lyricism in this book is beautiful and enthralling. The way the words come together to form something cohesive is impressive with such disparate and far reaching ideas and anecdotes. I'm never sure where Lightman will take me until I've arrived there. From personal experiences in his own life to vast stretching quasars deep in the cosmos, he somehow relates those things which I thought unrelatable. In that way, I am impressed with his skillful writing and lucid imagery.I am, however, always left feeling as though I've missed something. Each essay reaches an altogether unsatisfying conclusion which I had hoped it would surpass. I wonder, what more is there to say about this topic? Perhaps that is Lightman's clever way of getting me to explore these ideas on my own. Yet, I wanted more than what I got. Something more deeply scientific, some theories about how and why, instead of questions that lead to no answers but instead to casual ""maybe""s and ""we don't know""s. Pick up this book for some poetic stellar imagination, but leave it on the shelf in favor of Hawking or Kaku if you want something that provokes your deeper scientific spirit. The short length and easy narrative makes this book a great starting point for anyone new to physics, philosophy and cosmology. "

This is the exact kind of thing I like to read: not pure science, but a way to think about science. Writing about science that is beautiful and thought-provoking, even inspiring, is rare (Carl Sagan was the very best at this, in my opinion). This book hits all the right notes.The author is a physicist and a fiction writer, so he manages to write about the universe with deep, satisfying prose. In seven short chapters, Mr. Lightman manages to cover the weirdness of the universe, the lawfulness of the universe, the spiritual depth of the universe, and the way that our observation of the universe is entirely dependent on the observers. I am not doing it justice by trying to describe the depth of this man's insights. They are profound.Why is there so much symmetry in the universe? Is there really a multiverse? Why does everything change, and decay? What is consciousness? What is relationship between experiences of transcendence and religion? As I read, I found that both my humanist and pantheist leanings were being highly stimulated. My take away from this book is an astonishing sense of wonder, and reverence. That I am here at all, on this planet, and conscious, is a miracle. My existence, my ability to reason, to observe, and to ponder, is...sacred. Numinous indeed. Literally my favorite kind of writing.

271,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45699572-nadisha,3,"It's clear Alan Lightman is enthralled by what he had discovered in his work as physicist and professor, and that enthusiasm seeps off each page of this book. He constantly illuminates his readers to the wonders of the universe by simplistically explaining complex scientific systems/theories and threading the with psychological and sociological theories on how mankind is and has to deal with these truths. It's a fascinating collection of questions and wonderings, but that was the extent to which I felt engaged. Lightman presents some interesting insight on mankind's need for structure, the laws of nature, and a dimming of the ""vitality of the visible"" realm...but it was nothing monumental. Rather, it felt like general psychological deductions, and the book echoed nothing more, to me, than an effort to get Lightman's readers to awe at the universe and question it as he has. That's not to say he didn't craft beautiful connections between philosophy, literature, science, and religion, but the beauty lay more in the idea of their interconnectedness rather than in the points he was trying to make. If someone were unfamiliar with the scientific truths about the physical universe that Lightman points out, then I can see reading this novel as an enlightening and illuminating experience. However, I already spent a brief portion of my life fascinated by these truths, and though I continue to be dazzled and perplexed by exactly what Lightman illustrates, I hoped to read this and come away with a new fascination to chew on, and that did not occur. Therefore, as an introductory reading (and given the second half of the title, I can't help but assume such was purposed), this is an excellent choice for readers of any age and level of experience in the fields of math/science or the humanities. It'll open your eyes to our broken, self-made realities in order to reveal the startling and nonsensical possibilities of the universe and hopefully motivate you to look at the world through a completely different lens.

He starts this fantastic collection of previously published essays by relating how he met the Dalai Lama at MIT, and it’s exactly this kind of cross-pollinating of the spiritual world with the scientific one that exemplifies this title. “Science,” he writes, “does not reveal the meaning of our existence, but it does draw back some veils.” Much veil-pulling ensues, and like über-dude Isaac Asimov, the good professor focuses on explaining/exploring various topics within cosmology and physics, like dark energy. Mind-boggling facts appear; “If the theoretically possible values for dark energy were marked on a ruler stretching from here to the sun, the value of dark energy actually found in our universe … (10 -8 ergs per cubic centimeter) would be closer to the zero end than the width of an atom.” This title will infuriate intelligent design advocates, for Lightman holds, per the title, that “we are an accident.” And yet the writing is a real and searching investigation at the crux of science and faith. Where else might you read the spiritual version of the second law of thermodynamics—the “arrow of time”—explicated in a way that includes toupees and Botox? VERDICT Part philosophy, part science, this little book is a big fat pleasure to read.

I stopped after the Prologue and a few pages of the first chapter. I just couldn't.This book, instead of trying to tackle microcosms of ""What Is Science?"", goes straight after our own existence, and how our uncertainties of the past turned to certainties only lead to more uncertainties today.Lightman has a wonderful knack for relating the unfathomable and wholly abstract--the size of our universe, the nature of quantum mechanics, unending entropy--to the fathomable yet wholly abstract in our lives--that tiny feeling near the ocean, love, pondering non-existence.In a sense, he does what Canon attempts. He dives deep into one realm of our existence that defines everything else in our existence: what is our universe and what is our consciousness, but together, in their whole tangled mess.His conclusion is a bit too much of a concrete cop-out rant on electronics and being present. I believe his real conclusion is that we know what we know, much abstractly, but furthermore that whatever is outside of our observable universe--literally the space beyond the distance that light could have travelled in the universe's existence--is unknowable. For now, at least.Also, his writing is superb.Read it.Tossing it on the Religion shelf because he deals with religion quite a bit."

This is balanced by Lightman's reflections on human nature, our mutual condition, and our place in a vast cosmos beyond our reach. This creates an interesting tension that runs throughout the collection, beginning right at the beginning in the titular essay. Lightman starts with that: ""The history of science can, in fact, be viewed as the recasting of phenomena that were once accepted as 'givens' as phenomena that can now be understood in terms of fundamental causes and principles."" Science peels away layers that obscure the truth at the heart of our universe. However, after centuries of constant triumph, scientists have run into a brick wall. For every new discovery, new questions arise that science may not also be able to answer. After affirming what science has done, he pulls away the table cloth: ""According to the current thinking of many physicists, we are living in one of a vast number of universes.

The last essay in particular, ""The Disembodied Universe,"" veers off into a weird anti-technological rant about how kids these days just Instagram pictures of nature instead of just being in the moment, or something (although I admit the story he recounts about one of his adult daughter's friends playing a song on her iPhone during a dinner he took them out too seemed pretty rude).

It was a further explanation of the state of Physics, written in a very accessible way. I understood almost all of it. There was only one concept that left me scratching my head; I just couldn't quite get it.I like how this author, an atheist, nevertheless treats the Christian point of view with respect, and concedes that Science will never tell us Why, only What and How, and the why, along with the moral uses of science, lies with other ways of knowing, such as religious faith.

What does it mean that our idea of how big the universe is keeps expanding, what does it mean that we interact with these forces through technology as our senses are no longer able to perceive without assistance the newest findings.

It touches on astronomy, cosmology, physics and our place in the world. It is a short book on big questions. It is a pleasant read but a little on the light side. It was fun but I think I would have enjoyed it more if it was a little more meaty. Not bad though."
286,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4442364-franz,4,"Elegantly written meditations on physics, spirituality, and the mysteries of what is known and what cannot be known. The author bridges the artificial gap between the sciences and the humanities, as one might expect of a best selling novelist who has taught both physics and creative writing at MIT. Intelligent, learned, and accessible."

There's very little science, and that was my biggest disappointment. I also wanted more space (or at least more physics), though that was my fault for not reading the back of the book carefully enough."

I was expecting more."
289,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2296903-jana,5,This has never happened to me before. My body hums when I read this book; it resonates with everything that I started asking myself and on each page I see fractions of my thoughts and then answers that are still too eloquent for me to express them on my own. 
290,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17046765-dylan-jack,1,It was pretty interesting until the last chapter where he goes on a rant about people using their phones too much. If you stop reading before the last chapter it's alot of fun and gives you alot to think about.

295,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4061006-angela,5,"A brief, beautiful book - ho man, it hit me right here, right in the heart. And the brain. Lovely. Sometimes books meet you right where you are and you have, basically, a perfect date with a book. I just had a great, great date with this book. It's brief - <200 pages, or only a couple audiobook commutes. I want to read it again! And everything else by Lightman! Fun fact, but I've had him on my TO-READ list since TWO THOUSAND SIX. 11 years!!!Anyway, this book is kinda similar to Carlo Rovelli's Sette brevi lezioni di fisica (Seven brief lessons in physics), in that it's short, dense, deep, and loving. Very heartening! It's a collection of essays/meditations on cutting edge physics and its intersections with philosophy, cosmic mysteries. There's one essay on how screens mediate our reality too much, with a shout out to Sherry Turkle, and a general sense of aaaaAAAAAAAHHHHHH and our post-human future.So, like Rovelli's book, this covers the cosmic weirdnesses of modern physics - specifically, the multiverse, quantum mechanics, and the time-bendy wavey nature of things very very very great or very very very small. We dwell on why there is anything, and Lightman kinda shook my foundations a little bit by answering it in the usual ways: the multiverse (i.e. this highly improbable, intelligent life-sustaining universe exists because every other possible universe also exists) or, gah, GOD. Theism has all of zero social prestige in my liberal/secular circles, and so I found Lightman's (who notes he is an atheist) discussion of how cosmically improbable a medium zone planet being birthed from a Big Bang with perfectly calibrated levels of hydrogen, ergo First Mover, spooky and disquieting. I mean, when the choice is inscrutable First Mover vs. multiverse, BOTH ARE VERY STRANGE CHOICES. People, it's this or this!? Lightman also sticks it to Dawkins, which was satisfying (Lord, grant me the patience to tolerate Richard frickin Dawkins), and his whole social, professional and spiritual life is centralized around MIT, which was ALSO very satisfying. (Glory, glory be to MIT!) But those two bits are just icing on the cake.Wonderfully written, inspiring, and YES WE SPEND TOO MUCH TIME IN OUR SCREENS. Even though Lightman sounds like a 60+ curmudgeon when he complains about young people ""emailing their Facebooks"" with pictures of nature walks (thus defeating the purpose of the nature walk), I did - basically - 200% AGREE. YA DAMN KIDS WITH YER DAMN BOOK OF FACE!Strongly recommended. Do not wait 11 years to read this."
296,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27614432-justin-tapp,3,"I have read several of Brian Greene's and Stephen Hawking's books detailing the history of modern physics, string theory in its various iterations, and the theoretical possibilities of a multiverse. Lightman does a much better job summing up the philosophical implications of theoretical physics in very stark form. He is also much more transparent about the fact that there are Nobel prize-winning physicists who don't buy the multiverse theory and believe in a Creator and an intelligence behind the design of our universe rather than a theoretically infinite number of universes created by no intelligence. Lightman admits the ""fine-tuning"" of the cosmological constants necessary for our universe to be the way it is are astronomically improbable. While charitable to his colleagues who believe in a higher power, Lightman disagrees with them. In Lightman's view, we are simply a random collection of molecules put together by chance. ""We are an accident,"" he states, a mathematical improbability in our own universe -- ""one millionth of one billionth of a percent in our universe is life"" -- but when the denominator is infinity (the infinite multiverse) improbable is relative. ""Science can never know how universe was created,"" yet he's certain how it was not created.He details early in the book what this means for humans. He loves his daughter, feels attached to her, cares for her. But then he remembers that she's just a random collection of atoms and, like his own atoms, will one day be nothing more than scattered into the universe. He admits this is hard to wrap his mind around, his mind longs for eternity and he is ""self-delusional"" in his longing for immortality. But since everything in the universe decays or dies and the law of entropy says that everything moves from order to disorder there can be nothing more than this. Life is therefore meaningless, absurd. Not since Hawking wrote in Black Holes and Baby Universes that we have two options: God, or grand unifying theory that explains everything from the Big Bang to why I ate a salad for lunch. Hawking rejected the former and later recanted on the GUT (which was supposed to bridge quantum mechanics with the standard model), basically the multiverse via string theory has replaced his GUT. Meaning, again, that both the big bang and my salad were random and need no explanation.It's odd that Lightman even uses the word ""life"" in the book since how do you define a random collection of atoms whose extinguishing means nothing as ""life""? What is consciousness? If I were to kill his daughter, why would that be wrong, I'm just scattering her atoms about the universe? The fact that his brain has evolved to find that idea repulsive is his own problem. Atoms have no ethics and it's silly to call things that are random ""evil."" For an MIT professor who also teaches philosophy he surprisingly doesn't raise the question. Odder still is that he later heralds natural selection and the ability of millions of cells to transmit information when reproducing without noting that some atheist biologists have concluded that this is impossible without some sort of guided process. How did the basic building blocks of life know that they needed to survive? These biologists have followed Lightman's logic to its conclusion, apparently unknown to Lightman himself, that we are the result of a completely random process.I have also read physicist Lee Smolin's The Trouble with Physics, critiquing string theory and modern physics in general. I highly recommend that book to anyone who thinks string theory is all that there is. There are alternative, testable theories out there. Which is another irony because Lightman writes that science ""must be verified and tested"" but doesn't apply this to either string theory or the multiverse. Stephen Hawking wrote in The Universe in a Nutshell that you would need a particle collider larger than the size of the universe to test some aspects of string theory. Yet Lightman hails theoretical physics as ""the purest form of science.""Cosmologist George Ellis was quoted recently in Scientific American criticizing physicists like Lightman and Lawrence Krauss who have moved away from physics and science to pure metaphysical hypotheses which are not testable.""Krauss does not explain in what way these entities could have pre-existed the coming into being of the universe, why they should have existed at all, or why they should have had the form they did. And he gives no experimental or observational process whereby we could test these vivid speculations of the supposed universe-generation mechanism. How indeed can you test what existed before the universe existed? You can’t.""Lightman's essays contradict themselves in this regard: he praises scientific measurement and cheering on the work of phsyics toward a complete set of the fundamental laws of our universe while earlier saying that if the multiverse is true them most of physics is ""useless"" as there is ""no point"" in explaining why things in our universe are the way they are-- it was just random. Other universes are flat, some are round, some are finite, some are infinite, some contain the null set, and in some universes every law that holds in ours doesn't hold, and vice-versa.Lightman contends that a God ""consistent with science"" can only exist outside the universe, never intervening in its immutable, unchangeable laws. This rules out anything miraculous, whether there is evidence or not to the contrary-- and he examines no evidence or testimony of the physically unexplainable. (I read Eric Metaxas' Miracles just prior to this book, the first bit of which argues philosophically against Lightman's conclusions.) God is the watchmaker who let the universe wind up, go and never intervenes, somehow can't intervene without the entire universe falling apart according to Lightman. Lightman rejects the ""immanentism"" of Spinoza and Einstein.The essays also contain brief explanations of the importance of symmetry and discovery of the Higgs-Boson. There is also some overview of philosophical history but nothing in-depth. As I wrote above, he ignores his own theory's implications for ethics and the problem of evil. He writes of how he had somehow a sort of mental connection with a bird once, yet seemingly forgets that this, like his daugher, was purely random and meaningless. He cites plenty of deist scientists along the way, and criticizes Lawrence Krauss for being critical of faith. He considers faith to be rational, and rightly notes many scientific, economic, and political achievements that have come forth from theists who felt their exploration of science was a way to understand better how God created things, wrong-headed though they were. But this again ignores the fact that it's hard to define what is ""ethical"" or an ""advancement"" when we're purely random and there are no consequences, ultimately, for our actions.He concludes the book with some futurist silliness that reminded me of Lightman's fellow multiverse proponent Brian Greene in The Hidden Reality where Greene writes that another plausible alternative to the multiverse is that nothing in our world is actually real, we could all be living in a simulated multiverse. A ""software glitch"" explains why we can't reconcile quantum mechanics and the standard model or discover all of the fundamental laws. We are just Sims in someone's video game, and those playing us are also likely Sims, who are being played by Sims and so on. Physics has truly set philosophy back millenia.As I wrote above, Lightman's work does a great job showing the logical conclusion of the multiverse in a succinct fashion. I recommend reading it for yourself, but only 3.5 stars because as another sympathetic reviewer writing for the left-leaning magazine Salon pointed out: ""Perhaps Lightman contradicts himself."""
297,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103275991-emilie-marshall,0,"Was inspired to pick up this book from some excerpts discussed by David Byrne in his Bicycle Diaries. Some intriguing ideas, as I usually find new curiosities in books about physics made digestible for the common folk such as myself. If I remember correctly there was much scrutiny of the idea that our brains are finite, and that something must always be lost in order to gain something else. I think... Here is the one and only quote I copied down during my reading:""Most of us will adapt to this new way of living the same way that the people of today have adapted to cell phones and Skype. It will be the natural and normal way of being in the world. But here and there, small pockets of people will rebel and establish protected communes, where the newer technologies are left at the front gate-- in the same way that some people today still send handwritten letters and take long walks without their cellphones. In such enclaves, people will feel that they are living a more immediate and authentic life, that they are more connected with themselves and their surroundings. And that will be partly true. Yet they will be also disconnected from the larger world just outside of their gate, invisible in their own way,"" -pg 145While this thought is certainly nothing new or terribly provoking, I think it's an important thought to remind oneself to remember. It's easily one of those things you store away in your ""things I am aware of"" closet where it collects dust and gets forgotten. So pull it off the shelf every once in a while and think about it again!! In my opinion it is a truth that will continue to morph in relevance at constant intervals in one's life."
298,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81065199-caleb,3,"While this book offers an exciting and poetic journey into some of the larger questions of life, existence and our universe, it is barely a scratch at the surface which poses more problems than it answers. Do not pick up this book expecting a scientifically rigorous look at cosmology or dimensionality, as I made the mistake of doing. You need nothing more than a basic understanding of physics and astronomy to grasp a lot of the concepts in this book. On one hand that is good because it makes it accessible to everyone and anyone who wants to get into this sort of philosophical questioning. On the other hand, it makes me wonder what, if anything, this book adds that hasn't already been said before in so many ways. The lyricism in this book is beautiful and enthralling. The way the words come together to form something cohesive is impressive with such disparate and far reaching ideas and anecdotes. I'm never sure where Lightman will take me until I've arrived there. From personal experiences in his own life to vast stretching quasars deep in the cosmos, he somehow relates those things which I thought unrelatable. In that way, I am impressed with his skillful writing and lucid imagery.I am, however, always left feeling as though I've missed something. Each essay reaches an altogether unsatisfying conclusion which I had hoped it would surpass. I wonder, what more is there to say about this topic? Perhaps that is Lightman's clever way of getting me to explore these ideas on my own. Yet, I wanted more than what I got. Something more deeply scientific, some theories about how and why, instead of questions that lead to no answers but instead to casual ""maybe""s and ""we don't know""s. Pick up this book for some poetic stellar imagination, but leave it on the shelf in favor of Hawking or Kaku if you want something that provokes your deeper scientific spirit. The short length and easy narrative makes this book a great starting point for anyone new to physics, philosophy and cosmology. "
299,0307908585,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3506592-michael,5,"Marvelous book about science, and wonder. This is the exact kind of thing I like to read: not pure science, but a way to think about science. Writing about science that is beautiful and thought-provoking, even inspiring, is rare (Carl Sagan was the very best at this, in my opinion). This book hits all the right notes.The author is a physicist and a fiction writer, so he manages to write about the universe with deep, satisfying prose. In seven short chapters, Mr. Lightman manages to cover the weirdness of the universe, the lawfulness of the universe, the spiritual depth of the universe, and the way that our observation of the universe is entirely dependent on the observers. I am not doing it justice by trying to describe the depth of this man's insights. They are profound.Why is there so much symmetry in the universe? Is there really a multiverse? Why does everything change, and decay? What is consciousness? What is relationship between experiences of transcendence and religion? As I read, I found that both my humanist and pantheist leanings were being highly stimulated. My take away from this book is an astonishing sense of wonder, and reverence. That I am here at all, on this planet, and conscious, is a miracle. My existence, my ability to reason, to observe, and to ponder, is...sacred. Numinous indeed. Literally my favorite kind of writing.
