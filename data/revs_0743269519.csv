I would like to make clear that David Hasselhoff's appearance in this review should in no way be deemed to imply that I endorse or support his career in any way whatsoever.Thank you for your understanding.
 FIVE ""PRACTICAL"" HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLEFirst, a few comments on the seven so-called “habits” identified in the book, namely:1.Be proactive, 2.Begin with the End in Mind, 3. Put First Things First, 4. Think Win-Win, 5. Seek First to Understand, then to be understood, 6. Synergize, and7. Sharpen the SawIn a word…..crap!! In several words, what a giant, steaming pile of new-age, masturbatory, corp-lingo, platitude spewing bullshit. Think Win-Win…are you kidding me with this Jim Jones Kool-aid party chant? Synergize….just hearing that word makes me throw up in my mouth.Sharpen the saw….exactly…reading that phrase makes me literally want to sharpen the saw and slice a hate filled path through the contents of this book. This book is like a giant fortune cookie full of sounds good but says nothing. My advice: rather than read this book, go get a six pack or a bottle of wine, grab some China Mieville or Dan Simmons and find a nice comfy tree to sit under while you read something that might actually expand your mind. Now I certainly don't have any foolproof answers or magic exercises that will help you bring out the ""inner-winner"" inside you. However, I did come up five pracical (and hopefully a little humorous) habits that have proven to be pretty effective at making people successful in their chosen field (tongue planted firmly in cheek). 1.  EMBRACE TECHNOLOGY AND MEDICAL SCIENCE TO BECOME THE BEST YOU CAN BE

2. BE BOLD, BE DARING AND DELIVER TO THE MARKETPLACE THE NEXT BIG THING 

3. DON’T BE AFRAID TO USE THE FORCE TO ACCOMPLISH YOUR GOAL

4. GET IN GOOD WITH THE GERMANS

5. BE RUTHLESS PROACTIVE IN DEALING WITH THE COMPETITION

THE END.....

1,0743269519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,4,"This book explains 7 principles that make a person more effective personally and professionally. Covey shows how a principle-centered, character-based life helps you build the healthy relationships that are key to an effective life. This classic is well worth reading for its perspective and practical advice.ConceptsCorrect Principles: Covey frequently references his Christianity. He says the Habits are based on ""Correct Principles"" (aka Natural Law) found in Judeo-Christian scriptures and common to major religions.P/PC Balance: Covey says you must maintain a balance between production (P; your output) and production capability (PC; your ability to produce). You must stay healthy and renew yourself (see Habit 7) or you'll get burned out and become ineffective. He uses the fable of the Goose and the Golden Egg as a metaphor.Interdependence: Covey says the Habits lead you from dependence to independence to interdependence (cooperating with others to achieve a common goal; producing things greater than the sum of their parts).The 7 HabitsHabit 1: Be ProactiveYou choose how to respond to what life throws at you. Between stimulus and response lies your freedom to choose. Take responsibility for your actions.Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind Choose your short-term, daily behavior according to the plan you have for your entire life. Think about the legacy you want to leave. Put things in perspective; what would you want people to say at your funeral?Habit 3: Put First Things FirstDaily planning is too narrow and short-sighted. Weekly planning gives a better big-picture perspective of your goals, and allows for the flexibility to deal with the things that will inevitably come up.People are more important than things, so plan your time accordingly. Be efficient with things, but effective with people. You can't be efficient with relationships; they take time. Instead of focusing on things and time, focus on relationships and results.Only spend time on things that align with your deep values. Don't waste time on other things, even if it means saying no to requests. Don't prioritize your schedule; schedule your priorities.Think of tasks in terms of urgency and importance. Focus on the important, even though they seem less urgent. Think preventatively to keep tasks from ever becoming urgent.Use stewardship delegation instead of ""gofer"" delegation; teach a person to be the steward of the task you assign to them, rather than constantly telling them to ""go for this"" or ""go for that.""Habit 4: Think Win/WinMost of life requires cooperation, not competition. Work together with co-workers, friends, and family for mutual benefit. Approach everything in terms of ""win/win or no deal""; if you can't reach a deal in which both parties feel they're winning, don't make a deal at all. Create win/win agreements that clearly state expectations, privileges, consequences up front. This prevents you from having to figure those things out when issues arise, and makes the relationship more smooth because it causes each person to manage themselves.Think in terms of the Abundance Mentality rather than the Scarcity Mentality; the quest for recognition, credit, power, and profit isn't a zero-sum game. Be happy when others succeed.Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to be UnderstoodListen with the intent to understand, not to reply. Diagnose before you prescribe. Understand needs, concerns, situation before you give advice.To understand others, listen with empathy. To be understood, present your views according to:ethos: personal credibilitypathos: emotional alignment with the other personlogos: logical reasoningYou can't motivate people by appealing to satisfied needs (money, status, etc.); only unsatisfied needs motivate.Habit 6: Synergize.Value the differences in relationships. Oneness is not sameness, it's complementariness. Unity is not uniformity.Habit 7: Sharpen the SawRenew and improve in yourself in the following categories, by spending at least an hour each day.• Physical: Eat right and exercise.• Spiritual: Find and carry an inner peace. Meditate, read scripture, or spend time in nature.• Mental: Read good literature to gain the insights of others. Write, organize, and plan.• Social/emotional: Understand others. Serve others, at work or through volunteering.AfterwardCovey says a summary of the first 3 Habits is ""make and keep a promise,"" and a summary of the next 3 Habits is ""involve others in the problem and work out the solution together."" He says the first 3 Habits are about integrity, and the next 3 are about loyalty."
2,0743269519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/395524-virginia,5,"Ever since I worked at the bookstore at Virginia Tech, I would watch the douchebag* business major undergrads buy this book for their classes and look down upon them, and the book by association, as, well, douchebags.*This is not to say that all undergrad business majors are douchebags. I've met one really really awesome one. Additionally, after working at a major university bookstore, a majority of all undergrad students can be fairly classified as douchebags. Jebus.Consequently, I never picked up this book. I hated the people who were reading it for class. I hated the people who were assigning it for their classes. I hated my job and I hated the area that I was living in. (I was, yes indeedy, a hater)Obviously it wasn't the right time for me to read it.My current boss (who is only occasionally a douchebag) is doing this huge self-help/life plan program, and from it, there is a major reading list. As I am a wee bit addicted to books, I immediately agreed, and when I started searching on Amazon for the reading list, ""7 Habits"" appeared on pretty much every single page. So I picked that one up too.Excellent decision. I chose to read it first. It has taken me, probably three weeks to read it. I have ordered (with my boss' blessing) ""The 8th Habit"" and will read that shortly.Every single page I found something that made me put the book down for a couple of minutes and think about it. I already know that I'm going to have to re-read this at some point in the near future. I would say this is required reading for humanity, but my father would have been the exception to that rule.Basically, this book will teach you about effective ways to be a compassionate, kind, enjoyable human being. It will teach you about personal responsibility (personal as in to your self, and to others). It will teach you how to be a better parent, employee, spouse, daughter, or boss. I can't give it enough praise. It is a truly outstanding book."
3,0743269519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/128745-malbadeen,1,"I think the sign of a great book is when, right inside the cover there is a pull out brochure that encourages you to order more of the authors products - that's some quality shit when you see that.But the book itself, well it has charts: flow charts, boxed charts, circle charts, up and down charts, sideways charts, charts with arrows, charts with triangles and charts with dotted lines.This book uses words like ""synergy"" and ""proactive""....repeatedly This book has ""application suggestions"". This book is shiny and it has 6 pages of recommendations before the title page. This book makes me want to barf - A LOT! so much so, that I could even stop watching what I eat because I'd be barfing up all the calories anyway. I could eat and eat and eat and barf and barf and barf and it wouldn't be a disorder because it would all happen naturally - no effort on my part, just read and barf, read and barf - like that.This book is my assigned reading for tonight, this review received more of my attention than the assigned reading will."

You look kinda weird.- Well, I don't know how to say this...- Yes?- I had this dream where I talked with God.- Was She black?- No, I'm serious! I did! It was, like, utterly real. It was the most real thing that's ever happened to me.The rest of this review is available elsewhere (the location cannot be given for Goodreads policy reasons) "
5,0743269519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat,0,"This was recommended reading following on from a course and I found it to be an odd mix of the homely and the disturbing.On the whole it's probably the dogmatic air of absolute certainty that I find disturbing, that and the way he describes how he reduced his son to tears over keeping the garden in good order. Reading this book is rather like having a very one-sided conversation with a particularly earnest and opinionated drunk who isn't shy to jab you in the chest with a fore-finger to underline a point. That's not to say that the seven habits are bad, far from it. They are a quite reasonable and potentially useful set of habits. Whether effective people tend to have these habits or if having these habits will make you more effective is presumed but not proven by this book which is heavily anecdotal, but that is neither here nor there. The power of the argument and the vast number of sales lies in how the seven habits tap into our moral beliefs about the kind of habits we want to be able to have to make us successful, and more to the point the kind of habits that we want to believe make people successful, and in the great tradition of self help books it asserts the primacy of the individual will over any and all other circumstances. No war, want, injustice, disease, political, economic or social structure can hinder the truly just man girt by the seven habits. Business in this account is a battlefield in the moral universe, the victor, a sage at least if not a saint.Be proactive, begin with the end in mind, put first things first, think win/win, seek first to understand and then to be understood, synergise and sharpen the saw are the seven habits. That's the meat of the book in one sentence. I wonder if all of Covey's seven habits could be cribbed out of Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism? But equally perhaps we should remember that seven is a magic number, this really isn't a business book, it is a spiritual book. The seven habits are to stand firm against the seven deadly sins. Life on Earth for Covey is a probationary period for the life ever after, since Covey was a Mormon being true to his faith was due to be rewarded with stewardship of an entire planet. Clearly one needs to demonstrate effective stewardship over the smaller business of mortal life to be judged ready for such a substantial reward.In turn this was another disturbing element to the book for me because this means that everything becomes functional. Having a picnic with your sweetheart isn't about enjoying life it is an important Quadrant II activity! This is a mechanistic view of the human experience and, sadder yet, a harsh one. The path to life everlasting is a narrow one, beset with dangers while storms around do rage. Fear not, lonely pilgrim, for Covey illuminates the way with quadrants and diagrams.Yet there is optimism in his approach. Understanding triumphs eternally. Despite what he repeats about paradigm shifts he believes that everybody can come to see both alternative paradigms and appreciate their validity. Personally I suspect that every reader will be able to think of occasions when opposite points of view are not reconcilable. Honesty and realism has to temper any reading of this book.Maybe my problem with this book is that everything is spelt out. It's a Sunday sermon and the pastor is going to read out every word and isn't going to be hurried on to his inevitable conclusions. Worth reading for a taste of the horror and the glory of late twentieth- early twenty-first century corporate life - but keep some salt handy."

CoveyThe 7 Habits of Highly Effective People is a comprehensive program based on developing an awareness of how perceptions and assumptions hinder success---in business as well as personal relationships. Here's an approach that will help broaden your way of thinking and lead to greater opportunities and effective problem solving. Be Pro-Active: Take the initiative and the responsibility to make things happen. Begin With an End in Mind: Start with a clear destination to understand where you are now, where you're going and what you value most. Put First Things First: Manage yourself. Organize and execute around priorities. Think Win/Win: See life as a cooperative, not a comprehensive arena where success is not achieved at the expense or exclusion of the success of others. Seek First to Understand: Understand then be understood to build the skills of empathetic listening that inspires openness and trust. Synergize: Apply the principles of cooperative creativity and value differences. Renewal: Preserving and enhanving your greatest asset, yourself, by renewing the physical, spiritual, mental and social/emotional dimensions of your nature. عنوانها: هفت عادت مردمان موثر؛ هفت گام به سوی کامیابی؛ تاملات روزانه؛ نویسنده: استیون آر کاوی؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش بیستم ماه جولای سال 1997میلادیعنوان: هفت عادت مردمان موثر؛ نویسنده: استیون آر. کاوی؛ مترجم گیتی خوشدل؛ تهران، نشر البرز، 1375؛ در 189ص؛ مصور، نمودار؛ شابک 9644420160؛ چاپ دوم 1376؛ چاپ دیگر تهران، پیکان؛ چاپ هشتم 1380؛ چاپ نهم 1381؛ چاپ پانزدهم 1384؛ در 189ص؛ شابک 9643280829؛ چاپ بیست و هشتم 1392؛ چاپ سی و دوم 1395؛ موضوع موفقیت - خودسازی - جنبه های روانشناسی و خلق و خوی مردمان تاثیر گذار؛ سده 20معنوان: هفت عادت مردمان موثر؛ نویسنده: استیون آر. کاوی؛ مترجم محمدرضا آل یاسین؛ تهران، هامون، 1376؛ در 348ص؛ مصور، نمودار؛ شابک 9649146687؛ چاپ دوم 1377؛ چاپ سوم 1378؛ چاپ هشتم 1383؛ چاپ یازدهم 1384؛ چاپ سیزدهم 1385؛ چاپ بیست و دوم 1393؛ موضوع: درسهایی برای دگرگونی خویشتن؛ سده 20معنوان: هفت گام به سوی کامیابی؛ تهران، نشر نی، 1376، در 416ص، شابک 9643122743؛ مترجمها: محسن اشرفی؛ مهدی الوانی؛ معصومه پیروز بخت؛ عنوان: تاملات روزانه؛ مترجم: حسن اکبریان طبری؛ تهران، مهرنوش، 1379؛ در 137ص؛ شابک 9649133135؛ تابی است مشهور در مورد مهارت‌های زندگی.این کتاب تا کنون به سی و هشت زبان ترجمه و پانزده میلیون نسخه از آن در دنیا به فروش رفته است. کاوی در این کتاب با معرفی هفت عادت و آموزش گام به گام آن‌ها، چیزی که زندگی در شمال نام می‌برد را معرفی کرده و اخلاق منجر به موفقیت را آموزش می‌دهد. این کتاب ادامه دارد عنوان ادامه کتاب «عادت هشتم» است؛ ا. شربیانی"
7,0743269519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2386804-mj-nicholls,0,"One of the most-highlighted books on Kindle, proving that human beings thrive on snappy buzz-quotes written by middle managers like David Brent who partake of the music of M People and Steely Dan Kool & The Gang, and whose souls were long ago vacuumed out in a boardroom somewhere during a PowerPoint presentation. Regard: What you are shouts so loudly in my ears I cannot hear what you say.This incoherent drivel has the most highlights. Regard the faux-profound self-importance of the “cannot” in this sentence, as though securing the attention of Jim Phelps CEO of E-Z-Clix Online Supplies is the pinnacle of human achievement. Between stimulus and response, man has the freedom to choose.You can say this imbecilic utterance in any accent, or at any speed you like, and it still would be a piece of drivelling cack. It would still linger on the brain for a second as a semi-intelligent observation, before pooling slowly to the floor like the incoherent dog-drool it really is when given two seconds thought.Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things. Die now. Die now, you patronising ill-bred country-club smug-face slab of nothing. See how that semicolon WINKS at you, as if to say: “Just listen to my me and everything will be all right. Just quote this vacuous frog-plop at the next AGM and sit back as the room erupts into spontaneous applause. Told you so!”The ability to subordinate an impulse to a value is the essence of the proactive person. Reactive people are driven by feelings, by circumstances, by conditions, by their environment. Proactive people are driven by values—carefully thought about, selected and internalized values. Translation: proactive people are greedy loveless cash-licking pus-heads.It’s not what happens to us, but our response to what happens to us that hurts us.Are you sure it’s not our response to our response to what happens to us that hurts us? Or our response to our response to our response to what happens to us that hurts us is what hurts us and us and us and them?Effectiveness lies in the balance—what I call the P/PC Balance. P stands for production of desired results, the golden eggs. PC stands for production capability, the ability or asset that produces the golden eggs.P = how many eggs stakeholders want chickens to shit out, vs. PC = how many eggs the chickens are capable of shitting out if kept in airless cages and fed reheated bull droppings. “Squeeze ‘em harder, Mr Pancks!”The PC principle is to always treat your employees exactly as you want them to treat your best customers.Condescending fake-friendliness masking resentment and loathing.For our purposes, we will define a habit as the intersection of knowledge, skill, and desire. Knowledge is the theoretical paradigm, the what to do and the why. Skill is the how to do. And desire is the motivation, the want to do. In order to make something a habit in our lives, we have to have all three. OH MOMMY MAKE IT STOP!"
8,0743269519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12755336-nora,1,"I read only the first twenty pages of this book, and that was enough to make me want to gouge out my own eyeballs. It is so repetitive and the author just gives all these ridiculous, impossible analogies that you're supposed to relate to or learn something from. He goes on for pages about himself and his job and his wife and kids. Totally unnecessary. It really is all just common sense stuff that you already know, but preached at you over the course of pages and pages of utter nonsense. For example, Covey writes that if you're not nice to your coworkers, you won't get far in your career.[image error]I know. Groundbreaking stuff, right? If you want to learn more, Mr. Covey has written you about 70 pages on the subject, so you're good to go. Believe me when I tell you that this book will most certainly NOT change your life in any way, shape, or form. I liken this author to that one uncle that will tell you his entire life story at every reunion, regardless of whether or not you're interested in hearing it. I should probably stop myself before steam starts coming out of my ears. I only have one thing to say to you, book."

10,0743269519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,3,An okay book if you don't know how to manage your life it's probably really helpful but if you've thought about how to make yourself more productive or effective a lot of it's intuitive. Also like a lot of these books can only tell you things you have to make the changes yourself which is always the hard part so. This one was better written than most which I appreciate.
11,0743269519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16731747-calista,5,"Holy cow, this is a book people either hate or they think it's great. There were so many one's. I didn't read the book so I didn't see all the charts. I listened to this in my car and so it was just the writing bits. What I really enjoy about this book is these habits he describes are based on universal principles. Every religion uses these underlying ideas. They feel universal to me. I really appreciate how he describes win-win. I have not been living in win-win and it made so much sense. I want to begin living life in a win-win mindset. It makes most sense, but will also take the most work. I must confess that I usually avoid conflict and then take the least conflicting way out, usually lose-win for me. I avoid situations I feel I might have conflict so much of the time. I like the way he talks about paradigm shifts. How you see or perceive a situation will make a huge difference in the way you react to that situation and feel about it. This rings true with everything we study in my school and ways we learn to helps people in clinic. So much of our own misery comes from out we hold a situation. Sometimes, we simply need a new paradigm and he described this way of thinking so well I thought.I also was drawn to the way he describes deep listening. Deep listening really is powerful. It is one of the biggest tools we have in the treatment to really connect to a person and really hear what they are asking for. I have actually been taught to deeply listen and it is truly a powerful tool to have. You can draw a person out with deep listening like nothing else really. I felt Stephen gave very practical and useful tools to use and work with to change. They were feel good pie in the sky things. He had real tools. Not a whole lot of advice books do that. I have read many self-help books and I feel like this is one amazing book. I see why it was so popular and has sold so many copies. I had 2 people tell me how good this book was in the last month and that's why I finally picked this up. It's been on my too read list for decades. For me, what Stephen is talking about here is a way to live at a deep level and work with people intradependently. This is the best way to accomplish great things in this world. I enjoyed how he spoke about dependent and intradependent. I like the word synergy.This came at the perfect time when I'm trying to get a business started. I need to really work with these principles. I found this super helpful for me personally. IT does sound like a lot of work. "

13,0743269519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro,2,"I found this book a bit condescending and with too much of a religious feel to it. It also felt a little insincere and manipulative. I remember that everyone was reading it and swearing by it and that the author must have made millions on seminars and the like, but I found it too close to a cultish mentality and was unsurprised when several adepts of the book later tried dragging me in to pyramid schemes like Amway. Empty platitudes are not really incredibly useful. Read GTD instead!"
14,0743269519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/814660-greg,5,"Inspirational, developmental, and practical -- what a combination! The principles of behavior covered in this groundbreaking and long-respected book are of great worth to anyone seeking success in career, family, or any other aspect of their life. Covey discusses first the actions we must take (or habits we must develop) internally first - getting our heads and hearts right first. These include being proactive, beginning with the end in mind, and putting first things first. These constitute the ""private victory."" He then moves on to the ""public victory,"" that is, the things that we can do that involve other people, and not just our own internal battles and development. These include, thinking win/win, seeking first to understand and then to be understood, and achieving synergy with others. Finally, he addresses the truth that we won't always be energetic and at our best in his discussion of personal renewal. Key to that is the idea of sharpening the saw...that is, we can only be at the top of our game for so long before we need to re-energize. Any serious athlete understands that principle.Outstanding book, especially when linked with his expanded discussion of Habit 3, putting first things first, in the book by the same title. Another excellent complement to this book is ""Crucial Conversations."""
15,0743269519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4042964-ann,1,"This is my husband's favorite book. Obviously he is more effective than I am. Dividing my life into squares, writing in those squares the things I have to do, then doing the ""most important"" may make me effective, but is that my best life? Choosing to do the things that I want to do rather than the things I need to do, adds interest to my existence. If I take the scenic route, and run out of gas doing it, I find adventure, and often meet AAA wrecker drivers who could write books on their experiences. By forgetting birthdays and anniversaries, I find out who really loves me for myself. By forgetting about the time and shimming the door knob that has been bothering me for weeks, and then remembering that it is time to pick up my child from school, he learns independence and I can cross the darn rattling doorknob off my to do list. It's been driving me nuts. I am tempted to write the 7 habits of highly haphazard people. 1. Be creative with your to-do list. Add color and doodles. If you can read it, you are not trying hard enough. Lose it. 2. Buy something you will never use, but if you can use it in a unique way (for which it was not intended) do that. (Colanders make great Halloween alien helmets. Add pipe cleaners for antennae.)3. Set some clocks in your home ahead by a few minutes and some behind for a few minutes. You will learn a great deal about yourself and others. 4. Get a cat. Dogs make you feel important. Cats teach you humility.5. Relish the wonder of soap bubbles blown in the sun.6. Take the road that you've always been curious about. See where it goes. Learn how to turn around quickly in tight places. 7. Really listen to a small child as often as possible. I am enjoying writing this, especially since I have company coming in a few moments and scads of things to do before they get here."
16,0743269519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63168028-peter,5,"PrinciplesThe 7 Habits of Highly Effective People is one of those seminal pieces of work that everyone should read. It is not a business book, it is not a marriage help book, it is not a parenting book and it is not a friendship book. It is a book about YOU, in a holistic context. It is about provoking you to examine your core defining traits; personality, character, principles and ethics. In other words, it is NOT a quick self-help book it is about instilling fundamental habits, 7 to be exact. These habits take us from our base level of being a dependent person, as in childhood, through Independence, as in adulthood, to Interdependence, as a contributing member of society and family. They are defined as:1.	Be Proactive2.	Begin with the End in Mind3.	Put First Things First4.	Think Win-Win5.	Seek First to Understand Then to be Understood6.	Synergise7.	Sharpen the Saw – Continuous ImprovementThe principles are as sound today, as they were when Stephen Covey initially wrote them thirty years ago. They have always been core to personal attainment and effectiveness, and the world would be a better place if we all lived by these habits. The language is getting dated and some of it has been so widely used, and misused, that it’s a bit awkward in today’s vocabulary. Nevertheless to contemplate these values and commit to them, is literally life-changing.I would say 5 stars for the impact this book has had, and 4 stars for the language being a bit aged. 4.5 stars would be about right."

We had to read this the summer before a freshman college Intro to Business Class - perhaps I read it at the wrong age? When Steven Covey starts talking about his kid mowing the lawn and the motivation behind it...ugh! Needless to say, I only got through about 2 of the 7 habits - I guess I'm not a highly effective person. And I will not be purchasing any of Mr Covey's time management calendar systems either, thank you very much."
18,0743269519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9777942-joe,5,"I bought The Seven Habits at a yard sale for $1 with little knowledge of its contents. Years later, when my life dipped to a low ebb of meaning and motivation, I picked it off the shelf in hopes of finding a spark. Inside I found wisdom, compassion, a direct approach and a love of humanity.  The result wasn't immediately transformative. The methods and techniques Covey espouses didn't fall into place and turn me into a whirlwind of positive productivity. Reading The Seven Habits was just one of many moderate steps on a journey that, years on, still stretches endlessly into the horizon. But the part that had the greatest effect on me, looking back, is the notion of the Personal Mission Statement; a written representation of who you are and who you want to be. It's a credo or philosophy, written to reflect your values and edited over time to refine the edges of your philosophy. It demonstrates the power of organizing what you feel and writing it down or speaking it out loud. And with that I share my Personal Mission Statement; consulted often, edited occasionally, some points followed more consistently than others.-When something seems wrong about how I pattern my life, I will analyze that pattern and change if it makes sense.-I matter to others and they matter to me.-I will look before I leap, but sometimes I will leap.-I will write down my ideas.-When I lose myself in reverie, I will turn to my to-do list rather than internet engagement.-I will continue to write even if my content is receiving diminishing attention.-I will carve out time each week to be around other people.-I will favor truth over cleverness in my articulation.-I will maintain my health through strong nutrition and consistent activity.I will leave room for flights of fancy.-I will leave the house with the intention of being early.-I will act when I know there is something to do.-I will write events on the calendar as they come up.-I will minimize my multitasking.-Not everything I say has to sound clever; I will make an effort to giving encouragement and obeying social graces.-I shall ask for help and I shall offer it.-When I wake up I will engage my legs or mind promptly.-The names of others matter and I will learn them.-When life gets stressful, I will harness that stress.-I will speak well of people behind their backs.-There are stories everywhere and I shall find them.-I will respond to people online promptly; say within an hour or when I know what to say.-I will go to bed when I feel tired.-Not every big step will take me far.-My Checklists serve me, not the other way around."
19,0743269519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5032322-carol-storm,5,"One of the most disappointing experiences of my life was going to Columbia University in hopes of an education -- which (as I learned too late) actually means learning how to deal with people, and one's emotional needs, and make plans for a rewarding future. This was in the mid-eighties. Well, the books I had to read at Columbia had nothing to do with anything as mundane as making a living or liking yourself or understanding how to work constructively with other people. I really, really wish I had read this book as a Columbia freshman in 1981. Of course it wasn't written till 1989. Still, I'm convinced that reading the 7 Habits would have taught me more than reading Homer's ILIAD or Plato's REPUBLIC. What Stephen R. Covey does is so much more than just telling sales types how to win friends and influence people. He teaches you how to think about what you really want from life, and how to express those goals, frame them in a workable context, and make them possible by connecting with other people. Those are all skills I didn't have when I entered Carman Hall in the fall of 1981, and I didn't have them when I left Furnald Hall for the last time in 1985. It seems to me that these fancy Ivy League colleges do nothing but rip people off, especially in the Humanities divisions. They don't teach practical job skills, or self-development, or leadership, or anything else. They don't encourage skepticism or independent thought. Nobody even pretends that reading Homer's ILIAD will help students find a job, or even know how to look for a job. Jobs aren't important, because, hey, only rich kids go to Columbia! And if you're not rich, you don't really belong, so who are you to question the curriculum? Of course no one expressed it in quite that way. When I was at Columbia in the Reagan Eighties, a lot of the more left wing professors took pleasure in sneering at kids my age as being materialistic and lacking ideals. They really made you feel that you had no business hoping for any kind of practical benefits from your education. And they were really, really clear on the fact that undergraduates had no business asking for help. They weren't there to help. They were there to lecture. And they weren't thinking win-win! If I could have my college education to do over again I wouldn't go to Columbia. I wouldn't read Homer's Iliad or Plato's Republic. But I would definitely read 7 Habits of Highly Effective People!"

It’s a book that is rich and dense, but worth the time and energy.The first notion that struck me was ‘the fundamental shift of perception’, which changes our perspective on things in matter of seconds. When I rose above myself and did this, all of a sudden I was not the same person. Quite a few things that I’ve been trying very hard to change for a long time, changed almost immediately.The second was the statement ‘listen, not to respond, but to comprehend’. I realized I’ve been doing just the opposite, ever since I learnt to speak. All those other advices I’ve received on effective communication boiled down to nothing, because they all focus on how to make the other person listen! If there is one technique that has improved my relation with people, both personal and professional, it’s this: now I listen to understand, see things from the perspective of the other. The book is worth just for this.I love his notion of synergy in creating values, but this is also the notion that pains me the most, because this is the least I see around me. May be it’s the human nature not to seek synergy, but, in any case, I’ve applied this in my personal relations, and that has changed my life.His chapter on renewal convinced me to have a role and goal. It’s so basic, yet I had never taken the time to do it. It gave me a meaning to my life, for the first time."

I was slightly disappointed as I have had this book recommended to me by countless people so I did expect better. I felt it could have been condensed to a quarter of its size easily.The book was also written in the 80s and I could easily tell (personally, I feel it's in need of a 21st Century update). I did give it 3-stars though because there were parts I found useful and interesting, especially the section about writing a mission statement for oneself.

Read again before going back to work in January 2014. I think it's fitting that the first time I read this, I was in grad school and planning for the future, and that I would read it again as I leave behind the career I was planning for back then. Well, somewhat. I'm letting music librarianship go and focusing on being an assistant director in the library, and also to figuring out what the next move will be in a few years. A couple of things I'm mulling over after the second read:-Moving beyond to-do lists, which can be a false sense of achievement-Not letting work be the only place where goals are set-Valuing difference-Becoming a person who helps others achieve their goals-Quadrant II (again)"

28,0743269519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2116837-steve,4,"I borrowed this book from the library and I liked it enough to buy my own copy.Unlike other self-help books, there is no flim-flam here. Right at the beginning of the book Covey tells readers that none of his advice will work unless the reader works, hard. At the end of the book Covey reveals that he struggles with his own advice.If you are an amotivated person who starts things and who does not finish them, this book will not give you a trick to make sticking to a plan easy.What this book tells you to do is to discover what you truly value, not what you tell yourself you value. The idea is that once you are in touch ( honestly ) with what your values are you can use that knowledge to motivate yourself to work hard at following hard to follow time honored advice for success.As far as complaints go I could have done without the corporate buzz terms and diagrams. I guess it is a sign of success of the book that the terms from the book have degenerated into corporate buzz terms.I also thinks it sucks that Covey tried to cash in on this insightful work by putting out a series of lame sequels, office supplies and over-priced bloated courses.Some reviews claim that the book pushes Christianity. I am an atheist, I read the book, and I think that claim is rubbish. Towards the end of the book Covey mentions that he is a Christian and that he turns to religious readings in his spare time for inspiration. That is about as far as it goes.If you are wary of this book be aware that it was very successful. Many copies of it exist in libraries and used book venues so the risk is small."

Covey also teaches/reminds me to avoid/better manage ""time wasters"" in favor of focusing on what matters most (well noted!). My only complaint--it reads like a boring textbook. Perhaps this should be given to students while they can still tolerate it? I enjoy nonfiction but I like the writing to be smooth. And sometimes he goes on and on about some pretty obvious stuff--which also is more appropriate for younger students. "
31,0743269519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102484307-muhammad-abdullah,5,"The Seven Habits is a million dollar worth book which sow the seeds of effectiveness in the reader’s mind. The seeds grow large as the reader proceeds reading. The main message of the book is the 7 habits which every highly effective people possessed. “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then is not an act, but a habit.”Habit 1- Be Proactive Being proactive means recognizing our responsibilities to make things happen. This habit tells us to do whatever is necessary and consistent with correct principles. Work on the things which are in our influence to extend the circle of influence and spend less energy on the center of concern.Habit 2- Begin with the End in Mind Begin with the end in mind means to know where we are going so as to understand where we are now, and take our next step in the right direction. The best way to start is to develop a personal statement which describes what we want to be(character) and to do(achievement). Everybody wants to center his life on correct principles because principles don’t change. We can depend on them.Habit 3- Put First Things FirstThis habit involves self-leadership and self-management: putting first things first. Leadership decides what the ‘first things’ are, and management is the discipline of carrying out your program.“We don’t manage time. We can only manage ourselves.”According to quadrant rule, do things first which are urgent and important, then the things which are important but not urgent. After that things which are urgent but not important, and then all other things which are neither urgent nor important. Habit 4- Seek First to Understand, Then to Be UnderstoodListen is the most important tool for this habit. Listen but not with intent to reply or to convince. Listen to simply understand, to see how the other party sees things. Empathy is the skill need to develop for this habit.“Empathic listening is with the ears, eyes and heart- for feeling, for measuring.”Habit 5- Think Win/WinThink win/win habit entrails making an important deposit in another person’s Emotional Bank Account: finding a way both of us can benefit by our interaction. All the other possibilities- win/lose, lose/win, lose/lose- are ineffective either in short term or long term.Habit 6- SynergizeThe exercise for all other habits prepares us for the habit of synergy. Properly understood, it is the highest activity of life. Through it, we create new, untapped alternatives- things that didn’t yet exist. We unleash people’s greatest powers. We make a whole greater than sum of its parts. The basis of synergy is that two people can disagree, and both can be right. It’s not logical. It’s psychological.Habit 7- Sharpen the SawTo sharpen the saw means renewing ourselves, in all the four dimensions of our nature:·	Physical- exercise, nutrition, stress management;·	Mental- reading, visualizing, planning, writing;·	Social/Emotional- service, empathy, synergy, security;·	Spiritual- spiritual reading, study, meditation;To exercise in all these necessary dimensions, we must be proactive. No one can do it for us. It’s a quadrant IV activity.“To become strong, renew the spirit.”ConclusionThe first three habits take us towards “private victory”- the journey from dependence to independence by taking responsibility for our lives. Next three habits lead us towards “public victory” to the path of interdependent to succeed with other people. The seventh habit allows us renewing ourselves in mind, body and spirit.I would like to recommend this book to all those people who want to live their life fully, amazing and joyful."
32,0743269519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53414564-chadi-raheb,2,"I started this book a long time ago and never got to finish it. Because at some point I found out that there is no such thing as ""perfection"". There is no ""highly effective people"". There is ""us""; and ""us"" cannot be perfect. Ever. All we have to do is to accept it and then just Try not hard but smart enough to be the best version of ourselves. If there are flaws, let it be & don't overreact for the mistakes you've made.Have a plan. Stick to it. Try to be better each day a little bit more than the day before. Be patient. Take a good care of your health. And that's it. That's all. Life is no perfect. Neither are the beings. Get over it: It hurts because it's real, But is worth accepting. So in short: stick to the plan; throw these books away; And someday you yourself will be the most effective person of your life. Perfection my ass!"

Sharpen the saw? Woah, Tell me again what were you talking about all this time? This book promised me helpful strategies to make me live an effective life but well, I found nothing other than the same old boring bits of advices repeated x100 times. Sure, I did like it when he talked of his workplace, or his wife or kids. But he kept implying he turned his family into this amazing one, with these so-called 7 habits, instead of ACTUALLY TELLING US HOW HE DID IT. His introverted shy son became extroverted, smart and active. Cool. He rubbed in well with his boss at work while his co-workers had problems with him. He repeatedly shows how his life has turned for the best. But I still didn't get what he's trying to convey with this book. That or the point went right over my head if there ever was one."

Last year I decided that I wanted to explore new genres and looked around for what was considered a must read in the self help section and found 7 Habits. I'm normally a decently fast reader but this book, at 358 pages, took me 13 months to finish. I couldn't bring myself to read more than a few pages at a time, I just disliked it that much.It's not that the book itself is horrible. It's just that the information it attempts to teach is what I would humbly call common sense. If you have any sense of self awareness or if you ever reflect on yourself, you probably won't gain anything from this book. If you've gone through a crisis and have no sense of how to continue being a proper human being then maybe this book would be of some help. The cherry on top of the horrible cake that this book is, is his personal note where he points out that if you don't believe in the power of God and live with those spiritual beliefs, you won't reach anything beyond the animal plane. Basically just ignoring everything else his book discusses because why bother being a good person and practicing these habits if you don't believe in God?"

We were asked to read this in relation to a company-wide training on the same in the mid 80’s and my friends from other companies were also required to undergo the same training. The 7 habits will always be applicable as they are all based on common sense. However, there are some that was new during the 80’s like the paradigm shifting and the visualization. Now we have the “secret” – law of attraction which is basically similar to visualization (thinking with the end in mind). I think the business gurus are just renaming things in order to appear new. They are the ones laughing their way to banks while HR people in companies appear to have brilliant ideas for productivity by using those new ideas or propositions based on these books. I have been working for almost 3 decades now and I can’t help but see this cycle of foolishness. "

It comes across quite ‘preachy’, full of awkward, clearly made-up anecdotes and dialogue. It also definitely feels like a book from another age...

He mostly references them as ""first habit"" or ""fifth habit"" and there's not much explanation about what that particular habit was about. To be honest, I realised that we are on to habits only when in the ""third habit"" the previous two habits were mentioned. I mean that is a pretty big issue when you are revisiting or reading his answers to some questions. Some of the things made a lot of sense, but nothing was really eye opening. Many things were repetitive and really it annoyed me that it did seem to concentrate to give advice to business leaders, not much on the regular folk. As far as I understand, the business leaders already have these habits, we - regular people need to adapt them, so it was a bit of a miss. I get annoyed by quotations of bible as the true source of wisdom, so this certainly hit that point as well. Can't really say much bad about the contents, most of the things actually made sense and were explained to make you understand how you can benefit from them... that is... if you didn't count the first two habits."

At first I was skeptical; no I should say I was pessimistic. That is a bit more honest. Does it not seem that most people perceive books on personal change and self improvement in a negative way? Pretty ironic wouldn’t you say? Well this was the first such book that I owned that fell into the “personal change” category. Since then I have read it numerous times and have read countless other books on the subject. It is safe to say that this book completely changed my perception on reality and it put me in a place where I was not only comfortable, but motivated, to read every other book like it that I could get my hands on.As one can probably understand from the title, Stephen Covey presents his strategy for personal change and development through these seven habits that he has created to lead individuals in being as effective as possible. I will not get into detail about what the seven habits actually are because that of course would greatly take away from the power of this book. Do you really think Covey would spend over 350 pages discussing these seven habits if he could get the same point across by just listing them on one page? The things that make this book so powerful are not only the seven habits, but the stories, examples and explanation that thoroughly support each of them. Through the seven habits Covey gets across so many fundamentals of leading a powerful life. I credit this work with so many positive things that have since done wonders for my life and my outlook on it. These include writing a personal mission statement, understanding the power of setting goals and then setting them, establishing clear values by which to live, effectively managing my time, understanding the significance of honesty and integrity, focusing on results and leading others. If I had to claim a single most powerful benefit that I received from this book, (which is difficult because there really are so many) I would have to say it was learning the value of having my own personal mission statement. Unfortunately the idea of a personal mission statement does not go over well with most people. That is at least the experience I have had. The truth is that without a personal mission statement and a definition of what it means for you to be successful, how is one ever going to know when they have succeeded and what they should and should not do to get them closer to their goals? This clear definition does wonders for your motivation, drive and excitement with everything you do.I now have a personal mission statement that I can look to at any part of my day and ask myself “is what I am doing right now getting me closer to my mission”. If the answer is no then I should not be doing it. I just looked up at my statement as I was writing this and I can confidently say that writing these words to you is very in line with my life mission. It is pretty simple really. Do you know how good it feels to be doing things that get you closer to your mission? It is time to find out. -Reading For Your Succcess"

If you were a paraplegic who had just fallen from an 11-story-building, and the by-standers shot you with automatic rifes and blew you with 100 grenades, leaving you behind as an amorphous mixture of blood and flesh. You would not have to worry. You are not your cirumstances.
The author, Stephen R. Covey, passed away in July this year. Rest in peace. He left a positive mark and this needs to be appreciated. Now to the book...I bought it about 2 years ago, but never bothered reading it. It had a self-help look and feel about it which prevented me. In retrospect, I could have walked out of the bookstore without it, but fate had its way. And so it did last week, when a teacher of mine talked about this book and praised it. Oh yes he did. His opinion was that it was literally life altering. I thought, I already had the book, why not give it a read? You know, maybe it'll make me smarter, and a better person.The thesis is clear from the get-go. The author realized that most of the self-help books focused on secondary problems so his intention was to focus on the effective practices which were fundamental in human nature. The real thesis? A self-help book that will vilify all the existing self-help books and then triumphantly walk as the 'true', read:self-help, book.Make no mistake, every grain of this book is reaking of the generic self-help ideas. From the start the author berates self-help books as having 'platitudes', and by the 3rd habit chapter, I had enough of THIS book's platitudes.It breeds in you your superirity, your ego. Your wife doesn't want to have sex with you, you choose to accept have sex with her. Your boss doesn't call you in the evening, you choose to go for the betterment of the business you work at. It wants you to become that ultimate prick.I have read sentences in this book that made me vomit! The all-encompassing, all-positive, all-self-help-vocabulary-I-can-use-in-one-sentence kind of sentences. Coming back to the opening of this review. The book doesn't make a room for humanness. On one hand, it wants you to live a life of your priorities, but then it tells you that don't get carried away with feelings, emotions or circumstances. The book kept quoting Viktor Frankl, which was very frustrating because life is not Frankl's concentration camp.I am not perfect, I am probably not a leader. But at least I enjoy life at its fullest, I love all moments, I enjoy rain, I take walks just for the hell of it, I read stupid books just to feel superior. I regurgitate bullshit for conversations... I am a human and this book was definitely not for me."

Second time reading it I will take notes. I also bought the book too. There was surprisingly a lot about how to deal with your children, as well as how to deal with others. It had a How to Win Friends and Influence People feels to it."

51,0743269519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4738272-justin-griffiths-bell,2,"I know a number of people who rate this book seemingly more highly than any other, and maybe that is a good enough reason to leave well alone, given the constant sell that Facebook is giving me over Shades of Grey. I should have been warned, but there you go. There is much wisdom here, let that not go unsaid. There are some very wise ideas and a number of insightful anecdotes to show how the effective habits secure financial wealth, generate business and mend relationships. Okay, there's nothing here that any well-adjusted person wouldn't instinctively practise as a matter of course, but as I read, I thought to myself, well, not everyone is as wise, well-adjusted and tuned towards humanity as I am, and this is just the sort of thing that might be gold dust to them, sad unfortunates that they are. It's that sort of book. I also had a sneaking suspicion that it all seemed too convenient that every time Mr Covey practised an effective habit, he met with unqualified success. ""Don't be too put out if someone tells you to sod off whist you are getting off on synergising"" is not one of the seven habits, but it is a useful one to learn, as real people do not fall so easily into line as Covey might have you believe. If you are going to give this book a crack, then you will be interested to know that this book falls into three sections. Part one is where all the commonsense, intelligent, useful, everyday habits come. You will be lured in. Part two shows you the money with a battery of businessspeak and stories of high sales figures and management strategies that were aced using the habits. You will be... bored (unless you are a salesman, in which case you may well be enjoying your hard-on for synergy). Part three will guarantee your salvation, when you realise that it was all about God. That's right, it's evangelism for people in suits. You will laugh as Covey confesses that he had great tears streaming down his face when he resolved a family dispute regarding the choice of supper - cheese on toast or scrambled egg - through talk, synergy, a nice cup of tea and the love of our Lord Jesus Christ. Great stuff! Perhaps if there were more practising Christians in the boardrooms of the world, things would get better for everybody. I have no problem with that. I'm just saying that this is the way the book tends.  "
52,0743269519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82596342-iman-shabani,5,"Already on my 2nd read, I can tell you with certainty, that this one is a keeper, a must-read for you, and anyone you care about.With this book, Stephen Covey proved that you could write a non-fiction book that will be as relevant and as interesting after 30 years, as it was the year it was published and became a best-seller.Do yourself a favour and put this at the top of your reading list, you might think this is yet another one of those books that look interesting, but lack enough relevancy, or wisdom to be useful to you, but give it a shot before you judge it (or judge me for that matter, if I sound like a fanboy to you); as they say, you can't judge a book by its cover.I'm sad that Stephen isn't among us anymore, maybe we could get even more wisdom out of him if he were, but at least now that I was lucky enough to know him a little bit through his books, maybe I can join that large group of people that are using his legacy to become a better human being. I might not have what's required yet, but I hope soon I will; and I'm looking forward to my next read of it, and the next read after that, to help me get there.Rest in peace Stephen, and count me impressed while you do."

I've put down some books for later for not being the right time. I can't say the same with this one. This is more like a ""I don't wanna see you again ever"" kind of book.Amazon kept recommending me this damn book for some reason, always the first on the list. It felt like someone trying to sell me Herbalife. This is not for me, hell no."

55,0743269519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7254657-bayanola92,4,An inspiring book! Boring at first but gets your attention after all I think I might read it again in the near future just to make sure I understood everything :D 4/5
56,0743269519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90942605,3,"I have to say, this is a great book to help you add a value and meaning to your life.Even though I am familiar with at least most of what the author is saying since I am a business student, I thought this book wouldn't add very much to me BUT as I continued to read, this book gave me ideas and helped me refresh my mind.However, I believe he could have said and delivered all his thoughts in less pages, I found some pages unnecessary.But anyways, I loved that the author have explained some through practices, that were really interesting to me, I that I think I am going to start making in my life.#WorthReading"
57,0743269519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2809736-shelley,1,"I know I was supposed to fall down and worship the ground that Mr. Covey walked on after I read this book. I am sure it is a fine book for some people. But not for me. I could not take the sheep mentality that this book creates. I am supposed to repeat the mantras in this book and practice the principles so I can be like everyone else that has read this book. Ummmmm...no? They are actually teaching these principles at the school where I work and my kids come home with these little platitudes every week. I am so sick of hearing them. Our teachers are no more effective or productive for having read this book or trying to drill it into my kids. I am no more effective for reading it. I am however more effective when I live my life the way I say I am going to. I am effective when I stick to my own principles and am honest and open with people. I don't need someone to stand behind me and whisper in my ear that I am a good person and people will like and respect me more when I become more effective. All this ""pat on the back"" mentality that our society has is tearing us down. We mollycoddle our kids to death, no one takes responsibility for themselves or their own actions and if you are not effective, it is not because you are not working hard enough or trying hard enough, it is now because you did not learn these principles or read the book and so, it is not your fault. Pppfffftttt!!!!"
58,0743269519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/783170-tiffany,4,"A wonderful book! Stephen Covey is amazing! It's wonderful to think that such awesome things can come from the mind of one person. It has been a great reminder to me that I need to progress as much as possible in this life, and live a life based on truth, values, and correct principles. ANd that multiple people working together can do a *lot* more than the equivalent of what they can all do working alone.We have the choice to live a happy and productive life, or not. We don't need to blame other people or hard circumstances for our problems. We can be in control of our own lives, and learn to live in harmony with others. I love all the fabulous quotes he uses, and stories of his own experiences. You can see that he really believes all that he says and wants to use what he's learned to help others. Some of the ways he suggests applying these things aren't exactly the way I would do them, but they helped me to get a better idea of how I would do it. A very thought provoking book, we could all do a little more productive thinking in our lives. As a whole, a great book that I am not sorry to have read."
59,0743269519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54459790-breinholt-dorrough,1,"I am a believer in fiction. Constantly pondering over the thousands of stories I have read and been told helps me realize I am not alone, helps me sympathize with those around me, helps motivate me to action when I know disastrous ramifications would follow my current course, helps me maintain a positive emotional homeostasis. With literature, I craft my own path to happiness given an infinite quantity of possible molds.I am not a believer in salesmanship scams. Marketing seven ambiguous phrases as if they actually were the end-all, be-all of individual well-being - for the sake of turning a profit - is not my cup of tea. Seriously, there's a whole slew of people whose career consists of teaching this book at conferences. This book has gained a pseudo-religious following in many circles. With books like this, I only have one cookie-cutter mold for happiness.I do not doubt that this book has helped certain people through hard times, and I am aware its advice is not malignant in intent, but I also believe that over seven thousand other books would have helped those people more, had they only read them...Excuse me as I synergistically sharpen my saw."
