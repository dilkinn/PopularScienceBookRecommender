The advances in explaining our universe have been many, and yet it is not easy to summarize it in a way most people can relate to. Brian Cox does well to include the right amount of information with detail to be satisfying. There are portions on the book where it moves slowly but generally regains the track after some slack. The coverage includes space, origin theories, fundamental particles & forces. Overall, an interesting read."
1,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew,4,"This is another sumptuous book in the series but if you have read any of Professor Brian Cox's previous books you would come to expect nothing less - and this book does not disappoint.However this book has quite a challenge ahead of it. You see his previous books have been on rather straight forward and easily defined subjects - the solar system, the universe and so on - how we have something a little more vague and as such something totally open to interpretation. And this is where the challenge lies - what do you class as the force of nature - and this interpretation works both for and against this book. Do not get me wrong it is amazing with beautiful photography and amazing insights just that I would say that you do have a rather whirlwind tour.Now I maintain that these books though never definitive act as an appetiser drawing the reader in with the hope that it sparks some thirst for more knowledge and setting the reader off on a journey of discovery - if the reader just thinks ""hmm that was interesting"" and simply shuts the book and goes off else where then the book and I guess Professor Cox have failed. Somehow reading this book I dont think they have anything to worry about, just yet."
2,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498454-h-kon-gunnarsson,4,"This exploration of science is perhaps a little bit unfocused, but Brian Cox has such an infectious enthusiasm for the subject that it's hard not to be swept along with him on this journey. All in all an interesting very book that I'm glad that I've read."
3,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42028968-nicola,4,"Whenever I read books like these, I’m always awe-inspired by the sheer vastness and pure amazingness of our little home in a huge universe. The fundamental laws of nature, quantum mechanics, physics and the tenacity of biology never ceases to amaze me and this book expertly communicated all of that. Beautifully written and in a way that will help you to slow down, stop and think and truly appreciate the intricacies of the world and the physics we live in and are bound by. It lays down and explains many of the fundamental laws and science, in a way that caters for both the science novice and the scientist alike. It does go deep into the maths and science in some instances which, even if you don’t understand (which most wont claim to, me included!) it will still work to amaze and show the deep levels of understanding and human endeavour to explain and work out the world around us. It really helps to make you appreciate just how complex and amazing our world is- something that can get so easily overlooked in the wrappings of our everyday lives. I’ll always be a fan of Brian’s work and his easy way of communicating science to all, and this book like many of his others, did a beautiful job of explaining and exploring the many forces of nature in a way that held your interest, kept you entertained, intrigued and in awe in the beautiful world we get to call home. I’ll never tire about learning more of our beautiful planet!"
4,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4176122-stuart-aken,5,"This surprising book exudes the author’s enduring sense of wonder and delight at the natural world. Such qualities, when demonstrated by a leading academic, who is also a well-loved and respected TV presenter, can motivate and inspire. I hope many non-scientists read this book.Not an ‘easy’ read, it demands attention and concentration. But it does explain, where possible in layman’s terms, the fundamental forces that control how things are made in this extraordinary universe we occupy. Acknowledging the roles of early pioneers, and explaining the history of discovery, Professor Cox builds pictures of the way brilliant minds have come to understand the way things work in nature.If I have a negative comment, it’s only that some early equations in the book would benefit from a few more labels to identify the quantities and qualities described. As the book progresses, however, these very issues, that I imagined were an assumption about readers’ mathematical skills and knowledge, are made clearer: the later formulae are better labelled. For someone like me, with all the mathematical aptitude of an artichoke, some of the workings might just as well have been written in Klingon. But that’s my problem, not the book’s.It’s refreshing to find a scientist, a popular one at that, so willing to explain at length that science is not a fixed or exact thing. Its methods, however, are subject to peer scrutiny and its theorems require proofs to reach that status. Science is an area of endeavour where simple speculation coupled with a belief system is no substitute for factual information and a serious attempt to discover the realities. It’s refreshing to find this mind-set in a scientist of Professor Cox’s stature, since there are, unfortunately, scientists who treat their discipline in the same cavalier way that most religious authorities treat their beliefs: as if somehow the very fact that they believe their myths should render them beyond question.I read this book as background research for a science fiction novel I’m writing. I’m very pleased I did! It’s caused me to reconsider certain elements of the future I’m portraying and prevented me appearing more foolish than I might otherwise seem: I’ve discovered that certain ‘facts’ in some fields are not quite what some proponents have declared them to be. This is a book about the forces of nature. Four of them that form the basic ‘building blocks’ of how the universe, and everything in it, is structured. It’s a truly fascinating read, peppered with amusing comments and presented in a very readable manner. What could so easily have been a dry textbook, is actually an entertaining and informative piece of accessible writing. I wish I’d had teachers with Professor Cox’s ability to explain things in an engaging and inspiring fashion; my school education would have taken an entirely different and more useful route!Readers with little scientific background may find some of the explanations difficult to comprehend, and those, like me, with poor maths, may have problems understanding some of the proofs. But the Professor makes allowances for these holes in our education and finds ways to make clear what might otherwise be obscure. It’s an intriguing and inspiring read and, having thoroughly enjoyed it, I fully recommend the book."
5,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89324589-ming-wei,5,"Very strong indepth educational book, learnt many thing from this, Brian Cox yet again makes topics very interesting, the book is well written, well presented, the book cover is OK, this book really expands your knowledge, many people I believe would find this book interesting, if you like the TV series, this book is a great complement to the TV shows. The eudcational level is that the book would potentially be very useful to university students, study relevent topics. Reall enjoyed this book. No editorial issues, no negatives at all from my point of view."
6,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34708201-zoe-hall,4,"This is such an interesting read! It forms book 5 of my Penguin Read the Year Challenge too. Well written, interesting and thoroughly fascinating. It felt like my science lessons from school all in one! Only, this is a little more complicated. I’d highly recommend it. "
7,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,2,"The short introductory book on science is too short to serve a purpose. To start with, the tone is as if the author is trying to convince its readers that there is science/reason, rather than anything mystical, at the base of the reality around. The wonderment angle often leads to the author spending a considerable amount of time (compared to the size of the book) making elementary arguments, discussing the history of scientists/discovery or raising questions that do not fit. From the mundane or the most comprehensible, the author would suddenly make almost quantum jumps to extremely complex arguments with little explanations. And in another flash, the readers would find the book on a completely different topic as it covers multiple branches of biochemistry, evolutionary science, astronomy, electromagnetism, relativity and quantum physics apart from issues like the origin of life and even the Big Bang. "
8,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4850586-kris,5,I don't know what it is about the way he explains complicated topics but I really connect with it. Fantastic book.
9,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20508475-raluca,4,"Do I now know physics? Nope. But I know somewhere between 5 and 15% more on some topics of physics than I did before this book. But that's not really why I liked Forces of Nature - I don't think my life will be directly impacted by knowing or forgetting how many flavors of neutrinos there are. (Three. And yes, for some reason they're called ""flavors"".) What I liked was that Cox and Cohen do a great job of linking things you might not have thought are linked, of weaving a bit of science history into simple but not dumbed-down explanations of physical and chemical mechanisms, and especially of transmitting how utterly brilliant they find the whole thing. So even if you haven't the slightest interest in the topic, even if you've never wondered why the sky is blue and why beex build hexagonal hives, just read it to take part in a fancy university professor's joy about how the world works. How often do you get to do that?(Did not fit into the PopSugar Reading Challenge 2020)"
10,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,3,This is an interesting and informative book. It’s very approachable and written at entry level. It was adapted from a television show and this fact is noticeable and maybe a bit irritating. I listened to the audobook and the reader has a great voice.
11,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24090230-jaymi,4,"Professor Cox is the type of person who is optimistic with his physics: he lifts people up to the wonders of the universe rather than pulling the board from beneath and letting you fall into stark realism. This is perhaps due to his English sentiment of not taking anything too serious, whilst also drawing from his great love of the subject and the hundreds of scientists who pioneered some part of it and transformed physics into what it is today.Forces of Nature is a broad overview of the four fundamental forces of nature: the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, the electromagnetic force and the force of gravity. Professor Cox goes on to answer many of the questions that are intrinsic to our universe—a universe created with fixed laws made manifest in a creative amalgamation of numbers. The book is based off of a BBC documentary and Cox makes use of this very visual explanation of things; he describes the physics of symmetry through manatees off the coast of Florida, and the wonders of colour through his diving into the mid-Atlantic ridge in Iceland.I would be lying if I said that textbooks do not provide the information with the same enthusiasm as Cox does, but Professor Cox’s prose is noticeably beautiful, romantic and kind; he is pleasantly droll, enthusiastic, modest and not at all pejorative. You can tell he has an appreciation for just about every sub-field of physics and not only that, he seems to be greatly appreciative of the arts; Claude Monet and George Orwell appear amongst his quotes and visualisations. People often frown at me when I tell them that Physics and Literature are incredibly similar to one another, but they shouldn’t be shocked at the idea that a lot of physicists turn into writers and communicators; it is not a coincidence that scientists often convey the secrets of the universe in poetic prose. After all, every creation story needs a language—Professor Cox has found a kind and intelligent one.Original Review posted at: https://suspectnarglesblog.wordpress...."
12,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47550128-lorrie,1,"I tried with this one, I really did. I don't have any science background, and math was never my strongest subject in school, but I know when someone is a good teacher. The biggest factor is being able to take really abstract or difficult concepts and boil them down into something someone who doesn't have a physics degree can understand them. Neil deGrasse-Tyson can do it wonderfully. Carl Sagan could do it too. Brian Cox? Nope. Not even a little. After a third chapter if scratching my head, rereading the section to see if I missed something, and then giving up and moving on to the next concept, I eventually made the decision to DNF this book. Nothing in this book was boiled down so the lay person (ie. me) could get more than the basic gist of the concept. As much as this stuff interests me, I don't want to have to go and get a physics degree just to understand what this author is trying to say."
13,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16319384-julia-tulloh-harper,4,"This is great-Brian Cox talking through the physical forces that shape the world/universe - electromagnetism, gravity, & strong & weak nuclear forces, and how they create patterns and certain structures in the universe - spherical planets, tidal oceans, snowflakes, bilateral symmetry in many animal species, etc. It’s physics well explained for the layperson (experts might find it too basic- but then, it’s so nicely articulated they might enjoy it). I LOVED it, especially the discussions around the physical origins of life on earth. A lot of the book is quite abstract (as physics often is) and across it all is the sheer joy and delight Cox takes in the pursuit and value of knowledge, which as an academic meant a lot to me. There’s still quite a lot of maths and chemistry in here so if they’re not your thing this probably isn’t for you. I listened to the audio which was narrated by Samuel West who of course was EXCELLENT, think I’ll now only listen to books narrated by him 😂"
14,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533225-arie-prasetyo,3,"Some of the discussions are too deep for a pop science book. But the ""Ionian enchantments"" I had from some of the information provided by the book make up for its shortcomings."
15,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69057876-sami,5,This is such a great book! Prof. Brian Cox is a master of describing complex science in enchanting storytelling. I wish I had this book in high school!
16,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76430209-gabriella,4,"This was a really interesting and informative book. I liked the fact that it explored science through asking basic questions about the world, such as 'Why do snowflakes have six points?' or 'What makes things different colours?' etc. This made it feel like I was learning how the knowledge is applied to the world rather than that I was just learning random facts. I did struggle to understand some concepts and diagrams but you can tell that he's done his best to explain things clearly. He also throws in the occasional anecdote or a bit of dry wit which made it entertaining too."
17,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64460286-rachid-idjiou,5,"If you look at the sky at night you will see beautiful stars shining, have you ever asked yourself . How the universe began? Why the sun shines? Why the sky is blue? Why there is life on earth? Why we can't explain scientifically why we can't go back in time? Why we can't go back to the past? Scientists look for the answers to many questions, they won't want to be right but they want to know. This book inspired by BBC television. Brian Cox leads us with his amazing to discover the Forces of Nature"
18,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69098335-rob,4,"As with most of the TV Shows and other stuff done by Brian, this book is a very good primer into the wonder of science and the natural world. The narrator of the Audiobook really does a good job conveying that tone of wonder and amazement that is so often heard from Brian on his TV miniseries. I think this is definitely a good book for anyone interested in the natural word."
19,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38874522-madina,5,"one of the best nonfiction science books ever period. somehow i feel like i understand physics so much more now, espc time dilation & other mindbending concepts. also that part about ""why science? why research?"" brian cox u have me"
20,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52293943-hugo,5,"Fantastic book. If you are a layperson and you want to gain some knowledge on the forces that rule our world and the entire universe, this book will really help you. "
21,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45460060-se-n,4,"Pretty interesting, wish they went into a bit more detail on some things. It is inspired by the TV show so some things weren't as easy to understand without a visual."
22,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6489740-lloyd-downey,4,"I don't remember ever watching the TV series but somewhere I came across this little book that was designed to accompany the BBC TV series with Professor Brian Cox (and in smaller fonts ...Andrew Cohen who was apparently the Executive producer of the BBC Science Unit..and so probably taking the credit here for the toil of many underlings). I only realised after I had bought the paperback book that there is apparently a more lavish hardback book ...which looks like it has the colour plates embedded into the text rather than being gathered together in one section as they are in the paperback. In fact, the paperback version is not good. The diagrams appear to have been lifted from a larger version (maybe with colour in the larger version) but they are generally so small and the printing is so faint that it is hard to read or interpret. So this was disappointing. However, I persevered and to give credit where it is due, Brian Cox does a workman-like job of bringing some aspects of science to the masses (in this case just me). As he says in the opening chapter ...this book is about science and about asking the sort of questions that a child might ask...and usually doesn't get a satisfactory answer; why is the sky blue? why are stars and planets round? why are plants green? I thought that I had a reasonable grasp on all of these issues but Brian opened my eyes to quite a few new wrinkles or things that I had not thought about. He, most appropriately, starts off with a discussion about snowflakes and symmetry ...leading into Chemistry and the fundamental building blocks and forces of nature...the strong force, the weak force, electromagnetism and gravity. And why is the earth round (well more or less round)..it's because gravity is pulling everything inwards towards the centre. And he makes the point...which I had not thought about before, that we can't have really high mountains on earth because the ground under them will not be strong enough to resist the downward pressure. But on Mars you can have very high mountains,...24 km high. And once an object in our solar system gets to be about 600 km across the force of gravity is sufficient to pull it into a spherical shape. The earth is spinning, however, and the spin makes the earth a slightly oblate spheroid. And the snowflake has a hexagonal symmetry because of the angular bonds in the water molecules ..so the shape of the snow crystals is indicative of a deeper structure.Brian then moves into a discussion of space and time and describes one of Einstein's contributions that you are a rest in an inertial frame of reference if an isolated object is either remaining at rest or continuing in a straight line. And the earths accelerating towards the sun ...but net effect is it orbits the sun in a elliptical orbit. (Must confess the I've always has a mental difficulty in accepting this idea of accelerating towards the sun...but travelling in a ""fixed"" elliptical orbit. And the moon (which probably was formed by a collision of the earth with another planet) has a major impact on the earth. Contrary to popular belief, the moon doesn't circle the centre of the earth but a spot about 4,700km from the centre of the earth (which is the centre of mass of the earth/moon system). (The earth has a radius of 6,376 km). And the earth, in turn orbits around this centre of mass in roughly a circle. Because the earth is rotating around this centre of mass (and spinning on it's axis) there is a centrifugal force which counterbalances the pull of the moon's gravity....and it's this centrifugal force which spins the tides out on the side facing away from the moon. And for the side facing (underneath) the moon, the gravitational pull is slightly greater than the gravitational pull at the centre of the earth. So the oceans are pulled towards the moon...and, in fact, the earth's crust is deformed by about 0.5m too.Maxwell developed his equations relating the electric and magnetic fields where the speed of light enters the equations as a constant. Einstein's brilliance was to take the equations at face value and insist that the speed of light remained constant when we hop between inertial frames of reference. Brian goes on to discuss the familiar issues of measuring time in different frames of reference and discusses the world timeline that we all experience plus ""forbidden "" zones that are not within our ""light cone"". If we take Einstein's theory of relativity at face value, it leads to the idea of the Block Universe. Spacetime can be pictured as a 4D blob over which we move, encountering the events on our worldliness as we go. But whilst the theory leads to this it is not necessarily correct.He now moves on to the question of how did life begin. It seems that the earth formed 4.54 billion years ago and there is good evidence that life had gained a foot hold by 3.5 billion years ago. And living things are made out of simple building blocks. It's Chemistry. And chemistry is all about the movement of electrons. We have a bit of a digression here whilst Brian describes the rather macabre experiments around 1800 with corpses and electricity...making the corpses twitch and move.....with some ideas about bring them back to life. There is increasing evidence from analysis of ancient zircons that the very young earth was a world of moderate temperatures, stable oceans and familiar air (though oxygen levels were low) and there are some indications that life may have been established 4.1 billion years ago.But life appears to run contrary to the second law of thermodynamics because living things are highly ordered. Though as Schrodinger pointed out, events within a living system cannot be isolated from their environment . For example if you have a bunch of atoms of hydrogen and oxygen in a box and they spontaneously combine to form water...the water is in a more ordered state than the atoms. So what has happened here? Well whilst the entropy of the system of atoms has been lowered by the chemical reaction, a large amount of energy has also been released, This heat is absorbed into the surroundings ...thus increasing the entropy of the environment by more than the entropy increase associated with the formation of the water molecules. Living things work in the same way.The energy generating mechanisms used by living things are basically sugar combines with oxygen giving CO2 plus water ...and a wax candle burning is essentially the same sort of reaction. In both cases electrons are transferred from a long chain carbon molecule to oxygen. But with respiration (life) the electron is transferred via a lot of steps (about 15) usually involving iron. The steps are also used in photosynthesis. And all living things store part of the energy in ATP..like batteries. As the electrons are passed down the respiratory chain they are used to pump protons across membranes. For every pair of electron 10 protons are pumped. In the vicinity of the membrane (6 billionths of a m thick), the electric field is 30 million volts per m...roughly like a lightning strike on us. This ""waterfall"" of protons is used to produce ATP out of two ""empty"" molecular components known as ADP plus P. All living things seem to use the same system which suggests that this biochemistry is very ancient. The story then morphs into the familiar discussion about life originating in the under-sea volcanic vents..black smokers and possible hydrogen sulphide chemistry; and white smokers which are not volcanic but result from the reaction of warm water with methane at the ocean floor...and have an alkaline environment.The argument is that one gets a proton gradient between this alkaline environment (with a deficit of protons) and the surrounding seawater's acid environment with a surplus of protons. The argument is that this sets up the conditions needed for photosynthesis or respiration ...with a proton gradient. (Actually, I think one probably gets something like this with the double layer between common clay particles.....and clay lines itself up in nice ordered sheets with regular spacing.......might be worth exploring...). Brian leaves us with the thought that life is really just chemistry and there are some plausible pathways for it to occur spontaneously on the earth. He then explores the basis of colour and our experience of colour and the formation of the rainbow. In passing he mentions Ibn al-Haytham, who, in the 11th century, was a pretty original researcher....looking for evidence rather than relying on authority....his words about the seeker after truth:...""he should also suspect himself as he performs his critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency"". Great! I like it. Other's contributed to the understanding of the formation of the rainbow but it was probably Newton who eventually resolved the issue with a double refraction of while light ..which was composed of all the other visible colours. And so to an an investigation into the origin and nature of light. The energy output of the sun at the top of the earth's atmosphere is 1.41Kw/ square m. in January when the earth is closest to the sun and 1.32 Kw in July when the earth is furtherest away...and the energy output is staggering ...all due to the fusion resulting in an atomic nucleus of one proton and one neutron...it's called a deuteron...Then another proton fuses with the deuteron to form Helium 3 nucleus and two of these fuse together to form a Helium 4 nucleus...with the release of 2 protons.About this stage, I've just ordered, the larger version of the BBC book. I'll update this review when I receive it but for the moment I'll just continue following Brian Cox as he explains why things shine.It was Maxwell who realised that light was a travelling disturbance in the electromagnetic field. He saw it as a wave and light has a wavelength...ranging (at least) from 10 to power 8 m (long radio waves) to 10 to power -16 (gamma rays). When electrical charges wiggle they create a changing magnetic field which creates a changing electrical field etc etc. The resulting moving disturbance IS light. The movement suggests a link between temperature and light...but the early models predicted an infinite amount of energy being radiated away from hot objects....obviously not right so Planck proposed another model...crazy but it worked where light could only be emitted in packets. It was Einstein who actually proposed taking the theory seriously and proposed that light is actually composed of little packets (photons)....and even more...that the electromagnetic field is composed of little particles of light.....thus pointing to the deeper structure of quantum theory. Electrically charged particles emit light when they are accelerated....in accord with Maxwell's equations.Electrons can organise themselves in very specific ways within molecules. If the arrangement of electrons inside a molecule is to be altered then a photon with just the right energy to make the change must be absorbed. Since the energy of a photon is directly related to its colour , a particular molecule will only absorb certain colours of light. In modern language, Rayleigh's formula shows that the probability of a photon to scatter is inversely proportional to the fourth power of its wavelength. This means that blue photos (450nm) are over three times more likely to scatter off gas molecules on their way through than red photons (650nm). That's why we have blue skies during the day and red at dusk.But why is green the colour of life...the answer is that plants are green because chlorophyll absorbs blue and red photons and the green photons are reflected back into our eyes. Early life probably grabbed their electrons off less stable molecules such as hydrogen sulphide..but at some stage the oxygen evolving complex allowed organisms to replace H2S with the more readily available water. The while lot was linked together into the Z-scheme (of photosynthesis) which is present in all plants today.His summary of photosynthesis skims over things just a bit too fast. But then, it's incredibly complicated...and probably best left to a specialist boom.Finally he indulges himself with some speculation about life elsewhere in the universe. There is a lot of knowledge packed into this book. And I'll be interested to see how the full sized book handles the message."

The only one who could write better would be late Carl Sagan. It'll be quite hard to find using Monet as a framework to explain Special Theory of Relativity elsewhere."

Book goes far more in depth into the topics covered in the show to the point where I struggled a bit to understand the concepts and math being discussed. Luckily, Brian Cox is nice enough to point out well in advance the section that will require some mental gymnastics, and encourages the reader (in his all to witty ways) to take a break and have some tea before tackling the subject matter. If that doesn't work, there's always er-reading it.I can't think of any way to summarize this book except that if you're familiar with Cox's lectures, podcast, and shows, then you will not be disappointed."

27,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7401975-calenmarwen,3,"Good book, got better as it went along and the author warmed to his theme. Writing seemed a little disjointed at first.The only book I've read to really compare this to, is A Brief History of Time which I actually found easy to read. I imagine that book deals with more complicated ideas, but due to the skill of the writer, I ended up understanding almost all of them, and enjoying the book more than the current one where the explanations were not as helpful."
28,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12700288-paul,3,This was far less horrible than I expected. Attempts at witticism are cringeworthy but sparse and the literary quotes while abundant are bearable. I've not seen the TV show the book keeps mentioning but going on previous experience it's probably mostly closeups of Brian Cox in gormless wonder. 
29,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27195238-menglong-youk,4,4.25/5 starsThe book is best read after one finishes watching Brian Cox's mini-series. The documentaries will provide us stunning visuals and basic information of many concepts while the book takes one step further explaining readers in more details. 
30,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5982358-derek-bridge,4,"Beautifully-illustrated and quite lyrical, as with Cox's other BBC publications. But I found this one a harder read, maybe due to its ambitions - a delve into fundamental, including quantum physics, which is never going to be an easy read."
31,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6489740-lloyd-downey,5,"I've already written a review of this book....well not quite....because my review was of a paperback version and this is the large hardback colour version of this book designed to accompany a BBC Science Program. As one can gather from my other review, I was not happy with the paperback version. (The diagrams were too small, printing in black and white lost most of the details. So I looked for the ""real"" version of the book to form a judgement. And, I must confess, it is altogether a much better and very different experience. For a start, there are probably close to 10x the number of illustrations...and many of them quite large. And the addition of full colour makes such a huge difference ....especially with something like the blackbody spectrum ...showing how far the infra red extends (for example).However, now that I've finished re-reading the book in the large version, I am surprised to find that the parts that were difficult in the smaller paperback version are still difficult, even with the addition of colour. So I'm not sure that I am all that much further ahead. It is true, that the larger diagrams in colour are certainly clearer, and easier to understand than the faded B&W versions...but I struggles to understand the tides in the paperback version and still struggling to understand the tides in this version. I guess, it is easier to grasp the concept of a centre of mass of the earth+moon combination with he colour diagram and it is certainly easier to grasp the concepts of light and the spectrum with colour added. The book, is really quite lovely, and Brain Cox's script is generally interesting and clear. So, all in all, a good book which I'm rating as 5 stars."
32,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33362779-gareth,4,"Another very good book by Brian Cox and Andrew Cohen that supplements the tv programs that they have produced. I haven't actually seen the programs myself and it didn't have any affect on this at all. The book is very well written and a lot of time and effort has gone into it. It details the progression through the history of the forces that have come to shape the world today, and some of the planets too. Including things such as how and why DNA came around, why snowflakes are formed the way they are, how time is affected by speed and how your future could already be pre determined in another universe and we are just following allowing, filling the gaps. I recently finished Human Universe from the same authors and although this was good, I preferred Human Universe. This book is aimed at a higher scientific audience, if I remember correctly Human Universe had one differential equation in it. This book has quite a few and even delves into vector calculus at some points without a suitable explanation on what components of the equation actually mean. There was also one or two points where I had to go back and reread parts as I'd got through them and didn't quite remember what they were about due to the filler. I don't necessarily see this as bad as it's good to learn something new! However I could see it putting people off. That aside I did enjoy this book and if you are even considering reading it then it is worth a go! Things are explained well and you come away with a greater appreciation of the mysteries of the universe and especially the scientific minds that have spent a lifetime of research just so we know why the sky is blue. Very good book."
33,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019544-sue,4,"Brian Cox takes simple questions, such as why does the sun shine, and explains the physics behind the answer. He included some quite whimsical asides and quips, which help lighten the tone. This is helpful because the book is pretty detailed in its explanations. It reminded me of Physics classes with Mrs Burton, who managed to make the whole subject sound interesting way back in the 70s. I remember being interested to know how you could tell where a ball would land if thrown into the wind (yes really, I liked that stuff at school!) and loved playing around with the Maths to get to an answer. I would have loved to read a book like this back then. I only wish I had seen the TV series on which this is based - I'll watch for it on a re-run. As well as being great for adults, this would be an ideal book for a child interested in science of any sort. I have to mention the outstanding narration by Samuel West. Not only was his voice a pleasure to listen to, but he actually sounded as though he understood all the theories himself, and was enjoying explaining them to the listener! This definitely helped in the heavier quantum physics sections about quarks and so on which, in themselves, I didn't find so interesting, but I could listen to his voice all day so I just sailed through it."
34,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20087831-tahmidul,5,"Phew! That was one hell of a ride. Professor Cox sure can write! This book explains a lot of things. Physics, astronomy, geography, biology and whatnot. I must add to this, a lot of new questions are asked. That is exhilarating! The humble professor tells us about all we know today, and all that we don't know.The writing style is a treat in itself. Feels like he's lecturing you, live. Sometimes questions will surface in that weird brain of yours, the writer knows. Almost all of the questions that came to me at the time of reading were answered, or asked. Let me give you an example,“There are three known planets in the PSR B1257 system, which have been named Draugr, Poltergeist and Phobetor. Poltergeist was the first to be discovered. I know, I was curious about their names as well. Poltergeist means ""pounding ghost"". The draugr are the undead in Norse legends who live in their graves. And Phobetor is the personification of nightmares, and the son of Nyx, Greek goddess of the night.Astronomers are goths.”That's a great sense of humor. Reading this book is fun. What can be better than understanding the complex (yet simple) working of the universe, enjoyably.Oh, we're made of starstuff 😂"
35,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66196977-benj,3,"This book is surprisingly bad, and bad in two distinct ways.The first problem is that it’s not well-written. I generally enjoy Brian Cox’s television programs and find them easy to follow, but this book seemed to gloss over many important points. A theory is described, but not explained in enough detail to make it understandable to the layman. To take one example early on: he tells us that the electro-magnetic force is carried by photons. What? I’ve never heard of photons doing this before, and would have liked a bit more discussion on how this works.And that leads to the second problem. I checked out photons in the index, which told me that their first mention is on a certain page. I re-read that page, and the index was wrong. This sort of sloppiness pervades the book. There are lots of diagrams, but these often require paragraphs of explanation, which is the wrong way round - diagrams should illuminate the text. In one case a diagram contained an obvious mistake. In a similar vein there are examples of equations where some of the functions are not even mentioned, much less explained.This is a hugely ambitious book, and I enjoyed much of it, but it feels like it was cobbled together in a hurry."
36,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13565835-agne-zainyte,5,"Brian Cox is in love with science the same way as Carl Sagan was in love with it.I believe this is a book for someone who enjoys science and cares to learn more about it. For someone who cares to learn about science from the beginning, this book might seem too challenging or exhausting. Brian's writing is brilliant but the terms and topics might seem too difficult and consequently, this book might lose its beauty. Since I already read a couple of popular science books on physics before and I feel that I have an understanding, for me it was hard to judge if this book would be an easy read for someone new. But as I am sure that most of the people heard of the terms used in the book in school, this book can serve as a reminder how glorious science can be if presented in an interesting way. Overall, I am a science lover and I must say this is the book written by a man who loves science and sees poetry in it. Science is hard to overly simplify without losing its beauty, it is a challenge for sure, but I believe Brian did it well."
37,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28436797-nat,4,"Forces of Nature was a pretty engaging and accessible read. It's narrated very strongly from the point of view of Brian Cox, so if you don't like him you won't like this.The book focuses on three things. First, explaining simple questions with relatively complex science. Second, telling a history of science. Third, being infectiously enthusiastic. These three themes fit together quite well throughout, and while the overall structure does lend itself to the nebulous, freethinking curiosity that the third theme is rooted in, it also causes the book's main problem. The structure is symmetrical - four subjects that can be viewed as independent and related. Some of the storytelling, however, is chronological. In a book where many of the call-backs and references are scientific in nature, this is especially difficult. It's a great book to read and enjoy, it's not a great book to have to study from.That said, I don't have any major complaints - I enjoyed it, and even if I forget the actual science (or forgot halfway through writing this), I probably won't forget the general sense of positivity it leaves you with. Although there is a pretty grim chapter on Time."
38,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70081069-alec,4,"This book freely roams the science behind various natural occurrences, along with the odd quip and tangent every now and then. Whilst I enjoyed some of these additions, I also found the writing style and structure to interrupt the flow of an explanation just a tad too often, working against the informative purpose of the book. (However, I appreciate that this is no doubt an issue that comes of trying to simultaneously breach such a variety of topics.) Despite this, I found it to be an engaging and enlightening read, sparking curiosity within me towards a variety of the areas covered, as well as providing me with a much greater understanding and respect of the interconnectedness of physics - if not all sciences. A worthwhile read, and certainly a book that I can see myself flicking through again in the future.Irrelevant sidenote: why did the last 2 sentences confuse me more than the rest of the book? - A Thick Person"
39,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6463881-l,5,"In this book, it explains the minutae of human experience through science. Most questions end with uncertainty, the space between the known and unknown -- a place of curiosity and wonder. And, this book delves deep into those parts where many fear to go. Questions are asked that have a sense of depth, of complexity and of intractability. You step beyond the everyday and approach the universe beyond... Science is about a shift in perspective. Scientific writing that transcends time, and gives an illuminating and entertaining insight into a great mind at play. Science is delighted frustration! Scientific results are always preliminary, no scientist will believe they have offered the last word on a given subject! This book also covers quantum theory, Einstein's theories and is fresh and original. I would recommend it to any science fan, wonders of the universe fan or someone who's interested in physics. "
40,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15078832-steve-cann,4,"This book made for a fascinating and absorbing accompaniment to the excellent TV series, where Brian sets out to answer those simple but important questions about how and why nature and the universe is what it is!Brian adds his own personal insights, and all the chapters are set out in clear and easy to digest chunks.The only drawback of the book is that some of these things are better explained via the visual medium of TV, and many of the maths & equations quoted can appear rather mind-boggling to the lay-reader.It’s a shame too that nearly all measurements are shown in metric - I don’t know anyone who uses these other than schoolchildren!But, those small points aside, this book is beautifully set out and genuinely humbling and fascinating in equal measure - all wrapped up in Brian’s trademark friendly and accessible style.May the force be with you!"
41,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56590436-stephanie,5,"Im typically a pop-fan fiction, light and airy something to occupy me while i commute. My husband, a historical academic - studying warfare, spies and some science. So our Audible library is hodge podge. That's the foundation of this review.This is a delightfully fantastic book. Cox explains everything from the breakdown of an atom to ice molecules to the beginning of the universe. He takes you on a long journey that seems to filled with never ending bunny trails - until he ties it all together and you realize why he began explaining in the first place. My recommendation -- read or listen to this in long stretches and with a buddy. There are sections of the book where I would THINK I finally grasped what he was saying only to lose it and feel utterly confused the next moment."
42,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105519070-maddie-johnson,4,"I will not pretend that a lot of the content didn’t go over my head, nevertheless Cox presents some very interesting concepts and thought provoking ideas. Some of my favourite extracts include: “Nature is beautiful, deep down, and when we want to glimpse that underlying beauty. Let’s not guess. Let’s not make something up. Let’s think, observe, experiment, pay attention, look for similarities and differences across the natural world and try to understand them. Most of all, let’s be comfortable, delighted, exhilarated when faced with the unknown and devote our time to exploring the infinite territory beyond. There are treasures beyond imagination in the simplest things, if we care to look closely” “It is sometimes the case that remarkable ideas become so embedded in culture that they cease to feel remarkable simply because they are familiar” "
43,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84128348-neilw,2,"What do you get when you turn a slick science documentary into a novel? A bit of a mess, actually.While the science is solid and interesting, it is badly presented, mostly since it was meant for another medium. All of the illustrations are in the center of the book, meaning the visual the narration would have counted on you seeing in real time causes you to thumb through the book or just skip it altogether. The tone of the book varies from conversational to the feeling of a technical lecture. The ligaments connecting the ideas seems to have been largely stripped away with the loss of visual cues. You can see how the sections would have worked as an episode of a show...they just don't work in book form."
44,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68253295-malcolm-evans,4,"Brian Cox takes some very basic and apparently simple scientific questions like why does the sun shine, why are plants green, why are we here and then proceeds to answer those questions to deeper and deeper scientific levels peeling away different levels of truth down to the quantum level challenging our understanding of science at each level. The book reads like a story of intrigue and discovery. He states that good scientists should challenge every concept and not be disappointed about being proved wrong as a new layer of truth is uncovered. I really enjoyed the journey with him. His ultimate conclusions even verge on the territory of philosophy and theology."
45,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25824532-ian,5,"This is such a well written accessible exploration of science which will certainly appeal to anyone who is interested in the origins of space, time and us. It is a book which is to be savoured rather than rushed through and the little effort and time required is repaid over and over. Professor Cox has presented a wonderful description of our world through the eyes of physics, chemistry and biology with an excellent summary of what is known tantalisingly interspersed with theories of what may be. If you only ever read one science book, then read this one."
46,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16460731-deniz,2,"Stereotypically British...Not sure if anyone would enjoy this but a reader who does not read much. Too shallow even for a popular science book, not much of detail, no infectious excite nor curiosity injections. Definitely not a starting book for this genre nor a follow-up... I literally just wasted my 2-3 weeks on this. Have to confess that Brian Cox is really good a communication, and does quite impressive chats and interviews in front of the camera, but his books are definitely third class."
47,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56629704-ashley-vu,4,"Forces of Nature is all about the beauty of nature and its laws. Throughout the book, Brian covers how physics, chemistry and biology together beautifully underlie seemingly obvious phenomenon. At times it is very thought provoking. My favourite chapter is the Origins of Life, which imposes great philosophical thought on what we are as human being and how insignificant we are in this enormous universe. However, I have to admit, it is hard to follow sometimes when more advanced science is involved."
48,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19919117-kurtis-baute,4,"Excellent book about the forces of nature and their discovery via the scientific method. Cox has a poetic way of expressing the beauty of the scientific method, and this book is filled with cool historical accounts of discovery, as well as great examples on how these forces apply to the universe and interact with each other. If I hadn't already read a lot about this topic I think this book would have really blown my mind. Would definitely recommend for those just getting into science."
49,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13309535-sara,4,"A lot of it went over my head, but I think after another listen or two (my physics knowledge is more than a little rusty), I'll have understood most of it. You can clearly tell that he finds the natural world exquisitely beautiful, and loves learning and sharing why this is so. He left me with a feeling that we are lucky to be alive on our little planet, doubly so to be alive at a time when so many scintillating discoveries are being made!"
50,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51233654-jack,4,"Another book by Professor Brian Cox which covers topics with his usual enthusiasm. It is obvious that Professor Cox takes joy in encouraging inquisitive minds to ask questions and to pay attention to the world around us. The book is full of information, explanations, humour and encouragement. There are times, as I felt when reading his book 'Human Universe', where I wish some topics would be expanded on further or themes discussed in more detail, but I read these chapters as an encouragement to continue your learning rather than a comprehensive coverage."
51,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63240697-gu-mundur,5,"I think this is the best science book that I have read.Binds to together astrophysics, particle physics, chemistry and biology in perfect clear and understandable mix. Authors interest and passion for this topics is so contagious that I never dazed of. And suddenly Maxwell's equations make more sense.Almost perfect book that ""just"" takes around 5 hours to read. Amazing given the scope of topics it manages to cover."
52,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62177003-planar,4,"Nice read, a bit harder than your average popular science book. Yet if you can manage it it has some wonderful insights. Helped me to understand special relativity better than any other book. Which goes back to what I am always saying. You cannot properly explain in depth the properties of the physical world without use of mathematical equations. This book dares to use some basic equations and it works well"
53,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61812565-jacob,5,This book about physics is bookended by a quote from Kermit The Frog.EDIT: changed this to a 5 Star rating after sleeping on it. It delivers answers to fundamental questions about nature. Why does the sky turn red during the sunset? Why do honeybees build perfect hexagon beehives?It is interesting to delve into and it leaves an impression!
54,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73029907-cav,4,"Great book, that serves as a primer to explain the basic physics of our universe; relativity, quantum physics, particle physics, the 4 forces, wavelengths of light, Maxwell's laws, and more.I was expecting it to be more of an easy, introductory read, but it's a fairly dense and technical look at the topics covered. This is not a bad thing, but just be aware that's it's a fairly informationally-dense science book.He tends to write in a bit of a dry style, although I'll give him credit for tossing in some humorous asides as an attempt to keep the mood light. I would recommend this book to anyone curious about physics and the forces that govern our universe."
55,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55350450-chris-cloake,4,Loved this. It challenges you to use your brain. Physics made fun. I needed Brian Cox to teach me at school. I would have passed!The simple stuff we take for granted explained beautifully. It makes sense of my part in the Universe without the thankless soul searching demands of religion.It takes none of the awe inspiring aspects away from Nature while letting us understand it. 
56,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53841635-zad,3,"This is a good book. What's annoying is that it could have been great. What bothered me the most is that the explanation of concepts was interrupted with historical trivia. Which is fine to a certain degree. However, these were so long winded that they totally disrupted the explanation.But maybe it's just me. Anyway, if you have the chance, read this book. "
57,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115213781-curtis-holt,5,"This unsuspecting book managed to fundamentally change the way I look at the universe. Suddenly every structure and event is a pattern, a result of unchanging laws. There's a subtle beauty hiding in this realisation as it emerges in the everyday, summoning memories of the masterfully-presented examples and anecdotes presented in this book."
58,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5931996-jodi,4,"I can’t say that I understood everything that was covered (physics is something that won’t ever stay in my head), but it was so engaging that whilst listening to the audiobook I decided to purchase the book and follow along. I’m really loving science non-fiction novels (science is the definition of non-fiction I guess) and excited to pick more up soon! "
59,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48716011-andrea-allen,1,My husband bought this book for me and I read the back and thought it looked really good.

63,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2220034-steinar-sigurdsson,3,Two problems; I listened to the audiobook and not hearing Brian's voice deliver his lines was not the same.

64,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6463196-gordon,4,This is a good science book delivered in easy to digest chunks. It mainly covered subjects I already knew but still had enough new facts and figures and it's always good to reinforce and update knowledge well worth picking it up unless you really want something a bit more in depth.
65,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38934845-ruairi-o-driscoll,4,"An excellent summary of the forces of nature, however, I found the detail thin at points.

69,Wonders,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108474132-aga-doma-ska,5,Wonderfully written. Shows us how little we know about that things we think we know really well. And takes us to the whole new wonderful world of particle physics. The World never will be looked at in the same way.
