0,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3926982-shovelmonkey1,4,"Visiting the Body Farm in Tennessee would be my idea of a good day out. A scientific research facility which treats death as an informative transition period rather than something static and final, the Body Farm has become world famous.As someone who has been routinely staring death in the face (or more accurately into the faces of hundreds of deceased, recent or otherwise), my desk is usually awash with texts and field manuals produced by William Bass and his colleagues. People often mistakenly believe that archaeologists only deal with the driest of bones. This is not true and a number of my experiences have been remarkably similar to those of Prof Bass (bodies appearing recently buried turning out to have been in the ground for over 120 years like Colonel Shy/ body bags really not being leak proof being two examples).Deaths Acre takes you inside the body farm, providing detailed descriptions of the advances in forensic research, as well as an insight into the inspiration and relationships which led Prof Bass on his remarkable journey from army researcher to forensics lecturer and founder of the worlds most infamous research facility.I have to admit to reading this for the forensic case details rather than info on Bill's personal life but despite being a 'ghosted' volume (perhaps in the literal and literary sense) it was an informative and educational read. Some of the descriptions and images are not for the squeamish so if you're not in possession of an ironcast gut then maybe you should just stick to Patricia Cornwell novels. If you're feeling double tough and want further access to forensic material then Bass's field guide to human osteology should be your next port of call."
1,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/961136-becky,4,"As someone who has had a lifelong fascination with death, decomposition, murder, funerary and burial practices, and all manner of morbid stuff, I was eager to read Death's Acre. I had read a little about the Body Farm previously, so I couldn't wait to get the whole story from the man who started it all, Bill Bass.I expected the book to focus very narrowly on the Body Farm itself, but that isn't the case. The reader does get information about Bass's background and how he got into anthropology -- and then forensics -- in the first place. This moves into logical background about Bass's initial work with corpses and the eventual founding of the Body Farm. I thought it was interesting that the Farm got started not only as a much-needed research facility for learning about an uncharted area of science, but it also seemed to have been started because Bass was running out of place to store messy dead bodies (a broom closet at the university and even the trunk of his beloved Mustang proved to be not the best places after all!).The book then gets into some of the difficulties the Farm has had -- protests about its location, protests about the use of unclaimed cadavers (particularly those of U.S. veterans) and some of the projects it has hosted (including an adipocere formation experiment and an experiment suggested by crime author Patricia Cornwell).But most of what comprises this book are stories about Bass's career -- his failures and successes. The failures (most notably the Shy case) point up the need for a facility like the Body Farm, and the successes point to the value of the data gathered at the site. All the workers at the Body Farm -- living and dead -- are doing a great deal to aid forensic science. In the future, justice for murder victims will be served more swiftly and accurately because of the work done at the Body Farm.Avid readers of true crime will enjoy the specialized ""professional"" view of cases that may already be familiar to them. I was familiar with the Madison Rutherford and Perry/Rubinstein cases, but getting the technical details from Bass (shaped for maximum readability by his capable co-author Jon Jefferson) gave the stories a new dimension. Especially fascinating was the description of the study Bass's student made of the effects of different types of saws upon bone, which helped lead to a conviction in the death of Leslie Mahaffey, one of the victims of the diabolical Paul Bernardo, the male half of the Canadian ""Barbie and Ken"" husband-and-wife murder team. There's also an inside look at the infamous Tri-State Crematory case from 2002.There's a lot of eye-popping detail in this book, some of it horrifying, some of it poignant, some of it -- dare I say -- hilarious. See if you can keep yourself from laughing when you find out why Bass had to buy his first wife two new kitchen stoves, or why he had to buy his third wife a new blender.Even when the tone of the book becomes humorous, Bass is always professional and respectful. Bass sees himself as a scientist, first and foremost, and his ultimate goal is to use his science to bring criminals to justice. He's humble, big-hearted, and always willing to learn from anybody -- be it a colleague, one of his own students, or the voiceless dead who speak to him with their inert, shattered bones. "
2,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3292905-julie,4,"I loved William Bass's engaging writing style and dry humor. He works with passion and dedication to unravel the truth of violent death to provide closure to those that mourn the victims. According to Bass, ""Truth like that can be a humbling and sacred gift for a scientist to give."""
3,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10600458-val,4,"What a fascinating book to read! I learned a lot (A LOT!) about what happens to the human body when a person dies. What a journey Dr. Bass had, leading up to the creation of the body farm. He shared many different cases and some were truly heart wrenching to read. He also shared anecdotes about his life, leaving me smiling and chuckling quite often. I think one of the things I admired the most was how respectful Dr. Bass was of every body he examined. I loved how he grasped any and every opportunity to learn - even when it included learning from one of his students!The first time I heard of a body farm was on the original CSI. Learning that one actually exists, and the long road bringing it into existence, makes for an engrossing read!"
4,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6303796-rachel-bavr,5,"I picked up this book because the Body Farm fascinates me. Seriously, I'm so taken with that place that I would consider willing my future cadaver there someday if my family approves. In Death's Acre, Dr. William M. Bass, his tale written by the vastly capable Jon Jefferson, takes us on the journey of his exciting career as a forensic anthropologist, professor, and founder of the Body Farm. There are some very graphic descriptions of human decomposition in this book, which doesn't bother me, but I know some readers may want to take that into account before reading. Bass manages to remain respectful throughout all of the tough stuff, though, from outlining the case of a murdered toddler to commenting on charred human remains. That undercurrent of respect for the decedents and the work really sets this book on a pedestal for me. Because I'm hardly a science scholar, I was relieved to find that Bass and Jefferson explain the processes in layman's terms. At times, I felt like one of Dr. Bass's students, called to class to study another pile of bones. As the book went on, I got better and better at figuring out the rationale behind time of death estimates and cause of death explanations. No wonder the man is a legend in his field. I would recommend this story to anyone who has the stomach for and the interest in forensic science. "
5,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"The writing could be tighter, but his wandering through his life is interesting. How he, an anthropologist developed into a pioneer in the field of forensics is interesting & funny, in rather horrible ways. (A corpse in the closet over the weekend - the poor janitor!) The development & reasoning behind the body farm is also interesting. See Mary Roache's book on corpses, Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers. She has a chapter on the body farm & does a wonderful job, too."
6,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7214345-julia-ce,4,"This book is based on the University of Tennessee's Anthropological Research Facility, aka ""The Body Farm"". The 1st facility of it's kind, The Body Farm researches the decomposition process of the human body in varied controlled settings. Results in these studies have helped federal and local law enforcement solve murders and missing persons cases.The author, who joined UofT's anthropology department in 1971 and founded the original Body Farm in 1981, injects a nice balance of humor to off-set the scientific language of the book. Thanks to the author explanation and the internet, I thought this book was quite easy for the layperson to understand. The author is also half of the writing duo ""Jefferson Bass"" who writes ""The Body Farm"" series. After reading this book, I am looking forward to reading The Body Farm series."
7,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17703155-melissa-chung,5,"I can’t remember if my friend Keely bought me this book or I bought it myself because she loved it so much. With that being said, I want to thank my friend Keely for making me read this book. It’s an amazing piece of non-fiction that I highly recommend reading.On the front cover of the book it says foreword by Patricia Cornwell. A relative told me in college, “if you like crime books you have to read Patricia Cornwell”. I picked up her first book of the Scarpetta series and was hooked. I was happy to read a book that Patricia had a small hand in. I also love anything that has to do with death. I’m odd like that. So picking up this true crime non-fiction was a real treat. Dr. Bill Bass is the creator of the Body Farm, a scientifically run facility, that recreates different scenarios where a body could decompose. Through this scientific research we now can tell when a body died. Time of death is an important marker for police in murder investigations. Through the body farm, Dr. Bass and his fellow forensic anthropologists, entomologists, medical examiners, forensic dentists and other scientists and law enforcement have learned the stages of decomposition. Through decades of research, the body farm has helped to broaden and create a more accurate analysis of death. We know what to look for in order to catch that killer. This book doesn’t just talk about the body farm it also follows Bill Bass’s journey from getting a masters in counseling and taking an anthropology class just for fun, to becoming a world renowned forensic anthropologist. Death’s Acre or the body farm is where Bill Bass became famous, but it was his coming up that was the most fascinating. We get see cases that Bass worked on over the years. We get to read about his “aha!” moments, and his oops moments. With the help of some anthropology pioneers, Bill Bass and his body farm would not be possible.If you like true crime, forensics, non-fiction, mystery and death in general you’ll really enjoy this book. Those with a weak stomach be aware... there are mentions of bugs, body liquid, juicy flesh, horrendous smells and other unpleasant adjectives to describe a rotting corpse. I ate while reading this so I’m fine teehee. Check this book out. You won’t be disappointed."
8,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239777-sarah-swann,4,"This was fascinating! It really shows the importance of forensic science and what it can prove. If I had the stomach for it, I think this is a fascinating field...but I can’t, lol!"
9,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt,5,"Examining one of the Bass non-fiction books, the reader will discover that the world of forensic anthropology and crime scene analysis is nothing like that depicted on television, or in most crime novels. Bass seeks not only to delve into the real-world exploration of what he has been doing for the past 25 (at the time) years or so, but also to shed some light on techniques, variations, and the creation of the Body Farm, for which he has become known since its creation in 1980. Adding some personal stories to many of his professional (read: work) ones, Bass, enthrals the reader with true crime solving and anecdotal tales that shed a more thorough light on forensics in general and forensic anthropology in particular. It is much more than BONES or CSI could offer, and far more interesting, especially for the reader who has enjoyed Bass' complete series of fiction novels.I come into this reading experience, having devoured the entire fiction series (to date) and being a major fan. As he does in his works of fiction, Bass injects a pile of humour and a ton of teachable moments to show the reader what it is that is going on and putting it in a larger context for the layman. Additionally, many of the story lines of the fiction series are taken from Bass' experiences and people with whom he has worked. (As an aside, many of Bass' former students have gone on to have careers with 'world's foremost expert' attached to their titles). I found this highly entertaining and thoroughly captivating. While I am sure there is a research component to writing his fiction books, much can also be called life lesson and experience.I highly enjoyable book, fitting right in with the fiction collection. Fans of Bass' work will surely love this and fans of BONES, CSI, and even Patricia Cornwell (fan and friend of Dr. Bass) will also raise eyebrows and utter many a 'hmm'.Kudos Messers. Bass for this wonderful journey into the world of forensic anthropology. I cannot wait to read the other non-fiction book you two have penned. "
10,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11818290-sarah,4,"I really enjoyed learning about the Body Farm and how it came to be. I have read Patricia Cornwell's book The Body Farm and so learning the lengths she went to for her research for a death scene in the book was great and encouraging to hear that she really cared if her books are realistic. Also learning where the techniques that are taken for granted today came from, who thought them up, and the experiments done to create these techniques. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the behind the scenes, real life aspect of shows like CSI and Criminal Minds."
11,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50066399-diane-in-australia,4,4 Stars = Outstanding. It definitely held my interest.
12,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28537122-wheeler,1,"“Death’s Acre” is not what it claims to be: “Inside the Legendary Forensic Lab the Body Farm Where the Dead Do Tell Tales.”It’s Bill Bass’s bloated memoir, brimming with useless information, bogging down readers and serving no purpose.It’s also Bill Bass’s chance to stand up and accuse men and women, not convicted in a court of law, of being murderers. More on that later.Bass writes about all sorts of things, including a few of his cases and cases of his colleagues. He writes a little about the “body farm” and its genesis, but, not that much. He complains about journalists, the scoundrels, and then bemoans when newspapers (written by journalists) didn’t cover a murder, disappearance or found body he deemed newsworthy. A little bit of cake-and-eat-it-too going on.As much as Bass might bemoan journalists, he could have done with a journalistic editor. He jumps around, across, over, under and through time without much, if any, concrete groundings, concrete dates, concrete years to orient the reader. There is no timeline and the memoir is not ordered chronologically.Result: Confusing and bloated. Too much useless fluff opinion. Bass tries to be a philosopher, to make great, profound points at the end of his chapters. Really, life is short and brutish and no amount of sugared words will mask that fact.Guilty until proven innocentAs a journalist, on the cops and courts beat, I deal with this topic on a (literally) daily basis. I err on the side of writing about all the felony arrests in my county. I also try to make sure to write about the end of the case: a guilty plea, a dismissal, a not-guilty verdict, etc.Bill Bass feels no need to throw allegedlys into his writing. Or, really, any indication that the people whom he believes to be guilty aren’t. They’re guilty, come hell or high water! And as a forensic pathologist, often writing about cases he was not even a part of, he knows best. Trust Bill, when he says someone is a murderer. It doesn’t ruin lives or reputations or anything.Take the case of the murdered 18-year-old Lisa Ranker. Bass’ protégé, Bill Rodriguez, was working on the case and detectives thought they had their suspect based on circumstantial evidence, hearsay and a polygraph test. The District Attorney didn’t want to prosecute.That’s not good enough for Bill Bass. Boyfriend Bernie Woody and Woody’s friend Danny Heath are guilty. And that’s just a fact.“With no cause of death and nothing but circumstantial evidence to suggest that Lisa might have been murdered, though, the district attorney decided not to file criminal charges against either Bernie Woody or Danny Heath.”Bass is on a first-name basis with “Danny,” whom he has accused of murdering or helping to murder Ranker. I mention his casual use of Heath’s last name because it marks a lack of respect and civility, especially for a man one openly and profusely accuses of murder in a mainstream publication.So, Rodriguez (referred to, very poorly in style terms in this book, as Bill, despite the author’s own first name) finds Ranker’s bones show evidence of stab wounds. Her death gets re-classified as a homicide.“Sadly, Lisa’s killer remains at large. Despite the skeletal proof Bill (Rodriguez) found showing that Lisa has been murdered, and despite the linger questions surrounding Bernie Woody and Danny Heath, the Fairfax County Commonwealth Attorney remains unwilling to prosecute the case.”Woah there! Billy proved the woman had been stabbed, probably to death! Except there’s no evidence of who did it. Bass doesn’t care. Hang ‘em high! He says. Let God adjust the scales, right? Burn ‘em!“Anthropologists and insects can reveal the truth about a crime, but they can’t force the wheels of bureaucracy to turn, they can’t guarantee that justice will be done. All they can do is serve as a voice for the victims, and hope that voice is heard.”’Let’s be clear. A district attorney refusing to charge and attempt to prosecute a murder case for which he has no evidence is not a wheels of bureaucracy issue. It’s a: preventing other victims, falsely accused by anthropologists who are only out for blood, from being turned into victims issue.(That quote was also one of Bass’s faux-philosophical chapter endings.)And really, he’s giving voice to the dead victims, I guess, in hopes of making new, living ones. Kudos, Dr. Bill Bass. Kudos. Grade A life-ruining right there. Even as a journalist, I couldn’t have done a better job myself. And I’m accused of doing such on a monthly basis.ConclusionMildly entertaining and bloated as the bodies he inspected, Bill Bass makes allegations of murder against unconvicted men and otherwise wastes time in this mislabeled memoir."
13,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1662632-richard,4,"Update Spring 2019: The New York Times just presented a good, short news story on this: My Afterlife on the Body Farm which also links to several other sources of information. One of them is available on YouTube, from the BBC series Stephen Fry in America, episode two on the Deep South. A longer one is a 45-minute documentary (with overly dramatic audio), and a link to a television news report.                      ☠️  ☠️  ☠️ I'd heard about this fellow's work from several directions before I ever picked up the book (one of my oldest friends has agreed to donate his body to this research facility), and I was frankly enamored with the idea (of the research facility, not the donation).I was actually mildly disappointed with the scale of his facility -- I had imagined it as a huge spread, out in the wilds of southern Appalachia, with various experiments scattered in the hollows and tucked away at the end of meandering paths.Sort of like a hiking area the Adamms family might enjoy.The memoir approach also surprised me, but it worked quite well, since Bass's career certainly had drama to it. But, still, the book didn't work as well as I expected. I blame the editors, since Bass must remain the hero in this story, but it is too bad he didn't get a better book out of this.Recommended, to address these flaws: Mary Roach's Stiff."
14,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1990978-lori-summers,3,"I have a keen interest in forensic science and true crime. I studied forensic anthropology for a little while in grad school (and I feel compelled to add that I did this before it was The In Thing). My interest in the subject was sparked by a book by Dr. William Maples, one of the founders of the field, called Dead Men Do Tell Tales. Dr. Bass is another of the giants in the field, although Maples’ book is more artful and creative than this one, which is somewhat formless and meandering.I felt like I’d heard some of these stories before. Given how many books in this field I’ve read, it’s entirely possible that I have, but the similarities between Bass’ career and Maples’ are sometimes striking. Bass is a friendlier narrator than Maples (at times Maples’ ego shines forth like a pair of neon green fuzzy dice hanging from a rearview mirror) but his voice wanders, and he inexplicable gives the same explanations several times in different chapters, almost as if the chapters were written as standalone articles and later compiled, resulting in some repetition of expository information.His discussion of his work at the so-called Body Farm (actually the Anthropological Research Facility) is actually pretty minimal. Most of the book is about his other cases. I would have liked more insight about the work they’ve done at the facility. My enjoyment of the book (which I read very quickly) was probably impeded by my familiarity with the subject matter; a lot of things that would be interesting and new to a less prepared reader were old hat to me.It’s an interesting read but at times wearying and repetitive. I’m surprised his co-author didn’t corrall the prose a bit more. Weak, Jefferson. Weak."
15,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,3,"This is a book that was ghosted, or the guy who wrote it was helped to write it by some other guy. The danger with this is that you don't know if the guy who is helping you to write your book can write. This book could have done with someone with a cringe detector reading over it first and saying to both of them - ""look, no, just no"".Otherwise it is a fascinating book. I loved the story of the Civil War grave and the recent body found in it. I loved most of the stories in the book and given the fact that people seem to be obsessed with shows like CSI and such this ought to be the sort of book that people would enjoy. My main problem with this book was that there was a sense the whole way through that the people writing it were 'cashing in' - and it was hard not to get this impression as they kept referring to it all of the time - but there was no need for this. This was, in many ways, the story of the life of the guy who set up a forensic lab to test what happens to bodies when they are burnt or left out in the elements or put in water and how one can date the time of death by following these processes. There was no need for it to apologise for itself, none at all.This is a book that should have been much better than it ended up being."
16,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7125076-rachel,4,"Excellently written book, though not exactly what I expected from the title. The Body Farm is crucial to the book, but is mostly in the background. The book is a memoir of Bill Bass's professional career, with a little overlap into his personal life. His career has been (Wikipedia says he is still active at age 91) astonishing. I had no idea that studying the decomposition of bodies was included in anthropology. But forensic anthropology does just that, in the interest of solving murders. Bass has apparently been a major factor (a giant factor if you include his students and proteges) in many of the advances of this science.Half or more of the book is about murder cases that Bass worked on. They are fascinating. His (and forensic anthropology's) ability to make broad and specific identifications with as little as a handful of bones is amazing. And when he and his colleagues come up against areas in which they don't have enough knowledge to make a determination, they do their research and add to the science. The Body Farm was started to do just that. The research goes in odd and disgusting smelly directions. I'm glad there are people willing to do this. I have scientific curiosity about it, but there's no way I would get that stinky. Or covered with bugs. Or decomposition fluids/solids.Bass comes across as a congenial person who is devoted to family, truth, and the scientific method. The various murderers and some of the victims do not."
17,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79513313-camden-johnson,5,"I recieved this book as a gift from a family friend after they discovered that I love forensic science. This book dives into the creation of the Body Farm and the work that William Bass does as a forensic anthropologist. The book deals with murder cases, unsolved cases, and even talks about William's personal life and experiences with death. I really enjoyed this book and I'm ashamed that it took me so long to finish it. I would love to visit the Body Farm one day and do research like William Bass."
18,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3361842-keilani-ludlow,4,"Wow what a book! I am so very glad that my new-ish Goodreads friend, Matt, recommended this book. Exactly what I like. I love watching the crime/forensic shows. CSI, Criminal Minds, Bones, whatever. However, I get really grossed-out at the graphic visuals and some of the details into the creepy minds leaves me feeling ill. This book has all the good parts without the nasty.The author started the first body farm in America and is behind (either on his own or thru graduate students he taught) a significant percentage of the forensic methods and tests and processes used today, in addition to much of the knowledge the experts have on how to determine things like age, sex, time since death, etc.He starts just telling little stories of how he started in the field of forensic science. He continues telling his story as it leads up to how he got the idea and eventually started the body farm (and how a very popular Patricia Cornwall book came to be named after it). It's really a kind of series of small stories in (mostly) order, each one telling about how and when he got called to a death scene, what the particular twists were in the murder and in the state of the corpse, and what he did to determine what facts he could find. It's written in easy enough terms for the layman, but well enough that it's not just a story, it's interesting information. I kept grabbing my husband saying ""did you know that..."" over and over. Really fascinating. How to determine how long a body has been dead in multiple situations. How to determine what kind of blade cut apart a body. How to tell if someone was alive or dead, tied or restrained in any way, when their body burned. How to tell if a body had been moved. How to determine time of death by bugs. Why kidnapped children don't leave fingerprints behind. How to determine how long a body had been in the water. How to tell race without a skull. Methods of telling age when teeth aren't available. The list of things determined by either Dr. Bass or by his students is huge and amazing. Reading about how it all unfolded is fascinating!"
19,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27033611-theresa,2,"I'll give it a 2.5. This book is more of an autobiography of Bill Bass, and I will say that he doesn't hesitate to praise himself and emphasize his awards throughout the book. Whereas many of the cases were interesting, often they dragged on. In addition, this book seemed more like a bunch of stories he had written over time and threw together, what with the many repetitions of definitions, and of cohorts' backgrounds/educations--(I just read that in the last chapter; I didn't need to read it again). I had expected more and was disappointed."
20,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3189997-sarah-louise-leach,3,"Some very interesting information from an innovator of forensic pathology, but a little too much about the man, jovial brilliant person though he clearly is, to make this book what I was expecting. I feel I have learned plenty of (hopefully useless to me!) essential grisly dead body facts, so not bad at all."
21,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3067217-kerri-book-hoarder,4,"This book is not for everyone, but oh, I enjoyed it! I'm well aware that I have a bit of a fascination when it comes to death and the macabre. I remember as a teenager checking out a book on Fred and Rosemary West, the infamous serial killers. True crime interests me, as does the nature of death and how people relate to it. The descriptions in this book are sure to turn some stomachs, I would definitely say that if you're not prepared to read honest - and in some case, graphic - descriptions of corpses and decomposition, then you may want to give this book a miss. The stories Bass has to tell are intriguing and fascinating, though, and are well balanced against the details of the author. Intertwined with these are highlights of students and colleagues, which I appreciated. It's interesting - while I stand by my warning up above, I did find myself thinking just now that it's possible that people could benefit from reading books like this. Not necessarily this book, but books on death, and dying. We are so removed from the process, now."
22,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2799466-leah-clifford,5,Really interesting read!
23,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7081519-gretchen,4,"I would have given this book 4 out of 5 stars, but I had one minor, nit-picky complaint. The author gives us only glimpses into his personal life, his beliefs and his childhood. We know by the end of the book that his first two wives died, leaving him lonely and depressed. Then, next thing you know, he's married to someone he knew years ago. I would have liked some tales of their courtship or maybe some more information about her. He mentions at the end that he no longer believes in an afterlife. Throughout the book, I wondered to myself many times how he felt about what happens to us after we die and how he aligns any spiritual beliefs he may have with working day to day with the bodies of human beings and reliving the often horrendous crimes that brought those bodies to him. I am interested in how he came to his unbelief of an afterlife. That being said, I enjoyed the book immensely. A strong stomach is definitely a prerequisite for reading a book in which you discover where maggots most like to feed on rotting flesh and how a body appears in each stage of decomposition. I actually learned a lot about how the examination and analysis of bodies helps bring murderers to justice. Seems that no matter what lengths some criminals go through in order to destroy the ""evidence"", a brilliant scientist like Dr. Bass and his team will eventually uncover enough evidence in order to bring a guilty verdict. I felt that after reading some of the gruesome details of the crimes, the conviction of the perpetrators was a small victory and made it worthwhile. I found it quite interesting that one of the main identifiers of race and heritage is the shape of the skull and bones of the face, especially the mouth. A question that kept popping up in my mind was how that will certainly change (and probably already has, to some degree) with the advent of so many multicultural children changing the face (no pun intended) of our society. Lesson learned from this book: don't try to fake your own death with the body of a Mexican if you're a Caucasian. For those who have read the book, you know what I'm referring to. If you are interested in forensics, this book is certainly worth a read. I'm looking forward the sequel. "
24,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145381-brian,3,"(3.5) Interesting, though reminds me of concerns about accuracyThese forensic anthropologists (much like many coroners) become experts and then assume they can determine facts with near certainty when they can't possibly consistently. I do appreciate Bass making as much of a science out of this field as possible, so he may be among the best, but there's danger in accepting the data they return.I appreciate Bass' frankness about his mistakes. He really owns up to them, at times pokes a bit of fun at himself. It's all the more impressive because these regularly get thrown back in his face when he testifies. It's good for his humility that he's gone through these experiences (view spoiler)[(e.g. when he mistook a Civil War casualty as a recently murder corpse) (hide spoiler)]. But just goes to show how wrong these techniques can be, and how much is up to speculation, bias, old fashioned detective work.I also had quite a problem with his approach to some of these cases. At least in retrospect, he is very clearly trying to come to the 'right' conclusion on some of the cases. It should make us all feel uneasy that he has a conclusion that he wants to come to and searches for the evidence to support. The cases he brings up appear to be iron-clad, but still, I'm sure there are far more close calls...and I'm sure the local law enforcement get all sorts of benefit of the doubt when Bass strolls in. It was good that in one case at least he told the detectives not to tell him the timeline they suspected before he was able to do his analysis. I could see great opportunity for detectives to influence results (in fact, even if they do take this precaution). There's huge risk of bias here, lots of room for defense lawyers to assail the credibility I'd think.Anyway, glad I read."

So I finally got around to reading it once I saw it was on my library's ebook system. SO GOOD. Dr Bass' way of storytelling is so engaging and well written that I would almost recommend it to anyone if they could stomach some of the descriptions. I found it to be an easy read, although I couldn't eat while reading it, that was my limit. Each chapter could have easily been read as a stand alone story since he runs through complete cases in each. He also puts in little quips and ""observations"" that are well placed, but also accessible. There is a sort of gallows humour people in those kinds of fields get, but it isn't accessible to the public. His sense of humour draws mostly from his own errors or his personal life, and they're very amusing. I read it while waiting on appointments, at work, before bed, basically whenever I had 5 minutes to sit still since I was so enraptured in the book. Getting to know him, the students, the cases and the people involved, the experiments, the mishaps, it was all put together so well you really felt along for the ride in the story."

I’m also an anthropologist - cultural one, but still fascinated with anything anthropological. This book is excellent and I was in love with it the moment I’ve started reading it. History of dr Bass and his creation of Body Farm is like a really great adventure for me. I give it 4 stars only because I wasn’t exactly happy with the fact, that he was repeating himself quite often, almost as if this book was writing for people who read one chapter in a big while. Now I’ve started continuation of the book - Beyond the Body Farm: A Legendary Bone Detective Explores Murders, Mysteries, and the Revolution in Forensic Science and again - I’m charmed :) "

I got Beyond the Bodyfarm so I felt compelled to finish this one! I thoroughly enjoyed it. I learned a lot, especially from the appendices. I loved Dr Bass' punny humor. The cases were all interesting and mostly all of them we're new to me. I'm excited to see what new ones he brings in the next book.The thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars was that there was a lot of repetition. Almost like each case was written to stand on it's own, so he had to explain the basics again in each. I would have rather it just be eluded to because as the reader I am learning and retaining through out the book. evolving along with the Body Farm.highly recommended!!"

It was striking to read about advances in a modern field where all the work is original and new.

The book contains cases that he worked on, as well as how the Body Farm came to be and various struggles it has faced. In some chapters, it's almost memoir-ish, as Bass' personal life features glancingly, but the focus is never on him as a person, rather than as a researcher. The personal anecdotes are along the lines of ""I had to replace the stove in my house three times because the university didn't have one, so I was cleaning bones in my kitchen and the pot boiled over and my wife would have divorced me if we had to smell corpse fluid every time she cooked,"" and his father's suicide giving him a fascination with death that led him to forensic anthropology.There's a lot of good things to say about this book, but one of the best is that they were very careful with the pictures they included; some of the descriptions he gives of the corpses he's worked with are hard enough to read without a visual aid. You can tell, throughout the reading, that Bill Bass is a wonderful professor. He communicates information clearly, and his writing is enjoyable. It's easy to tell he's simplified the science for general audiences, and the level it's dumbed down to works well for me. There are a few (potentially?) controversial aspects: Bass got his career start by excavating Indian burial grounds in North Dakota, ahead of a dam being built and flooding the area. He unearthed over four thousand bodies, mostly of the Arikara tribe. The skeletons were sent to the Smithsonian, and have since been returned and reburied. He also talks about sex and race typing skeletons as a sure and easy thing, and while I definitely don't know enough to contradict him, that sounds wrong to me, and I wouldn't be surprised to find out that it's not as easy as he makes it sound.Given the title of the book, I was expecting a closer focus on the actual Body Farm, but it's more a series of cases he worked on over the years, ranging from serial killers to insurance frauds to a identifying bodies that a crematory stacked up for years instead of burning. Very interesting and well written, but I'm glad I'll be reading more on the topic, as it's not really wide-ranging enough to feel like I understand forensic anthropology now.Quick, easy read, as long as you're not too squeamish."
32,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58910403-kylie-rodriguez,5,"Death's Acre was an interesting book to say the least. It managed to be humorous throughout its descriptions of murder scenes, post-mortem bodies and various explicit tales. Dr. Bass’s purpose for the novel was not only to educate the reader about the human body after death, but to explain and detail one of his life’s biggest accomplishments, the building of the body farm. The purpose of the body farm is for donated bodies to be put in various situations in order to study and understand the various rates and characteristics of human decomposition in order to assist in multiple fields. His graphic description of boiling bodies and examining teeth were further enhanced by the array of pictures included in the book. Anthropologists, forensic investigators, and other various fields find this to be invaluable information when coming into contact with a body in a state of decay. His reason for creating this body farm was because he’d realized after finding several bodies, there are so many different forms of decay due to varying conditions that without further research it could be incredibly difficult to definitively state a time of death. For example, in this book he talks about how he investigated a potential murder at the site of a civil war grave. He placed the death at approximately 2-6 months before the body was found. And then he talked about how after talking to the press and imploring people to give informational they knew anything, he found the body was actually that of the person whose grave it was. Due to the type of coffin he’d had his body had been preserved for an incredibly long time. These types of cases were the reasons he created the body farm."
33,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5672469-krista,4,"4.5 stars. Part true-crime anecdotes, part memoir, Death's Acre is a macabre delight if (like me) you are the sort of person who gets a twisted sort of pleasure reading about crazy murders and how forensics teams solve them. The book wasn't quite what I was expecting, because it's billed as an examination of the Body Farm, a research facility in Tennessee where experiments are preformed concerning how human bodies decay. And while the book does talk about origins of the Body Farm and discusses some of the more interesting experiments that they have done with donated human corpses, the book's main focus is on the life of it's author, Dr. Bill Bass, a pioneer in the field of forensic anthropology and the founder of the Body Farm itself. Dr. Bass has seen pretty much everything when it comes to human remains, and he shares some of his best murder investigation stories here with a healthy dose of biology, chemistry, and anatomy (yay!). The stories are en-gross-ing (har har har) and wildly entertaining as long as you have a strong stomach. Definitely recommended."

He tells these stories with consideration and respect for the victims and their families and a little humor to keep it light(er). Riveting. Rock Chalk, Dr. Bass! "

That part of my life is now complete.The book is full of great lines like the following one from when he first met crime novelist Patricia Cornwell at a training seminar for the medical examiner’s office where she worked, “As usual, I was showing slides of maggot-covered bodies.” He later did a commissioned experiment for her to analyze how a body would decompose in a basement. The results from that experiment ended up in her aptly titled novel, The Body Farm, which later became the nickname for Bass’s Anthropology Research Facility."

46,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34187759-thereadingowlvina-elvina-ulrich,5,"In 1977, forensic anthropologist Dr. William Bass was called to investigate the disturbed grave of Confederate officer Lieutenant Colonel William Shy. Unfortunately, there was a miscalculation in the real time of death of the corpse found in the coffin. This was the pivotal moment in Dr. Bass' 20 years career as forensic scientist. Seeing there was a lack of knowledge in the study of human decomposition from the time of death to the time of decay, Dr. Bass invented the first ""Body Farm"" to address that need. This has revolutionized the field of forensic science. In Death's Acre, we learn about the many real life cases Dr. Bass' investigates and how these cases helped establish the Body Farm from its humble beginnings - a journey that was not an easy and a smooth sailing one. This book is written with so much honesty and emotions. Dr. Bass shares about his personal life - how he started in forensic science, his passion for Body Farm, his grief over the deaths of his loved ones, and so forth (not going to spoil it for you!) I enjoyed the many different real life cases and how the investigations were done. The graphic descriptions of the murder victims and their human decompositions may be grisly for some readers but theses details were important in helping us to see how the cases were solved. It was fascinating and amazing! If you enjoy forensic science, this is a must read book! I appreciate that this book was written in an easy to understand manner - without being too sciency - and the storytelling is so engaging! I definitely learned a lot from this book - both the world of forensic science and the life of a forensic scientist. "

48,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4089241-liralen,4,"I know of only two types of scientific research that require utterly destroying the very thing you're studying: excavating an archaeological site and investigating a death scene (74).Bass started the first Body Farm, a research facility designed to study decomposition of human bodies and, in turn, aid investigations. For better or for worse, Death's Acre is not really about the Body Farm—rather, it's about Bass's career trajectory more generally. Over the years, he says, counting my excavations of Indian burials in the Great Plains, I've been in somewhere around five thousand graves. By the time I die I suspect I'll hold some sort of unofficial record: ""body that's been in and out of the most graves ever"" (62–63). And he does take the reader in and out of quite a lot of those graves, exploring death scenes and crime cases and his growing understanding of the effects of different circumstances on death. It's amazing to think that only ~30 years ago this was really not being studied at all—and also to think that a lot of this research is limited by location. Bass's Body Farm is in Tennessee, and though there are now others, some of his research in the muggy south would have little relevance to death scenes in, say, dry/hot parts of Texas (where there are now two body farms) or dry/chilly Saskatoon. So much more space for research!I would have loved to see more about that research—the particular experiments they ran and the results; what was expected or unexpected—but considering that there was proportionally little of that sort of thing, I am left to conclude that author/editor/coauthor found that the more interesting stories were the ones that used lessons they'd learned from the Body Farm but that took place elsewhere. A lot of the lessons are almost accidental—one man became a 'dismemberment expert' (the book's term, not mine!) after being asked what kind of saw had made a cut in a bone and realising that he had no idea how to distinguish that. (Oddly, or perhaps not, I think I'd have less trouble doing that kind of work than being married to someone who did. Hmmm.)Perhaps not for the faint of heart, but it's fascinating stuff."
49,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18468967-rachel-jackson,2,"After reading Mary Roach's Stiff, I wanted to dive into more books about death, the morbid and the macabre immediately, which led me to Bill Bass's book Death's Acre about his brainchild and creation the body farm in Tennessee. I wanted to learn more about how it was created, how it operated and what sort of research it did. However, this book was less about the body farm as it was about Bass's life itself, from his origins as an anthropologist studying Native American remains to his love life. And those weren't nearly as interesting as the book that the title suggests.Bass's work as a forensic anthropologist is interesting, don't get me wrong; it's full of death and murder and investigations and scandals. But anyone can write a crime story. What I wanted to know about was the work that goes into the place where the dead go to die in grotesque ways, letting flies devour their bodies, seeing the sticky goo that oozes from them when their skin and organs give out. That's what fascinates me. And Bass does go into detail about those sorts of things, but for the most part, the book follows him as he gallivants around the world, giving speeches, investigating murders and learning more things about bodies outside of the body farm.And it's clear that Bass wants to provide variety and spice to his book so it doesn't center solely on death and decomposition alone, given the heavy topic that it is — which is fine; providing that angle on his own life and exploits is fine. But that's not what the title suggests and certainly not what I wanted to read about when I picked this book up. It's an easy read, and the personal details make it a quirky but relatable read. However, in some places Bass's anecdotes and musing about life and death are cheesy and overdone, and all I really wanted to know about was the bodies at the body farm. As a research book — that is, something I read to learn more about the body farm — it was lacking. As a memoir, perhaps it was better. But again, that's not what I was expecting as I was going in. "

Like a lot of people, I first learned about The Body Farm from Patricia Cornwell in her novel by the same name and I found it fascinating. While I would not have the patience or the stomach for the type of investigation that they do there, I think it is critical work that has helped in a lot of criminal investigations.The story of how Bill Bass came to be involved in forensic anthropology and to start The Body Farm is almost as fascinating as the work done since that facility opened. I was especially taken with the mistake he made on time of death of Col. Shy and how they came to discover it and to use it as a starting point for further learning. I am afraid of giving too much away by discussing any of the discoveries made or cases worked because I enjoyed reading them so much. I will say I appreciate his willingness to try to find a place in his line of work for those with unorthodox interests and backgrounds, because I do think it has improved the practice of forensics over time.Definitely recommended reading for anyone interested in forensics or criminology, but with the caveat that the subject matter of decaying and dismembered bodies is not for everyone."

When I started reading this book I wanted to read about dead bodies and the story behind the bodies, the cause of death and if it was a murder victim then the story of how the person was killed. The first chapter did start out talking about a body but it also started talking about the life of Bill Bass, the founder of the Body Farm, which I wasn’t interested in but I had to remind myself that this book is a memoir of how the Body Farm became what it is today. To get the story of the Body Farm the life story of Bill Bass is also told. Each chapter tells about a body and the back story of the body. This book can best be described as a true, real life CSI series. Not only does each chapter talk about the bodies but also the evidence and events that lead examiners to determine the cause of death of the people. This book has a lot of scientific talk about human anatomy but the book is broken down and explained and terms are used that can be understood by anyone who is not familiar with technical human anatomy terms."
52,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3787451-ctgt,4,"The title is a little misleading in that it's not just about The Body Farm. It's more of an overview of Dr. Bass and some of his cases. It was interesting to read that the idea for the body farm grew from an inicident involving cows. There is a large section in the middle of the book that deals with the farm and the struggles to get it up and running. The book goes into some detail about the efforts to establish a scientific method of determining ""time since death"". As popular as these types of crime solving procedures are on tv right now, it is interesting to consider that most of this science is very new and really still a very young field. Dr. Bass talks about a Chinese forensic text published in A.D. 1247 by Sung Tz'u entitled The Washing Away of Wrongs and how there had been virtually no published work on the extended postmortem interval since that text. So it is an interesting look at the beginning stages of current forensic anthropology and how far the field has progressed in a fairly short period of time."
53,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/122647-sarah-sammis,3," The body farm is a forensic tool invented by Dr. Bill Bass in 1971. Cadavers donated to science are allowed to decompose under a variety of environmental conditions. The progress is documented for use in future forensic investigations.Death's Acre recounts the career of Dr. Bill Bass and the early years of modern forensic science as it evolved from anthropology. The first hundred pages of this three hundred page book is spent on Bass's early career. As I was most interested in the Body Farm, i found this portion a slog to get through. I did learn a bit about anthropology and working in the desert and on avoiding snakes but it wasn't what I had set out to read.Fortunately things pick up on page 100. The remainder of the book is a series of fascinating chapters on how environmental factors affect decomposition and the mistakes criminals make when trying to hide or destroy bodies. "
54,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4347062-lil-grogan,4,"A fascinating read with far more humour and heart than I expected. My own interest in forensics is purely born from watching CSI. Found it intriguing to read about how and where some of the knowledge in the field was developed. Majority of the book is about Bass' career as a physical anthropologist, with a concentration on his work in crime cases and small bits about his personal life. Bass is also generous in devoting time to the achievements of his students and colleagues in the field. Liked that he was open about mistakes he made along the way, and what was learned from them.I'm not sure how the writing of this book was carried out, but I can't help wishing his co-author or editor had tightened it up a bit more. The repetition and side-tracking were at times annoying. However, I'm glad that his avuncular, didactic tone carried through...along with his often groan-worthy jokes. "
55,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/794432-elizabeth,3,"Death's Acre is a humble account of the development of forensic anthropology from the man who was curious enough to find the answers. Bass's personal history and relationships give insight into how the science has evolved and culminated in the Body Farm. Bass is generous in his praise for those he has worked with and mentored over his long career and comes across as an approachable and ever-curious figure. The only criticism would be that certain descriptions of techniques or processes are repeated in detail through various chapters, making them feel like stand-alone chunks; not taking into account the reader's ability to retain these details. Otherwise, The Body Farm is written well for the uninitiated without becoming too technical or academic."
56,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/803323-nancy,5,"Death's Acre is primarily a series of interesting stories about solving crimes through forensic science. Jon Jefferson has assisted Dr. Bass in writing a really engaging memoir. This book could have been just a series a CSI type stories, but it is more than that. I found Dr. Bass's discussion of his loss of religious faith particularly interesting. He practiced a conventional Christian faith for over 60 years. His direct experience with horrific murders did not shake it, but the cancer deaths of two women he loved did. It would have been easy to leave this out of the book, but including it gives us insight into the life of a real man who is more than a successful teacher, researcher and mystery solver."
57,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14529100-amanda-messerlie,5,"I really enjoyed reading about Dr. Bass's life and career; he did a wonderful job of conveying both with humor and clarity. Combining science, history, personality, and humility, Bass does interested readers a service by bringing us an accurate glimpse into the actual life of a forensic scientist.In a dream world where I have unlimited money and time, I would be finishing a doctoral program in forensic anthropology. None of the concepts introduced in this book were new to me, but they were fleshed out in a interesting and simple manner. With the preponderance of criminal investigation shows on television, many people are woefully misinformed about the forensic sciences. Death's Acre is a great way to begin correcting those misrepresentations. "

This is definitely a must read if you like to watch crime drama television such as Bones or have an interest in anthropology. Surprisingly, this book wasn't dry, which I kind of hoped it would be! However, Bass included little pieces of his humor which had me laughing out loud while I was reading it. Death's Acre was the type of book that I didn't want to put down. Bass also includes a section with pictures that relate to his cases as well as his personal life within the book.

It's easy to tell he's simplified the science for general audiences, and the level it's dumbed down to works well for me. There are a few (potentially?) controversial aspects: Bass got his career start by excavating Indian burial grounds in North Dakota, ahead of a dam being built and flooding the area. He unearthed over four thousand bodies, mostly of the Arikara tribe. The skeletons were sent to the Smithsonian, and have since been returned and reburied. He also talks about sex and race typing skeletons as a sure and easy thing, and while I definitely don't know enough to contradict him, that sounds wrong to me, and I wouldn't be surprised to find out that it's not as easy as he makes it sound.Given the title of the book, I was expecting a closer focus on the actual Body Farm, but it's more a series of cases he worked on over the years, ranging from serial killers to insurance frauds to a identifying bodies that a crematory stacked up for years instead of burning. Very interesting and well written, but I'm glad I'll be reading more on the topic, as it's not really wide-ranging enough to feel like I understand forensic anthropology now.Quick, easy read, as long as you're not too squeamish."

His graphic description of boiling bodies and examining teeth were further enhanced by the array of pictures included in the book. Anthropologists, forensic investigators, and other various fields find this to be invaluable information when coming into contact with a body in a state of decay. His reason for creating this body farm was because he’d realized after finding several bodies, there are so many different forms of decay due to varying conditions that without further research it could be incredibly difficult to definitively state a time of death. For example, in this book he talks about how he investigated a potential murder at the site of a civil war grave. He placed the death at approximately 2-6 months before the body was found. And then he talked about how after talking to the press and imploring people to give informational they knew anything, he found the body was actually that of the person whose grave it was. Due to the type of coffin he’d had his body had been preserved for an incredibly long time. These types of cases were the reasons he created the body farm."

76,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34187759-thereadingowlvina-elvina-ulrich,5,"In 1977, forensic anthropologist Dr. William Bass was called to investigate the disturbed grave of Confederate officer Lieutenant Colonel William Shy. Unfortunately, there was a miscalculation in the real time of death of the corpse found in the coffin. This was the pivotal moment in Dr. Bass' 20 years career as forensic scientist. Seeing there was a lack of knowledge in the study of human decomposition from the time of death to the time of decay, Dr. Bass invented the first ""Body Farm"" to address that need. This has revolutionized the field of forensic science. In Death's Acre, we learn about the many real life cases Dr. Bass' investigates and how these cases helped establish the Body Farm from its humble beginnings - a journey that was not an easy and a smooth sailing one. This book is written with so much honesty and emotions. Dr. Bass shares about his personal life - how he started in forensic science, his passion for Body Farm, his grief over the deaths of his loved ones, and so forth (not going to spoil it for you!) I enjoyed the many different real life cases and how the investigations were done. The graphic descriptions of the murder victims and their human decompositions may be grisly for some readers but theses details were important in helping us to see how the cases were solved. It was fascinating and amazing! If you enjoy forensic science, this is a must read book! I appreciate that this book was written in an easy to understand manner - without being too sciency - and the storytelling is so engaging! I definitely learned a lot from this book - both the world of forensic science and the life of a forensic scientist. "
77,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36801712-dawn-o-connor,5,"Pure fascination for me. Lots of science, mystery, and a look into a topic I’ve never learned about before. Highly recommend for any fans of true crime or forensics."
78,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4089241-liralen,4,"I know of only two types of scientific research that require utterly destroying the very thing you're studying: excavating an archaeological site and investigating a death scene (74).Bass started the first Body Farm, a research facility designed to study decomposition of human bodies and, in turn, aid investigations. For better or for worse, Death's Acre is not really about the Body Farm—rather, it's about Bass's career trajectory more generally. Over the years, he says, counting my excavations of Indian burials in the Great Plains, I've been in somewhere around five thousand graves. By the time I die I suspect I'll hold some sort of unofficial record: ""body that's been in and out of the most graves ever"" (62–63). And he does take the reader in and out of quite a lot of those graves, exploring death scenes and crime cases and his growing understanding of the effects of different circumstances on death. It's amazing to think that only ~30 years ago this was really not being studied at all—and also to think that a lot of this research is limited by location. Bass's Body Farm is in Tennessee, and though there are now others, some of his research in the muggy south would have little relevance to death scenes in, say, dry/hot parts of Texas (where there are now two body farms) or dry/chilly Saskatoon. So much more space for research!I would have loved to see more about that research—the particular experiments they ran and the results; what was expected or unexpected—but considering that there was proportionally little of that sort of thing, I am left to conclude that author/editor/coauthor found that the more interesting stories were the ones that used lessons they'd learned from the Body Farm but that took place elsewhere. A lot of the lessons are almost accidental—one man became a 'dismemberment expert' (the book's term, not mine!) after being asked what kind of saw had made a cut in a bone and realising that he had no idea how to distinguish that. (Oddly, or perhaps not, I think I'd have less trouble doing that kind of work than being married to someone who did. Hmmm.)Perhaps not for the faint of heart, but it's fascinating stuff."
79,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18468967-rachel-jackson,2,"After reading Mary Roach's Stiff, I wanted to dive into more books about death, the morbid and the macabre immediately, which led me to Bill Bass's book Death's Acre about his brainchild and creation the body farm in Tennessee. I wanted to learn more about how it was created, how it operated and what sort of research it did. However, this book was less about the body farm as it was about Bass's life itself, from his origins as an anthropologist studying Native American remains to his love life. And those weren't nearly as interesting as the book that the title suggests.Bass's work as a forensic anthropologist is interesting, don't get me wrong; it's full of death and murder and investigations and scandals. But anyone can write a crime story. What I wanted to know about was the work that goes into the place where the dead go to die in grotesque ways, letting flies devour their bodies, seeing the sticky goo that oozes from them when their skin and organs give out. That's what fascinates me. And Bass does go into detail about those sorts of things, but for the most part, the book follows him as he gallivants around the world, giving speeches, investigating murders and learning more things about bodies outside of the body farm.And it's clear that Bass wants to provide variety and spice to his book so it doesn't center solely on death and decomposition alone, given the heavy topic that it is — which is fine; providing that angle on his own life and exploits is fine. But that's not what the title suggests and certainly not what I wanted to read about when I picked this book up. It's an easy read, and the personal details make it a quirky but relatable read. However, in some places Bass's anecdotes and musing about life and death are cheesy and overdone, and all I really wanted to know about was the bodies at the body farm. As a research book — that is, something I read to learn more about the body farm — it was lacking. As a memoir, perhaps it was better. But again, that's not what I was expecting as I was going in. "
80,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19004147-cheryl,4,"This is a book I have been wanting to read for quite some time and when I was off work sick yesterday I couldn't resist it. Like a lot of people, I first learned about The Body Farm from Patricia Cornwell in her novel by the same name and I found it fascinating. While I would not have the patience or the stomach for the type of investigation that they do there, I think it is critical work that has helped in a lot of criminal investigations.The story of how Bill Bass came to be involved in forensic anthropology and to start The Body Farm is almost as fascinating as the work done since that facility opened. I was especially taken with the mistake he made on time of death of Col. Shy and how they came to discover it and to use it as a starting point for further learning. I am afraid of giving too much away by discussing any of the discoveries made or cases worked because I enjoyed reading them so much. I will say I appreciate his willingness to try to find a place in his line of work for those with unorthodox interests and backgrounds, because I do think it has improved the practice of forensics over time.Definitely recommended reading for anyone interested in forensics or criminology, but with the caveat that the subject matter of decaying and dismembered bodies is not for everyone."
81,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054835-brandee,5,"I was sad when I read the last sentence of this book; I did not want it to end. When I started reading this book I wanted to read about dead bodies and the story behind the bodies, the cause of death and if it was a murder victim then the story of how the person was killed. The first chapter did start out talking about a body but it also started talking about the life of Bill Bass, the founder of the Body Farm, which I wasn’t interested in but I had to remind myself that this book is a memoir of how the Body Farm became what it is today. To get the story of the Body Farm the life story of Bill Bass is also told. Each chapter tells about a body and the back story of the body. This book can best be described as a true, real life CSI series. Not only does each chapter talk about the bodies but also the evidence and events that lead examiners to determine the cause of death of the people. This book has a lot of scientific talk about human anatomy but the book is broken down and explained and terms are used that can be understood by anyone who is not familiar with technical human anatomy terms."
82,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3787451-ctgt,4,"The title is a little misleading in that it's not just about The Body Farm. It's more of an overview of Dr. Bass and some of his cases. It was interesting to read that the idea for the body farm grew from an inicident involving cows. There is a large section in the middle of the book that deals with the farm and the struggles to get it up and running. The book goes into some detail about the efforts to establish a scientific method of determining ""time since death"". As popular as these types of crime solving procedures are on tv right now, it is interesting to consider that most of this science is very new and really still a very young field. Dr. Bass talks about a Chinese forensic text published in A.D. 1247 by Sung Tz'u entitled The Washing Away of Wrongs and how there had been virtually no published work on the extended postmortem interval since that text. So it is an interesting look at the beginning stages of current forensic anthropology and how far the field has progressed in a fairly short period of time."
83,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/122647-sarah-sammis,3," The body farm is a forensic tool invented by Dr. Bill Bass in 1971. Cadavers donated to science are allowed to decompose under a variety of environmental conditions. The progress is documented for use in future forensic investigations.Death's Acre recounts the career of Dr. Bill Bass and the early years of modern forensic science as it evolved from anthropology. The first hundred pages of this three hundred page book is spent on Bass's early career. As I was most interested in the Body Farm, i found this portion a slog to get through. I did learn a bit about anthropology and working in the desert and on avoiding snakes but it wasn't what I had set out to read.Fortunately things pick up on page 100. The remainder of the book is a series of fascinating chapters on how environmental factors affect decomposition and the mistakes criminals make when trying to hide or destroy bodies. "
84,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4347062-lil-grogan,4,"A fascinating read with far more humour and heart than I expected. My own interest in forensics is purely born from watching CSI. Found it intriguing to read about how and where some of the knowledge in the field was developed. Majority of the book is about Bass' career as a physical anthropologist, with a concentration on his work in crime cases and small bits about his personal life. Bass is also generous in devoting time to the achievements of his students and colleagues in the field. Liked that he was open about mistakes he made along the way, and what was learned from them.I'm not sure how the writing of this book was carried out, but I can't help wishing his co-author or editor had tightened it up a bit more. The repetition and side-tracking were at times annoying. However, I'm glad that his avuncular, didactic tone carried through...along with his often groan-worthy jokes. "
85,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/794432-elizabeth,3,"Death's Acre is a humble account of the development of forensic anthropology from the man who was curious enough to find the answers. Bass's personal history and relationships give insight into how the science has evolved and culminated in the Body Farm. Bass is generous in his praise for those he has worked with and mentored over his long career and comes across as an approachable and ever-curious figure. The only criticism would be that certain descriptions of techniques or processes are repeated in detail through various chapters, making them feel like stand-alone chunks; not taking into account the reader's ability to retain these details. Otherwise, The Body Farm is written well for the uninitiated without becoming too technical or academic."
86,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/803323-nancy,5,"Death's Acre is primarily a series of interesting stories about solving crimes through forensic science. Jon Jefferson has assisted Dr. Bass in writing a really engaging memoir. This book could have been just a series a CSI type stories, but it is more than that. I found Dr. Bass's discussion of his loss of religious faith particularly interesting. He practiced a conventional Christian faith for over 60 years. His direct experience with horrific murders did not shake it, but the cancer deaths of two women he loved did. It would have been easy to leave this out of the book, but including it gives us insight into the life of a real man who is more than a successful teacher, researcher and mystery solver."
87,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14529100-amanda-messerlie,5,"I really enjoyed reading about Dr. Bass's life and career; he did a wonderful job of conveying both with humor and clarity. Combining science, history, personality, and humility, Bass does interested readers a service by bringing us an accurate glimpse into the actual life of a forensic scientist.In a dream world where I have unlimited money and time, I would be finishing a doctoral program in forensic anthropology. None of the concepts introduced in this book were new to me, but they were fleshed out in a interesting and simple manner. With the preponderance of criminal investigation shows on television, many people are woefully misinformed about the forensic sciences. Death's Acre is a great way to begin correcting those misrepresentations. "

This is definitely a must read if you like to watch crime drama television such as Bones or have an interest in anthropology. Surprisingly, this book wasn't dry, which I kind of hoped it would be! However, Bass included little pieces of his humor which had me laughing out loud while I was reading it. Death's Acre was the type of book that I didn't want to put down. Bass also includes a section with pictures that relate to his cases as well as his personal life within the book. These pictures along with lucid descriptions bring the book to life in the audience's hands."

Unfortunately, there was a miscalculation in the real time of death of the corpse found in the coffin. This was the pivotal moment in Dr. Bass' 20 years career as forensic scientist. Seeing there was a lack of knowledge in the study of human decomposition from the time of death to the time of decay, Dr. Bass invented the first ""Body Farm"" to address that need. This has revolutionized the field of forensic science. In Death's Acre, we learn about the many real life cases Dr. Bass' investigates and how these cases helped establish the Body Farm from its humble beginnings - a journey that was not an easy and a smooth sailing one. This book is written with so much honesty and emotions. Dr. Bass shares about his personal life - how he started in forensic science, his passion for Body Farm, his grief over the deaths of his loved ones, and so forth (not going to spoil it for you!) I enjoyed the many different real life cases and how the investigations were done. The graphic descriptions of the murder victims and their human decompositions may be grisly for some readers but theses details were important in helping us to see how the cases were solved. It was fascinating and amazing! If you enjoy forensic science, this is a must read book!

108,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4089241-liralen,4,"I know of only two types of scientific research that require utterly destroying the very thing you're studying: excavating an archaeological site and investigating a death scene (74).Bass started the first Body Farm, a research facility designed to study decomposition of human bodies and, in turn, aid investigations. For better or for worse, Death's Acre is not really about the Body Farm—rather, it's about Bass's career trajectory more generally. Over the years, he says, counting my excavations of Indian burials in the Great Plains, I've been in somewhere around five thousand graves. By the time I die I suspect I'll hold some sort of unofficial record: ""body that's been in and out of the most graves ever"" (62–63). And he does take the reader in and out of quite a lot of those graves, exploring death scenes and crime cases and his growing understanding of the effects of different circumstances on death. It's amazing to think that only ~30 years ago this was really not being studied at all—and also to think that a lot of this research is limited by location. Bass's Body Farm is in Tennessee, and though there are now others, some of his research in the muggy south would have little relevance to death scenes in, say, dry/hot parts of Texas (where there are now two body farms) or dry/chilly Saskatoon. So much more space for research!I would have loved to see more about that research—the particular experiments they ran and the results; what was expected or unexpected—but considering that there was proportionally little of that sort of thing, I am left to conclude that author/editor/coauthor found that the more interesting stories were the ones that used lessons they'd learned from the Body Farm but that took place elsewhere. A lot of the lessons are almost accidental—one man became a 'dismemberment expert' (the book's term, not mine!) after being asked what kind of saw had made a cut in a bone and realising that he had no idea how to distinguish that. (Oddly, or perhaps not, I think I'd have less trouble doing that kind of work than being married to someone who did. Hmmm.)Perhaps not for the faint of heart, but it's fascinating stuff."
109,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18468967-rachel-jackson,2,"After reading Mary Roach's Stiff, I wanted to dive into more books about death, the morbid and the macabre immediately, which led me to Bill Bass's book Death's Acre about his brainchild and creation the body farm in Tennessee. I wanted to learn more about how it was created, how it operated and what sort of research it did. However, this book was less about the body farm as it was about Bass's life itself, from his origins as an anthropologist studying Native American remains to his love life. And those weren't nearly as interesting as the book that the title suggests.Bass's work as a forensic anthropologist is interesting, don't get me wrong; it's full of death and murder and investigations and scandals. But anyone can write a crime story. What I wanted to know about was the work that goes into the place where the dead go to die in grotesque ways, letting flies devour their bodies, seeing the sticky goo that oozes from them when their skin and organs give out. That's what fascinates me. And Bass does go into detail about those sorts of things, but for the most part, the book follows him as he gallivants around the world, giving speeches, investigating murders and learning more things about bodies outside of the body farm.And it's clear that Bass wants to provide variety and spice to his book so it doesn't center solely on death and decomposition alone, given the heavy topic that it is — which is fine; providing that angle on his own life and exploits is fine. But that's not what the title suggests and certainly not what I wanted to read about when I picked this book up. It's an easy read, and the personal details make it a quirky but relatable read. However, in some places Bass's anecdotes and musing about life and death are cheesy and overdone, and all I really wanted to know about was the bodies at the body farm. As a research book — that is, something I read to learn more about the body farm — it was lacking. As a memoir, perhaps it was better. But again, that's not what I was expecting as I was going in. "
110,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19004147-cheryl,4,"This is a book I have been wanting to read for quite some time and when I was off work sick yesterday I couldn't resist it. Like a lot of people, I first learned about The Body Farm from Patricia Cornwell in her novel by the same name and I found it fascinating. While I would not have the patience or the stomach for the type of investigation that they do there, I think it is critical work that has helped in a lot of criminal investigations.The story of how Bill Bass came to be involved in forensic anthropology and to start The Body Farm is almost as fascinating as the work done since that facility opened. I was especially taken with the mistake he made on time of death of Col. Shy and how they came to discover it and to use it as a starting point for further learning. I am afraid of giving too much away by discussing any of the discoveries made or cases worked because I enjoyed reading them so much. I will say I appreciate his willingness to try to find a place in his line of work for those with unorthodox interests and backgrounds, because I do think it has improved the practice of forensics over time.Definitely recommended reading for anyone interested in forensics or criminology, but with the caveat that the subject matter of decaying and dismembered bodies is not for everyone."
111,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054835-brandee,5,"I was sad when I read the last sentence of this book; I did not want it to end. When I started reading this book I wanted to read about dead bodies and the story behind the bodies, the cause of death and if it was a murder victim then the story of how the person was killed. The first chapter did start out talking about a body but it also started talking about the life of Bill Bass, the founder of the Body Farm, which I wasn’t interested in but I had to remind myself that this book is a memoir of how the Body Farm became what it is today. To get the story of the Body Farm the life story of Bill Bass is also told. Each chapter tells about a body and the back story of the body. This book can best be described as a true, real life CSI series. Not only does each chapter talk about the bodies but also the evidence and events that lead examiners to determine the cause of death of the people. This book has a lot of scientific talk about human anatomy but the book is broken down and explained and terms are used that can be understood by anyone who is not familiar with technical human anatomy terms."
112,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3787451-ctgt,4,"The title is a little misleading in that it's not just about The Body Farm. It's more of an overview of Dr. Bass and some of his cases. It was interesting to read that the idea for the body farm grew from an inicident involving cows. There is a large section in the middle of the book that deals with the farm and the struggles to get it up and running. The book goes into some detail about the efforts to establish a scientific method of determining ""time since death"". As popular as these types of crime solving procedures are on tv right now, it is interesting to consider that most of this science is very new and really still a very young field. Dr. Bass talks about a Chinese forensic text published in A.D. 1247 by Sung Tz'u entitled The Washing Away of Wrongs and how there had been virtually no published work on the extended postmortem interval since that text. So it is an interesting look at the beginning stages of current forensic anthropology and how far the field has progressed in a fairly short period of time."
113,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/122647-sarah-sammis,3," The body farm is a forensic tool invented by Dr. Bill Bass in 1971. Cadavers donated to science are allowed to decompose under a variety of environmental conditions. The progress is documented for use in future forensic investigations.Death's Acre recounts the career of Dr. Bill Bass and the early years of modern forensic science as it evolved from anthropology. The first hundred pages of this three hundred page book is spent on Bass's early career. As I was most interested in the Body Farm, i found this portion a slog to get through. I did learn a bit about anthropology and working in the desert and on avoiding snakes but it wasn't what I had set out to read.Fortunately things pick up on page 100. The remainder of the book is a series of fascinating chapters on how environmental factors affect decomposition and the mistakes criminals make when trying to hide or destroy bodies. "
114,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4347062-lil-grogan,4,"A fascinating read with far more humour and heart than I expected. My own interest in forensics is purely born from watching CSI. Found it intriguing to read about how and where some of the knowledge in the field was developed. Majority of the book is about Bass' career as a physical anthropologist, with a concentration on his work in crime cases and small bits about his personal life. Bass is also generous in devoting time to the achievements of his students and colleagues in the field. Liked that he was open about mistakes he made along the way, and what was learned from them.I'm not sure how the writing of this book was carried out, but I can't help wishing his co-author or editor had tightened it up a bit more. The repetition and side-tracking were at times annoying. However, I'm glad that his avuncular, didactic tone carried through...along with his often groan-worthy jokes. "
115,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/794432-elizabeth,3,"Death's Acre is a humble account of the development of forensic anthropology from the man who was curious enough to find the answers. Bass's personal history and relationships give insight into how the science has evolved and culminated in the Body Farm. Bass is generous in his praise for those he has worked with and mentored over his long career and comes across as an approachable and ever-curious figure. The only criticism would be that certain descriptions of techniques or processes are repeated in detail through various chapters, making them feel like stand-alone chunks; not taking into account the reader's ability to retain these details. Otherwise, The Body Farm is written well for the uninitiated without becoming too technical or academic."
116,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/803323-nancy,5,"Death's Acre is primarily a series of interesting stories about solving crimes through forensic science. Jon Jefferson has assisted Dr. Bass in writing a really engaging memoir. This book could have been just a series a CSI type stories, but it is more than that. I found Dr. Bass's discussion of his loss of religious faith particularly interesting. He practiced a conventional Christian faith for over 60 years. His direct experience with horrific murders did not shake it, but the cancer deaths of two women he loved did. It would have been easy to leave this out of the book, but including it gives us insight into the life of a real man who is more than a successful teacher, researcher and mystery solver."
117,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14529100-amanda-messerlie,5,"I really enjoyed reading about Dr. Bass's life and career; he did a wonderful job of conveying both with humor and clarity. Combining science, history, personality, and humility, Bass does interested readers a service by bringing us an accurate glimpse into the actual life of a forensic scientist.In a dream world where I have unlimited money and time, I would be finishing a doctoral program in forensic anthropology. None of the concepts introduced in this book were new to me, but they were fleshed out in a interesting and simple manner. With the preponderance of criminal investigation shows on television, many people are woefully misinformed about the forensic sciences. Death's Acre is a great way to begin correcting those misrepresentations. "
118,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19839412-kristine,5,"This book was incredible! Bill Bass gives an easy to read background to forensic anthropology. This is definitely a must read if you like to watch crime drama television such as Bones or have an interest in anthropology. Surprisingly, this book wasn't dry, which I kind of hoped it would be! However, Bass included little pieces of his humor which had me laughing out loud while I was reading it. Death's Acre was the type of book that I didn't want to put down. Bass also includes a section with pictures that relate to his cases as well as his personal life within the book. These pictures along with lucid descriptions bring the book to life in the audience's hands."
119,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4209925-nancy,4,"This is an interesting and compelling look at the Body Farm at the University of Tennesse, written by the forensic anthropologist who created it. He describes a number of true crime cases that he has been called on as an expert witness, how he got his start in anthropology and how he is able to determine age, sex, and stature from just a handful of bone fragments. He also details how he first met Patricia Cornwell and how she got her start in writing the Kay Scarpetta series. A must-read for true crime aficionados or fans of Patricia Cornwell. "
120,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7160162-julianne,1,I'm giving it a star as it made me sleep at 4am today when I was having a bout of insomnia. 
121,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77183671-rachel,4,"Death's Acre is written by Bill Bass, the creator of the Body Farm and one of the preeminent forensic anthropologists of our time. The book contains cases that he worked on, as well as how the Body Farm came to be and various struggles it has faced. In some chapters, it's almost memoir-ish, as Bass' personal life features glancingly, but the focus is never on him as a person, rather than as a researcher. The personal anecdotes are along the lines of ""I had to replace the stove in my house three times because the university didn't have one, so I was cleaning bones in my kitchen and the pot boiled over and my wife would have divorced me if we had to smell corpse fluid every time she cooked,"" and his father's suicide giving him a fascination with death that led him to forensic anthropology.There's a lot of good things to say about this book, but one of the best is that they were very careful with the pictures they included; some of the descriptions he gives of the corpses he's worked with are hard enough to read without a visual aid. You can tell, throughout the reading, that Bill Bass is a wonderful professor. He communicates information clearly, and his writing is enjoyable. It's easy to tell he's simplified the science for general audiences, and the level it's dumbed down to works well for me. There are a few (potentially?) controversial aspects: Bass got his career start by excavating Indian burial grounds in North Dakota, ahead of a dam being built and flooding the area. He unearthed over four thousand bodies, mostly of the Arikara tribe. The skeletons were sent to the Smithsonian, and have since been returned and reburied. He also talks about sex and race typing skeletons as a sure and easy thing, and while I definitely don't know enough to contradict him, that sounds wrong to me, and I wouldn't be surprised to find out that it's not as easy as he makes it sound.Given the title of the book, I was expecting a closer focus on the actual Body Farm, but it's more a series of cases he worked on over the years, ranging from serial killers to insurance frauds to a identifying bodies that a crematory stacked up for years instead of burning. Very interesting and well written, but I'm glad I'll be reading more on the topic, as it's not really wide-ranging enough to feel like I understand forensic anthropology now.Quick, easy read, as long as you're not too squeamish."
122,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58910403-kylie-rodriguez,5,"Death's Acre was an interesting book to say the least. It managed to be humorous throughout its descriptions of murder scenes, post-mortem bodies and various explicit tales. Dr. Bass’s purpose for the novel was not only to educate the reader about the human body after death, but to explain and detail one of his life’s biggest accomplishments, the building of the body farm. The purpose of the body farm is for donated bodies to be put in various situations in order to study and understand the various rates and characteristics of human decomposition in order to assist in multiple fields. His graphic description of boiling bodies and examining teeth were further enhanced by the array of pictures included in the book. Anthropologists, forensic investigators, and other various fields find this to be invaluable information when coming into contact with a body in a state of decay. His reason for creating this body farm was because he’d realized after finding several bodies, there are so many different forms of decay due to varying conditions that without further research it could be incredibly difficult to definitively state a time of death. For example, in this book he talks about how he investigated a potential murder at the site of a civil war grave. He placed the death at approximately 2-6 months before the body was found. And then he talked about how after talking to the press and imploring people to give informational they knew anything, he found the body was actually that of the person whose grave it was. Due to the type of coffin he’d had his body had been preserved for an incredibly long time. These types of cases were the reasons he created the body farm."
123,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5672469-krista,4,"4.5 stars. Part true-crime anecdotes, part memoir, Death's Acre is a macabre delight if (like me) you are the sort of person who gets a twisted sort of pleasure reading about crazy murders and how forensics teams solve them. The book wasn't quite what I was expecting, because it's billed as an examination of the Body Farm, a research facility in Tennessee where experiments are preformed concerning how human bodies decay. And while the book does talk about origins of the Body Farm and discusses some of the more interesting experiments that they have done with donated human corpses, the book's main focus is on the life of it's author, Dr. Bill Bass, a pioneer in the field of forensic anthropology and the founder of the Body Farm itself. Dr. Bass has seen pretty much everything when it comes to human remains, and he shares some of his best murder investigation stories here with a healthy dose of biology, chemistry, and anatomy (yay!). The stories are en-gross-ing (har har har) and wildly entertaining as long as you have a strong stomach. Definitely recommended."

That part of my life is now complete.The book is full of great lines like the following one from when he first met crime novelist Patricia Cornwell at a training seminar for the medical examiner’s office where she worked, “As usual, I was showing slides of maggot-covered bodies.” He later did a commissioned experiment for her to analyze how a body would decompose in a basement. The results from that experiment ended up in her aptly titled novel, The Body Farm, which later became the nickname for Bass’s Anthropology Research Facility."

Found it intriguing to read about how and where some of the knowledge in the field was developed. Majority of the book is about Bass' career as a physical anthropologist, with a concentration on his work in crime cases and small bits about his personal life. Bass is also generous in devoting time to the achievements of his students and colleagues in the field. Liked that he was open about mistakes he made along the way, and what was learned from them.I'm not sure how the writing of this book was carried out, but I can't help wishing his co-author or editor had tightened it up a bit more.

Bass's personal history and relationships give insight into how the science has evolved and culminated in the Body Farm. Bass is generous in his praise for those he has worked with and mentored over his long career and comes across as an approachable and ever-curious figure. The only criticism would be that certain descriptions of techniques or processes are repeated in detail through various chapters, making them feel like stand-alone chunks; not taking into account the reader's ability to retain these details. Otherwise, The Body Farm is written well for the uninitiated without becoming too technical or academic."

Jon Jefferson has assisted Dr. Bass in writing a really engaging memoir. This book could have been just a series a CSI type stories, but it is more than that. I found Dr. Bass's discussion of his loss of religious faith particularly interesting. He practiced a conventional Christian faith for over 60 years. His direct experience with horrific murders did not shake it, but the cancer deaths of two women he loved did. It would have been easy to leave this out of the book, but including it gives us insight into the life of a real man who is more than a successful teacher, researcher and mystery solver."

Combining science, history, personality, and humility, Bass does interested readers a service by bringing us an accurate glimpse into the actual life of a forensic scientist.In a dream world where I have unlimited money and time, I would be finishing a doctoral program in forensic anthropology. None of the concepts introduced in this book were new to me, but they were fleshed out in a interesting and simple manner. With the preponderance of criminal investigation shows on television, many people are woefully misinformed about the forensic sciences. Death's Acre is a great way to begin correcting those misrepresentations. "

However, Bass included little pieces of his humor which had me laughing out loud while I was reading it. Death's Acre was the type of book that I didn't want to put down.

151,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77183671-rachel,4,"Death's Acre is written by Bill Bass, the creator of the Body Farm and one of the preeminent forensic anthropologists of our time. The book contains cases that he worked on, as well as how the Body Farm came to be and various struggles it has faced. In some chapters, it's almost memoir-ish, as Bass' personal life features glancingly, but the focus is never on him as a person, rather than as a researcher. The personal anecdotes are along the lines of ""I had to replace the stove in my house three times because the university didn't have one, so I was cleaning bones in my kitchen and the pot boiled over and my wife would have divorced me if we had to smell corpse fluid every time she cooked,"" and his father's suicide giving him a fascination with death that led him to forensic anthropology.There's a lot of good things to say about this book, but one of the best is that they were very careful with the pictures they included; some of the descriptions he gives of the corpses he's worked with are hard enough to read without a visual aid. You can tell, throughout the reading, that Bill Bass is a wonderful professor. He communicates information clearly, and his writing is enjoyable. It's easy to tell he's simplified the science for general audiences, and the level it's dumbed down to works well for me. There are a few (potentially?) controversial aspects: Bass got his career start by excavating Indian burial grounds in North Dakota, ahead of a dam being built and flooding the area. He unearthed over four thousand bodies, mostly of the Arikara tribe. The skeletons were sent to the Smithsonian, and have since been returned and reburied. He also talks about sex and race typing skeletons as a sure and easy thing, and while I definitely don't know enough to contradict him, that sounds wrong to me, and I wouldn't be surprised to find out that it's not as easy as he makes it sound.Given the title of the book, I was expecting a closer focus on the actual Body Farm, but it's more a series of cases he worked on over the years, ranging from serial killers to insurance frauds to a identifying bodies that a crematory stacked up for years instead of burning. Very interesting and well written, but I'm glad I'll be reading more on the topic, as it's not really wide-ranging enough to feel like I understand forensic anthropology now.Quick, easy read, as long as you're not too squeamish."
152,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58910403-kylie-rodriguez,5,"Death's Acre was an interesting book to say the least. It managed to be humorous throughout its descriptions of murder scenes, post-mortem bodies and various explicit tales. Dr. Bass’s purpose for the novel was not only to educate the reader about the human body after death, but to explain and detail one of his life’s biggest accomplishments, the building of the body farm. The purpose of the body farm is for donated bodies to be put in various situations in order to study and understand the various rates and characteristics of human decomposition in order to assist in multiple fields. His graphic description of boiling bodies and examining teeth were further enhanced by the array of pictures included in the book. Anthropologists, forensic investigators, and other various fields find this to be invaluable information when coming into contact with a body in a state of decay. His reason for creating this body farm was because he’d realized after finding several bodies, there are so many different forms of decay due to varying conditions that without further research it could be incredibly difficult to definitively state a time of death. For example, in this book he talks about how he investigated a potential murder at the site of a civil war grave. He placed the death at approximately 2-6 months before the body was found. And then he talked about how after talking to the press and imploring people to give informational they knew anything, he found the body was actually that of the person whose grave it was. Due to the type of coffin he’d had his body had been preserved for an incredibly long time. These types of cases were the reasons he created the body farm."

Part true-crime anecdotes, part memoir, Death's Acre is a macabre delight if (like me) you are the sort of person who gets a twisted sort of pleasure reading about crazy murders and how forensics teams solve them. The book wasn't quite what I was expecting, because it's billed as an examination of the Body Farm, a research facility in Tennessee where experiments are preformed concerning how human bodies decay. And while the book does talk about origins of the Body Farm and discusses some of the more interesting experiments that they have done with donated human corpses, the book's main focus is on the life of it's author, Dr. Bill Bass, a pioneer in the field of forensic anthropology and the founder of the Body Farm itself. Dr. Bass has seen pretty much everything when it comes to human remains, and he shares some of his best murder investigation stories here with a healthy dose of biology, chemistry, and anatomy (yay!). The stories are en-gross-ing (har har har) and wildly entertaining as long as you have a strong stomach. Definitely recommended."

The results from that experiment ended up in her aptly titled novel, The Body Farm, which later became the nickname for Bass’s Anthropology Research Facility."

Unfortunately, there was a miscalculation in the real time of death of the corpse found in the coffin. This was the pivotal moment in Dr. Bass' 20 years career as forensic scientist. Seeing there was a lack of knowledge in the study of human decomposition from the time of death to the time of decay, Dr. Bass invented the first ""Body Farm"" to address that need. This has revolutionized the field of forensic science. In Death's Acre, we learn about the many real life cases Dr. Bass' investigates and how these cases helped establish the Body Farm from its humble beginnings - a journey that was not an easy and a smooth sailing one. This book is written with so much honesty and emotions. Dr. Bass shares about his personal life - how he started in forensic science, his passion for Body Farm, his grief over the deaths of his loved ones, and so forth (not going to spoil it for you!) I enjoyed the many different real life cases and how the investigations were done. The graphic descriptions of the murder victims and their human decompositions may be grisly for some readers but theses details were important in helping us to see how the cases were solved. It was fascinating and amazing! If you enjoy forensic science, this is a must read book! I appreciate that this book was written in an easy to understand manner - without being too sciency - and the storytelling is so engaging!

168,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4089241-liralen,4,"I know of only two types of scientific research that require utterly destroying the very thing you're studying: excavating an archaeological site and investigating a death scene (74).Bass started the first Body Farm, a research facility designed to study decomposition of human bodies and, in turn, aid investigations. For better or for worse, Death's Acre is not really about the Body Farm—rather, it's about Bass's career trajectory more generally. Over the years, he says, counting my excavations of Indian burials in the Great Plains, I've been in somewhere around five thousand graves. By the time I die I suspect I'll hold some sort of unofficial record: ""body that's been in and out of the most graves ever"" (62–63). And he does take the reader in and out of quite a lot of those graves, exploring death scenes and crime cases and his growing understanding of the effects of different circumstances on death. It's amazing to think that only ~30 years ago this was really not being studied at all—and also to think that a lot of this research is limited by location. Bass's Body Farm is in Tennessee, and though there are now others, some of his research in the muggy south would have little relevance to death scenes in, say, dry/hot parts of Texas (where there are now two body farms) or dry/chilly Saskatoon. So much more space for research!I would have loved to see more about that research—the particular experiments they ran and the results; what was expected or unexpected—but considering that there was proportionally little of that sort of thing, I am left to conclude that author/editor/coauthor found that the more interesting stories were the ones that used lessons they'd learned from the Body Farm but that took place elsewhere. A lot of the lessons are almost accidental—one man became a 'dismemberment expert' (the book's term, not mine!) after being asked what kind of saw had made a cut in a bone and realising that he had no idea how to distinguish that. (Oddly, or perhaps not, I think I'd have less trouble doing that kind of work than being married to someone who did. Hmmm.)Perhaps not for the faint of heart, but it's fascinating stuff."

The book contains cases that he worked on, as well as how the Body Farm came to be and various struggles it has faced. In some chapters, it's almost memoir-ish, as Bass' personal life features glancingly, but the focus is never on him as a person, rather than as a researcher. The personal anecdotes are along the lines of ""I had to replace the stove in my house three times because the university didn't have one, so I was cleaning bones in my kitchen and the pot boiled over and my wife would have divorced me if we had to smell corpse fluid every time she cooked,"" and his father's suicide giving him a fascination with death that led him to forensic anthropology.There's a lot of good things to say about this book, but one of the best is that they were very careful with the pictures they included; some of the descriptions he gives of the corpses he's worked with are hard enough to read without a visual aid. You can tell, throughout the reading, that Bill Bass is a wonderful professor. He communicates information clearly, and his writing is enjoyable. It's easy to tell he's simplified the science for general audiences, and the level it's dumbed down to works well for me. There are a few (potentially?) controversial aspects: Bass got his career start by excavating Indian burial grounds in North Dakota, ahead of a dam being built and flooding the area. He unearthed over four thousand bodies, mostly of the Arikara tribe. The skeletons were sent to the Smithsonian, and have since been returned and reburied. He also talks about sex and race typing skeletons as a sure and easy thing, and while I definitely don't know enough to contradict him, that sounds wrong to me, and I wouldn't be surprised to find out that it's not as easy as he makes it sound.Given the title of the book, I was expecting a closer focus on the actual Body Farm, but it's more a series of cases he worked on over the years, ranging from serial killers to insurance frauds to a identifying bodies that a crematory stacked up for years instead of burning. Very interesting and well written, but I'm glad I'll be reading more on the topic, as it's not really wide-ranging enough to feel like I understand forensic anthropology now.Quick, easy read, as long as you're not too squeamish."
182,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58910403-kylie-rodriguez,5,"Death's Acre was an interesting book to say the least. It managed to be humorous throughout its descriptions of murder scenes, post-mortem bodies and various explicit tales. Dr. Bass’s purpose for the novel was not only to educate the reader about the human body after death, but to explain and detail one of his life’s biggest accomplishments, the building of the body farm. The purpose of the body farm is for donated bodies to be put in various situations in order to study and understand the various rates and characteristics of human decomposition in order to assist in multiple fields. His graphic description of boiling bodies and examining teeth were further enhanced by the array of pictures included in the book. Anthropologists, forensic investigators, and other various fields find this to be invaluable information when coming into contact with a body in a state of decay. His reason for creating this body farm was because he’d realized after finding several bodies, there are so many different forms of decay due to varying conditions that without further research it could be incredibly difficult to definitively state a time of death. For example, in this book he talks about how he investigated a potential murder at the site of a civil war grave. He placed the death at approximately 2-6 months before the body was found. And then he talked about how after talking to the press and imploring people to give informational they knew anything, he found the body was actually that of the person whose grave it was. Due to the type of coffin he’d had his body had been preserved for an incredibly long time. These types of cases were the reasons he created the body farm."

Part true-crime anecdotes, part memoir, Death's Acre is a macabre delight if (like me) you are the sort of person who gets a twisted sort of pleasure reading about crazy murders and how forensics teams solve them. The book wasn't quite what I was expecting, because it's billed as an examination of the Body Farm, a research facility in Tennessee where experiments are preformed concerning how human bodies decay. And while the book does talk about origins of the Body Farm and discusses some of the more interesting experiments that they have done with donated human corpses, the book's main focus is on the life of it's author, Dr. Bill Bass, a pioneer in the field of forensic anthropology and the founder of the Body Farm itself. Dr. Bass has seen pretty much everything when it comes to human remains, and he shares some of his best murder investigation stories here with a healthy dose of biology, chemistry, and anatomy (yay!). The stories are en-gross-ing (har har har) and wildly entertaining as long as you have a strong stomach. Definitely recommended."

Unfortunately, there was a miscalculation in the real time of death of the corpse found in the coffin. This was the pivotal moment in Dr. Bass' 20 years career as forensic scientist. Seeing there was a lack of knowledge in the study of human decomposition from the time of death to the time of decay, Dr. Bass invented the first ""Body Farm"" to address that need. This has revolutionized the field of forensic science. In Death's Acre, we learn about the many real life cases Dr. Bass' investigates and how these cases helped establish the Body Farm from its humble beginnings - a journey that was not an easy and a smooth sailing one. This book is written with so much honesty and emotions. Dr. Bass shares about his personal life - how he started in forensic science, his passion for Body Farm, his grief over the deaths of his loved ones, and so forth (not going to spoil it for you!) I enjoyed the many different real life cases and how the investigations were done. The graphic descriptions of the murder victims and their human decompositions may be grisly for some readers but theses details were important in helping us to see how the cases were solved. It was fascinating and amazing! If you enjoy forensic science, this is a must read book! I appreciate that this book was written in an easy to understand manner - without being too sciency - and the storytelling is so engaging! I definitely learned a lot from this book - both the world of forensic science and the life of a forensic scientist. "

198,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4089241-liralen,4,"I know of only two types of scientific research that require utterly destroying the very thing you're studying: excavating an archaeological site and investigating a death scene (74).Bass started the first Body Farm, a research facility designed to study decomposition of human bodies and, in turn, aid investigations. For better or for worse, Death's Acre is not really about the Body Farm—rather, it's about Bass's career trajectory more generally. Over the years, he says, counting my excavations of Indian burials in the Great Plains, I've been in somewhere around five thousand graves. By the time I die I suspect I'll hold some sort of unofficial record: ""body that's been in and out of the most graves ever"" (62–63). And he does take the reader in and out of quite a lot of those graves, exploring death scenes and crime cases and his growing understanding of the effects of different circumstances on death. It's amazing to think that only ~30 years ago this was really not being studied at all—and also to think that a lot of this research is limited by location. Bass's Body Farm is in Tennessee, and though there are now others, some of his research in the muggy south would have little relevance to death scenes in, say, dry/hot parts of Texas (where there are now two body farms) or dry/chilly Saskatoon. So much more space for research!I would have loved to see more about that research—the particular experiments they ran and the results; what was expected or unexpected—but considering that there was proportionally little of that sort of thing, I am left to conclude that author/editor/coauthor found that the more interesting stories were the ones that used lessons they'd learned from the Body Farm but that took place elsewhere. A lot of the lessons are almost accidental—one man became a 'dismemberment expert' (the book's term, not mine!) after being asked what kind of saw had made a cut in a bone and realising that he had no idea how to distinguish that. (Oddly, or perhaps not, I think I'd have less trouble doing that kind of work than being married to someone who did. Hmmm.)Perhaps not for the faint of heart, but it's fascinating stuff."
199,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18468967-rachel-jackson,2,"After reading Mary Roach's Stiff, I wanted to dive into more books about death, the morbid and the macabre immediately, which led me to Bill Bass's book Death's Acre about his brainchild and creation the body farm in Tennessee. I wanted to learn more about how it was created, how it operated and what sort of research it did. However, this book was less about the body farm as it was about Bass's life itself, from his origins as an anthropologist studying Native American remains to his love life. And those weren't nearly as interesting as the book that the title suggests.Bass's work as a forensic anthropologist is interesting, don't get me wrong; it's full of death and murder and investigations and scandals. But anyone can write a crime story. What I wanted to know about was the work that goes into the place where the dead go to die in grotesque ways, letting flies devour their bodies, seeing the sticky goo that oozes from them when their skin and organs give out. That's what fascinates me. And Bass does go into detail about those sorts of things, but for the most part, the book follows him as he gallivants around the world, giving speeches, investigating murders and learning more things about bodies outside of the body farm.And it's clear that Bass wants to provide variety and spice to his book so it doesn't center solely on death and decomposition alone, given the heavy topic that it is — which is fine; providing that angle on his own life and exploits is fine. But that's not what the title suggests and certainly not what I wanted to read about when I picked this book up. It's an easy read, and the personal details make it a quirky but relatable read. However, in some places Bass's anecdotes and musing about life and death are cheesy and overdone, and all I really wanted to know about was the bodies at the body farm. As a research book — that is, something I read to learn more about the body farm — it was lacking. As a memoir, perhaps it was better. But again, that's not what I was expecting as I was going in. "

Like a lot of people, I first learned about The Body Farm from Patricia Cornwell in her novel by the same name and I found it fascinating. While I would not have the patience or the stomach for the type of investigation that they do there, I think it is critical work that has helped in a lot of criminal investigations.The story of how Bill Bass came to be involved in forensic anthropology and to start The Body Farm is almost as fascinating as the work done since that facility opened. I was especially taken with the mistake he made on time of death of Col. Shy and how they came to discover it and to use it as a starting point for further learning. I am afraid of giving too much away by discussing any of the discoveries made or cases worked because I enjoyed reading them so much. I will say I appreciate his willingness to try to find a place in his line of work for those with unorthodox interests and backgrounds, because I do think it has improved the practice of forensics over time.Definitely recommended reading for anyone interested in forensics or criminology, but with the caveat that the subject matter of decaying and dismembered bodies is not for everyone."

When I started reading this book I wanted to read about dead bodies and the story behind the bodies, the cause of death and if it was a murder victim then the story of how the person was killed. The first chapter did start out talking about a body but it also started talking about the life of Bill Bass, the founder of the Body Farm, which I wasn’t interested in but I had to remind myself that this book is a memoir of how the Body Farm became what it is today. To get the story of the Body Farm the life story of Bill Bass is also told. Each chapter tells about a body and the back story of the body. This book can best be described as a true, real life CSI series. Not only does each chapter talk about the bodies but also the evidence and events that lead examiners to determine the cause of death of the people. This book has a lot of scientific talk about human anatomy but the book is broken down and explained and terms are used that can be understood by anyone who is not familiar with technical human anatomy terms."
202,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3787451-ctgt,4,"The title is a little misleading in that it's not just about The Body Farm. It's more of an overview of Dr. Bass and some of his cases. It was interesting to read that the idea for the body farm grew from an inicident involving cows. There is a large section in the middle of the book that deals with the farm and the struggles to get it up and running. The book goes into some detail about the efforts to establish a scientific method of determining ""time since death"". As popular as these types of crime solving procedures are on tv right now, it is interesting to consider that most of this science is very new and really still a very young field. Dr. Bass talks about a Chinese forensic text published in A.D. 1247 by Sung Tz'u entitled The Washing Away of Wrongs and how there had been virtually no published work on the extended postmortem interval since that text. So it is an interesting look at the beginning stages of current forensic anthropology and how far the field has progressed in a fairly short period of time."

The first hundred pages of this three hundred page book is spent on Bass's early career. As I was most interested in the Body Farm, i found this portion a slog to get through. I did learn a bit about anthropology and working in the desert and on avoiding snakes but it wasn't what I had set out to read.Fortunately things pick up on page 100.

Very interesting and well written, but I'm glad I'll be reading more on the topic, as it's not really wide-ranging enough to feel like I understand forensic anthropology now.Quick, easy read, as long as you're not too squeamish."

It managed to be humorous throughout its descriptions of murder scenes, post-mortem bodies and various explicit tales. Dr. Bass’s purpose for the novel was not only to educate the reader about the human body after death, but to explain and detail one of his life’s biggest accomplishments, the building of the body farm. The purpose of the body farm is for donated bodies to be put in various situations in order to study and understand the various rates and characteristics of human decomposition in order to assist in multiple fields. His graphic description of boiling bodies and examining teeth were further enhanced by the array of pictures included in the book. Anthropologists, forensic investigators, and other various fields find this to be invaluable information when coming into contact with a body in a state of decay. His reason for creating this body farm was because he’d realized after finding several bodies, there are so many different forms of decay due to varying conditions that without further research it could be incredibly difficult to definitively state a time of death. For example, in this book he talks about how he investigated a potential murder at the site of a civil war grave. He placed the death at approximately 2-6 months before the body was found. And then he talked about how after talking to the press and imploring people to give informational they knew anything, he found the body was actually that of the person whose grave it was. Due to the type of coffin he’d had his body had been preserved for an incredibly long time. These types of cases were the reasons he created the body farm."

226,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34187759-thereadingowlvina-elvina-ulrich,5,"In 1977, forensic anthropologist Dr. William Bass was called to investigate the disturbed grave of Confederate officer Lieutenant Colonel William Shy. Unfortunately, there was a miscalculation in the real time of death of the corpse found in the coffin. This was the pivotal moment in Dr. Bass' 20 years career as forensic scientist. Seeing there was a lack of knowledge in the study of human decomposition from the time of death to the time of decay, Dr. Bass invented the first ""Body Farm"" to address that need. This has revolutionized the field of forensic science. In Death's Acre, we learn about the many real life cases Dr. Bass' investigates and how these cases helped establish the Body Farm from its humble beginnings - a journey that was not an easy and a smooth sailing one. This book is written with so much honesty and emotions. Dr. Bass shares about his personal life - how he started in forensic science, his passion for Body Farm, his grief over the deaths of his loved ones, and so forth (not going to spoil it for you!) I enjoyed the many different real life cases and how the investigations were done. The graphic descriptions of the murder victims and their human decompositions may be grisly for some readers but theses details were important in helping us to see how the cases were solved. It was fascinating and amazing! If you enjoy forensic science, this is a must read book! I appreciate that this book was written in an easy to understand manner - without being too sciency - and the storytelling is so engaging! I definitely learned a lot from this book - both the world of forensic science and the life of a forensic scientist. "
227,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36801712-dawn-o-connor,5,"Pure fascination for me. Lots of science, mystery, and a look into a topic I’ve never learned about before. Highly recommend for any fans of true crime or forensics."
228,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4089241-liralen,4,"I know of only two types of scientific research that require utterly destroying the very thing you're studying: excavating an archaeological site and investigating a death scene (74).Bass started the first Body Farm, a research facility designed to study decomposition of human bodies and, in turn, aid investigations. For better or for worse, Death's Acre is not really about the Body Farm—rather, it's about Bass's career trajectory more generally. Over the years, he says, counting my excavations of Indian burials in the Great Plains, I've been in somewhere around five thousand graves. By the time I die I suspect I'll hold some sort of unofficial record: ""body that's been in and out of the most graves ever"" (62–63). And he does take the reader in and out of quite a lot of those graves, exploring death scenes and crime cases and his growing understanding of the effects of different circumstances on death. It's amazing to think that only ~30 years ago this was really not being studied at all—and also to think that a lot of this research is limited by location. Bass's Body Farm is in Tennessee, and though there are now others, some of his research in the muggy south would have little relevance to death scenes in, say, dry/hot parts of Texas (where there are now two body farms) or dry/chilly Saskatoon. So much more space for research!I would have loved to see more about that research—the particular experiments they ran and the results; what was expected or unexpected—but considering that there was proportionally little of that sort of thing, I am left to conclude that author/editor/coauthor found that the more interesting stories were the ones that used lessons they'd learned from the Body Farm but that took place elsewhere. A lot of the lessons are almost accidental—one man became a 'dismemberment expert' (the book's term, not mine!) after being asked what kind of saw had made a cut in a bone and realising that he had no idea how to distinguish that. (Oddly, or perhaps not, I think I'd have less trouble doing that kind of work than being married to someone who did. Hmmm.)Perhaps not for the faint of heart, but it's fascinating stuff."
229,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18468967-rachel-jackson,2,"After reading Mary Roach's Stiff, I wanted to dive into more books about death, the morbid and the macabre immediately, which led me to Bill Bass's book Death's Acre about his brainchild and creation the body farm in Tennessee. I wanted to learn more about how it was created, how it operated and what sort of research it did. However, this book was less about the body farm as it was about Bass's life itself, from his origins as an anthropologist studying Native American remains to his love life. And those weren't nearly as interesting as the book that the title suggests.Bass's work as a forensic anthropologist is interesting, don't get me wrong; it's full of death and murder and investigations and scandals. But anyone can write a crime story. What I wanted to know about was the work that goes into the place where the dead go to die in grotesque ways, letting flies devour their bodies, seeing the sticky goo that oozes from them when their skin and organs give out. That's what fascinates me. And Bass does go into detail about those sorts of things, but for the most part, the book follows him as he gallivants around the world, giving speeches, investigating murders and learning more things about bodies outside of the body farm.And it's clear that Bass wants to provide variety and spice to his book so it doesn't center solely on death and decomposition alone, given the heavy topic that it is — which is fine; providing that angle on his own life and exploits is fine. But that's not what the title suggests and certainly not what I wanted to read about when I picked this book up. It's an easy read, and the personal details make it a quirky but relatable read. However, in some places Bass's anecdotes and musing about life and death are cheesy and overdone, and all I really wanted to know about was the bodies at the body farm. As a research book — that is, something I read to learn more about the body farm — it was lacking. As a memoir, perhaps it was better. But again, that's not what I was expecting as I was going in. "
230,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19004147-cheryl,4,"This is a book I have been wanting to read for quite some time and when I was off work sick yesterday I couldn't resist it. Like a lot of people, I first learned about The Body Farm from Patricia Cornwell in her novel by the same name and I found it fascinating. While I would not have the patience or the stomach for the type of investigation that they do there, I think it is critical work that has helped in a lot of criminal investigations.The story of how Bill Bass came to be involved in forensic anthropology and to start The Body Farm is almost as fascinating as the work done since that facility opened. I was especially taken with the mistake he made on time of death of Col. Shy and how they came to discover it and to use it as a starting point for further learning. I am afraid of giving too much away by discussing any of the discoveries made or cases worked because I enjoyed reading them so much. I will say I appreciate his willingness to try to find a place in his line of work for those with unorthodox interests and backgrounds, because I do think it has improved the practice of forensics over time.Definitely recommended reading for anyone interested in forensics or criminology, but with the caveat that the subject matter of decaying and dismembered bodies is not for everyone."
231,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054835-brandee,5,"I was sad when I read the last sentence of this book; I did not want it to end. When I started reading this book I wanted to read about dead bodies and the story behind the bodies, the cause of death and if it was a murder victim then the story of how the person was killed. The first chapter did start out talking about a body but it also started talking about the life of Bill Bass, the founder of the Body Farm, which I wasn’t interested in but I had to remind myself that this book is a memoir of how the Body Farm became what it is today. To get the story of the Body Farm the life story of Bill Bass is also told. Each chapter tells about a body and the back story of the body. This book can best be described as a true, real life CSI series. Not only does each chapter talk about the bodies but also the evidence and events that lead examiners to determine the cause of death of the people. This book has a lot of scientific talk about human anatomy but the book is broken down and explained and terms are used that can be understood by anyone who is not familiar with technical human anatomy terms."
232,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3787451-ctgt,4,"The title is a little misleading in that it's not just about The Body Farm. It's more of an overview of Dr. Bass and some of his cases. It was interesting to read that the idea for the body farm grew from an inicident involving cows. There is a large section in the middle of the book that deals with the farm and the struggles to get it up and running. The book goes into some detail about the efforts to establish a scientific method of determining ""time since death"". As popular as these types of crime solving procedures are on tv right now, it is interesting to consider that most of this science is very new and really still a very young field. Dr. Bass talks about a Chinese forensic text published in A.D. 1247 by Sung Tz'u entitled The Washing Away of Wrongs and how there had been virtually no published work on the extended postmortem interval since that text. So it is an interesting look at the beginning stages of current forensic anthropology and how far the field has progressed in a fairly short period of time."
233,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/122647-sarah-sammis,3," The body farm is a forensic tool invented by Dr. Bill Bass in 1971. Cadavers donated to science are allowed to decompose under a variety of environmental conditions. The progress is documented for use in future forensic investigations.Death's Acre recounts the career of Dr. Bill Bass and the early years of modern forensic science as it evolved from anthropology. The first hundred pages of this three hundred page book is spent on Bass's early career. As I was most interested in the Body Farm, i found this portion a slog to get through. I did learn a bit about anthropology and working in the desert and on avoiding snakes but it wasn't what I had set out to read.Fortunately things pick up on page 100. The remainder of the book is a series of fascinating chapters on how environmental factors affect decomposition and the mistakes criminals make when trying to hide or destroy bodies. "
234,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4347062-lil-grogan,4,"A fascinating read with far more humour and heart than I expected. My own interest in forensics is purely born from watching CSI. Found it intriguing to read about how and where some of the knowledge in the field was developed. Majority of the book is about Bass' career as a physical anthropologist, with a concentration on his work in crime cases and small bits about his personal life. Bass is also generous in devoting time to the achievements of his students and colleagues in the field. Liked that he was open about mistakes he made along the way, and what was learned from them.I'm not sure how the writing of this book was carried out, but I can't help wishing his co-author or editor had tightened it up a bit more. The repetition and side-tracking were at times annoying. However, I'm glad that his avuncular, didactic tone carried through...along with his often groan-worthy jokes. "
235,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/794432-elizabeth,3,"Death's Acre is a humble account of the development of forensic anthropology from the man who was curious enough to find the answers. Bass's personal history and relationships give insight into how the science has evolved and culminated in the Body Farm. Bass is generous in his praise for those he has worked with and mentored over his long career and comes across as an approachable and ever-curious figure. The only criticism would be that certain descriptions of techniques or processes are repeated in detail through various chapters, making them feel like stand-alone chunks; not taking into account the reader's ability to retain these details. Otherwise, The Body Farm is written well for the uninitiated without becoming too technical or academic."
236,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/803323-nancy,5,"Death's Acre is primarily a series of interesting stories about solving crimes through forensic science. Jon Jefferson has assisted Dr. Bass in writing a really engaging memoir. This book could have been just a series a CSI type stories, but it is more than that. I found Dr. Bass's discussion of his loss of religious faith particularly interesting. He practiced a conventional Christian faith for over 60 years. His direct experience with horrific murders did not shake it, but the cancer deaths of two women he loved did. It would have been easy to leave this out of the book, but including it gives us insight into the life of a real man who is more than a successful teacher, researcher and mystery solver."
237,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14529100-amanda-messerlie,5,"I really enjoyed reading about Dr. Bass's life and career; he did a wonderful job of conveying both with humor and clarity. Combining science, history, personality, and humility, Bass does interested readers a service by bringing us an accurate glimpse into the actual life of a forensic scientist.In a dream world where I have unlimited money and time, I would be finishing a doctoral program in forensic anthropology. None of the concepts introduced in this book were new to me, but they were fleshed out in a interesting and simple manner. With the preponderance of criminal investigation shows on television, many people are woefully misinformed about the forensic sciences. Death's Acre is a great way to begin correcting those misrepresentations. "

This is definitely a must read if you like to watch crime drama television such as Bones or have an interest in anthropology. Surprisingly, this book wasn't dry, which I kind of hoped it would be! However, Bass included little pieces of his humor which had me laughing out loud while I was reading it. Death's Acre was the type of book that I didn't want to put down. Bass also includes a section with pictures that relate to his cases as well as his personal life within the book. These pictures along with lucid descriptions bring the book to life in the audience's hands."

He also details how he first met Patricia Cornwell and how she got her start in writing the Kay Scarpetta series. A must-read for true crime aficionados or fans of Patricia Cornwell. "

The book contains cases that he worked on, as well as how the Body Farm came to be and various struggles it has faced. In some chapters, it's almost memoir-ish, as Bass' personal life features glancingly, but the focus is never on him as a person, rather than as a researcher. The personal anecdotes are along the lines of ""I had to replace the stove in my house three times because the university didn't have one, so I was cleaning bones in my kitchen and the pot boiled over and my wife would have divorced me if we had to smell corpse fluid every time she cooked,"" and his father's suicide giving him a fascination with death that led him to forensic anthropology.There's a lot of good things to say about this book, but one of the best is that they were very careful with the pictures they included; some of the descriptions he gives of the corpses he's worked with are hard enough to read without a visual aid. You can tell, throughout the reading, that Bill Bass is a wonderful professor. He communicates information clearly, and his writing is enjoyable. It's easy to tell he's simplified the science for general audiences, and the level it's dumbed down to works well for me. There are a few (potentially?) controversial aspects: Bass got his career start by excavating Indian burial grounds in North Dakota, ahead of a dam being built and flooding the area. He unearthed over four thousand bodies, mostly of the Arikara tribe. The skeletons were sent to the Smithsonian, and have since been returned and reburied. He also talks about sex and race typing skeletons as a sure and easy thing, and while I definitely don't know enough to contradict him, that sounds wrong to me, and I wouldn't be surprised to find out that it's not as easy as he makes it sound.Given the title of the book, I was expecting a closer focus on the actual Body Farm, but it's more a series of cases he worked on over the years, ranging from serial killers to insurance frauds to a identifying bodies that a crematory stacked up for years instead of burning.

Unfortunately, there was a miscalculation in the real time of death of the corpse found in the coffin. This was the pivotal moment in Dr. Bass' 20 years career as forensic scientist. Seeing there was a lack of knowledge in the study of human decomposition from the time of death to the time of decay, Dr. Bass invented the first ""Body Farm"" to address that need. This has revolutionized the field of forensic science. In Death's Acre, we learn about the many real life cases Dr. Bass' investigates and how these cases helped establish the Body Farm from its humble beginnings - a journey that was not an easy and a smooth sailing one. This book is written with so much honesty and emotions. Dr. Bass shares about his personal life - how he started in forensic science, his passion for Body Farm, his grief over the deaths of his loved ones, and so forth (not going to spoil it for you!) I enjoyed the many different real life cases and how the investigations were done. The graphic descriptions of the murder victims and their human decompositions may be grisly for some readers but theses details were important in helping us to see how the cases were solved. It was fascinating and amazing! If you enjoy forensic science, this is a must read book! I appreciate that this book was written in an easy to understand manner - without being too sciency - and the storytelling is so engaging!

258,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4089241-liralen,4,"I know of only two types of scientific research that require utterly destroying the very thing you're studying: excavating an archaeological site and investigating a death scene (74).Bass started the first Body Farm, a research facility designed to study decomposition of human bodies and, in turn, aid investigations. For better or for worse, Death's Acre is not really about the Body Farm—rather, it's about Bass's career trajectory more generally. Over the years, he says, counting my excavations of Indian burials in the Great Plains, I've been in somewhere around five thousand graves. By the time I die I suspect I'll hold some sort of unofficial record: ""body that's been in and out of the most graves ever"" (62–63). And he does take the reader in and out of quite a lot of those graves, exploring death scenes and crime cases and his growing understanding of the effects of different circumstances on death. It's amazing to think that only ~30 years ago this was really not being studied at all—and also to think that a lot of this research is limited by location. Bass's Body Farm is in Tennessee, and though there are now others, some of his research in the muggy south would have little relevance to death scenes in, say, dry/hot parts of Texas (where there are now two body farms) or dry/chilly Saskatoon. So much more space for research!I would have loved to see more about that research—the particular experiments they ran and the results; what was expected or unexpected—but considering that there was proportionally little of that sort of thing, I am left to conclude that author/editor/coauthor found that the more interesting stories were the ones that used lessons they'd learned from the Body Farm but that took place elsewhere. A lot of the lessons are almost accidental—one man became a 'dismemberment expert' (the book's term, not mine!) after being asked what kind of saw had made a cut in a bone and realising that he had no idea how to distinguish that. (Oddly, or perhaps not, I think I'd have less trouble doing that kind of work than being married to someone who did. Hmmm.)Perhaps not for the faint of heart, but it's fascinating stuff."
259,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18468967-rachel-jackson,2,"After reading Mary Roach's Stiff, I wanted to dive into more books about death, the morbid and the macabre immediately, which led me to Bill Bass's book Death's Acre about his brainchild and creation the body farm in Tennessee. I wanted to learn more about how it was created, how it operated and what sort of research it did. However, this book was less about the body farm as it was about Bass's life itself, from his origins as an anthropologist studying Native American remains to his love life. And those weren't nearly as interesting as the book that the title suggests.Bass's work as a forensic anthropologist is interesting, don't get me wrong; it's full of death and murder and investigations and scandals. But anyone can write a crime story. What I wanted to know about was the work that goes into the place where the dead go to die in grotesque ways, letting flies devour their bodies, seeing the sticky goo that oozes from them when their skin and organs give out. That's what fascinates me. And Bass does go into detail about those sorts of things, but for the most part, the book follows him as he gallivants around the world, giving speeches, investigating murders and learning more things about bodies outside of the body farm.And it's clear that Bass wants to provide variety and spice to his book so it doesn't center solely on death and decomposition alone, given the heavy topic that it is — which is fine; providing that angle on his own life and exploits is fine. But that's not what the title suggests and certainly not what I wanted to read about when I picked this book up. It's an easy read, and the personal details make it a quirky but relatable read. However, in some places Bass's anecdotes and musing about life and death are cheesy and overdone, and all I really wanted to know about was the bodies at the body farm. As a research book — that is, something I read to learn more about the body farm — it was lacking. As a memoir, perhaps it was better. But again, that's not what I was expecting as I was going in. "
260,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19004147-cheryl,4,"This is a book I have been wanting to read for quite some time and when I was off work sick yesterday I couldn't resist it. Like a lot of people, I first learned about The Body Farm from Patricia Cornwell in her novel by the same name and I found it fascinating. While I would not have the patience or the stomach for the type of investigation that they do there, I think it is critical work that has helped in a lot of criminal investigations.The story of how Bill Bass came to be involved in forensic anthropology and to start The Body Farm is almost as fascinating as the work done since that facility opened. I was especially taken with the mistake he made on time of death of Col. Shy and how they came to discover it and to use it as a starting point for further learning. I am afraid of giving too much away by discussing any of the discoveries made or cases worked because I enjoyed reading them so much. I will say I appreciate his willingness to try to find a place in his line of work for those with unorthodox interests and backgrounds, because I do think it has improved the practice of forensics over time.Definitely recommended reading for anyone interested in forensics or criminology, but with the caveat that the subject matter of decaying and dismembered bodies is not for everyone."
261,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054835-brandee,5,"I was sad when I read the last sentence of this book; I did not want it to end. When I started reading this book I wanted to read about dead bodies and the story behind the bodies, the cause of death and if it was a murder victim then the story of how the person was killed. The first chapter did start out talking about a body but it also started talking about the life of Bill Bass, the founder of the Body Farm, which I wasn’t interested in but I had to remind myself that this book is a memoir of how the Body Farm became what it is today. To get the story of the Body Farm the life story of Bill Bass is also told. Each chapter tells about a body and the back story of the body. This book can best be described as a true, real life CSI series. Not only does each chapter talk about the bodies but also the evidence and events that lead examiners to determine the cause of death of the people. This book has a lot of scientific talk about human anatomy but the book is broken down and explained and terms are used that can be understood by anyone who is not familiar with technical human anatomy terms."
262,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3787451-ctgt,4,"The title is a little misleading in that it's not just about The Body Farm. It's more of an overview of Dr. Bass and some of his cases. It was interesting to read that the idea for the body farm grew from an inicident involving cows. There is a large section in the middle of the book that deals with the farm and the struggles to get it up and running. The book goes into some detail about the efforts to establish a scientific method of determining ""time since death"". As popular as these types of crime solving procedures are on tv right now, it is interesting to consider that most of this science is very new and really still a very young field. Dr. Bass talks about a Chinese forensic text published in A.D. 1247 by Sung Tz'u entitled The Washing Away of Wrongs and how there had been virtually no published work on the extended postmortem interval since that text. So it is an interesting look at the beginning stages of current forensic anthropology and how far the field has progressed in a fairly short period of time."
263,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/122647-sarah-sammis,3," The body farm is a forensic tool invented by Dr. Bill Bass in 1971. Cadavers donated to science are allowed to decompose under a variety of environmental conditions. The progress is documented for use in future forensic investigations.Death's Acre recounts the career of Dr. Bill Bass and the early years of modern forensic science as it evolved from anthropology. The first hundred pages of this three hundred page book is spent on Bass's early career. As I was most interested in the Body Farm, i found this portion a slog to get through. I did learn a bit about anthropology and working in the desert and on avoiding snakes but it wasn't what I had set out to read.Fortunately things pick up on page 100. The remainder of the book is a series of fascinating chapters on how environmental factors affect decomposition and the mistakes criminals make when trying to hide or destroy bodies. "
264,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4347062-lil-grogan,4,"A fascinating read with far more humour and heart than I expected. My own interest in forensics is purely born from watching CSI. Found it intriguing to read about how and where some of the knowledge in the field was developed. Majority of the book is about Bass' career as a physical anthropologist, with a concentration on his work in crime cases and small bits about his personal life. Bass is also generous in devoting time to the achievements of his students and colleagues in the field. Liked that he was open about mistakes he made along the way, and what was learned from them.I'm not sure how the writing of this book was carried out, but I can't help wishing his co-author or editor had tightened it up a bit more. The repetition and side-tracking were at times annoying. However, I'm glad that his avuncular, didactic tone carried through...along with his often groan-worthy jokes. "
265,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/794432-elizabeth,3,"Death's Acre is a humble account of the development of forensic anthropology from the man who was curious enough to find the answers. Bass's personal history and relationships give insight into how the science has evolved and culminated in the Body Farm. Bass is generous in his praise for those he has worked with and mentored over his long career and comes across as an approachable and ever-curious figure. The only criticism would be that certain descriptions of techniques or processes are repeated in detail through various chapters, making them feel like stand-alone chunks; not taking into account the reader's ability to retain these details. Otherwise, The Body Farm is written well for the uninitiated without becoming too technical or academic."
266,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/803323-nancy,5,"Death's Acre is primarily a series of interesting stories about solving crimes through forensic science. Jon Jefferson has assisted Dr. Bass in writing a really engaging memoir. This book could have been just a series a CSI type stories, but it is more than that. I found Dr. Bass's discussion of his loss of religious faith particularly interesting. He practiced a conventional Christian faith for over 60 years. His direct experience with horrific murders did not shake it, but the cancer deaths of two women he loved did. It would have been easy to leave this out of the book, but including it gives us insight into the life of a real man who is more than a successful teacher, researcher and mystery solver."
267,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14529100-amanda-messerlie,5,"I really enjoyed reading about Dr. Bass's life and career; he did a wonderful job of conveying both with humor and clarity. Combining science, history, personality, and humility, Bass does interested readers a service by bringing us an accurate glimpse into the actual life of a forensic scientist.In a dream world where I have unlimited money and time, I would be finishing a doctoral program in forensic anthropology. None of the concepts introduced in this book were new to me, but they were fleshed out in a interesting and simple manner. With the preponderance of criminal investigation shows on television, many people are woefully misinformed about the forensic sciences. Death's Acre is a great way to begin correcting those misrepresentations. "
268,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19839412-kristine,5,"This book was incredible! Bill Bass gives an easy to read background to forensic anthropology. This is definitely a must read if you like to watch crime drama television such as Bones or have an interest in anthropology. Surprisingly, this book wasn't dry, which I kind of hoped it would be! However, Bass included little pieces of his humor which had me laughing out loud while I was reading it. Death's Acre was the type of book that I didn't want to put down. Bass also includes a section with pictures that relate to his cases as well as his personal life within the book. These pictures along with lucid descriptions bring the book to life in the audience's hands."
269,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4209925-nancy,4,"This is an interesting and compelling look at the Body Farm at the University of Tennesse, written by the forensic anthropologist who created it. He describes a number of true crime cases that he has been called on as an expert witness, how he got his start in anthropology and how he is able to determine age, sex, and stature from just a handful of bone fragments. He also details how he first met Patricia Cornwell and how she got her start in writing the Kay Scarpetta series. A must-read for true crime aficionados or fans of Patricia Cornwell. "
270,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7160162-julianne,1,I'm giving it a star as it made me sleep at 4am today when I was having a bout of insomnia. 
271,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77183671-rachel,4,"Death's Acre is written by Bill Bass, the creator of the Body Farm and one of the preeminent forensic anthropologists of our time. The book contains cases that he worked on, as well as how the Body Farm came to be and various struggles it has faced. In some chapters, it's almost memoir-ish, as Bass' personal life features glancingly, but the focus is never on him as a person, rather than as a researcher. The personal anecdotes are along the lines of ""I had to replace the stove in my house three times because the university didn't have one, so I was cleaning bones in my kitchen and the pot boiled over and my wife would have divorced me if we had to smell corpse fluid every time she cooked,"" and his father's suicide giving him a fascination with death that led him to forensic anthropology.There's a lot of good things to say about this book, but one of the best is that they were very careful with the pictures they included; some of the descriptions he gives of the corpses he's worked with are hard enough to read without a visual aid. You can tell, throughout the reading, that Bill Bass is a wonderful professor. He communicates information clearly, and his writing is enjoyable. It's easy to tell he's simplified the science for general audiences, and the level it's dumbed down to works well for me. There are a few (potentially?) controversial aspects: Bass got his career start by excavating Indian burial grounds in North Dakota, ahead of a dam being built and flooding the area. He unearthed over four thousand bodies, mostly of the Arikara tribe. The skeletons were sent to the Smithsonian, and have since been returned and reburied. He also talks about sex and race typing skeletons as a sure and easy thing, and while I definitely don't know enough to contradict him, that sounds wrong to me, and I wouldn't be surprised to find out that it's not as easy as he makes it sound.Given the title of the book, I was expecting a closer focus on the actual Body Farm, but it's more a series of cases he worked on over the years, ranging from serial killers to insurance frauds to a identifying bodies that a crematory stacked up for years instead of burning. Very interesting and well written, but I'm glad I'll be reading more on the topic, as it's not really wide-ranging enough to feel like I understand forensic anthropology now.Quick, easy read, as long as you're not too squeamish."
272,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58910403-kylie-rodriguez,5,"Death's Acre was an interesting book to say the least. It managed to be humorous throughout its descriptions of murder scenes, post-mortem bodies and various explicit tales. Dr. Bass’s purpose for the novel was not only to educate the reader about the human body after death, but to explain and detail one of his life’s biggest accomplishments, the building of the body farm. The purpose of the body farm is for donated bodies to be put in various situations in order to study and understand the various rates and characteristics of human decomposition in order to assist in multiple fields. His graphic description of boiling bodies and examining teeth were further enhanced by the array of pictures included in the book. Anthropologists, forensic investigators, and other various fields find this to be invaluable information when coming into contact with a body in a state of decay. His reason for creating this body farm was because he’d realized after finding several bodies, there are so many different forms of decay due to varying conditions that without further research it could be incredibly difficult to definitively state a time of death. For example, in this book he talks about how he investigated a potential murder at the site of a civil war grave. He placed the death at approximately 2-6 months before the body was found. And then he talked about how after talking to the press and imploring people to give informational they knew anything, he found the body was actually that of the person whose grave it was. Due to the type of coffin he’d had his body had been preserved for an incredibly long time. These types of cases were the reasons he created the body farm."
273,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5672469-krista,4,"4.5 stars. Part true-crime anecdotes, part memoir, Death's Acre is a macabre delight if (like me) you are the sort of person who gets a twisted sort of pleasure reading about crazy murders and how forensics teams solve them. The book wasn't quite what I was expecting, because it's billed as an examination of the Body Farm, a research facility in Tennessee where experiments are preformed concerning how human bodies decay. And while the book does talk about origins of the Body Farm and discusses some of the more interesting experiments that they have done with donated human corpses, the book's main focus is on the life of it's author, Dr. Bill Bass, a pioneer in the field of forensic anthropology and the founder of the Body Farm itself. Dr. Bass has seen pretty much everything when it comes to human remains, and he shares some of his best murder investigation stories here with a healthy dose of biology, chemistry, and anatomy (yay!). The stories are en-gross-ing (har har har) and wildly entertaining as long as you have a strong stomach. Definitely recommended."

That part of my life is now complete.The book is full of great lines like the following one from when he first met crime novelist Patricia Cornwell at a training seminar for the medical examiner’s office where she worked, “As usual, I was showing slides of maggot-covered bodies.” He later did a commissioned experiment for her to analyze how a body would decompose in a basement. The results from that experiment ended up in her aptly titled novel, The Body Farm, which later became the nickname for Bass’s Anthropology Research Facility."

And Bass does go into detail about those sorts of things, but for the most part, the book follows him as he gallivants around the world, giving speeches, investigating murders and learning more things about bodies outside of the body farm.And it's clear that Bass wants to provide variety and spice to his book so it doesn't center solely on death and decomposition alone, given the heavy topic that it is — which is fine; providing that angle on his own life and exploits is fine. But that's not what the title suggests and certainly not what I wanted to read about when I picked this book up. It's an easy read, and the personal details make it a quirky but relatable read. However, in some places Bass's anecdotes and musing about life and death are cheesy and overdone, and all I really wanted to know about was the bodies at the body farm. As a research book — that is, something I read to learn more about the body farm — it was lacking. As a memoir, perhaps it was better. But again, that's not what I was expecting as I was going in. "
290,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19004147-cheryl,4,"This is a book I have been wanting to read for quite some time and when I was off work sick yesterday I couldn't resist it. Like a lot of people, I first learned about The Body Farm from Patricia Cornwell in her novel by the same name and I found it fascinating. While I would not have the patience or the stomach for the type of investigation that they do there, I think it is critical work that has helped in a lot of criminal investigations.The story of how Bill Bass came to be involved in forensic anthropology and to start The Body Farm is almost as fascinating as the work done since that facility opened. I was especially taken with the mistake he made on time of death of Col. Shy and how they came to discover it and to use it as a starting point for further learning. I am afraid of giving too much away by discussing any of the discoveries made or cases worked because I enjoyed reading them so much. I will say I appreciate his willingness to try to find a place in his line of work for those with unorthodox interests and backgrounds, because I do think it has improved the practice of forensics over time.Definitely recommended reading for anyone interested in forensics or criminology, but with the caveat that the subject matter of decaying and dismembered bodies is not for everyone."
291,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054835-brandee,5,"I was sad when I read the last sentence of this book; I did not want it to end. When I started reading this book I wanted to read about dead bodies and the story behind the bodies, the cause of death and if it was a murder victim then the story of how the person was killed. The first chapter did start out talking about a body but it also started talking about the life of Bill Bass, the founder of the Body Farm, which I wasn’t interested in but I had to remind myself that this book is a memoir of how the Body Farm became what it is today. To get the story of the Body Farm the life story of Bill Bass is also told. Each chapter tells about a body and the back story of the body. This book can best be described as a true, real life CSI series. Not only does each chapter talk about the bodies but also the evidence and events that lead examiners to determine the cause of death of the people. This book has a lot of scientific talk about human anatomy but the book is broken down and explained and terms are used that can be understood by anyone who is not familiar with technical human anatomy terms."
292,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3787451-ctgt,4,"The title is a little misleading in that it's not just about The Body Farm. It's more of an overview of Dr. Bass and some of his cases. It was interesting to read that the idea for the body farm grew from an inicident involving cows. There is a large section in the middle of the book that deals with the farm and the struggles to get it up and running. The book goes into some detail about the efforts to establish a scientific method of determining ""time since death"". As popular as these types of crime solving procedures are on tv right now, it is interesting to consider that most of this science is very new and really still a very young field. Dr. Bass talks about a Chinese forensic text published in A.D. 1247 by Sung Tz'u entitled The Washing Away of Wrongs and how there had been virtually no published work on the extended postmortem interval since that text. So it is an interesting look at the beginning stages of current forensic anthropology and how far the field has progressed in a fairly short period of time."
293,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/122647-sarah-sammis,3," The body farm is a forensic tool invented by Dr. Bill Bass in 1971. Cadavers donated to science are allowed to decompose under a variety of environmental conditions. The progress is documented for use in future forensic investigations.Death's Acre recounts the career of Dr. Bill Bass and the early years of modern forensic science as it evolved from anthropology. The first hundred pages of this three hundred page book is spent on Bass's early career. As I was most interested in the Body Farm, i found this portion a slog to get through. I did learn a bit about anthropology and working in the desert and on avoiding snakes but it wasn't what I had set out to read.Fortunately things pick up on page 100. The remainder of the book is a series of fascinating chapters on how environmental factors affect decomposition and the mistakes criminals make when trying to hide or destroy bodies. "
294,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4347062-lil-grogan,4,"A fascinating read with far more humour and heart than I expected. My own interest in forensics is purely born from watching CSI. Found it intriguing to read about how and where some of the knowledge in the field was developed. Majority of the book is about Bass' career as a physical anthropologist, with a concentration on his work in crime cases and small bits about his personal life. Bass is also generous in devoting time to the achievements of his students and colleagues in the field. Liked that he was open about mistakes he made along the way, and what was learned from them.I'm not sure how the writing of this book was carried out, but I can't help wishing his co-author or editor had tightened it up a bit more. The repetition and side-tracking were at times annoying. However, I'm glad that his avuncular, didactic tone carried through...along with his often groan-worthy jokes. "
295,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/794432-elizabeth,3,"Death's Acre is a humble account of the development of forensic anthropology from the man who was curious enough to find the answers. Bass's personal history and relationships give insight into how the science has evolved and culminated in the Body Farm. Bass is generous in his praise for those he has worked with and mentored over his long career and comes across as an approachable and ever-curious figure. The only criticism would be that certain descriptions of techniques or processes are repeated in detail through various chapters, making them feel like stand-alone chunks; not taking into account the reader's ability to retain these details. Otherwise, The Body Farm is written well for the uninitiated without becoming too technical or academic."
296,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/803323-nancy,5,"Death's Acre is primarily a series of interesting stories about solving crimes through forensic science. Jon Jefferson has assisted Dr. Bass in writing a really engaging memoir. This book could have been just a series a CSI type stories, but it is more than that. I found Dr. Bass's discussion of his loss of religious faith particularly interesting. He practiced a conventional Christian faith for over 60 years. His direct experience with horrific murders did not shake it, but the cancer deaths of two women he loved did. It would have been easy to leave this out of the book, but including it gives us insight into the life of a real man who is more than a successful teacher, researcher and mystery solver."
297,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14529100-amanda-messerlie,5,"I really enjoyed reading about Dr. Bass's life and career; he did a wonderful job of conveying both with humor and clarity. Combining science, history, personality, and humility, Bass does interested readers a service by bringing us an accurate glimpse into the actual life of a forensic scientist.In a dream world where I have unlimited money and time, I would be finishing a doctoral program in forensic anthropology. None of the concepts introduced in this book were new to me, but they were fleshed out in a interesting and simple manner. With the preponderance of criminal investigation shows on television, many people are woefully misinformed about the forensic sciences. Death's Acre is a great way to begin correcting those misrepresentations. "
298,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19839412-kristine,5,"This book was incredible! Bill Bass gives an easy to read background to forensic anthropology. This is definitely a must read if you like to watch crime drama television such as Bones or have an interest in anthropology. Surprisingly, this book wasn't dry, which I kind of hoped it would be! However, Bass included little pieces of his humor which had me laughing out loud while I was reading it. Death's Acre was the type of book that I didn't want to put down. Bass also includes a section with pictures that relate to his cases as well as his personal life within the book. These pictures along with lucid descriptions bring the book to life in the audience's hands."
299,0425198324,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4209925-nancy,4,"This is an interesting and compelling look at the Body Farm at the University of Tennesse, written by the forensic anthropologist who created it. He describes a number of true crime cases that he has been called on as an expert witness, how he got his start in anthropology and how he is able to determine age, sex, and stature from just a handful of bone fragments. He also details how he first met Patricia Cornwell and how she got her start in writing the Kay Scarpetta series. A must-read for true crime aficionados or fans of Patricia Cornwell. "
