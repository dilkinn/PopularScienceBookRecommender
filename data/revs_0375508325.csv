1,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13266158-samadrita,5,"I wonder what Carl Sagan may have thought of 9/11 and the world in the new millennium, a strife-torn place which is being shaken up and shaken out every moment. I imagine the civil but slightly horrified and slightly bemused tone he may have employed while talking about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and the antics of the Bush administration which have become such excellent fodder for stand up comedians the world over. And I can almost detect the note of boyish enthusiasm in his voice while he may have spoken of the Higgs Boson and explained the reasons behind the incorrect observation readings of the 'neutrinos being speedier than light particles' experiment that had made the headlines a few years ago.I can only imagine because he wasn't there to witness these watershed events and he isn't here to offer comment, criticism or share his inexhaustible repository of knowledge with us any longer. His time in the Cosmos had run out within two decades of the publication of this work - a testament to his own belief in the staggering inferiority of our evanescent lifetimes in the scheme of the universe(s). 
""Our familiar universe of galaxies and stars, planets and people, would be a single elementary particle in the next universe up, the first step of another infinite regress.""
It would be nice if I could summarize each one of the 13 chapters of 'Cosmos' and give readers the lowdown on our painstakingly slow but rewarding crawl through the fabric of space and time, the civilizational hurdle race towards a finish line which we can neither begin to envision nor fully comprehend yet. I could write a review in the conventional format, leaving you with a gentle nudge to read this book as soon as you can.Or, instead, I could simply write about how, despite being more than 30 years outdated, Carl Sagan's voice of reason rings truer than ever, cutting through the heart of all the din and chaos of our troubled times. I could just tell you how Sagan's deep and abiding love for nature and humanity reverberates in every page of this work and how our scientific endeavours across timelines and geographical boundaries, across the unending void which surrounds us on all sides, symbolize our collective pursuit of knowledge.
""There is no other species on Earth that does science. It is, so far, entirely a human invention, evolved by natural selection in the cerebral cortex for one simple reason: it works. It is not perfect. It can be misused. It is only a tool. But it is by far the best tool we have, self-correcting, ongoing, applicable to everything. It has two rules. First: there are no sacred truths; all assumptions must be critically examined; arguments from authority are worthless. Second: whatever is inconsistent with the facts must be discarded or revised.""
The Cold War is a now defunct appendage of our history, the Soviet Union is no more, America has achieved a milestone in its race relations by welcoming its first African American President. But turmoil in the world order persists - the nuclear arms race between the Americans and the Soviets has been replaced by a newer dance of dominance in the Asia Pacific region. The world is as much embroiled in a mesh of steadily growing list of challenges as it was in the past, if not more. Preposterous decrees issued by fanatical outfits, blatant human rights violations, infringement on freedom of speech and expression, diplomatic arm-wrestling, the ever-enthusiastic decriers of science, 'War on Women', the shouts of the global-warming deniers reign supreme still. The players may have changed faces but the game of petty one-upmanship in the arena of global politics still continues unabated.Which is why Sagan's rousing call for all of mankind to unite under the identity of citizens of the Cosmos and not as citizens of a nation moves me to the core of my being. His recapitulation of our scientific advancements achieved against the tide of adverse circumstances, of the victories won in the face of persecution by religious authority, impresses upon us a sense of urgency - that with the exponential increase in the defense budgets of the global powers, the incentive given to the greatest minds of our times to devote time and energy to unraveling the mysteries of the Cosmos is reduced. As the concept of 'nuclear deterrence' receives a pat on the back, the global arms sales numbers continuing to soar despite hollow promises of arms control, more and more scientists are being engaged in improving weapons technology rather than validating the fact of our existence against the intimidating presence of the stars, galaxies and universes. The NASA budget cuts of recent times are proof of this ignominy.Is it to this end that the ancient advanced cities like Alexandria, the destroyed civilizations of Ionia and the Aztecs and pioneers such as Eratosthenes, Democritus, Aristarchus, Hypatia, Leonardo da Vinci, Copernicus, Galileo, Johannes Kepler, Tycho Brahe, Christiaan Huygens, Issac Newton and Albert Einstein worked tirelessly for? To further intensify mutual national antagonism and increase our probability of complete self-annihilation?Sagan thinks not.
""Our loyalties are to the species and the planet. We speak for the Earth. Our obligation to survive is owed not just to ourselves but also to that Cosmos, ancient and vast, from which we spring.""
 This is why I can't help but agree quite heartily with someone who says 'If I had a religion, I would be a Carl Saganian.'
""If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.""
If there is only one worldly diktat we must abide by with unquestioning faith, let it be this one."
2,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3593962-kalliope,5,"The Star system in GR is absolutely inadequate for rating this book. Gosh, I should not use the term ‘absolutely’ for something in which everything orbits around relativity.Anyway, I think something like this would give a better idea of my opinion about this book: my rating is an universe of zillions to the power of zillions of stars, …and expanding. My rating:What a brilliant read this has been. I have read it very slowly; one chapter a week. But what are thirteen weeks in relation to cosmic time? I have also read it in parallel to watching the DVD programs. What a treat this has been to have Carl Sagan in the little and measurable and limited space of my living room, bringing home and explaining to me, the immensity of all that space and dust and gas and light and fire and immeasurable time.Sagan’s mind is truly cosmic, in scope and in outlook. We accompany him as he pulls together history, with the pre-Socratic, the Alexandrians, Leonardo, Kepler and Tycho Brahe, Huygens, Einstein, with the basics of biology and chemistry and physics and astronomy. I particularly liked his explanation of the effects of Relativity on the light spectrum on board of an Italian Vespa, in a true Pasolini manner. I smiled at the candid StarTreckish nave from which we travel through his half-observed-half-fictional universe. I gasped to see he was using a touch screen to navigate his craft, realizing this would have seemed so fancy back in the early 1980s when Sagan’s program and book were all the rage, and which for us is now so irritatingly ubiquitous.I loved his survey of the Lives of Stars and his anecdote of his first trip to the library as a kid, when upon his request for a book on stars the Librarian gave him a book on Hollywood actors and actresses. Startling are also the simulations in the film version of the encounter of various objects and any given galaxy. Unforgettable.The contents are primarily a laudable exposition of what he calls the language of the universe--the language of science--, which he deciphers as if he were handling a Rosetta stone of multiple dimensions. But a running argument, and I suspect one motivation behind this wondrous book and program, is his deeply human and humane quest to undo our main enemies: superstition and violence.Produced during the Cold War, the book seems a mission launched to make us aware of our origins and our circumstances and increase our awareness of the possibilities of self-destruction. His work is an epic from a savior with a cosmic projection.But the most precious impression I have gathered in this reading is a reminder of how infinitesimally small I am and the inconsequence of my being. But also how, in spite of my own insignificance, how lucky I am to be one more specimen of this wondrous phenomenon of evolution through which a conscience is formed in a strange and extraordinary combination of a few natural elements.Rather than depressing, I have found this thought heartening. A reminder that I have to enjoy it while it lasts.Which means to keep reading books and bask in the knowledge transmitted to me through this wonderful medium, invented by us. Sagan after all begins and ends his account with the Alexandrian Library.He understood."

I'm glad I did; I was able to project the image and voice of Carl Sagan into the words on the page. If there is a better science related, non-fiction book out there, please, someone point it out to me.Revised Oct. 2017."
4,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1397575-daniella,5,"I'm not sure what I could possibly say about Cosmos that hasn't already been said by countless others in the 28 years since its publication, and likely in a far more intelligent and eloquent way than I ever could. But upon recently reading this book for the first time (which may seem a bit belated, but I am, after all, only 23) it instantly became one of my favorites, a status not easily attained by any book, and so I feel compelled to say something, to expound upon its many virtues and why it has endeared itself to me so completely.""One glance at [a book:] and you hear the voice of another person--perhaps someone dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, the author is speaking, clearly and silently, inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people, citizens of distant epochs, who never knew one another. Books break the shackles of time.""Perhaps prophetically, this is exactly the effect the late great Dr. Sagan acheived with this book. Through the power and fluid elegance of his prose, while reading Cosmos I could almost hear that familiar and somehow majestic voice (which in large part, I believe, made the PBS miniseries of the same name so wholly entrancing), as if the two of us were old friends having a leisurely, albeit profoundly intellectual, chat over coffee. Not exactly what one might expect from a book largely concerned with science, but this is just one of many qualities that makes it not only endearing to the reader, but also--and perhaps more importantly--accessible, making even the smattering of complex equations seem casual and undaunting.Aside from the beauty of its prose, which is at times poetic in its depth and its eloquence, Cosmos is also wholly engaging and fascinating in the depth and scope of its subects. Sagan succinctly and expertly covers everything from the birth of stars to the birth of science, the origins of life on Earth to the possibility of life on other planets, and our far distant and recent (in the grand cosmic scheme of things) past to the possibilities for our distant future. And yes, because science is constantly evolving and, as Dr. Sagan states, self-correcting, some of the information and theories covered may now be outdated, but I still believe that Cosmos is well worth reading. Not only can it serve as a friendly, accessible, and engrossing jumping-off point for we common folk who are interested in delving deeper into science but may feel a bit intimidated, it is also, if nothing else, worth reading for the beautifully poignant and evocative insights and the oft-philosophical tidbits contained therein.""We are the local embodiment of the Cosmos grown to self-awareness. We have begun to contemplate our origins: starstuff pondering the stars....""My only complaints about Cosmos are these: the last two or three chapters lag just a bit, incorporating several topics that seem extraneous and unnecessary, and somewhat lose the smooth, easy flow present throughout the rest of the book; and though I feel that, in the current world political climate, the section discussing nuclear arms is still as relevant today as then, I can't help but think that anybody above the age of 12 and possessing a fully-functioning cerebral cortex is already aware of the potential consequences of nuclear war (gamma burst, radiation poisoning, junk in the atmosphere, nuclear winter, death, doom, destruction, we get it already). However, I can concede on this last point that, at the time of publication, the aftermath of a full-scale nuclear war was perhaps still a pretty hot topic. And in the grand scheme, these negative points make up only a negligible fraction of this otherwise fantastic book, and do not in anyway detract from its intrinsic value or from its overall enjoyability.All in all, Cosmos is a thoroughly enthralling read that takes you on a breath-taking journey from the inception of the Universe to futures that may never be, and allows us to ponder--when considering our own epic journey from starstuff to ""assemblages of a billion billion billion atoms contemplating the evolution of atoms""--what it truly means to be human and what our place, our purpose, is in the vast expanse of ""this Cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky""."

These flaws center on either Sagan's unusual speaking style and acting(?) abilities, or the show's contents. I certainly agree that he looks stupid when displaying the ""awed"" look; however, the complaints about the content of his shows are not justified. Yes, he is short on reasons and long on visual effects, and, yes, he talks as if the viewer did not know the obvious. What we are all forgetting is this: the average person doesn't know what we would consider ""obvious"". We should realize that Carl Sagan has his work cut out for him making science digestible for the average person."

Stars borrowed from skies that I witnessed when I was eight or maybe ten and would wake up early at pre-dawn, because that was the best time for star gazing after all. To read Mr.Sagan, the words so simple describing the Universe so complex. To read a small passage and follow it up with a sleep filled with dreams of all those stars dying and being born every passing moment.To recall, days of childish innocence gazing towards the infinite.Gazing in anticipation of recognizing a constellation or an anticipated meteor shower.To pause while reading and reflect, wonder. To attempt understanding things with closed eyes.To hear back from the infinite, after all these many years. Because thoughts might after all travel through vacuum.To think what has been thought centuries ago, but not by you yet.To take a possibility, and create countless possibilities.To be curious, to question. To look at things with not just your eyes. To be looked back from an infinite distance, with your own eyes.To the journeys we could take each night, only if we gave ourselves the chance to.To Pause.To realize that this moment ephemeral as it is, and only one among a multiple of possible moments,still IS."
7,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/286151-z,5,"Let's put it simply. Cosmos is required reading for everyone who lives on this planet. It will give you a sense of perspective that nothing else can -- no lofty ideology, no omniscient religion, no inspiring quotations can explain things quite as clearly as Carl Sagan's treatise on science, reality, and the nature of things in this universe. Mind-bending and dazzling, and best of all, uncluttered by confusing scientific terminology. A book worthy of all the positive superlatives I can think of bestowing on it.We have held the peculiar notion that a person or society that is a little different from us, whoever we are, is somehow strange or bizarre, to be distrusted or loathed. Think of the negative connotations of words like alien or outlandish. And yet the monuments and cultures of each of our civilisations merely represent different ways of being human. An extraterrestrial visitor, looking at the differences among human beings and their societies, would find those differences trivial compared to the similarities. The Cosmos may be densey populated with intelligent beings. But the Darwinian lesson is clear: There will be no humans elsewhere. Only here. Only on this small planet. We are a rare as well as an endangered species. Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.- Carl Sagan, Cosmos"
8,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,4,"Carl Sagan was a good writer. For a scientist, his prose had a literary style that is enjoyable to read, and he injected a sense of philosophy into his passionate account of the origins and marvels of the cosmos. I do find that the delivery was quite heavy-handed in trying to instill that sense of awe and wonder into the reader. What made it even more so was the narrator whose intonation carries a quality of breathless resonance. The arrangement of the subject matter also seemed a bit haphazard in my view. I couldn't help comparing this book to a favourite of mine - A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson which was organised, concise, informative, and very entertaining. Regardless, Cosmos is still a good primer to read for those who are interested in learning more about the universe and our world before venturing into more recent writings from the likes of Stephen Hawkings (may he rest in peace) and Neil deGrasse Tyson."
9,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,4,"Re-visit 2016:1: The Shores of the Cosmic Ocean: After an introduction by Ann Druyan, including the benefits of the end of the Cold War, Carl Sagan opens the program with a description of the cosmos and a ""Spaceship of the Imagination"" (shaped like a dandelion seed). The ship journeys through the universes' hundred billion galaxies, the Local Group, the Andromeda Galaxy, the Milky Way, the Orion Nebula, our Solar System, and finally the planet Earth. Eratosthenes' attempt to calculate the circumference of Earth leads to a description of the ancient Library of Alexandria. Finally, the ""Ages of Science"" are described, before pulling back to the full span of the Cosmic Calendar. 2: One Voice in the Cosmic Fugue : Sagan discusses the story of the Heike crab and artificial selection of crabs resembling samurai warriors, as an opening into a larger discussion of evolution through natural selection (and the pitfalls of the theory of intelligent design). Among the topics are the development of life on the Cosmic Calendar and the Cambrian explosion; the function of DNA in growth; genetic replication, repairs, and mutation; the common biochemistry of terrestrial organisms; the creation of the molecules of life in the Miller-Urey experiment; and speculation on alien life (such as life in Jupiter's clouds). In the Cosmos Update ten years later, Sagan remarks on RNA also controlling chemical reactions and reproducing itself and the different roles of comets (potentially carrying organic molecules or causing the Cretaceous--Tertiary extinction event)This episode is worth 6* just on its ownHeaven and Hell: Sagan discusses comets and asteroids as planetary impactors, giving recent examples of the Tunguska event and a lunar impact described by Canterbury monks in 1178. It moves to a description of the environment of Venus, from the previous fantastic theories of people such as Immanuel Velikovsky to the information gained by the Venera landers and its implications for Earth's greenhouse effect. The Cosmos Update highlights the connection to global warming. 1908 Siberia Tunguska5: Blues for a red planet: The episode, devoted to the planet Mars, begins with scientific and fictional speculation about the Red Planet during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds, Edgar Rice Burroughs' science fiction books, and Percival Lowell's false vision of canals on Mars). It then moves to Robert Goddard's early experiments in rocket-building, inspired by reading science fiction, and the work by Mars probes, including the Viking, searching for life on Mars. The episode ends with the possibility of the terraforming and colonization of Mars and a Cosmos Update on the relevance of Mars' environment to Earth's and the possibility of a manned mission to Mars.6: Traveller's Tales: The journeys of the Voyager probes is put in the context of the Netherlands in the seventeenth century, with a centuries-long tradition of sailing ship explorers, and its contemporary thinks (such as Constantijn Huygens and his son Christian). Their discoveries are compared to the Voyager probes' discoveries among the Jovian and Saturn systems. In Cosmos Update, image processing reconstructs Voyager's worlds and Voyager's last portrait of the Solar System as it leaves is shown.Definitely need an up-to-date version with all that has been discovered since this was published in 1980"
10,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14475342-abubakar-mehdi,5,"“ The Cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be. Our feeblest contemplations of the Cosmos stir us - there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, of falling from a height. We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries. ”With these lines, we hop on Sagan’s ‘ship of imagination’ to visit distant worlds of Quasars, Pulsars, Black holes and Galaxies that are billions of light years away from us. A peak into the Cosmos. Sagan is a poet-scientist, he uses beautiful metaphors and aphorisms that are never too far from what an ordinary person can grasp. The style is lucid. The knowledge ranges from Mathematics to history, from ancient Greece to NASA. Building on the works of geniuses who introduced us to this fascinating, mind boggling universe of ours.After giving us a general idea of our ‘cosmic address’, Sagan moves on to Darwin and his discovery of Natural Selection as the engine of Evolution. This has to be one of the finest explanations of Darwinian Natural Selection, where Sagan uses the extra-ordinary example Heike crabs, to demonstrate the strange but beautiful ways in which ‘survival of the fittest’ is manifested. But he doesn’t keep us here for long. After giving the best possible ‘lecture’ on Evolution, he takes us further to see the harmony of the worlds. the planets and how the stars follow fixed patterns that can be mathematically explained; a most singular achievement of humans to have discovered the language of the Nature. Kepler gave us the laws of planetary motion. Laws that not just explained the elliptical orbit of Earth, but inspired a generation of mathematicians and physicists to inquire further into the nature and behaviour of the heavenly bodies.  A world so strange, complex and inaccessible has been made fascinating, understandable and rather accessible by the works of men and women who devoted their lives to Science and Cosmos. A world that is far more rich and awe-inspiring than the meagre and myth-ridden fairytales that we content ourselves with. We settle for too little. As the book progresses, Sagan’s obsession with extra-terrestrial life becomes more and more apparent. He admits that as a child, he spent hours contemplating about the possibility of intelligent life on other planets. Although our search for intelligent life has been a failure (even on Earth), Sagan aspires to make contact with the dwellers of distant worlds. The possibility of life elsewhere, is not too ‘fantastic’ altogether. As we observe the immensity of the observable universe, we can be more than certain that life does exist elsewhere but we don’t know what it will be like. Space travel and Alien Contact are not stuff of science fiction anymore but a possibility in waiting. The concluding chapters touch on two matters of colossal significance, namely Nuclear Weapons and Climate Change. These two man-made disasters are a ticking time bomb that can obliterate our species, and we have done precious little to stop them. We are destroying this planet, poisoning our oceans and destroying Specie after specie for centuries now. Man is without a doubt the most deadly predator in the history of Earth Life. And now we are on the path to self-annihilation. And this book is a wakeup call. A world ridden with ignorance and greed, will need to forego the idiotic bliss of being certain about everything. We don’t need good answers to everything, what we need instead are good questions. A good question is often times more educating than its answer. How can we love this world if we are awaiting an apocalypse, how can we love our environment and its safe keepers, the plants and the animals, without recognising that they are our distant cousins. Life, wherever it exists on this planet, is our kin. And we are bullying, butchering and asphyxiating it everywhere. What a shame !This is the kind of book that we must read and re-read. A book we must gift our children on their 12th birthdays. If you haven’t read it yet and you are over 12, do your self a favour and read it.Because Carl Sagan does more than just educate you about the wonders of Science and the Universe; he makes you fall in love with it."

13,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13631093-speranza,5,"As a child, I was fascinated and mesmerised by our world. It looked so huge, so full of wonders. Еverything was a source of marvel and inspiration. The world, the Earth, waited to be discovered and I had a long life ahead of me to do that. Then, in teenage years, I already knew all there was to know about life, people, the Earth and the Universe. Nobody could tell me any better. The new source of wonder had become love – falling in love, finding the purpose in another human being, the complete merging of body and soul.Once I entered the world of adults, I realised that I knew nothing. I strived for a higher purpose which, it turned out, was extremely hard to find in between a daily job that gives you no thrill, the same four walls you hide behind every night, and the usual faces that say the same words day in day out. The mundanity and routine that sustain a human life make it really hard to notice this same life. Wine and poetry help the cause to some extent, but they pull one out of Earth’s gravity for very short instances only.I have been at a crossroads lately, which shattered the illusive security of existence and made me anxious, itching with questions, sleepless, feeling an urge I couldn’t define. And then I started to seek answers, cosmic answers.Suddenly, it feels like a meteorite has hit my little planet. I read with eyes wide-open, with the naïveté of a toddler, with a remarkable ignorance and with an insatiable thirst to learn more. I feel like a child again! I feel in love again! I feel my senses being heightened and my pulse rushing. Carl Sagan made me feel like a scientist. For I have made a wonderful discovery - the nutrient of my little earthly life is curiosity – no step for the Cosmos, one giant leap for the cosmic speck of dust that I am.I could talk for hours about how beautiful and captivating I found Cosmos to be. It made me crave knowledge of the unknown. It made my underdeveloped imagination burst with colourful visions. It made my stunted mind race. I savoured every word, embraced every idea. I guess for someone who has read a lot on the subject I look like a newly hatched chicken, struggling to make its first steps. I have been intimidated by physics and chemistry all my life and now it is time to catch up.My gut tells me that Sagan is not right in completely rejecting astrology, the occult or religion, but I choose to trust him because he has managed to put into simple words concepts that have scared away so many people for so long. His narrative voice is the perfect combination of a bright mind and humility. It is subtle and guiding, not patronizing. It is human and it is humane – it makes you believe you can understand and dream beyond the boundaries of your own mind.Sagan was a great scientist, but I think his greatest achievement is that he made science accessible and interesting to his fellow human beings. His venture to bring the Cosmos closer to humans might eventually pay off in helping bring humans closer to the Cosmos. There is so much more I want to say, but I don’t have words for all thoughts that Cosmos provoked in me. I feel ashamed that my review of this monumental work revolves around my little nichtigkeit, but, after all, even the biggest galaxies are made of the smallest particles."
14,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/156533-rob,5,"A gorgeous book in every possible way. From the lush illustration and clever diagrams clear through to Sagan's lyrical and at times whimsical narrative, this is the science book for non-scientists. (And if you are a scientist, may this be a lesson in how to tell your story.) Sagan makes the astronomy and the math and the mind-boggling complexity of the universe not only comprehensible but palatable. He wraps up our history as a species into the history of the universe (such that we can even know it).As a kid, I adored this book for the color plates. I would flip the pages in my Dad's copy over and over and over again. Down on the floor, on the couch -- anywhere. Probably every day from ages four through seventeen. I didn't go on to be an astronomer. Hell, I never took a physics class and I nearly failed more than one math class (as I recall) but this book...Reading it cover-to-cover for the first time as an adult, I was struck by many things. The book is dense but Sagan paces it well, makes you hungry for every anecdote about Kepler or Pythagoras, thirsty for the decimal-laden scientific notation.And then there was the moment that blew my mind; tucked away in a footnote about telescopic ""snapshots"" of galaxies:...The near side of a galaxy is tens of thousands of light-years closer to us than the far side; thus we see the front as it was tens of thousands of years before the back. But typical events in galactic dynamics occupy tens of millions of years, so the error in thinking of an image of a galaxy as frozen in one moment of time is small.!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?"
15,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70913-deb,1,"This book was my bible when I was an enemy of God. As a stubbornly devout atheist, this was the book I turned to for justification of my proud and arrogant rejection of my Creator. Instead of reading this pile of conjecture, I recommend reading the Holy Bible (then get on your knees and repent before the holy God who gave you life and sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to pay the penalty for your lawlessness and sin). :-)"
16,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"Sagan explores the history and future of cosmology with wonder and foreboding in this slightly dated but insightful and still highly relevant mix of science and philosophy. He begins with the story of Eratosthenes, the first to calculate the circumference of the earth in the third century BCE. His instruments were two sticks. He placed one vertically in the ground at the summer solstice on the equator and a second 800 kilometers north. At noon the first would give no shadow but the angle of the shadow of the second would correspond to that segment of the earth. Divide the angle (7 degrees) into 360, multiply it by 800 and you are pretty close to the actual circumference. Simple but brilliant!In the 6th century BCE Thales, Anaximander, and Pythagoras began laying the foundations of modern scientific thought from astronomy to mathematics to biology. The 6th century not only produced these brilliant Ionian Greeks, but Gautama Buddha in India, Confucius and Lao-Tse in China, Zoroaster in Persia, and Pharaoh Necho in Egypt who had Africa circumnavigated 2000 years before the Portuguese. Sagan questions whether this simultaneous explosion of new ideas could really be unrelated, but doesn’t suggest an answer. Unfortunately this burst of innovative thought wouldn’t last. Sagan points to the destruction of the library at Alexandria in the fourth century CE as a final blow to learning symbolizing the beginning of the Dark Ages. It would be another 1,000 years for this ancient knowledge to be rediscovered although much would be lost forever. Sagan suggests the rise of slavery led to the demise of the Ionian scientists. Slavery obviated the need for technology and set up the need for clear lines of demarcation of class to justify it. Thus working with the hands, engaging in ungentlemanly activity was wrong. Religion was employed to rationalize the institution. Today we are familiar with a more recent example, the antebellum South which failed to industrialize due to its reliance on slavery and ended up falling far behind the North.Sagan covers the 16th and 17th century contributions of Copernicus, Brahe, Kepler, and Newton. Then he skips to the 1970’s discussing the Voyager missions, exploration of the solar system and the prospects for finding life. He presents the then current ideas on the nature of the universe discussing stars, space, time and the exploration of the galaxy. Sagan is particularly focused on the use of radio astronomy not only to identify far flung civilizations but to contact them. Cosmos was written before string theory, the multiverse, supersymmetry, dark matter, dark energy and the Higgs boson became hot topics. Still his discussion holds up well. Sagan is enamored with interacting with other civilizations. I am not sure this is a good idea but danger from aliens seems far less likely than danger from our fellow man. In trying to calculate the number of advanced civilizations in the universe, a key factor is how long a civilization can last before it destroys itself. We have only very recently gotten to the point where we can reach out to other worlds and between climate change, nuclear war, and other self-destructive behavior our future is clearly tenuous. Sagan takes this worry very seriously and persuades me to as well. Perhaps our search for intelligent life on other worlds has borne no fruit because intelligent life is a misnomer. "

The surface of the Earth is the shore of the cosmic ocean. On this shore, we've learned most of what we know. Recently, we've waded a little way out, maybe ankle-deep, and the water seems inviting. Some part of our being knows this is where we came from.We long to returnand we can .because the cosmos is also within us. We're made of starstuff 
i don't think i'll ever give 5 stars more wholeheartedly as i am doing now ..5 shimmering , eye-blindingly shinning stars , the brightest suns GR has in its this little galaxy should be owned by this book , cosmos .its really shocking that only days ago i didnt know who carl sagan is . The name may have seemed a bit familiar , but nothing more Now , this name feels too meaningful , i'd remember this man's words , his deep voice discussing the formations of the stars and their decay and deaths , i'd surly remember the passion in his eyes in the parallel Cosmos TV show , the way he pronounces Billions and Billions stressing on the B or the way he says  ""we are made of starstuff"" with too much longing . I LOVED THIS BOOK  it maybe mainstream and often said but i dont know how to phrase what i feel about it any other way , seems its beyond my ability of putting things into coherent sentences .it was Beautiful  in every mean , i wish now that i have saved every beautiful i've ever used , ever said , so that when i call this peace of heaven beautiful you would get what i am saying ..quoting from the same book , cosmos is :
""visually and musically stunning, and to engage the heart as well as the mind""
Carl Sagan , an astronomer, a cosmologist and a writer. a brilliant man . the way he uses words , it doesnt feel decorated , these words are written too honestly , the passions and ambitions of a man ,once a child inlove with science-fiction as we all are , scriped in papers .I feel too ashamed that i am 22 years living in this world and its only now that i read this book , Cosmos wasn't only about astronomy , but philosophy , biology and a big deal of history all written very beautifully you will enjoy every bit , i started to love radio waves , Phythagorean laws and things of this sort that i may have considered dry and lifeless in my school years . its hard to believe that this is written in the eighties of the last century , may be so much had changed , maybe some stuff here and there are not up to date but its is still a big source of inspiration . The question about extraterrestial life remains a puzzle , but exploring the problem is a fascinating journey in itself .I am not an expert on natural science , a mere starter , but it was easy for me to read , so i think carl sagan's books are gems of some sort , they are the bridge between scientists and common people , they are written for us , we who love the stars and crave to understand them yet we are no scientists or experts our selves . and generally expertise in the subject matter is not required to enjoy it , as the love of it shall demonstrates. I am officaily recommending this book for every human being , its a thing every soul should read .i wish i can buy enough copies for the human race and shove them down their doors . 
""Finally, at the end of all our wanderings, we return to our tiny, fragile, blue-white world, lost in a cosmic ocean vast beyond our most courageous imaginings. It is a world among an immensity of others. It may be significant only for us. The Earth is our home, our parent. Our kind of life arose and evolved here. The human species is coming of age here. It is on this world that we developed our passion for exploring the Cosmos, and it is here that we are, in some pain and with no guarantees, working out our destiny """"There will be no humans elsewhere. Only here. Only on this small planet. We are a rare as well as an endangered species. Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another""
Warning ! : dont you ever miss meeting the deep voice narrating to you the story of the cosmos , watch the TV show , meet carl sagan , I'll put links for the 13 episodes downwards .Advice : read the book with some cosmic music , it will feel magical and out of the world .The TV show episodes:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ9mz...i've read it as an ebook copy and i think half the book is marked blue , its just too charming you would want to remember every word , now i have my pockets full of fascinating quotes . and these are some i couldn't resist including in the review :* They remind us that humans have evolved to wonder, that understanding is a joy, that knowledge is prerequisite to survival. I believe our future depends on how well we know this Cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky*We are like butterflies who flutter for a day and think it is forever*Those explorations required skepticism and imagination both. Imagination will often carry us to worlds that never were. But without it, we go nowhere. Skepticism enables us to distinguish fancy from fact, to test our speculations*The Earth is a place. It is by no means the only place. It is not even a typical place. No planet or star or galaxy can be typical, because the Cosmos is mostly empty. The only typical place is within the vast, cold, universal vacuum, the everlasting night of intergalactic space, a place so strange and desolate that, by comparison, planets and stars and galaxies seem achingly rare and lovely. If we were randomly inserted into the Cosmos, the chance that we would find ourselves on or near a planet would be less than one in a billion trillion trillion* (1033, a one followed by 33 zeroes). In everyday life such odds are called compelling. Worlds are precious*Each star system is an island in space, quarantined from its neighbors by the light- years. I can imagine creatures evolving into glimmerings of knowledge on innumerable worlds, every one of them assuming at first their puny planet and paltry few suns to be all that is. We grow up in isolation. Only slowly do we teach ourselves the Cosmos*Welcome to the planet Earth - a place of blue nitrogen skies, oceans of liquid water, cool forests and soft meadows, a world positively rippling with life. In the cosmic perspective it is, as I have said, poignantly beautiful and rare; but it is also, for the moment, unique*The study of the heavens brought Ptolemy a kind of ecstasy. ‘ Mortal as I am,’ he wrote, ‘ I know that I am born for a day. But when I follow at my pleasure the serried multitude of the stars in their circular course, my feet no longer touch the Earth. . *With this symphony of voices man can play through the eternity of time in less than an hour, and can taste in small measure the delight of God, the Supreme Artist . . . I yield freely to the sacred frenzy . . . the die is cast, and I am writing the book - to be read either now or by posterity, it matters not. It can wait a century for a reader, as God Himself has waited 6,000 years for a witness*With searing heat, crushing pressures, noxious gases and everything suffused in an eerie, reddish glow, Venus seems less the goddess of love than the incarnation of hell*All that matters is the evidence, and the evidence is not yet in.*The Earth is a tiny and fragile world. It needs to be cherished*there are regularities in Nature that permit its secrets to be uncovered. Nature is not entirely unpredictable; there are rules even she must obey. This ordered and admirable character of the universe was called Cosmos*Traveling close to the speed of light is a kind of elixir of life. Because time slows down close to the speed of light, special relativity provides us with a means of going to the stars*A star is a phoenix, destined to rise for a time from its own ashes*Our passion for learning, evident in the behavior of every toddler, is the tool for our survival*Books permit us to voyage through time, to tap the wisdom of our ancestors. The library connects us with the insights and knowledge, painfully extracted from Nature, of the greatest minds that ever were, with the best teachers, drawn from the entire planet and from all of our history, to instruct us without tiring, and to inspire us to make our own contribution to the collective knowledge of the human species*The choice is stark and ironic. The same rocket boosters used to launch probes to the planets are poised to send nuclear warheads to the nations. The radioactive power sources on Viking and Voyager derive from the same technology that makes nuclear weapons. The radio and radar techniques employed to track and guide ballistic missiles and defend against attack are also used to monitor and command the spacecraft on the planets and to listen for signals from civilizations near other stars. If we use these technologies to destroy ourselves, we surely will venture no more to the planets and the stars. But the converse is also true. If we continue to the planets and the stars, our chauvinisms will be shaken further. We will gain a cosmic perspective. We will recognize that our explorations can be carried out only on behalf of all the people of the planet Earth"
19,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33085883-benjamin-or-so-they-say,5,"This is the closest I have ever been to love.This book is not only a huge source of knowledge for those looking forward to getting enthralled into the science of cosmos, but also one that I know has a special meaning for some people out there. Both of the before mentioned apply to me, but why do I say it has a special meaning? Well, as simple as it may sound, this book was what took me to where I am right now. There has always been magic for me. As a kid, I always believed in everything everyone else seemed to despise and so it was my faith that my parents even got to think that I was crazy.First, there were these magical creatures: faeries, mermaids, goblins, wizards, etc. Then something even better and more magical came to my life: science. Now you may be thinking, okay, but science is a wide subject, what part of science? And I will answer you: why do I have to choose from it when I can learn from all of it? That’s something taught me. Science is connected to everything in ways that some of us have never imagined. If we talk about science, we must think of it as the most important discovery in the history of humanity, of art, religion, music, and beauty in its fullest expression. One can’t live without the other, they are the things that give form and purpose to our existence. Since I find myself unfit to give a decent critic to the book (not because I lack knowledge but for the role, it played and keeps playing in my life), I’m going to invite you to think a little bit.Imagine yourself as a 6-year old kid. You are in the countryside, separated from any sound or human contact, and the only light is the one that comes from the starts you are currently watching. You feel happy about your loneliness. You don’t know anything about the matter and yet you have a feeling that there’s some magic in the sky, some kind of spell written in it. Suddenly the stars are passing by, leaving a blur of light on their tray and you wonder how some stars can move and fall while others keep doing their job, brightening everything around you. You run to the house at the other side of the camp, and turn to see the stars again, they are still there, the same stars every day, you are scared because you don’t understand and that makes you feel uneasy. You go to sleep. Next morning you wake up and go directly to the nearest library, you ask for books of stars, but the librarian tells you she has none and instead she gives you a physics, religion and art books, what a disappointment you think. You see the pictures and read as much as you can, it isn’t an easy task, though, you have barely learned to read. The hours passed by, and by the end of the day, you realized how much you have learned, not only about physics and stars but also about religion, math, and arts. It’s then when you as a 6-years old kid find the most valuable treasure when you were only looking to understand the stars. As I said before, there is no way of reviewing this book correctly."
20,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1938805-brian,5,"This is one of those kind of books that comes along every few years that is so fantastic that you purposely drag out reading it in order to savor its awesomeness. It doesn't matter that it was written 25+ years ago, pre-Hubble telescope, before the fall of the USSR, etc. - Sagan's insight and wide-reaching scope are timeless.The last few chapters are so rich in thought-provoking information they are worth re-reading. Sagan would have never wanted his work to become the foundation of a religion, but I can see why so many people refer to this as their ""bible"" and use it to help make sense out of a mad world and one's short time to inhabit it."

This is one of the best popular scientific books that I have read. This book is well written, reads like a mystery novel and is a great source of interesting information. Scientific information is explained in ""simple reader"" language.The focus in this book is on astronomy : how big is our universe, how old it is, how it ""works"", etc. Sagan pays a lot of attention to stars and galaxies, but also presents the more advanced topics of black holes and pulsars. There are also occasional earthly detours - evolution of life on earth, ancient greeks, the library of Alexandria, voyages of explorers, etc. The book also tries to bring up some philosophical questions, especially in relation to the possibility of other civilizations in the cosmos, and how a contact between us and them would happen.Highly recommendation!===================

This book is really very impressive. A story of 15 billion years of the cosmos compressed in this relatively smaller book! Easy to read and understand, Carl Sagan's Cosmos draws the reader into a world so vivid and realistic that it's hard not to be mesmerized throughout while reading this book."
24,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13070326-heather-k-dentist-in-my-spare-time,3," I wish I had LOVED this book as Carl Sagan is an icon. It was entertaining, if you ignore the fact that it is VERY dated (I mean, 40+ years dated), which is not its fault. However, I much prefer A Short History of Nearly Everything for a review of the same information. "
25,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,5,"Cosmos operates at a massive scale worthy of its lofty title. Carl Sagan, in a companion compendium to his 13-part 1980 TV series of the same name, explains what we know about the universe and the progression of human thought about origins and the nature of reality. We zoom across frames of reference, from the actions of atoms and subatomic particles, to the molecules that store genetic information, to life on this planet, and beyond, to the structure of the universe. We learn about the various explorations of Mars, Venus, Io and Europa, and how we might travel to stars in the future. Along the way, Sagan explains not just what we know, but how we know it, and the fascinating stories of how that information was discovered: often by brilliance or persistence, and sometimes by historical accident or sheer luck. His enthusiasm is readily apparent: infectious and infused with a positive vision for the world and the future. One can only wish that more people on Earth shared Sagan's perspective.The book is punctuated with quotes from various myths of the universe's origins, which serve to remind us how important these questions have always been, but also how poorly equipped we are to access answers through intuition alone. It is the scientific method that has allowed us to cumulatively add new knowledge. He quotes Seneca, from the first century CE: ""There will come a time when our descendants will be amazed that we did not know things that are so plain to them... Many discoveries are reserved for ages still to come, when memory of us will have been effaced. Our universe is a sorry little affair unless it has in it something for every age to investigate... Nature does not reveal her mysteries once and for all."" Seneca saw clearly, and Sagan shares the stories of thinkers like Pythagoras, Aristarchus, Eratosthenes, Copernicus, Kepler, Huygens, Newton and Einstein and the various contributions they made to our modern understanding.I listened to the audio version, read by LeVar Burton, which is fantastic. I then picked up my physical copy to re-read the quotes and footnotes and see the included charts and illustrations. I highly recommend this for everyone... even if you have a strong understanding of science, it is worth it just to hear Sagan's brilliant and beautifully crafted explanations."
26,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36595208-n-rmin,5,"It took me long to read it, but it was worth it. First thing that captivates me that despite being a nonfiction scientific book, Carl Sagan described the whole universe, explained the science in such a poetic and eloquent way that you would think he is a romantic poet! And the parts about his childhood and his enthusiasm for astronomy, for cosmos were the cutest and beautiful thing I have ever read. I saw myself, my passion for space in him, in his writings. And best part of this book was the incredible ideas that can belong to a sci-fi writer! I even took notes from this ideas so maybe I can use them in my future writings. Carl Sagan became my favorite person in science))) And this book will be forever my favorite and I am sure I will read it again and again and also recommend it as a teacher)) And these are my favorite quotes:“The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.” “What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.""“we make our world significant by the courage of our questions and the depth of our answers”"

28,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"When do we truly die ? The most logical answer would be to say that we die when the last breath escapes us and when our body and mind cease to function. But I tend to differ , death would be the loss of fascination and wonderment at the world around us. To wake up and see the sun rise everyday, to listen to birdsong in the mornings and see the blue sky above you, to feel the rain lashing at you and at times caressing you with its softness, the gentle breeze of the evenings, the feel of the sea waves beneath your toes....this is life ! And when a time arrives during which none of this can be felt with the same sense of wanton bliss, I shall call it death. If ever there arises a world like Cormac McCarthy's The Road envisaged, I would go insane in a couple of days at the most ! This digression is very much in line with Carl Sagan's work for he speaks to us about our home : Earth. His voice is one of clear reason and indefatigable energy that I was filled with a sense of elation to say the least. You hold his hand and walk with him, a kid who for the first time stepped into a science class with eyes as wide and big as glass marbles ! Even when he tells you that you are nothing but an insignificant speck of dust in the order of things in the galaxy, he continues to say  But look around you, isn't the Earth the most beautiful thing you ever saw ?  Sagan conducts a virtual tour through the history of human civilizations, astronomy, the rise of science, interstellar and interplanetary travel and also ponders for a chapter on the perceived nature of extra terrestrial intelligence. What makes it marvelous reading ? One word : Simplicity ! He never writes a word that a common man needs to break his head over. Yes, there are graphical representations and equations galore in the book but even if you skip them and keep reading you will not be at a loss. Things are kept to the simplest way possible, a spade is called a spade and there are no unnecessary theatrics. I have not seen the TV series that inspired this book but am surely going to go in search of it ! Recommended for those with a love for nature and science."
29,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45702383-a-l-buehrer,2," Let me just say this, I love science as much as anybody else, but I can love it without getting weird about it.  I guess I was expecting this book to be something it wasn't. It's really just a humanist philosophy book. I was expecting to learn something. I read science books to stretch my mind, not to be preached at. This was the preachiest science book I have ever read. Carl Sagan obviously literally worships science. This book was really just a hymn to science, not really delving into any particular part of it enough to really be interesting. I was disappointed enough in Sagan's writing to seriously consider taking ""The Pale Blue Dot"" off my reading list. His tone is so condescending. I decided to read it anyway. Just to give him a second chance. I'm just saying, he's not making my favorite authors list by any means. "

31,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13266158-samadrita,5,"I wonder what Carl Sagan may have thought of 9/11 and the world in the new millennium, a strife-torn place which is being shaken up and shaken out every moment. I imagine the civil but slightly horrified and slightly bemused tone he may have employed while talking about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and the antics of the Bush administration which have become such excellent fodder for stand up comedians the world over. And I can almost detect the note of boyish enthusiasm in his voice while he may have spoken of the Higgs Boson and explained the reasons behind the incorrect observation readings of the 'neutrinos being speedier than light particles' experiment that had made the headlines a few years ago.I can only imagine because he wasn't there to witness these watershed events and he isn't here to offer comment, criticism or share his inexhaustible repository of knowledge with us any longer. His time in the Cosmos had run out within two decades of the publication of this work - a testament to his own belief in the staggering inferiority of our evanescent lifetimes in the scheme of the universe(s). 
""Our familiar universe of galaxies and stars, planets and people, would be a single elementary particle in the next universe up, the first step of another infinite regress.""
It would be nice if I could summarize each one of the 13 chapters of 'Cosmos' and give readers the lowdown on our painstakingly slow but rewarding crawl through the fabric of space and time, the civilizational hurdle race towards a finish line which we can neither begin to envision nor fully comprehend yet. I could write a review in the conventional format, leaving you with a gentle nudge to read this book as soon as you can.Or, instead, I could simply write about how, despite being more than 30 years outdated, Carl Sagan's voice of reason rings truer than ever, cutting through the heart of all the din and chaos of our troubled times. I could just tell you how Sagan's deep and abiding love for nature and humanity reverberates in every page of this work and how our scientific endeavours across timelines and geographical boundaries, across the unending void which surrounds us on all sides, symbolize our collective pursuit of knowledge.
""There is no other species on Earth that does science. It is, so far, entirely a human invention, evolved by natural selection in the cerebral cortex for one simple reason: it works. It is not perfect. It can be misused. It is only a tool. But it is by far the best tool we have, self-correcting, ongoing, applicable to everything. It has two rules. First: there are no sacred truths; all assumptions must be critically examined; arguments from authority are worthless. Second: whatever is inconsistent with the facts must be discarded or revised.""
The Cold War is a now defunct appendage of our history, the Soviet Union is no more, America has achieved a milestone in its race relations by welcoming its first African American President. But turmoil in the world order persists - the nuclear arms race between the Americans and the Soviets has been replaced by a newer dance of dominance in the Asia Pacific region. The world is as much embroiled in a mesh of steadily growing list of challenges as it was in the past, if not more. Preposterous decrees issued by fanatical outfits, blatant human rights violations, infringement on freedom of speech and expression, diplomatic arm-wrestling, the ever-enthusiastic decriers of science, 'War on Women', the shouts of the global-warming deniers reign supreme still. The players may have changed faces but the game of petty one-upmanship in the arena of global politics still continues unabated.Which is why Sagan's rousing call for all of mankind to unite under the identity of citizens of the Cosmos and not as citizens of a nation moves me to the core of my being. His recapitulation of our scientific advancements achieved against the tide of adverse circumstances, of the victories won in the face of persecution by religious authority, impresses upon us a sense of urgency - that with the exponential increase in the defense budgets of the global powers, the incentive given to the greatest minds of our times to devote time and energy to unraveling the mysteries of the Cosmos is reduced. As the concept of 'nuclear deterrence' receives a pat on the back, the global arms sales numbers continuing to soar despite hollow promises of arms control, more and more scientists are being engaged in improving weapons technology rather than validating the fact of our existence against the intimidating presence of the stars, galaxies and universes. The NASA budget cuts of recent times are proof of this ignominy.Is it to this end that the ancient advanced cities like Alexandria, the destroyed civilizations of Ionia and the Aztecs and pioneers such as Eratosthenes, Democritus, Aristarchus, Hypatia, Leonardo da Vinci, Copernicus, Galileo, Johannes Kepler, Tycho Brahe, Christiaan Huygens, Issac Newton and Albert Einstein worked tirelessly for? To further intensify mutual national antagonism and increase our probability of complete self-annihilation?Sagan thinks not.
""Our loyalties are to the species and the planet. We speak for the Earth. Our obligation to survive is owed not just to ourselves but also to that Cosmos, ancient and vast, from which we spring.""
 This is why I can't help but agree quite heartily with someone who says 'If I had a religion, I would be a Carl Saganian.'
""If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.""
If there is only one worldly diktat we must abide by with unquestioning faith, let it be this one."
32,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3593962-kalliope,5,"The Star system in GR is absolutely inadequate for rating this book. Gosh, I should not use the term ‘absolutely’ for something in which everything orbits around relativity.Anyway, I think something like this would give a better idea of my opinion about this book: my rating is an universe of zillions to the power of zillions of stars, …and expanding. My rating:What a brilliant read this has been. I have read it very slowly; one chapter a week. But what are thirteen weeks in relation to cosmic time? I have also read it in parallel to watching the DVD programs. What a treat this has been to have Carl Sagan in the little and measurable and limited space of my living room, bringing home and explaining to me, the immensity of all that space and dust and gas and light and fire and immeasurable time.Sagan’s mind is truly cosmic, in scope and in outlook. We accompany him as he pulls together history, with the pre-Socratic, the Alexandrians, Leonardo, Kepler and Tycho Brahe, Huygens, Einstein, with the basics of biology and chemistry and physics and astronomy. I particularly liked his explanation of the effects of Relativity on the light spectrum on board of an Italian Vespa, in a true Pasolini manner. I smiled at the candid StarTreckish nave from which we travel through his half-observed-half-fictional universe. I gasped to see he was using a touch screen to navigate his craft, realizing this would have seemed so fancy back in the early 1980s when Sagan’s program and book were all the rage, and which for us is now so irritatingly ubiquitous.I loved his survey of the Lives of Stars and his anecdote of his first trip to the library as a kid, when upon his request for a book on stars the Librarian gave him a book on Hollywood actors and actresses. Startling are also the simulations in the film version of the encounter of various objects and any given galaxy. Unforgettable.The contents are primarily a laudable exposition of what he calls the language of the universe--the language of science--, which he deciphers as if he were handling a Rosetta stone of multiple dimensions. But a running argument, and I suspect one motivation behind this wondrous book and program, is his deeply human and humane quest to undo our main enemies: superstition and violence.Produced during the Cold War, the book seems a mission launched to make us aware of our origins and our circumstances and increase our awareness of the possibilities of self-destruction. His work is an epic from a savior with a cosmic projection.But the most precious impression I have gathered in this reading is a reminder of how infinitesimally small I am and the inconsequence of my being. But also how, in spite of my own insignificance, how lucky I am to be one more specimen of this wondrous phenomenon of evolution through which a conscience is formed in a strange and extraordinary combination of a few natural elements.Rather than depressing, I have found this thought heartening. A reminder that I have to enjoy it while it lasts.Which means to keep reading books and bask in the knowledge transmitted to me through this wonderful medium, invented by us. Sagan after all begins and ends his account with the Alexandrian Library.He understood."

But upon recently reading this book for the first time (which may seem a bit belated, but I am, after all, only 23) it instantly became one of my favorites, a status not easily attained by any book, and so I feel compelled to say something, to expound upon its many virtues and why it has endeared itself to me so completely.""One glance at [a book:] and you hear the voice of another person--perhaps someone dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, the author is speaking, clearly and silently, inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people, citizens of distant epochs, who never knew one another. Books break the shackles of time.""Perhaps prophetically, this is exactly the effect the late great Dr. Sagan acheived with this book. Through the power and fluid elegance of his prose, while reading Cosmos I could almost hear that familiar and somehow majestic voice (which in large part, I believe, made the PBS miniseries of the same name so wholly entrancing), as if the two of us were old friends having a leisurely, albeit profoundly intellectual, chat over coffee. Not exactly what one might expect from a book largely concerned with science, but this is just one of many qualities that makes it not only endearing to the reader, but also--and perhaps more importantly--accessible, making even the smattering of complex equations seem casual and undaunting.Aside from the beauty of its prose, which is at times poetic in its depth and its eloquence, Cosmos is also wholly engaging and fascinating in the depth and scope of its subects. Sagan succinctly and expertly covers everything from the birth of stars to the birth of science, the origins of life on Earth to the possibility of life on other planets, and our far distant and recent (in the grand cosmic scheme of things) past to the possibilities for our distant future. And yes, because science is constantly evolving and, as Dr. Sagan states, self-correcting, some of the information and theories covered may now be outdated, but I still believe that Cosmos is well worth reading. Not only can it serve as a friendly, accessible, and engrossing jumping-off point for we common folk who are interested in delving deeper into science but may feel a bit intimidated, it is also, if nothing else, worth reading for the beautifully poignant and evocative insights and the oft-philosophical tidbits contained therein.""We are the local embodiment of the Cosmos grown to self-awareness. We have begun to contemplate our origins: starstuff pondering the stars....""My only complaints about Cosmos are these: the last two or three chapters lag just a bit, incorporating several topics that seem extraneous and unnecessary, and somewhat lose the smooth, easy flow present throughout the rest of the book; and though I feel that, in the current world political climate, the section discussing nuclear arms is still as relevant today as then, I can't help but think that anybody above the age of 12 and possessing a fully-functioning cerebral cortex is already aware of the potential consequences of nuclear war (gamma burst, radiation poisoning, junk in the atmosphere, nuclear winter, death, doom, destruction, we get it already). However, I can concede on this last point that, at the time of publication, the aftermath of a full-scale nuclear war was perhaps still a pretty hot topic. And in the grand scheme, these negative points make up only a negligible fraction of this otherwise fantastic book, and do not in anyway detract from its intrinsic value or from its overall enjoyability.All in all, Cosmos is a thoroughly enthralling read that takes you on a breath-taking journey from the inception of the Universe to futures that may never be, and allows us to ponder--when considering our own epic journey from starstuff to ""assemblages of a billion billion billion atoms contemplating the evolution of atoms""--what it truly means to be human and what our place, our purpose, is in the vast expanse of ""this Cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky""."

These flaws center on either Sagan's unusual speaking style and acting(?) abilities, or the show's contents. I certainly agree that he looks stupid when displaying the ""awed"" look; however, the complaints about the content of his shows are not justified. Yes, he is short on reasons and long on visual effects, and, yes, he talks as if the viewer did not know the obvious. What we are all forgetting is this: the average person doesn't know what we would consider ""obvious"". We should realize that Carl Sagan has his work cut out for him making science digestible for the average person."

Stars borrowed from skies that I witnessed when I was eight or maybe ten and would wake up early at pre-dawn, because that was the best time for star gazing after all. To read Mr.Sagan, the words so simple describing the Universe so complex. To read a small passage and follow it up with a sleep filled with dreams of all those stars dying and being born every passing moment.To recall, days of childish innocence gazing towards the infinite.Gazing in anticipation of recognizing a constellation or an anticipated meteor shower.To pause while reading and reflect, wonder. To attempt understanding things with closed eyes.To hear back from the infinite, after all these many years. Because thoughts might after all travel through vacuum.To think what has been thought centuries ago, but not by you yet.To take a possibility, and create countless possibilities.To be curious, to question. To look at things with not just your eyes. To be looked back from an infinite distance, with your own eyes.To the journeys we could take each night, only if we gave ourselves the chance to.To Pause.To realize that this moment ephemeral as it is, and only one among a multiple of possible moments,still IS."
37,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/286151-z,5,"Let's put it simply. Cosmos is required reading for everyone who lives on this planet. It will give you a sense of perspective that nothing else can -- no lofty ideology, no omniscient religion, no inspiring quotations can explain things quite as clearly as Carl Sagan's treatise on science, reality, and the nature of things in this universe. Mind-bending and dazzling, and best of all, uncluttered by confusing scientific terminology. A book worthy of all the positive superlatives I can think of bestowing on it.We have held the peculiar notion that a person or society that is a little different from us, whoever we are, is somehow strange or bizarre, to be distrusted or loathed. Think of the negative connotations of words like alien or outlandish. And yet the monuments and cultures of each of our civilisations merely represent different ways of being human. An extraterrestrial visitor, looking at the differences among human beings and their societies, would find those differences trivial compared to the similarities. The Cosmos may be densey populated with intelligent beings. But the Darwinian lesson is clear: There will be no humans elsewhere. Only here. Only on this small planet. We are a rare as well as an endangered species. Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.- Carl Sagan, Cosmos"
38,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,4,"Carl Sagan was a good writer. For a scientist, his prose had a literary style that is enjoyable to read, and he injected a sense of philosophy into his passionate account of the origins and marvels of the cosmos. I do find that the delivery was quite heavy-handed in trying to instill that sense of awe and wonder into the reader. What made it even more so was the narrator whose intonation carries a quality of breathless resonance. The arrangement of the subject matter also seemed a bit haphazard in my view. I couldn't help comparing this book to a favourite of mine - A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson which was organised, concise, informative, and very entertaining. Regardless, Cosmos is still a good primer to read for those who are interested in learning more about the universe and our world before venturing into more recent writings from the likes of Stephen Hawkings (may he rest in peace) and Neil deGrasse Tyson."
39,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,4,"Re-visit 2016:1: The Shores of the Cosmic Ocean: After an introduction by Ann Druyan, including the benefits of the end of the Cold War, Carl Sagan opens the program with a description of the cosmos and a ""Spaceship of the Imagination"" (shaped like a dandelion seed). The ship journeys through the universes' hundred billion galaxies, the Local Group, the Andromeda Galaxy, the Milky Way, the Orion Nebula, our Solar System, and finally the planet Earth. Eratosthenes' attempt to calculate the circumference of Earth leads to a description of the ancient Library of Alexandria. Finally, the ""Ages of Science"" are described, before pulling back to the full span of the Cosmic Calendar. 2: One Voice in the Cosmic Fugue : Sagan discusses the story of the Heike crab and artificial selection of crabs resembling samurai warriors, as an opening into a larger discussion of evolution through natural selection (and the pitfalls of the theory of intelligent design). Among the topics are the development of life on the Cosmic Calendar and the Cambrian explosion; the function of DNA in growth; genetic replication, repairs, and mutation; the common biochemistry of terrestrial organisms; the creation of the molecules of life in the Miller-Urey experiment; and speculation on alien life (such as life in Jupiter's clouds). In the Cosmos Update ten years later, Sagan remarks on RNA also controlling chemical reactions and reproducing itself and the different roles of comets (potentially carrying organic molecules or causing the Cretaceous--Tertiary extinction event)This episode is worth 6* just on its ownHeaven and Hell: Sagan discusses comets and asteroids as planetary impactors, giving recent examples of the Tunguska event and a lunar impact described by Canterbury monks in 1178. It moves to a description of the environment of Venus, from the previous fantastic theories of people such as Immanuel Velikovsky to the information gained by the Venera landers and its implications for Earth's greenhouse effect. The Cosmos Update highlights the connection to global warming. 1908 Siberia Tunguska5: Blues for a red planet: The episode, devoted to the planet Mars, begins with scientific and fictional speculation about the Red Planet during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds, Edgar Rice Burroughs' science fiction books, and Percival Lowell's false vision of canals on Mars). It then moves to Robert Goddard's early experiments in rocket-building, inspired by reading science fiction, and the work by Mars probes, including the Viking, searching for life on Mars. The episode ends with the possibility of the terraforming and colonization of Mars and a Cosmos Update on the relevance of Mars' environment to Earth's and the possibility of a manned mission to Mars.6: Traveller's Tales: The journeys of the Voyager probes is put in the context of the Netherlands in the seventeenth century, with a centuries-long tradition of sailing ship explorers, and its contemporary thinks (such as Constantijn Huygens and his son Christian). Their discoveries are compared to the Voyager probes' discoveries among the Jovian and Saturn systems. In Cosmos Update, image processing reconstructs Voyager's worlds and Voyager's last portrait of the Solar System as it leaves is shown.Definitely need an up-to-date version with all that has been discovered since this was published in 1980"
40,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14475342-abubakar-mehdi,5,"“ The Cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be. Our feeblest contemplations of the Cosmos stir us - there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, of falling from a height. We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries. ”With these lines, we hop on Sagan’s ‘ship of imagination’ to visit distant worlds of Quasars, Pulsars, Black holes and Galaxies that are billions of light years away from us. A peak into the Cosmos. Sagan is a poet-scientist, he uses beautiful metaphors and aphorisms that are never too far from what an ordinary person can grasp. The style is lucid. The knowledge ranges from Mathematics to history, from ancient Greece to NASA. Building on the works of geniuses who introduced us to this fascinating, mind boggling universe of ours.After giving us a general idea of our ‘cosmic address’, Sagan moves on to Darwin and his discovery of Natural Selection as the engine of Evolution. This has to be one of the finest explanations of Darwinian Natural Selection, where Sagan uses the extra-ordinary example Heike crabs, to demonstrate the strange but beautiful ways in which ‘survival of the fittest’ is manifested. But he doesn’t keep us here for long. After giving the best possible ‘lecture’ on Evolution, he takes us further to see the harmony of the worlds. the planets and how the stars follow fixed patterns that can be mathematically explained; a most singular achievement of humans to have discovered the language of the Nature. Kepler gave us the laws of planetary motion. Laws that not just explained the elliptical orbit of Earth, but inspired a generation of mathematicians and physicists to inquire further into the nature and behaviour of the heavenly bodies.  A world so strange, complex and inaccessible has been made fascinating, understandable and rather accessible by the works of men and women who devoted their lives to Science and Cosmos. A world that is far more rich and awe-inspiring than the meagre and myth-ridden fairytales that we content ourselves with. We settle for too little. As the book progresses, Sagan’s obsession with extra-terrestrial life becomes more and more apparent. He admits that as a child, he spent hours contemplating about the possibility of intelligent life on other planets. Although our search for intelligent life has been a failure (even on Earth), Sagan aspires to make contact with the dwellers of distant worlds. The possibility of life elsewhere, is not too ‘fantastic’ altogether. As we observe the immensity of the observable universe, we can be more than certain that life does exist elsewhere but we don’t know what it will be like. Space travel and Alien Contact are not stuff of science fiction anymore but a possibility in waiting. The concluding chapters touch on two matters of colossal significance, namely Nuclear Weapons and Climate Change. These two man-made disasters are a ticking time bomb that can obliterate our species, and we have done precious little to stop them. We are destroying this planet, poisoning our oceans and destroying Specie after specie for centuries now. Man is without a doubt the most deadly predator in the history of Earth Life. And now we are on the path to self-annihilation. And this book is a wakeup call. A world ridden with ignorance and greed, will need to forego the idiotic bliss of being certain about everything. We don’t need good answers to everything, what we need instead are good questions. A good question is often times more educating than its answer. How can we love this world if we are awaiting an apocalypse, how can we love our environment and its safe keepers, the plants and the animals, without recognising that they are our distant cousins. Life, wherever it exists on this planet, is our kin. And we are bullying, butchering and asphyxiating it everywhere. What a shame !This is the kind of book that we must read and re-read. A book we must gift our children on their 12th birthdays. If you haven’t read it yet and you are over 12, do your self a favour and read it.Because Carl Sagan does more than just educate you about the wonders of Science and the Universe; he makes you fall in love with it."

43,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13631093-speranza,5,"As a child, I was fascinated and mesmerised by our world. It looked so huge, so full of wonders. Еverything was a source of marvel and inspiration. The world, the Earth, waited to be discovered and I had a long life ahead of me to do that. Then, in teenage years, I already knew all there was to know about life, people, the Earth and the Universe. Nobody could tell me any better. The new source of wonder had become love – falling in love, finding the purpose in another human being, the complete merging of body and soul.Once I entered the world of adults, I realised that I knew nothing. I strived for a higher purpose which, it turned out, was extremely hard to find in between a daily job that gives you no thrill, the same four walls you hide behind every night, and the usual faces that say the same words day in day out. The mundanity and routine that sustain a human life make it really hard to notice this same life. Wine and poetry help the cause to some extent, but they pull one out of Earth’s gravity for very short instances only.I have been at a crossroads lately, which shattered the illusive security of existence and made me anxious, itching with questions, sleepless, feeling an urge I couldn’t define. And then I started to seek answers, cosmic answers.Suddenly, it feels like a meteorite has hit my little planet. I read with eyes wide-open, with the naïveté of a toddler, with a remarkable ignorance and with an insatiable thirst to learn more. I feel like a child again! I feel in love again! I feel my senses being heightened and my pulse rushing. Carl Sagan made me feel like a scientist. For I have made a wonderful discovery - the nutrient of my little earthly life is curiosity – no step for the Cosmos, one giant leap for the cosmic speck of dust that I am.I could talk for hours about how beautiful and captivating I found Cosmos to be. It made me crave knowledge of the unknown. It made my underdeveloped imagination burst with colourful visions. It made my stunted mind race. I savoured every word, embraced every idea. I guess for someone who has read a lot on the subject I look like a newly hatched chicken, struggling to make its first steps. I have been intimidated by physics and chemistry all my life and now it is time to catch up.My gut tells me that Sagan is not right in completely rejecting astrology, the occult or religion, but I choose to trust him because he has managed to put into simple words concepts that have scared away so many people for so long. His narrative voice is the perfect combination of a bright mind and humility. It is subtle and guiding, not patronizing. It is human and it is humane – it makes you believe you can understand and dream beyond the boundaries of your own mind.Sagan was a great scientist, but I think his greatest achievement is that he made science accessible and interesting to his fellow human beings. His venture to bring the Cosmos closer to humans might eventually pay off in helping bring humans closer to the Cosmos. There is so much more I want to say, but I don’t have words for all thoughts that Cosmos provoked in me. I feel ashamed that my review of this monumental work revolves around my little nichtigkeit, but, after all, even the biggest galaxies are made of the smallest particles."
44,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/156533-rob,5,"A gorgeous book in every possible way. From the lush illustration and clever diagrams clear through to Sagan's lyrical and at times whimsical narrative, this is the science book for non-scientists. (And if you are a scientist, may this be a lesson in how to tell your story.) Sagan makes the astronomy and the math and the mind-boggling complexity of the universe not only comprehensible but palatable. He wraps up our history as a species into the history of the universe (such that we can even know it).As a kid, I adored this book for the color plates. I would flip the pages in my Dad's copy over and over and over again. Down on the floor, on the couch -- anywhere. Probably every day from ages four through seventeen. I didn't go on to be an astronomer. Hell, I never took a physics class and I nearly failed more than one math class (as I recall) but this book...Reading it cover-to-cover for the first time as an adult, I was struck by many things. The book is dense but Sagan paces it well, makes you hungry for every anecdote about Kepler or Pythagoras, thirsty for the decimal-laden scientific notation.And then there was the moment that blew my mind; tucked away in a footnote about telescopic ""snapshots"" of galaxies:...The near side of a galaxy is tens of thousands of light-years closer to us than the far side; thus we see the front as it was tens of thousands of years before the back. But typical events in galactic dynamics occupy tens of millions of years, so the error in thinking of an image of a galaxy as frozen in one moment of time is small.!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?"
45,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70913-deb,1,"This book was my bible when I was an enemy of God. As a stubbornly devout atheist, this was the book I turned to for justification of my proud and arrogant rejection of my Creator. Instead of reading this pile of conjecture, I recommend reading the Holy Bible (then get on your knees and repent before the holy God who gave you life and sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to pay the penalty for your lawlessness and sin). :-)"
46,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"Sagan explores the history and future of cosmology with wonder and foreboding in this slightly dated but insightful and still highly relevant mix of science and philosophy. He begins with the story of Eratosthenes, the first to calculate the circumference of the earth in the third century BCE. His instruments were two sticks. He placed one vertically in the ground at the summer solstice on the equator and a second 800 kilometers north. At noon the first would give no shadow but the angle of the shadow of the second would correspond to that segment of the earth. Divide the angle (7 degrees) into 360, multiply it by 800 and you are pretty close to the actual circumference. Simple but brilliant!In the 6th century BCE Thales, Anaximander, and Pythagoras began laying the foundations of modern scientific thought from astronomy to mathematics to biology. The 6th century not only produced these brilliant Ionian Greeks, but Gautama Buddha in India, Confucius and Lao-Tse in China, Zoroaster in Persia, and Pharaoh Necho in Egypt who had Africa circumnavigated 2000 years before the Portuguese. Sagan questions whether this simultaneous explosion of new ideas could really be unrelated, but doesn’t suggest an answer. Unfortunately this burst of innovative thought wouldn’t last. Sagan points to the destruction of the library at Alexandria in the fourth century CE as a final blow to learning symbolizing the beginning of the Dark Ages. It would be another 1,000 years for this ancient knowledge to be rediscovered although much would be lost forever. Sagan suggests the rise of slavery led to the demise of the Ionian scientists. Slavery obviated the need for technology and set up the need for clear lines of demarcation of class to justify it. Thus working with the hands, engaging in ungentlemanly activity was wrong. Religion was employed to rationalize the institution. Today we are familiar with a more recent example, the antebellum South which failed to industrialize due to its reliance on slavery and ended up falling far behind the North.Sagan covers the 16th and 17th century contributions of Copernicus, Brahe, Kepler, and Newton. Then he skips to the 1970’s discussing the Voyager missions, exploration of the solar system and the prospects for finding life. He presents the then current ideas on the nature of the universe discussing stars, space, time and the exploration of the galaxy. Sagan is particularly focused on the use of radio astronomy not only to identify far flung civilizations but to contact them. Cosmos was written before string theory, the multiverse, supersymmetry, dark matter, dark energy and the Higgs boson became hot topics. Still his discussion holds up well. Sagan is enamored with interacting with other civilizations. I am not sure this is a good idea but danger from aliens seems far less likely than danger from our fellow man. In trying to calculate the number of advanced civilizations in the universe, a key factor is how long a civilization can last before it destroys itself. We have only very recently gotten to the point where we can reach out to other worlds and between climate change, nuclear war, and other self-destructive behavior our future is clearly tenuous. Sagan takes this worry very seriously and persuades me to as well. Perhaps our search for intelligent life on other worlds has borne no fruit because intelligent life is a misnomer. "

The surface of the Earth is the shore of the cosmic ocean. On this shore, we've learned most of what we know. Recently, we've waded a little way out, maybe ankle-deep, and the water seems inviting. Some part of our being knows this is where we came from.We long to returnand we can .because the cosmos is also within us. We're made of starstuff 
i don't think i'll ever give 5 stars more wholeheartedly as i am doing now ..5 shimmering , eye-blindingly shinning stars , the brightest suns GR has in its this little galaxy should be owned by this book , cosmos .its really shocking that only days ago i didnt know who carl sagan is . The name may have seemed a bit familiar , but nothing more Now , this name feels too meaningful , i'd remember this man's words , his deep voice discussing the formations of the stars and their decay and deaths , i'd surly remember the passion in his eyes in the parallel Cosmos TV show , the way he pronounces Billions and Billions stressing on the B or the way he says  ""we are made of starstuff"" with too much longing . I LOVED THIS BOOK  it maybe mainstream and often said but i dont know how to phrase what i feel about it any other way , seems its beyond my ability of putting things into coherent sentences .it was Beautiful  in every mean , i wish now that i have saved every beautiful i've ever used , ever said , so that when i call this peace of heaven beautiful you would get what i am saying ..quoting from the same book , cosmos is :
""visually and musically stunning, and to engage the heart as well as the mind""
Carl Sagan , an astronomer, a cosmologist and a writer. a brilliant man . the way he uses words , it doesnt feel decorated , these words are written too honestly , the passions and ambitions of a man ,once a child inlove with science-fiction as we all are , scriped in papers .I feel too ashamed that i am 22 years living in this world and its only now that i read this book , Cosmos wasn't only about astronomy , but philosophy , biology and a big deal of history all written very beautifully you will enjoy every bit , i started to love radio waves , Phythagorean laws and things of this sort that i may have considered dry and lifeless in my school years . its hard to believe that this is written in the eighties of the last century , may be so much had changed , maybe some stuff here and there are not up to date but its is still a big source of inspiration . The question about extraterrestial life remains a puzzle , but exploring the problem is a fascinating journey in itself .I am not an expert on natural science , a mere starter , but it was easy for me to read , so i think carl sagan's books are gems of some sort , they are the bridge between scientists and common people , they are written for us , we who love the stars and crave to understand them yet we are no scientists or experts our selves . and generally expertise in the subject matter is not required to enjoy it , as the love of it shall demonstrates. I am officaily recommending this book for every human being , its a thing every soul should read .i wish i can buy enough copies for the human race and shove them down their doors .

I believe our future depends on how well we know this Cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky*We are like butterflies who flutter for a day and think it is forever*Those explorations required skepticism and imagination both. Imagination will often carry us to worlds that never were. But without it, we go nowhere. Skepticism enables us to distinguish fancy from fact, to test our speculations*The Earth is a place. It is by no means the only place. It is not even a typical place. No planet or star or galaxy can be typical, because the Cosmos is mostly empty. The only typical place is within the vast, cold, universal vacuum, the everlasting night of intergalactic space, a place so strange and desolate that, by comparison, planets and stars and galaxies seem achingly rare and lovely. If we were randomly inserted into the Cosmos, the chance that we would find ourselves on or near a planet would be less than one in a billion trillion trillion* (1033, a one followed by 33 zeroes). In everyday life such odds are called compelling. Worlds are precious*Each star system is an island in space, quarantined from its neighbors by the light- years. I can imagine creatures evolving into glimmerings of knowledge on innumerable worlds, every one of them assuming at first their puny planet and paltry few suns to be all that is. We grow up in isolation. Only slowly do we teach ourselves the Cosmos*Welcome to the planet Earth - a place of blue nitrogen skies, oceans of liquid water, cool forests and soft meadows, a world positively rippling with life. In the cosmic perspective it is, as I have said, poignantly beautiful and rare; but it is also, for the moment, unique*The study of the heavens brought Ptolemy a kind of ecstasy. ‘ Mortal as I am,’ he wrote, ‘ I know that I am born for a day. But when I follow at my pleasure the serried multitude of the stars in their circular course, my feet no longer touch the Earth. . *With this symphony of voices man can play through the eternity of time in less than an hour, and can taste in small measure the delight of God, the Supreme Artist . . . I yield freely to the sacred frenzy . . . the die is cast, and I am writing the book - to be read either now or by posterity, it matters not. It can wait a century for a reader, as God Himself has waited 6,000 years for a witness*With searing heat, crushing pressures, noxious gases and everything suffused in an eerie, reddish glow, Venus seems less the goddess of love than the incarnation of hell*All that matters is the evidence, and the evidence is not yet in.*The Earth is a tiny and fragile world. It needs to be cherished*there are regularities in Nature that permit its secrets to be uncovered. Nature is not entirely unpredictable; there are rules even she must obey. This ordered and admirable character of the universe was called Cosmos*Traveling close to the speed of light is a kind of elixir of life. Because time slows down close to the speed of light, special relativity provides us with a means of going to the stars*A star is a phoenix, destined to rise for a time from its own ashes*Our passion for learning, evident in the behavior of every toddler, is the tool for our survival*Books permit us to voyage through time, to tap the wisdom of our ancestors. The library connects us with the insights and knowledge, painfully extracted from Nature, of the greatest minds that ever were, with the best teachers, drawn from the entire planet and from all of our history, to instruct us without tiring, and to inspire us to make our own contribution to the collective knowledge of the human species*The choice is stark and ironic. The same rocket boosters used to launch probes to the planets are poised to send nuclear warheads to the nations. The radioactive power sources on Viking and Voyager derive from the same technology that makes nuclear weapons. The radio and radar techniques employed to track and guide ballistic missiles and defend against attack are also used to monitor and command the spacecraft on the planets and to listen for signals from civilizations near other stars. If we use these technologies to destroy ourselves, we surely will venture no more to the planets and the stars. But the converse is also true. If we continue to the planets and the stars, our chauvinisms will be shaken further. We will gain a cosmic perspective. We will recognize that our explorations can be carried out only on behalf of all the people of the planet Earth"

Both of the before mentioned apply to me, but why do I say it has a special meaning? Well, as simple as it may sound, this book was what took me to where I am right now. There has always been magic for me. As a kid, I always believed in everything everyone else seemed to despise and so it was my faith that my parents even got to think that I was crazy.First, there were these magical creatures: faeries, mermaids, goblins, wizards, etc. Then something even better and more magical came to my life: science. Now you may be thinking, okay, but science is a wide subject, what part of science? And I will answer you: why do I have to choose from it when I can learn from all of it? That’s something taught me. Science is connected to everything in ways that some of us have never imagined. If we talk about science, we must think of it as the most important discovery in the history of humanity, of art, religion, music, and beauty in its fullest expression. One can’t live without the other, they are the things that give form and purpose to our existence. Since I find myself unfit to give a decent critic to the book (not because I lack knowledge but for the role, it played and keeps playing in my life), I’m going to invite you to think a little bit.Imagine yourself as a 6-year old kid. You are in the countryside, separated from any sound or human contact, and the only light is the one that comes from the starts you are currently watching. You feel happy about your loneliness. You don’t know anything about the matter and yet you have a feeling that there’s some magic in the sky, some kind of spell written in it. Suddenly the stars are passing by, leaving a blur of light on their tray and you wonder how some stars can move and fall while others keep doing their job, brightening everything around you. You run to the house at the other side of the camp, and turn to see the stars again, they are still there, the same stars every day, you are scared because you don’t understand and that makes you feel uneasy. You go to sleep. Next morning you wake up and go directly to the nearest library, you ask for books of stars, but the librarian tells you she has none and instead she gives you a physics, religion and art books, what a disappointment you think. You see the pictures and read as much as you can, it isn’t an easy task, though, you have barely learned to read. The hours passed by, and by the end of the day, you realized how much you have learned, not only about physics and stars but also about religion, math, and arts. It’s then when you as a 6-years old kid find the most valuable treasure when you were only looking to understand the stars. As I said before, there is no way of reviewing this book correctly."

It doesn't matter that it was written 25+ years ago, pre-Hubble telescope, before the fall of the USSR, etc. - Sagan's insight and wide-reaching scope are timeless.The last few chapters are so rich in thought-provoking information they are worth re-reading. Sagan would have never wanted his work to become the foundation of a religion, but I can see why so many people refer to this as their ""bible"" and use it to help make sense out of a mad world and one's short time to inhabit it."

This is one of the best popular scientific books that I have read. This book is well written, reads like a mystery novel and is a great source of interesting information. Scientific information is explained in ""simple reader"" language.The focus in this book is on astronomy : how big is our universe, how old it is, how it ""works"", etc. Sagan pays a lot of attention to stars and galaxies, but also presents the more advanced topics of black holes and pulsars. There are also occasional earthly detours - evolution of life on earth, ancient greeks, the library of Alexandria, voyages of explorers, etc. The book also tries to bring up some philosophical questions, especially in relation to the possibility of other civilizations in the cosmos, and how a contact between us and them would happen.Highly recommendation!===================

This book is really very impressive. A story of 15 billion years of the cosmos compressed in this relatively smaller book! Easy to read and understand, Carl Sagan's Cosmos draws the reader into a world so vivid and realistic that it's hard not to be mesmerized throughout while reading this book."
54,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13070326-heather-k-dentist-in-my-spare-time,3," I wish I had LOVED this book as Carl Sagan is an icon. It was entertaining, if you ignore the fact that it is VERY dated (I mean, 40+ years dated), which is not its fault. However, I much prefer A Short History of Nearly Everything for a review of the same information. "
55,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,5,"Cosmos operates at a massive scale worthy of its lofty title. Carl Sagan, in a companion compendium to his 13-part 1980 TV series of the same name, explains what we know about the universe and the progression of human thought about origins and the nature of reality. We zoom across frames of reference, from the actions of atoms and subatomic particles, to the molecules that store genetic information, to life on this planet, and beyond, to the structure of the universe. We learn about the various explorations of Mars, Venus, Io and Europa, and how we might travel to stars in the future. Along the way, Sagan explains not just what we know, but how we know it, and the fascinating stories of how that information was discovered: often by brilliance or persistence, and sometimes by historical accident or sheer luck. His enthusiasm is readily apparent: infectious and infused with a positive vision for the world and the future. One can only wish that more people on Earth shared Sagan's perspective.The book is punctuated with quotes from various myths of the universe's origins, which serve to remind us how important these questions have always been, but also how poorly equipped we are to access answers through intuition alone. It is the scientific method that has allowed us to cumulatively add new knowledge. He quotes Seneca, from the first century CE: ""There will come a time when our descendants will be amazed that we did not know things that are so plain to them... Many discoveries are reserved for ages still to come, when memory of us will have been effaced. Our universe is a sorry little affair unless it has in it something for every age to investigate... Nature does not reveal her mysteries once and for all."" Seneca saw clearly, and Sagan shares the stories of thinkers like Pythagoras, Aristarchus, Eratosthenes, Copernicus, Kepler, Huygens, Newton and Einstein and the various contributions they made to our modern understanding.I listened to the audio version, read by LeVar Burton, which is fantastic. I then picked up my physical copy to re-read the quotes and footnotes and see the included charts and illustrations. I highly recommend this for everyone... even if you have a strong understanding of science, it is worth it just to hear Sagan's brilliant and beautifully crafted explanations."

First thing that captivates me that despite being a nonfiction scientific book, Carl Sagan described the whole universe, explained the science in such a poetic and eloquent way that you would think he is a romantic poet! And the parts about his childhood and his enthusiasm for astronomy, for cosmos were the cutest and beautiful thing I have ever read. I saw myself, my passion for space in him, in his writings. And best part of this book was the incredible ideas that can belong to a sci-fi writer! I even took notes from this ideas so maybe I can use them in my future writings. Carl Sagan became my favorite person in science))) And this book will be forever my favorite and I am sure I will read it again and again and also recommend it as a teacher)) And these are my favorite quotes:“The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.” “What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you.

58,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"When do we truly die ? The most logical answer would be to say that we die when the last breath escapes us and when our body and mind cease to function. But I tend to differ , death would be the loss of fascination and wonderment at the world around us. To wake up and see the sun rise everyday, to listen to birdsong in the mornings and see the blue sky above you, to feel the rain lashing at you and at times caressing you with its softness, the gentle breeze of the evenings, the feel of the sea waves beneath your toes....this is life ! And when a time arrives during which none of this can be felt with the same sense of wanton bliss, I shall call it death. If ever there arises a world like Cormac McCarthy's The Road envisaged, I would go insane in a couple of days at the most ! This digression is very much in line with Carl Sagan's work for he speaks to us about our home : Earth. His voice is one of clear reason and indefatigable energy that I was filled with a sense of elation to say the least. You hold his hand and walk with him, a kid who for the first time stepped into a science class with eyes as wide and big as glass marbles ! Even when he tells you that you are nothing but an insignificant speck of dust in the order of things in the galaxy, he continues to say  But look around you, isn't the Earth the most beautiful thing you ever saw ?  Sagan conducts a virtual tour through the history of human civilizations, astronomy, the rise of science, interstellar and interplanetary travel and also ponders for a chapter on the perceived nature of extra terrestrial intelligence. What makes it marvelous reading ? One word : Simplicity ! He never writes a word that a common man needs to break his head over. Yes, there are graphical representations and equations galore in the book but even if you skip them and keep reading you will not be at a loss. Things are kept to the simplest way possible, a spade is called a spade and there are no unnecessary theatrics. I have not seen the TV series that inspired this book but am surely going to go in search of it ! Recommended for those with a love for nature and science."
59,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45702383-a-l-buehrer,2," Let me just say this, I love science as much as anybody else, but I can love it without getting weird about it.  I guess I was expecting this book to be something it wasn't. It's really just a humanist philosophy book. I was expecting to learn something. I read science books to stretch my mind, not to be preached at. This was the preachiest science book I have ever read. Carl Sagan obviously literally worships science. This book was really just a hymn to science, not really delving into any particular part of it enough to really be interesting. I was disappointed enough in Sagan's writing to seriously consider taking ""The Pale Blue Dot"" off my reading list. His tone is so condescending. I decided to read it anyway. Just to give him a second chance. I'm just saying, he's not making my favorite authors list by any means. "

“Exploration is in our nature. We began as wanderers, and we are wanderers still. We have lingered long enough on the shores of the cosmic ocean. We are ready at last to set sail for the stars.”
Remarkable, strong, well crafted, Cosmos as far as I am concerned is a masterpiece of popular science.Carl Sagan is now one of my favorite authors and a person I greatly admire. You can see plainly how much effort was put into this book, and how genuine it is. To put it simply, he is a great writer and a great person.This book was meant as a companion to the TV show Cosmos (1980), a masterpiece on its own accord, I advise going over the two together and following up with Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey.As to the contents of this book, it is fair to say this book encompasses a great deal of information ranging between science and history, I guess I would call it a history of science, but it also touches on many other fields such as civilization, philosophy, and religion.The scientific fields the book goes through are many, but the main focus is, of course, astronomy.However, I would not recommend this book for its scientific content, as a lot has changed since 1980, almost 40 years now. Not that what we knew back then is now irrelevant, just less relevant as new information go piled on top of it.I recommend reading this book for several reasons. Sagan himself as one, I believe everyone should get acquainted with the men, what way would be better than hearing his words? Two, this book serves as a near-perfect gateway for astronomy and science in general, a kind of why you should care answer. Three, the historical view and perspective over the development of science are very enlightening, one can never know enough of one's own species. Four, a vision of where we are, how we came to be, and where we are going.I am pretty sure there is more, that was just off the top of my head.What I might criticize about this book is some repetitions, it made this feel less like a book and more like speech, and also like Sagan was trying to sell something, his points about extraterrestrial life and views on religion to be specific. Also, this is not exactly a very scientific book, nor an objective historical account, but that may not be a concern as it is not sold as one or the other. Arguably, if it was one of those it would not have been as beautiful and attractive. It would not have achieved as wide as an impact as it had. The emotion is a great part of why this book is so valuable.I recommend this book, for fun, for knowledge, for humanity.“What an astonishing thing a book is.

We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries.”"
62,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5,This book and series sparked my interest in science and the universe in 1980 when I was thirteen. It is not cutting edge today but the poetry and wonder of Carl Sagan's vision still is current. Reading this book 36 years after the series reminds me of how science and a vision of universe can inspire people long after the science of the book has been surpassed. Beautiful book.

64,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13421080-maricarmen-estrada-m,5,"Five huge stars for this remarkable book. I've added it to my ""books everyone should read"" shelf. The Cosmos is us. It is us understanding, getting to know who we really are. So many questions are still out there, but we, the people in our wonderful and unique planet, have been able to wonder, search, and find answers always closer to the truth thanks to science.Life is so wonderful and rare, and I'm so happy my life took place in this period of time when we have been able to inherit the science and knowledge of so many generations of people and such brilliant minds as Erathostenes, Copernicus, Kepler, Newton, Darwin, and so many others. I have to make a special mention of Christian Huygens, a brilliant man I barely knew about. I definitely want to read much more about him. Also Hipatia, the last guardian of the library of Alexandria. I experienced once more the pity and overwhelming sorrow for such terrible loss. Well, in Cosmos, Carl Sagan talks about the path of science from the beginning, when men began to wonder, question, and learn to have a conscience of our existence and who we are up to this point when we have developed technology that allows us to keep learning about other places in our Universe beyond the only place we have ever known and where everything has ever happened to each person that has ever existed: our Earth. My final feeling is still this great awe about us, about every form of life that we see as normal and common. I share Sagan's thoughts about how pointless wars are, and hope that we can survive past them and humanity can finally learn to live only to build and perpetuate life in all its forms. If you haven't read this book yet, read it. For me it's one of those ""must""."
65,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44347175-rashit,4,"Carl Sagan presents us with a journey from the Library of Alexandria to the void of the universe. This journey is mostly a scientific journey. From time to time, non-scientific elements become part of this journey. So the book doesn't contain very heavy information. Anyway, Sagan's tongue quite understandable. That's the most powerful side of the book. On the other hand, due to science is constantly improving, some information isn't up to date. He updates some information in Cosmos's documentary. That information will be insufficient over time. Although he protects his objectivity in the whole book, he loses his objectivity in a few places. The reason is the western admiration. He says that in the development of scientific civilization, the weight of west is. This attitude isn’t scientific. Because the basis of today's science occurs works which done in the Library of Alexandria period (Sagan also agrees). After the library was burned, burned books haven’t reached today (He agrees again). It isn't known most of those books of their titles and their writers (He continues to agree). Well, if there are many writers from that library that we don't know, how can we talk so confidently about the fact that science is based on the west?"

“Occasionally someone remarks on what a lucky coincidence it is that the Earth is perfectly suitable for life—moderate temperatures, liquid water, oxygen atmosphere, and so on. But this is, at least in part, a confusion of cause and effect. We earthlings are supremely well adapted to the environment of the Earth because we grew up here. Those earlier forms of life that were not well adapted died. We are descended from the organisms that did well. Organisms that evolve on a quite different world will doubtless sing its praises too.”
Cosmos contained a great deal of information, much of which was engaging. The subject matter included: a history of humanity’s quest for understanding and notable scientific discoveries, evolution and genetics, some basic chemistry and physics (including a brief description of relativity), and, of course, astronomy. The following are some of the astronomy topics covered: the Big Bang, the life cycles of stars, details about many of our solar system’s planets and their satellites, information on a few NASA space missions, and speculation about intelligent alien life.Overall, while Cosmos was a very comprehensive summary of many different branches of knowledge, I really didn’t care for Sagan’s writing style. The first issue I had with his style is that he was often overly lyrical/mystical in tone. The text was abundantly peppered with phrases such as “the bastion and the citadel of the stars.” In my opinion, science and math are beautiful just as they are, and so dressing them up in flowery language is overkill, and can even be counterproductive. An example of this type of thing occurred when Sagan discussed nuclear fusion in stars, and where heavier chemical elements come from. This is a truly fascinating process. But then Sagan goes on to state that: “The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.” I’m assuming he included that last sentence because he wanted readers to feel pretty pleased with ourselves…we’re all literally made out of stars! Far out! How cool are we? But if you think about it, excrement can lay claim to the same stellar forebears, which somewhat diminishes that beautiful, lofty sentiment we’re (presumably) supposed to be feeling about ourselves.My other issue with the writing is that, when it was not waxing poetic, it tended to be far too dumbed down. True, he was trying to reach a very large audience, many of whom have no background in science. That said, it would have been nice to read a book written for grown-ups.Overall, the book was just okay for me. Maybe it’s more exciting to those who haven’t taken an Intro to Astronomy course. If you’ve already studied Astronomy 101, however, there is nothing in either the writing or the personal opinions presented herein that qualify this as a must-read book."

From the days we were wandering the planet looking little different from our primate cousins, to these modern times where we take for granted technologies that would have been equated to magic just a century or so ago, we humans have made amazing progress. Science is what brought us here and science is what is going to help us evolve in the days ahead too. Science helped us see things as they are, dispelled our fears, gave us hope, made us discover fire and invent the wheel – two of the most important findings till today. While science may not have solved all our queries yet - and raises as many demons as it lays to rest - it makes genuine, continuous efforts to arrive at the Truth. Armed with science, we humans have started exploring all around us. From the microcosmic wonders of atoms to the mega marvels of Universe, science has lifted many veils and shown us things beyond our limited understanding. Scientists like Carl Sagan have played an important role in lifting those veils, not only by their direct contribution to the sciences, but also through their ability to communicate such esoteric wisdom to the masses, to laymen that are keen on understanding their surroundings but limited in their ability to do so.Books like ‘The Origin of Species’ remain special, not just because they tell us about groundbreaking discoveries, but also due to their telling it in a language that we, the laypersons, can understand. While ‘Cosmos’ by Carl Sagan may not be as earth-shattering as ‘The Origin of Species’, it is special by its own right. Written nearly four decades ago, co-developed with a television series of the same name, this book was produced with the idea of popularizing the sciences, especially astronomy, among the masses. To the uninitiated but curious mind, this book is the ideal beginning into the wonderous realms of the cosmos. This book is to the budding astronomer what the alphabets and the arithmetic are to the young child.From the ancient budding of scientific thoughts at the Ionian islands to the then-latest launching of space missions like Voyager-2, Carl Sagan takes each stage in the evolution of science as we know it, elaborates on the circumstances prevailing at those times, enumerates important contributions by various scientists. The real fun is his doing all this in an interesting, pacey manner, without letting the reader feel bored even once. After helping us navigate the unimaginably vast expanse of our Universe and showing us the wonders of our solar system, stars, planets, galaxies and the bleak black holes along the way, Sagan ends the book with philosophical musings on the future of mankind on this nuclear era and the possibilities of our encountering extra-terrestrial intelligence.This is not just a book on astronomy. Burgeoning with interesting details on history, evolution, atomic science and mathematics, this is one complete book that every mind passionate about learning must possess."

The chapters that dealt with star and galaxy formations were excellent, and many times I put down the book to look up something online. I had heard about a number of these topics in passing, and it was nice to read about them with more depth. For some reason, I was entranced by the concept of the 'heliopause' (look it up: it's freaking amazing), while I was outright blown away by the fact that both Voyager satellites are only a few years away from reaching this threshold of our solar system. In one of these searches, I discovered that you can subscribe to a Twitter feed for Voyager 2 that states (from a first-person POV, as if V2 is talking to you; nice) how far the satellite has traveled. According to a tweet that is one hour old (at 21:47 EST on 7/15/12), Voyager 2 was 13 hrs, 36 mins, and 44 seconds of light-travel time from Earth.One word: geekgasm.I enjoyed the historical passages, though I once again felt a massive need to branch out beyond the usual coterie of Greeks and Europeans. Sagan makes a passing reference to this cultural bias in his last chapter, stating that ""the emerging scientific civilization on our planet is mainly a Western Civilization"" (281). I want to contest this statement, and the fact that I feel ill-educated to do so is evidence that I have read far more about these portions of history than any other.Sagan includes passionate passages that touch upon our birthright as a species that, ultimately, comes from ""starstuff."" Though I have heard this idea before, Sagan writes about it with a conviction that snared my sympathies anew. His point is just as poignant today as it was 32 (damn) years ago: our specie's propensity for killing each other is frightening and tragic, and the billions of dollars that governments devote to this enterprise only divert our attention and energy from pursuits that could sustain humanity on this planet, if not propel it well beyond our own stellar backyard.This book awakened another perturbing thought: I should have read about this decades ago and read further thereafter. Better now, I suppose, than never."
73,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1074534-emily,1,"I have heard great things about this book and Carl Sagan for so long that I am ashamed to admit how little I liked it. I am only about 50 pages in and since I haven't been able to finish a single paragraph without skimming I'm just going to stop reading it. Cosmos is written in a casual, simple style almost like a story. To me it was way too simple and slow paced. Most of the first three chapters cover simple world setup and astronomy that I had learned about in more depth elsewhere. The book feels outdated to me though the facts are all still correct - very similar to the tv show of the same name (which we tried to watch but gave up on). I can't recommend this. I enjoyed Bill Bryson's 'A Short History of Nearly Everything' much more and I feel like they have a similar purpose. "
74,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6515529-waqas-mhd,4,wow TMI. literally too much info. i don't know if i got everything but i really enjoyed it.
75,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22327118-felix,4,"Wow, this is pretty good. I'd never read any Sagan before reading this, nor had I seen him on television. I profess to always having been some what Sagan-illiterate. After reading this, I see why he was such an iconic figure. He had a real gift for scientific communication. Cosmos is so lucid, and really does a great job of expressing the enormity of its subject matter.However, it is often outdated. The chapters on the history of astronomy (Ptolemy, Copernicus, Kepler, etc.) are likely to be timeless. Much of what is written about our own solar system is still (to the best of my knowledge) mostly accurate. Of course, Voyager had not yet reached Uranus when this was published, so there's very little on the ice giants, for example, and we knew much less about Mars than we do now (having since visited it with a rover). And our understanding of the life cycle of stars have also (in the big picture) not changed enormously since this book was written. However, our conception of deep space has changed substantially. This book was published before dark energy / dark matter became accepted and, as such, the discussion on the expansion of the universe and the composition of deep space is very obviously dated, even in much of its basics. The final chapter on avoiding the risk of nuclear war is also less prescient in our post-Cold War present.Nevertheless, I can't not recommend this book. Sagan is an awesome nonfiction writer, and no doubt inspired countless thousands of people to pursue astronomy and physics. This shouldn't be your only stop in exploring the mysteries of the universe beyond our earth, but even if it is - well, you could do much worse."
76,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6036690-mack-hayden,5,"I've seen a few people in Internet forums over the years say if there's any religion they subscribe to, it's Saganism. Obviously, it's a clever turn of phrase, but it also speaks to the fact the cosmic, scientific truths Sagan conveys here really do activate the same neural pathways of more traditional sacred experience. It's hard to walk away from any page of this book without feeling an immense sense of awe at the natural world, reverence for the universe as a whole, and a deep ethical commitment to not screw up this incredible opportunity we've been given to exist on this planet in this universe. I'm eager to read his other stuff and watch the original series now. After years of hearing so much hype about Sagan's ability to clearly communicate the inspirational wonders of scientific discovery, I was so excited to find he not just met but exceeded my high expectations."
77,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/214318-roddy,5,"Stunning, beautiful prose, excellent description and metaphor, incredibly accessible. Its also one of those books where you get to see the author's own genius slip into the pages accidentally, every so often. This book is the book A Brief History of Time wants to be. Problem is, ABHOT is much more boring and high concept. Sagan is and ever will be the great teacher of the masses in my opinion. This book starts out simpler than ABHOT - here on earth. It begins with what you know and slowly expands your circle of knowledge with insightful description and simile (""the dancing of electrons with their nuclear partners across the surface of ice is like..."") Once you've got your basics, he starts taking you through the process of thinking about how it all might fit together, what scientists are currently working on (were, then working on) and thinking about. I don't hesitate to loan this to my most unscientific minded friends because its actually a great way to get them to stop thinking that stars are made from the souls of people who have died and that people just appeared on the face of the earth fully formed and wearing neckties, some 4000 years ago. Cosmos is also a very holistic book, it discusses evolution, life, the beginnings of the universe the end of the universe, the possiblity of life on other planets - and, very convincingly suggests what that might look like. It at least drives home that we have to step away from the life we are familiar with when we start theorizing what life might be like elsewhere. I can't say enough about how great this book is, how well it imbues its reader with scientific mojo, and how a book that covers textbook type material manages to be so readable. There are also (especially in the hardcover) some very pretty pictures. Note: The book cosmos was a companion/derivative of the PBS special ""Cosmos"" which Sagan worked to explain the mysteries of the universe in something like 14 episodes. You can probably buy this online if you're one of those total lamos that prefers ""the movie"". However, this movie is actually pretty awesome, albeit with very old school animations. Also Note: This book was written in the 1970s. From an outsider's perspective, physics and astrophysics (which is technically more what Cosmos is about) don't change much in 30 years, but in fact they do. Many of the theories Sagan puts forth have since proven to be quite accurate, and some, have understandably proven to be not quite accurate. Not knowing which these are won't hurt the reader; just learning how he begins his process of hypothesizing, and the idea of thinking big picture and how it all fits together is the real lesson of Cosmos. You'll need a recent astronomy or astrophysics (basic) textbook to find the plot holes though, so the recreational reader should fear not. "
78,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5120947-haritha,5,"I cannot begin to describe how amazing this book is. Of all the books I have read in my life till now, I will always remember Carl Sagan's Cosmos as the book that brought back meaning into my life. With wonderful humility, Dr. Sagan makes the unfathomably huge Cosmos come to life. His words, clearly written from the heart, are complemented by beautiful photographs and illustrations. I cannot imagine any reader being unmoved by what Dr. Sagan is telling us. As I progressed through the thirteen chapters that make this book, I went through phases of awe about how big the known Universe is, how little we know, how insignificant we are in the Cosmic scale of things, hopelessness of how petty even the biggest and most serious of international arguments (forget the minutiae of daily petty fights and grudges) are, poignancy about lost knowledge and civilizations, before I realized truly what Dr. Sagan wishes to say- human life is so, so, so, very precious. In the deafening noise of various philosophies that concern the meaning of life, Dr. Sagan's voice is the soothing balm of reason to chaffed and tired ears. This lonely planet called Earth in a forgotten corner of the Universe desperately needs more people like Dr. Sagan who can write as eloquent a book as the Cosmos. I recommend this book to each and every one. If I have kids, this book will be one they will quote as the formative book of their childhood. Carl Sagan, we miss you and you will always be my hero. "
79,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58035793-hiba-arrame,5,"It was absolutely a stunning experience, this book is a treasure, seriously a TREASURE! It has in it almost everything you'd want to know about our universe.I won't deny that I learned a lot, and slightly appeased my eager to science, Astronomy in particular.One thing that I'd like is having the show Cosmos produced again, it would be a great opportunity to introduce ""people"" into a world of wonders."
80,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14811808-liz,5,Even after all these years (I read it for the first time ten years ago) Cosmos is still of the best science books I've ever read. 
81,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,4,"Carl Sagan's boyish enthusiasm fills this book ranging widely on scientific topics while emphasizing his life-long passion for communication with other intelligence in the universe.Like Issac Asimov, Sagan is captivated by the wonder of our physical world and eager to explain it to the general public, though Sagan ventures more into speculation while Asimov is more detail oriented - not only wanting you to know about the atom, but about the parts and the forces involved, never departing from the facts.It's impossible to read this book without finding out new things, even though it was written almost 30 years ago. For example, I did not know that our sun was formed in the company of other stars that have since dispersed across the galaxy, nor did I know that the spiral arms of our Milky Way are areas of star formation that move independently of the stars they move through. Ten million years ago the earth was within one of these spiral arms, now it is on the edge.In Cosmos, Sagan moves out from the Sun as he also takes us forward from the dawn of science. Since I've read quite a bit about the history of scientific discovery, I found the first part of this book, dealing with that subject, far less interesting than the last third where Sagan takes us off into the vastness of space, ponders the chances of life on other worlds, informs us of the weirdness of black holes, describes the life of stars and explains the possibility of another dimension that we cannot experience. He addresses the reader with respect. You feel like you are in the company of a good friend who responds to something you say with, ""yeah, I've wondered about that too and here's what I think.""Sagan has a marvelous capacity to take a subject just so far without getting bogged down in detail. There were several times I became engaged in his topic and he would carry it forward far enough for my curiosity to be satisfied. I never had that disappointing feeling of the child who says to the storytelling parent, ""but THEN what happened!?"" only to be told the story is over.The style of writing is free-flowing and natural. I don't know that I've ever sped through a book like I did this one, quickly grasping what the author has to say. There is a special kind of genius in being able to take the most abstruse subjects and present them in an understandable way. Carl Sagan writes like he was born with a pen in his hand. At the same time, his imagination is so fertile that you never can tell where he will go with a subject. His speculations about contact with another intelligence in the universe are broad and deep, this obviously being where is heart is.After closing the book, I'm impressed by how microscopic humanity is in the vastness of space and how recent we are in the immensity of time. We've only had radio for 100 years, so our electromagnetic voice has reached only 100 light years from earth, enough to get to the nearest few dozen stars, yet we are aware of, able to see through optical or radio astronomy, objects that are billions of light years from us, dating to not long after the origin of the universe.The question that hangs over this book is - are we alone? Over the billions of stars that are out there, why is there no evidence at all of intelligence elsewhere?I'm tempted to get the e-reader version of this book simply to be able to look things up easily in the future. Sagan answers so many questions, it will be easy for me to forget the answers."
82,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72985691-osama-siddique,5,"What can one say about Sagan and Cosmos that hasn't already been said. Of course I keenly devoured the show, I did have very early and deep fascination for the heavens above, and I have zealously read this one quite a few times. What Sagan has is this unique and very rare ability not just to make complex things simple, or to really bring forth and radiate the sense of awe evoked by the scale and nature of the cosmos, or a vital sense of timing and drama - of course he had all that and he was a superb scientist, teacher, presenter, actor and dramatist all rolled in one - but the unique and rare ability I want to highlight is to retain and flamboyantly convey the same deep and abiding sense of wonder, joy and excitement in the reader or the viewer as he probably felt himself the very first time he started looking for patterns in the stars. Give this book to every child, every dreamer, every would be scientist, every poet and anyone with a questioning mind. Give it also to the myopic, the dullard, the accountant and the bore. For who knows it may cure all of them. It rolls out a cosmic tapestry woven out of stars - the stuff of dreams, awe and imagination - with a master conductor and choreographer explaining the melody and rhythm of our universe. This is one of those books that you sometimes hope you had not read. Simply so that you can rediscover it and reread it and relive the thrill. Hope you are voyaging happily somewhere amongst the stars Carl. "
83,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,5,"I don't get people who find this too dry, or lacking in a sense of wonder about the world. It's full of a sense of wonder, no less potent because Sagan was agnostic (not atheist, as some people say), and he expresses this almost poetically. While some of the science is falling out of date now, it's still worth reading Cosmos -- as a primer, and for Sagan's clear explanations of how the world works, and how our understanding got to this point.I actually have the DVDs of the series as well, and while I know from seeing clips the book and the series are very similar, I'm gonna have to get round to seeing it soon. And if you've never heard of Symphony of Science, I definitely recommend it -- my favourite is 'A Glorious Dawn'.One of the things reading this really made me wonder is what Sagan would think of what we've made of the world in the last two decades. We haven't destroyed ourselves yet, but we haven't yet disarmed, we haven't even convinced everybody that climate change exists, and we still haven't gone any further from our own small planet. I wish we still had Sagan, speaking clearly and rationally about all the problems we face -- particularly because he had hope for us, as well as a warning."
84,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84821-amy,5,"I think I could categorize this book as ""life-changing"" for me. I think the reason I am interested in subjects such as classics and anthropology can be traced to this book! It's a very broad look at the history of the universe and the history of science, so even though it is a good 20+ years old, most of it still stands. Sagan writes in an engaging and accessible manner. This is definitely a great book for people who are interested in science, but a little afraid to approach a book about it. Sagan looks at the universe with awe and wonder, and he conveys these feelings to the reader."
85,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8895258-andrew-culyer,5,"There are not many books that I keep. The only ones I do keep are the ones I know I am going to read again, and this is my third time reading this.As general books about physics go, this is the best one I've ever read, and believe me, I've read a few.The subject might not appeal to a lot of people, but if you want an introduction to the cosmos, the universe, and our planet's place in it, and you don't mind having your mind opened a little bit, then I completely recommend this bookIt's going to stay on my shelf forever (or, more accurately, til the day I die)"
86,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4902544-katie,4,"I love Carl Sagan. He really does make you feel like a kid again. His excitement and enthusiasm come through clearly right from the start of this book and I'd think it would be hard for anyone not to get swept up by it. The facts and mysteries of the cosmos are fascinating especially when Carl Sagan is talking about them. There are inevitably some dry and drawn out parts,being the reason for 4 stars, but all in all fantastic. "

It leaves you somewhat different, somewhat better of a person than you were before. But rarely, very rarely, a book fundamentally alters your outlook on life and the world around you. Cosmos is such a book.Us human beings have a tendency to become complacent and indifferent as we get trapped in the humdrum rhythm of life on earth. Our minds occupied by mundane, pressing issues, we tend to forget the absurd immensity of it the cosmos - both in space and in time. This book wakes you from that slumber and takes you on a voyage from the very beginning of time to now, from the microcosm of what makes up everything to the macrocosm of everything that is. It makes you realize just how puny and insignificant, yet how remarkably special we are. We are, in Sagan's words, “starstuff pondering the stars; organized assemblages of ten billion billion billion atoms considering the evolution of atoms”Our future depends on this realization. It depends on whether we will be able to avoid self-destructing before we set on daring voyages beyond our lonely solar system. Cosmos is a book that must be read and reread, because its lessons are ones we cannot afford to forget."

“Exploration is in our nature. We began as wanderers, and we are wanderers still. We have lingered long enough on the shores of the cosmic ocean. We are ready at last to set sail for the stars.”
Remarkable, strong, well crafted, Cosmos as far as I am concerned is a masterpiece of popular science.Carl Sagan is now one of my favorite authors and a person I greatly admire. You can see plainly how much effort was put into this book, and how genuine it is. To put it simply, he is a great writer and a great person.This book was meant as a companion to the TV show Cosmos (1980), a masterpiece on its own accord, I advise going over the two together and following up with Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey.As to the contents of this book, it is fair to say this book encompasses a great deal of information ranging between science and history, I guess I would call it a history of science, but it also touches on many other fields such as civilization, philosophy, and religion.The scientific fields the book goes through are many, but the main focus is, of course, astronomy.However, I would not recommend this book for its scientific content, as a lot has changed since 1980, almost 40 years now. Not that what we knew back then is now irrelevant, just less relevant as new information go piled on top of it.I recommend reading this book for several reasons. Sagan himself as one, I believe everyone should get acquainted with the men, what way would be better than hearing his words? Two, this book serves as a near-perfect gateway for astronomy and science in general, a kind of why you should care answer. Three, the historical view and perspective over the development of science are very enlightening, one can never know enough of one's own species. Four, a vision of where we are, how we came to be, and where we are going.I am pretty sure there is more, that was just off the top of my head.What I might criticize about this book is some repetitions, it made this feel less like a book and more like speech, and also like Sagan was trying to sell something, his points about extraterrestrial life and views on religion to be specific. Also, this is not exactly a very scientific book, nor an objective historical account, but that may not be a concern as it is not sold as one or the other. Arguably, if it was one of those it would not have been as beautiful and attractive. It would not have achieved as wide as an impact as it had. The emotion is a great part of why this book is so valuable.I recommend this book, for fun, for knowledge, for humanity.“What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.""“The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.”“The Cosmos is all that is or was or ever will be. Our feeblest contemplations of the Cosmos stir us -- there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, of falling from a height. We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries.”"
92,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5,This book and series sparked my interest in science and the universe in 1980 when I was thirteen. It is not cutting edge today but the poetry and wonder of Carl Sagan's vision still is current. Reading this book 36 years after the series reminds me of how science and a vision of universe can inspire people long after the science of the book has been surpassed. Beautiful book.

It is us understanding, getting to know who we really are. So many questions are still out there, but we, the people in our wonderful and unique planet, have been able to wonder, search, and find answers always closer to the truth thanks to science.Life is so wonderful and rare, and I'm so happy my life took place in this period of time when we have been able to inherit the science and knowledge of so many generations of people and such brilliant minds as Erathostenes, Copernicus, Kepler, Newton, Darwin, and so many others. I have to make a special mention of Christian Huygens, a brilliant man I barely knew about. I definitely want to read much more about him. Also Hipatia, the last guardian of the library of Alexandria. I experienced once more the pity and overwhelming sorrow for such terrible loss. Well, in Cosmos, Carl Sagan talks about the path of science from the beginning, when men began to wonder, question, and learn to have a conscience of our existence and who we are up to this point when we have developed technology that allows us to keep learning about other places in our Universe beyond the only place we have ever known and where everything has ever happened to each person that has ever existed: our Earth. My final feeling is still this great awe about us, about every form of life that we see as normal and common. I share Sagan's thoughts about how pointless wars are, and hope that we can survive past them and humanity can finally learn to live only to build and perpetuate life in all its forms. If you haven't read this book yet, read it. For me it's one of those ""must""."
95,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44347175-rashit,4,"Carl Sagan presents us with a journey from the Library of Alexandria to the void of the universe. This journey is mostly a scientific journey. From time to time, non-scientific elements become part of this journey. So the book doesn't contain very heavy information. Anyway, Sagan's tongue quite understandable. That's the most powerful side of the book. On the other hand, due to science is constantly improving, some information isn't up to date. He updates some information in Cosmos's documentary. That information will be insufficient over time. Although he protects his objectivity in the whole book, he loses his objectivity in a few places. The reason is the western admiration. He says that in the development of scientific civilization, the weight of west is. This attitude isn’t scientific. Because the basis of today's science occurs works which done in the Library of Alexandria period (Sagan also agrees). After the library was burned, burned books haven’t reached today (He agrees again). It isn't known most of those books of their titles and their writers (He continues to agree). Well, if there are many writers from that library that we don't know, how can we talk so confidently about the fact that science is based on the west?"

“Occasionally someone remarks on what a lucky coincidence it is that the Earth is perfectly suitable for life—moderate temperatures, liquid water, oxygen atmosphere, and so on. But this is, at least in part, a confusion of cause and effect. We earthlings are supremely well adapted to the environment of the Earth because we grew up here. Those earlier forms of life that were not well adapted died. We are descended from the organisms that did well. Organisms that evolve on a quite different world will doubtless sing its praises too.”
Cosmos contained a great deal of information, much of which was engaging. The subject matter included: a history of humanity’s quest for understanding and notable scientific discoveries, evolution and genetics, some basic chemistry and physics (including a brief description of relativity), and, of course, astronomy. The following are some of the astronomy topics covered: the Big Bang, the life cycles of stars, details about many of our solar system’s planets and their satellites, information on a few NASA space missions, and speculation about intelligent alien life.Overall, while Cosmos was a very comprehensive summary of many different branches of knowledge, I really didn’t care for Sagan’s writing style. The first issue I had with his style is that he was often overly lyrical/mystical in tone. The text was abundantly peppered with phrases such as “the bastion and the citadel of the stars.” In my opinion, science and math are beautiful just as they are, and so dressing them up in flowery language is overkill, and can even be counterproductive. An example of this type of thing occurred when Sagan discussed nuclear fusion in stars, and where heavier chemical elements come from. This is a truly fascinating process. But then Sagan goes on to state that: “The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.” I’m assuming he included that last sentence because he wanted readers to feel pretty pleased with ourselves…we’re all literally made out of stars! Far out! How cool are we? But if you think about it, excrement can lay claim to the same stellar forebears, which somewhat diminishes that beautiful, lofty sentiment we’re (presumably) supposed to be feeling about ourselves.My other issue with the writing is that, when it was not waxing poetic, it tended to be far too dumbed down. True, he was trying to reach a very large audience, many of whom have no background in science. That said, it would have been nice to read a book written for grown-ups.Overall, the book was just okay for me. Maybe it’s more exciting to those who haven’t taken an Intro to Astronomy course. If you’ve already studied Astronomy 101, however, there is nothing in either the writing or the personal opinions presented herein that qualify this as a must-read book."

From the days we were wandering the planet looking little different from our primate cousins, to these modern times where we take for granted technologies that would have been equated to magic just a century or so ago, we humans have made amazing progress. Science is what brought us here and science is what is going to help us evolve in the days ahead too. Science helped us see things as they are, dispelled our fears, gave us hope, made us discover fire and invent the wheel – two of the most important findings till today. While science may not have solved all our queries yet - and raises as many demons as it lays to rest - it makes genuine, continuous efforts to arrive at the Truth. Armed with science, we humans have started exploring all around us. From the microcosmic wonders of atoms to the mega marvels of Universe, science has lifted many veils and shown us things beyond our limited understanding. Scientists like Carl Sagan have played an important role in lifting those veils, not only by their direct contribution to the sciences, but also through their ability to communicate such esoteric wisdom to the masses, to laymen that are keen on understanding their surroundings but limited in their ability to do so.Books like ‘The Origin of Species’ remain special, not just because they tell us about groundbreaking discoveries, but also due to their telling it in a language that we, the laypersons, can understand. While ‘Cosmos’ by Carl Sagan may not be as earth-shattering as ‘The Origin of Species’, it is special by its own right. Written nearly four decades ago, co-developed with a television series of the same name, this book was produced with the idea of popularizing the sciences, especially astronomy, among the masses. To the uninitiated but curious mind, this book is the ideal beginning into the wonderous realms of the cosmos. This book is to the budding astronomer what the alphabets and the arithmetic are to the young child.From the ancient budding of scientific thoughts at the Ionian islands to the then-latest launching of space missions like Voyager-2, Carl Sagan takes each stage in the evolution of science as we know it, elaborates on the circumstances prevailing at those times, enumerates important contributions by various scientists. The real fun is his doing all this in an interesting, pacey manner, without letting the reader feel bored even once. After helping us navigate the unimaginably vast expanse of our Universe and showing us the wonders of our solar system, stars, planets, galaxies and the bleak black holes along the way, Sagan ends the book with philosophical musings on the future of mankind on this nuclear era and the possibilities of our encountering extra-terrestrial intelligence.This is not just a book on astronomy. Burgeoning with interesting details on history, evolution, atomic science and mathematics, this is one complete book that every mind passionate about learning must possess."

102,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/365191-daniel,5,"I went into this book hoping to learn more about the Universe, and learn more I did. The chapters that dealt with star and galaxy formations were excellent, and many times I put down the book to look up something online. I had heard about a number of these topics in passing, and it was nice to read about them with more depth. For some reason, I was entranced by the concept of the 'heliopause' (look it up: it's freaking amazing), while I was outright blown away by the fact that both Voyager satellites are only a few years away from reaching this threshold of our solar system. In one of these searches, I discovered that you can subscribe to a Twitter feed for Voyager 2 that states (from a first-person POV, as if V2 is talking to you; nice) how far the satellite has traveled. According to a tweet that is one hour old (at 21:47 EST on 7/15/12), Voyager 2 was 13 hrs, 36 mins, and 44 seconds of light-travel time from Earth.One word: geekgasm.I enjoyed the historical passages, though I once again felt a massive need to branch out beyond the usual coterie of Greeks and Europeans. Sagan makes a passing reference to this cultural bias in his last chapter, stating that ""the emerging scientific civilization on our planet is mainly a Western Civilization"" (281). I want to contest this statement, and the fact that I feel ill-educated to do so is evidence that I have read far more about these portions of history than any other.Sagan includes passionate passages that touch upon our birthright as a species that, ultimately, comes from ""starstuff."" Though I have heard this idea before, Sagan writes about it with a conviction that snared my sympathies anew. His point is just as poignant today as it was 32 (damn) years ago: our specie's propensity for killing each other is frightening and tragic, and the billions of dollars that governments devote to this enterprise only divert our attention and energy from pursuits that could sustain humanity on this planet, if not propel it well beyond our own stellar backyard.This book awakened another perturbing thought: I should have read about this decades ago and read further thereafter. Better now, I suppose, than never."
103,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1074534-emily,1,"I have heard great things about this book and Carl Sagan for so long that I am ashamed to admit how little I liked it. I am only about 50 pages in and since I haven't been able to finish a single paragraph without skimming I'm just going to stop reading it. Cosmos is written in a casual, simple style almost like a story. To me it was way too simple and slow paced. Most of the first three chapters cover simple world setup and astronomy that I had learned about in more depth elsewhere. The book feels outdated to me though the facts are all still correct - very similar to the tv show of the same name (which we tried to watch but gave up on). I can't recommend this. I enjoyed Bill Bryson's 'A Short History of Nearly Everything' much more and I feel like they have a similar purpose. "
104,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6515529-waqas-mhd,4,wow TMI. literally too much info. i don't know if i got everything but i really enjoyed it.
105,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22327118-felix,4,"Wow, this is pretty good. I'd never read any Sagan before reading this, nor had I seen him on television. I profess to always having been some what Sagan-illiterate. After reading this, I see why he was such an iconic figure. He had a real gift for scientific communication. Cosmos is so lucid, and really does a great job of expressing the enormity of its subject matter.However, it is often outdated. The chapters on the history of astronomy (Ptolemy, Copernicus, Kepler, etc.) are likely to be timeless. Much of what is written about our own solar system is still (to the best of my knowledge) mostly accurate. Of course, Voyager had not yet reached Uranus when this was published, so there's very little on the ice giants, for example, and we knew much less about Mars than we do now (having since visited it with a rover). And our understanding of the life cycle of stars have also (in the big picture) not changed enormously since this book was written. However, our conception of deep space has changed substantially. This book was published before dark energy / dark matter became accepted and, as such, the discussion on the expansion of the universe and the composition of deep space is very obviously dated, even in much of its basics. The final chapter on avoiding the risk of nuclear war is also less prescient in our post-Cold War present.Nevertheless, I can't not recommend this book. Sagan is an awesome nonfiction writer, and no doubt inspired countless thousands of people to pursue astronomy and physics. This shouldn't be your only stop in exploring the mysteries of the universe beyond our earth, but even if it is - well, you could do much worse."
106,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6036690-mack-hayden,5,"I've seen a few people in Internet forums over the years say if there's any religion they subscribe to, it's Saganism. Obviously, it's a clever turn of phrase, but it also speaks to the fact the cosmic, scientific truths Sagan conveys here really do activate the same neural pathways of more traditional sacred experience. It's hard to walk away from any page of this book without feeling an immense sense of awe at the natural world, reverence for the universe as a whole, and a deep ethical commitment to not screw up this incredible opportunity we've been given to exist on this planet in this universe. I'm eager to read his other stuff and watch the original series now. After years of hearing so much hype about Sagan's ability to clearly communicate the inspirational wonders of scientific discovery, I was so excited to find he not just met but exceeded my high expectations."
107,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/214318-roddy,5,"Stunning, beautiful prose, excellent description and metaphor, incredibly accessible. Its also one of those books where you get to see the author's own genius slip into the pages accidentally, every so often. This book is the book A Brief History of Time wants to be. Problem is, ABHOT is much more boring and high concept. Sagan is and ever will be the great teacher of the masses in my opinion. This book starts out simpler than ABHOT - here on earth. It begins with what you know and slowly expands your circle of knowledge with insightful description and simile (""the dancing of electrons with their nuclear partners across the surface of ice is like..."") Once you've got your basics, he starts taking you through the process of thinking about how it all might fit together, what scientists are currently working on (were, then working on) and thinking about. I don't hesitate to loan this to my most unscientific minded friends because its actually a great way to get them to stop thinking that stars are made from the souls of people who have died and that people just appeared on the face of the earth fully formed and wearing neckties, some 4000 years ago. Cosmos is also a very holistic book, it discusses evolution, life, the beginnings of the universe the end of the universe, the possiblity of life on other planets - and, very convincingly suggests what that might look like. It at least drives home that we have to step away from the life we are familiar with when we start theorizing what life might be like elsewhere. I can't say enough about how great this book is, how well it imbues its reader with scientific mojo, and how a book that covers textbook type material manages to be so readable. There are also (especially in the hardcover) some very pretty pictures. Note: The book cosmos was a companion/derivative of the PBS special ""Cosmos"" which Sagan worked to explain the mysteries of the universe in something like 14 episodes. You can probably buy this online if you're one of those total lamos that prefers ""the movie"". However, this movie is actually pretty awesome, albeit with very old school animations. Also Note: This book was written in the 1970s. From an outsider's perspective, physics and astrophysics (which is technically more what Cosmos is about) don't change much in 30 years, but in fact they do. Many of the theories Sagan puts forth have since proven to be quite accurate, and some, have understandably proven to be not quite accurate. Not knowing which these are won't hurt the reader; just learning how he begins his process of hypothesizing, and the idea of thinking big picture and how it all fits together is the real lesson of Cosmos. You'll need a recent astronomy or astrophysics (basic) textbook to find the plot holes though, so the recreational reader should fear not. "
108,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5120947-haritha,5,"I cannot begin to describe how amazing this book is. Of all the books I have read in my life till now, I will always remember Carl Sagan's Cosmos as the book that brought back meaning into my life. With wonderful humility, Dr. Sagan makes the unfathomably huge Cosmos come to life. His words, clearly written from the heart, are complemented by beautiful photographs and illustrations. I cannot imagine any reader being unmoved by what Dr. Sagan is telling us. As I progressed through the thirteen chapters that make this book, I went through phases of awe about how big the known Universe is, how little we know, how insignificant we are in the Cosmic scale of things, hopelessness of how petty even the biggest and most serious of international arguments (forget the minutiae of daily petty fights and grudges) are, poignancy about lost knowledge and civilizations, before I realized truly what Dr. Sagan wishes to say- human life is so, so, so, very precious. In the deafening noise of various philosophies that concern the meaning of life, Dr. Sagan's voice is the soothing balm of reason to chaffed and tired ears. This lonely planet called Earth in a forgotten corner of the Universe desperately needs more people like Dr. Sagan who can write as eloquent a book as the Cosmos. I recommend this book to each and every one. If I have kids, this book will be one they will quote as the formative book of their childhood. Carl Sagan, we miss you and you will always be my hero. "
109,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58035793-hiba-arrame,5,"It was absolutely a stunning experience, this book is a treasure, seriously a TREASURE! It has in it almost everything you'd want to know about our universe.I won't deny that I learned a lot, and slightly appeased my eager to science, Astronomy in particular.One thing that I'd like is having the show Cosmos produced again, it would be a great opportunity to introduce ""people"" into a world of wonders."
110,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14811808-liz,5,Even after all these years (I read it for the first time ten years ago) Cosmos is still of the best science books I've ever read. 
111,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,4,"Carl Sagan's boyish enthusiasm fills this book ranging widely on scientific topics while emphasizing his life-long passion for communication with other intelligence in the universe.Like Issac Asimov, Sagan is captivated by the wonder of our physical world and eager to explain it to the general public, though Sagan ventures more into speculation while Asimov is more detail oriented - not only wanting you to know about the atom, but about the parts and the forces involved, never departing from the facts.It's impossible to read this book without finding out new things, even though it was written almost 30 years ago. For example, I did not know that our sun was formed in the company of other stars that have since dispersed across the galaxy, nor did I know that the spiral arms of our Milky Way are areas of star formation that move independently of the stars they move through. Ten million years ago the earth was within one of these spiral arms, now it is on the edge.In Cosmos, Sagan moves out from the Sun as he also takes us forward from the dawn of science. Since I've read quite a bit about the history of scientific discovery, I found the first part of this book, dealing with that subject, far less interesting than the last third where Sagan takes us off into the vastness of space, ponders the chances of life on other worlds, informs us of the weirdness of black holes, describes the life of stars and explains the possibility of another dimension that we cannot experience. He addresses the reader with respect. You feel like you are in the company of a good friend who responds to something you say with, ""yeah, I've wondered about that too and here's what I think.""Sagan has a marvelous capacity to take a subject just so far without getting bogged down in detail. There were several times I became engaged in his topic and he would carry it forward far enough for my curiosity to be satisfied. I never had that disappointing feeling of the child who says to the storytelling parent, ""but THEN what happened!?"" only to be told the story is over.The style of writing is free-flowing and natural. I don't know that I've ever sped through a book like I did this one, quickly grasping what the author has to say. There is a special kind of genius in being able to take the most abstruse subjects and present them in an understandable way. Carl Sagan writes like he was born with a pen in his hand. At the same time, his imagination is so fertile that you never can tell where he will go with a subject. His speculations about contact with another intelligence in the universe are broad and deep, this obviously being where is heart is.After closing the book, I'm impressed by how microscopic humanity is in the vastness of space and how recent we are in the immensity of time. We've only had radio for 100 years, so our electromagnetic voice has reached only 100 light years from earth, enough to get to the nearest few dozen stars, yet we are aware of, able to see through optical or radio astronomy, objects that are billions of light years from us, dating to not long after the origin of the universe.The question that hangs over this book is - are we alone? Over the billions of stars that are out there, why is there no evidence at all of intelligence elsewhere?I'm tempted to get the e-reader version of this book simply to be able to look things up easily in the future. Sagan answers so many questions, it will be easy for me to forget the answers."
112,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72985691-osama-siddique,5,"What can one say about Sagan and Cosmos that hasn't already been said. Of course I keenly devoured the show, I did have very early and deep fascination for the heavens above, and I have zealously read this one quite a few times. What Sagan has is this unique and very rare ability not just to make complex things simple, or to really bring forth and radiate the sense of awe evoked by the scale and nature of the cosmos, or a vital sense of timing and drama - of course he had all that and he was a superb scientist, teacher, presenter, actor and dramatist all rolled in one - but the unique and rare ability I want to highlight is to retain and flamboyantly convey the same deep and abiding sense of wonder, joy and excitement in the reader or the viewer as he probably felt himself the very first time he started looking for patterns in the stars. Give this book to every child, every dreamer, every would be scientist, every poet and anyone with a questioning mind. Give it also to the myopic, the dullard, the accountant and the bore. For who knows it may cure all of them. It rolls out a cosmic tapestry woven out of stars - the stuff of dreams, awe and imagination - with a master conductor and choreographer explaining the melody and rhythm of our universe. This is one of those books that you sometimes hope you had not read. Simply so that you can rediscover it and reread it and relive the thrill. Hope you are voyaging happily somewhere amongst the stars Carl. "
113,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,5,"I don't get people who find this too dry, or lacking in a sense of wonder about the world. It's full of a sense of wonder, no less potent because Sagan was agnostic (not atheist, as some people say), and he expresses this almost poetically. While some of the science is falling out of date now, it's still worth reading Cosmos -- as a primer, and for Sagan's clear explanations of how the world works, and how our understanding got to this point.I actually have the DVDs of the series as well, and while I know from seeing clips the book and the series are very similar, I'm gonna have to get round to seeing it soon. And if you've never heard of Symphony of Science, I definitely recommend it -- my favourite is 'A Glorious Dawn'.One of the things reading this really made me wonder is what Sagan would think of what we've made of the world in the last two decades. We haven't destroyed ourselves yet, but we haven't yet disarmed, we haven't even convinced everybody that climate change exists, and we still haven't gone any further from our own small planet. I wish we still had Sagan, speaking clearly and rationally about all the problems we face -- particularly because he had hope for us, as well as a warning."
114,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84821-amy,5,"I think I could categorize this book as ""life-changing"" for me. I think the reason I am interested in subjects such as classics and anthropology can be traced to this book! It's a very broad look at the history of the universe and the history of science, so even though it is a good 20+ years old, most of it still stands. Sagan writes in an engaging and accessible manner. This is definitely a great book for people who are interested in science, but a little afraid to approach a book about it. Sagan looks at the universe with awe and wonder, and he conveys these feelings to the reader."
115,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8895258-andrew-culyer,5,"There are not many books that I keep. The only ones I do keep are the ones I know I am going to read again, and this is my third time reading this.As general books about physics go, this is the best one I've ever read, and believe me, I've read a few.The subject might not appeal to a lot of people, but if you want an introduction to the cosmos, the universe, and our planet's place in it, and you don't mind having your mind opened a little bit, then I completely recommend this bookIt's going to stay on my shelf forever (or, more accurately, til the day I die)"
116,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4902544-katie,4,"I love Carl Sagan. He really does make you feel like a kid again. His excitement and enthusiasm come through clearly right from the start of this book and I'd think it would be hard for anyone not to get swept up by it. The facts and mysteries of the cosmos are fascinating especially when Carl Sagan is talking about them. There are inevitably some dry and drawn out parts,being the reason for 4 stars, but all in all fantastic. "
117,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17196555-ankit,5,I don't think I will ever encounter a better book in science genre. I urge you to read this!

119,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18782259-neeraj-adhikari,5,"Every once in a while a book you read compels you to think in a different way and broadens your perception. It leaves you somewhat different, somewhat better of a person than you were before. But rarely, very rarely, a book fundamentally alters your outlook on life and the world around you. Cosmos is such a book.Us human beings have a tendency to become complacent and indifferent as we get trapped in the humdrum rhythm of life on earth. Our minds occupied by mundane, pressing issues, we tend to forget the absurd immensity of it the cosmos - both in space and in time. This book wakes you from that slumber and takes you on a voyage from the very beginning of time to now, from the microcosm of what makes up everything to the macrocosm of everything that is. It makes you realize just how puny and insignificant, yet how remarkably special we are. We are, in Sagan's words, “starstuff pondering the stars; organized assemblages of ten billion billion billion atoms considering the evolution of atoms”Our future depends on this realization. It depends on whether we will be able to avoid self-destructing before we set on daring voyages beyond our lonely solar system. Cosmos is a book that must be read and reread, because its lessons are ones we cannot afford to forget."
120,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6075900-gayane,4,"The span of subjects in Carl Sagan's Cosmos is wide, from the history of science to (almost) modern cosmology, from the theory of evolution to interstellar flights, from creating gods to knowing our own home - Solar System. One thing you should keep in mind: I would not recommend this book to anyone with only very basic knowledge in physics. Cosmos was first published in 1980, and science has developed enormously since. There are new theories about space that correct or completely reject some of the assumptions in this book. And for those with deeper knowledge in physics there's not much to learn, but personally for me it was interesting to see what cosmology was like in 70-80s.For example, when it comes to The Big Bang and black holes I take the side of the theory of singularities. There's nothing about singularities in Cosmos. We just have to accept that we didn't know much about black holes back in 1980. That they're not completely black, that they radiate? Also, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the suggested theory that our expanding Universe can be viewed as a black hole. Nope. There were other small disagreements I had during reading but that didn't make my experience any less exciting.As for the writing, Cosmos is accessible for anyone. There's no going into equations, diagrams or whatsoever.Coming to my favourite part of the book, it has to be chapters devoted to extraterrestrial life and search for it. I just can't help it.And, if you ignore generalized or incorrect theories in the book, there are a lot of philosophical questions raised to ponder about."
121,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,5,"Quite simply—and obviously—the best popular science book ever written. Using beautiful prose, solid reasoning, historical context, philosophical power, and lavish illustrations, Sagan does an unsurpassed job conveying the mystery of the cosmos to the average reader. To be sure, some of the material is dated or has been superseded by later research, but as a snapshot of the understanding as of 1980 it is excellent. Even better, for those up-to-date with current theories and observational data, the book offers a fun way to see for yourself how science evolves itself toward better understanding, unlike some other more rigid value systems. In fact, I first read this book thirty years ago, and re-read it recently to compare with the upcoming 2014 TV series ""Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey"" by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, billed as an update to Sagan's original series.Don't be afraid to read Sagan's book, all that's required is an open mind."
122,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/577893-geekchick,5,"While the PBS series is dated now in its special effects, the ability of Sagan to inspire the wonderment of science and our connection with the universe is unparalleled to this day. I recommend the hardback edition, which has excellent photographs and other images. I read somewhere that Cosmos has sold more books in foreign languages than any book other than the Bible. I hope this is true. It is a book that everyone should read, and if you can watch the series, do so! (just accept the goofy effects as being a product of their age). Maybe if we all realize that we are starstuff, we would work together to save ourselves and our planet, rather than continuing on our consumeristic, capitalistic path of self destruction. Carl is king!"
123,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,4,"Given that this book was published in 1980, it is naturally a bit dated. Sagan only dreams of rovers on Mars and rendezvous with comets, and is much concerned with the arms race between US and USSR. But the fundamentals of astrophysics and rich history of early space exploration are still very much the way they would be described in a modern popular science book. It captures imagination and gets you excited about the universe all over again. There certainly is value in reading classic science books today, even though we might have progressed significantly since then. "

131,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3744803-chris,4,"Carl Sagan's enthusiasm and passion for astronomy made Cosmos a pleasure to read. Sagan is a master at explaining astronomical concepts in layman's terms. But this book touches on not just cosmology, but also goes into the history of scientific thought and introduces the reader to some of the most influential scientists/philosophers who have contributed to man's understanding of the universe over the last 2500 years. His book also weaves in evolutionary concepts, chemistry and physics. Because Cosmos was written in the 1980's, some parts of the book are dated, but I really don't think this takes away from the overall story. It is well worth a read for someone interested in cosmology."
132,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5670472-mizzsandie,3,"I quite liked this book. Apart from Sagan’s ridicule of astrology and all things spiritual and God’ish, that is. That seemed quite counterintuitive and counterproductive, as well as close minded and prejudiced, after claiming his aim is to understand, and after he himself points out, that research needs to stay humble and open minded and to not fall into the trap of thinking it knows best.... [eyeroll]If we are made of the atoms of the universe, if there is gravity pulling planets and whole star systems and galaxies around, why not even entertain and investigate the astrological notions of humans being affected by astrological events?Because that is what’s at the base of astrology as a science, which isn’t very comparable to do with a few apparent ‘astrology’ lines in a weekly magazine. That’s like reducing math to a few basic calculations that you can do with your 10 fingers, and then ridiculing it as childish, claiming it not to be a science.Or claiming that art doesn’t exist or isn’t real, just because every child can draw, or hit a few piano keys, but not every child turns out to be an artist or a musical genius. If you claim to be a scientist, then please, at least study the complex math, astronomy and psychology behind real astrology, before you rule it out. You might want to reconsider your prejudices once you get to know the science behind it.....The same goes for spiritual notions and claims of extraterrestrial visits and messages like cropcircles that is either not even considered in the book or taken a firm stand against. Look a little deeper into it, and you will see that a lot of the explanations, views, causalities are actually both interesting and probable, and fit with many of the scienctific principles and finds that is described in this book, and so deserve a lot more attention from science than scorn. What about time- and placetravel possibilities? And maybe, just maybe, extraterrestrials ciukd have technology that they don’t have to obey the same ‘slow’ laws that we abide by? What about at least just CONSIDERING these possibilities?Maybe there is information and keys to apparent mysteries right under your noses, that the ‘scientists’ are just too arrogant to consider, and therefore they will miss out. Untill the next non-dogmatic, fearless, open minded, curious, thinker comes along and makes discoveries and deductions, and experiements, and finds new proof and open up the whole field again...Here is a possible hypotheses, that would actually help explain some of the plot holes and mysteries in the evolutionary theory that claims that EVERYTHING happens by chance [cue; eyeroll]. The hypothesis goes that extraterrestrials helped ‘seed’ the planet, and potentially has been involved throughout at certain points, watching or interacting, like scientist, and we are the experimental objects. So maybe they experimented on Earth, on us, and that helped evolution along. So then it would not ALL just be plain coincidence, some of course, as a scientist controls certain factors and let others unfold to see what happens, but there would be an intelligence at play. Adding an intelligence factor that can observe, adjust, and manipulate with the objects and the process, would explain a lot of the ‘gaps’ that evolution theories and biologist can’t fill out or wrap their minds around. Sagan actually comes very close to this idea, as he does wonder if maybe alien forces ARE already here, invisibly watching us. But then how come he hasn’t even considered the idea or made the leap that they might have been here on/off throughout the millennia, helping evolution along? And that maybe back then they interacted with us? And maybe many of the old religions and descriptions of Gods is just that; humans interacting with more advanced extraterrestrials, or Gods, as they might have perceived them to be? Worth considering and investigating if you are a true scientist, claiming to wanting to know, and not being blinded by your prejudices or what you claim to know as the Truth, I’d say.Also; a real and good scientist should be careful of their own bias and prejudice as it closes down their mind to possibilities. I liked the ties to biological, historical and sociological and psychological areas the most, as those are my main field of interests, and overall I felt enriched by reading this book and by the knowledge it presented. I only wish Sagan and other scientists would use their voice and knowledge even more to speak for Earth and humans though, and how we are headed for self-destruction if we don’t change our ways and values."
133,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3389050-sean-delauder,5,"My earliest recollections of this book are a mix of the blurred stars of the book jacket, the original airing of the PBS series, and its connection to my father. Considering I was only 3 years old at the time, this strikes me as an indication of its import. What I remember distinctly are sitting beside the couch and watching with my father as a long DNA strand stretched out across the television screen and images of the hardbound book in my father's personal library.A few years after the first run of this series on PBS, my father died. Cosmos always held a certain fascination for me, as a book, as I identified it with my father, but I never read it. Not until a few years ago. Perhaps just to see what my father saw, or to learn what brought the book and series such reverence.Oh, and what a world.Inspirational, life affirming, and filled with starry-eyed wonder, Sagan's magnum opus pleads the case for science as the preferred lens through which to see the world. Written in a time when humanity seemed to teeter on the brink of mutually assured destruction, Sagan argued for rational behavior, for the unity of humanity and absurdity of petty power struggles, for the scientific method as a way to interpret events around us rather than prominent pseudosciences (e.g., astrology) with tenets that seemed deliberately vague and arbitrary (and surprisingly easy to debunk, given their popularity), how we benefit from being skeptical, and the great potential of the human race.This book earns my unadulterated praise for building upon a philosophy that human beings can do well for themselves if they'd bother considering their ridiculous behaviors and learn how to act sensibly. The potential is there, as evinced by the leaps made by individuals throughout human history. Whether or not we choose to stand upon the shoulders of giants, or cower in their shadows, remains to be seen.I like to believe that this was a philosophy my father shared and would have taught me firsthand if he'd been around. It's a philosophy I feel I adopted anyway, and, as a result of this similarity, I want to believe in some way a bit of him is preserved in me.But don't just read the book. To get the full experience, watch the PBS series released in 1980, narrated by Sagan himself and scored by Vangelis (later known for 
Chariots of Fire
, 
The Last of the Mohicans
,and 
Blade Runner
, to name a few, but his breakthrough, and one of his best works, remains one of the themes to the 1970 French documentary on the animal kingdom, L'Apocalypse des animaux, la petite fille de la mer).There's a reason Cosmos is the most widely viewed PBS Series in the world. Beautifully stated and brilliantly scored, it tells the story of humanity, our universe, and how we fit within it.On a personal level, it is a bridge back to my father, an inspiring philosophy, a source of wonder regarding how our world might evolve if the portions of ourselves that influence what is best in us are lost, and whether or not we can avoid disaster long enough to fully realize our potential in spite of ourselves.If you can't read the book, or watch the series, do yourself a favor and, at the very least, watch this.ADDENDUM:It has come to my attention that an updated version of this landmark series will be hosted in 2014 by none other than Neil deGrasse Tyson, entitled COSMOS: A SpaceTime Odyssey. The trailer shows the new version is very true to the original, with Sagan's infamous Cosmic Calendar, the spaceship of the mind, Johannes Kepler, and several other memorable moments from the 1980s series."

135,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5594063-anurag,5,"When you spot a rainbow, you point it out to people who might not be looking. When you see a shooting star flash across the sky but your friends miss it, you wish they could have seen it as well. It is in our nature to share the wonder of extraordinary experiences with others. We do it instinctively. Perhaps, we want so desperately for others to look because we know, subconsciously, that there is no way we could describe the hues of that rainbow or the awe inspired by that shooting star in our own words. I feel something similar about this book and I hope that you will read it for yourself. This book is a history of science and the culmination of one man's lifelong wonder for it. It is a paean to the fact that we are not the center of the universe, as individuals or species, and how that is in fact a beautiful thing. If nothing else, you will cherish that one lesson for long after you read this. I know I will."
136,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115626-nadine-jones,5,"This was absolutely amazing, and I can't believe it took me so long to get around to reading it. If you read only one book in your lifetime, this should be that book. It covers everything: the origins of the Universe, the creation of chemical elements, formation of planets, evolution of life, the slow process humankind has gone through to discover the world and Universe, why it has taken so long to relearn what was lost in the Dark Ages, the harmful effects of religion, the reason for so many Creation myths, the possibility of other life in the Universe, the danger of nuclear war (happily, this discussion felt quite dated), and why space exploration is important.I consider myself fortunate to have seen Mr Sagan speak, on the danger of nuclear proliferation. He was a fantastic speaker; I should have known then that his books would be equally (if not more!) fantastic."
137,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11713906-eduard-gafton,5,"“Cosmos is a Greek word for the order of the universe. It is, in a way, the opposite of Chaos. It implies the deep interconnectedness of all things. It conveys awe for the intricate and subtle way in which the universe is put together.” “The Cosmos is all that is or was or ever will be. Our feeblest contemplations of the Cosmos stir us -- there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, of falling from a height. We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries.” "
138,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32563817-douglas,2,"This would have been a great book at the time of its publication, but in 2019 it is a book about astronomy that was written a decade before the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope. In other words, it is quite outdated. Sagan is a talented writer, but I found myself tiring of his overawed tone by the later chapters. As work became significantly busier about halfway through reading this, I ended up leaving it to sit for over two weeks with just 78 pages left to read. Realistically, if I had been enjoying it more I would have found the time to finish it. If nothing else it provided a lesson in why one should not choose a book by fame alone.2/5 stars"

I only heard less about Carl Sagan before I read this book, but now I can understand why he is among the best respected scholars of all time. Sagan, in depth knowledge and passion in every area of sciences cannot go without amusing anyone. Books not only about genesis of universe but speaks very well about origins of life and evolution, hence you feel more like complete handbook of science when you read it. I got glued to the book throughout, it is just fascinating as it is!A Must Read, never to be missed! "
140,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52228684-salman-israr,0,"Brilliant as show is.Sagan's prose is magical, a journey from Big Bang to evolution of stars, planets, solar systems, life on earth,possibility of extraterristrial life to history of Homo sapiens to Moons of Mars,Saturn etc.,an enthralling voyage."
141,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974210-erik-graff,3,"This would serve as a good, albeit somewhat dated, introduction to astronomy, astrophysics and cosmology. It was written with reference to the popular 13-part television series hosted by author Sagan and would be most profitably read subsequent to a viewing. I myself saw very little of the series--perhaps only the portion on Mars."

147,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6824064-zhixin,5,"Cosmos is a joyous romp through space and time; genuine wonder at the beauty of galaxies, the music of spheres, the mountain of history it took to get us to the knowledge we possess about the universe today. It is not so much a science book as it is a book about everything, giving us much-needed context on the scale of things — how vast a universe measured in light years, how temporary a human lifespan, how microscopic the building blocks of matter — and how splendous the whole concoction: tiny electrical forces of push and pull holding together entire galaxies, and creating beings capable of marvelling at it all.I especially enjoyed the chapters bringing me to Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, and allowing me to bear witness to the birth and death of stars. Venus: a hellish place with 480°C surface temperature and 90 atmospheres of surface pressure, and an eternal rain of sulphuric acid in the atmosphere which never reaches the surface due to the high temperature. Mars: open bodies of water are impossible because the pressure is too low to keep it from boiling. Jupiter: a failed star radiating light in the infrared spectrum, big enough to contain a thousand Earths. And stars: their gravity brings particles close together for nuclear forces to overcome the natural repulsion between protons and electrons, fusing hydrogen particles together to form helium and giving off gamma photons in the process. When all the hydrogen is fused, the mass of the star determines its eventual fate into black dwarf, neutron star, or black hole. Along the way, the methods that astronomy has developed, like astronomical spectroscopy, to deduce these faraway conditions, and the expeditions — including the failures — to these planets for verification.Of noteworthy mention is Sagan’s inclusion of the process of arriving at our present conclusions, as he briefly presents a history of mistaken beliefs continuously corrected by scientific inquiry. What this serves to reinforce is the idea that what we know about the world is subject to change — but this is beautiful because we, coming later on the timeline of human civilisation, can still contribute to this giant repository of knowledge.Science is not just a pure pursuit of knowledge; it is very much affected by prevailing systems of power and beliefs. Sagan synthesizes thousands of years of (mostly Western) civilised history to present an argument for the causes of the acceleration and deceleration of the rate of scientific discovery. A great scientific boom occurred around the 5th to 6th century BC in Ionia, with the seeds of thought for a world formed not by Gods but by natural processes, the establishment of medical tradition (Hippocrates), the conception of the atom (Greek for unable to be cut), and many more, because, Sagan believes, it was comprised of a group of islands with no single concentration of power to enforce social and intellectual conformity. Diversity is the key ingredient to progress, providing a healthy cross fertilisation of ideas. Yet its reliance on the slave economy led to a lack of impetus for advancing technology, as well as an increased disdain towards manual labour, which was placed in opposition to spiritual pursuits, associated with the so-called elites. Ironically, Pythagoras and his followers, with their belief in pure theory unsullied by the world, contributed to the demise of progress, and would later influence a Christianity that suppressed free thought in order to maintain its hold on power.I found the last couple of chapters — arguments for the possibility of life elsewhere, and a warning against self-destruction through war — less satisfying than the rest of the book, as it wades into social science territory that comes off less as condensed material than as simplistic models. I raised my eyebrows at Sagan’s summary of a James W. Prescott’s findings — cultures lavishing physical affection on infants and allowing expression of sexual activity in adolescents are disinclined to violence — which Sagan proffers as the solution to world peace. While well-intentioned, it does not stand up in the strength of its argument to the rest of the book, and would perhaps have been better left as a couple of concluding paragraphs painting our possible paths: humanity annihilated through nuclear wars, versus the continued potential for awe at the worlds left for us to discover.This is a book in love with the universe; you will come off it with a renewed sense of wonder, and a growing curiosity for all things space and quantum.4.5/5"
148,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,4,"I have read this book after having watched the (amazing!) thirteen parts documentary, so, to be honest, here's just a template to the show. In fact, I couldn't but hear Sagan's voice and picture images from the show while reading; a great testimony to how striking and enthralling 'Cosmos' is! Having said that, who doesn't like Carl Sagan? On paper or live, he truly owns it! There is something akin to childish wonders with him, and he never fails to take you in amazing journey. 'Cosmos' the book is like 'Cosmos' the documentary: a wealth of informations that leaves you thirsty for more, a true classic that goes beyond space to delve into history, biology, or, again, ecology in a breath-taking journey which is, in the end, all about us - the human drive to understand, explore, conquer. Sure, being passionate, lyric, enthusiastic, it suffers at time of wild speculations! Embracing such a wide range of topics, some are obviously also more engrossing than others, depending on your own personal likes and dislikes. But, considering this is was written about thirty years ago, it remains rich in prophecies, and, more importantly, still is relevant through and through. What else to add? Carl Sagan was one of those great mind who had the ability to fire up your imagination. 'Cosmos' is, again, one of his many books proving the point. Thrilling! "
149,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88527427-daniel-aronskind,4,"Certainly dense but once you get into a passage it’s enthralling. Some concepts were raised in ways that made me put the book down and reconsider what I’d read. Quotes:“The secrets of evolution are death and time.”“What a marvelous cooperation arrangement—plants and animals each inhaling the other’s exhalations, a kind of planet-wide mutual mouth-to-stoma resuscitation, the entire elegant cycle powered by a star 150 million kilometers away.”“But if the Cosmos is closed and light cannot escape from it, then it may be perfectly correct to deceive the universe as a black hole. If you wish to know what it is like inside a black hole, look around you.”It’s also insane how stacked the 6th century BC was: “Thales, Anaximander, and Pythagoras in Ionia, Pharaoh Necho in Egypt, Zoroaster in Persia, Confucius and Lao-Tse in China, Jewish prophets in Israel, Egypt and Babylonia, and Guatama Buddha in India”."
150,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6075900-gayane,4,"The span of subjects in Carl Sagan's Cosmos is wide, from the history of science to (almost) modern cosmology, from the theory of evolution to interstellar flights, from creating gods to knowing our own home - Solar System. One thing you should keep in mind: I would not recommend this book to anyone with only very basic knowledge in physics. Cosmos was first published in 1980, and science has developed enormously since. There are new theories about space that correct or completely reject some of the assumptions in this book. And for those with deeper knowledge in physics there's not much to learn, but personally for me it was interesting to see what cosmology was like in 70-80s.For example, when it comes to The Big Bang and black holes I take the side of the theory of singularities. There's nothing about singularities in Cosmos. We just have to accept that we didn't know much about black holes back in 1980. That they're not completely black, that they radiate? Also, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the suggested theory that our expanding Universe can be viewed as a black hole. Nope. There were other small disagreements I had during reading but that didn't make my experience any less exciting.As for the writing, Cosmos is accessible for anyone. There's no going into equations, diagrams or whatsoever.Coming to my favourite part of the book, it has to be chapters devoted to extraterrestrial life and search for it. I just can't help it.And, if you ignore generalized or incorrect theories in the book, there are a lot of philosophical questions raised to ponder about."
151,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,5,"Quite simply—and obviously—the best popular science book ever written. Using beautiful prose, solid reasoning, historical context, philosophical power, and lavish illustrations, Sagan does an unsurpassed job conveying the mystery of the cosmos to the average reader. To be sure, some of the material is dated or has been superseded by later research, but as a snapshot of the understanding as of 1980 it is excellent. Even better, for those up-to-date with current theories and observational data, the book offers a fun way to see for yourself how science evolves itself toward better understanding, unlike some other more rigid value systems. In fact, I first read this book thirty years ago, and re-read it recently to compare with the upcoming 2014 TV series ""Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey"" by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, billed as an update to Sagan's original series.Don't be afraid to read Sagan's book, all that's required is an open mind."
152,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/577893-geekchick,5,"While the PBS series is dated now in its special effects, the ability of Sagan to inspire the wonderment of science and our connection with the universe is unparalleled to this day. I recommend the hardback edition, which has excellent photographs and other images. I read somewhere that Cosmos has sold more books in foreign languages than any book other than the Bible. I hope this is true. It is a book that everyone should read, and if you can watch the series, do so! (just accept the goofy effects as being a product of their age). Maybe if we all realize that we are starstuff, we would work together to save ourselves and our planet, rather than continuing on our consumeristic, capitalistic path of self destruction. Carl is king!"
153,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,4,"Given that this book was published in 1980, it is naturally a bit dated. Sagan only dreams of rovers on Mars and rendezvous with comets, and is much concerned with the arms race between US and USSR. But the fundamentals of astrophysics and rich history of early space exploration are still very much the way they would be described in a modern popular science book. It captures imagination and gets you excited about the universe all over again. There certainly is value in reading classic science books today, even though we might have progressed significantly since then. "

His book also weaves in evolutionary concepts, chemistry and physics. Because Cosmos was written in the 1980's, some parts of the book are dated, but I really don't think this takes away from the overall story. It is well worth a read for someone interested in cosmology."
162,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5670472-mizzsandie,3,"I quite liked this book. Apart from Sagan’s ridicule of astrology and all things spiritual and God’ish, that is. That seemed quite counterintuitive and counterproductive, as well as close minded and prejudiced, after claiming his aim is to understand, and after he himself points out, that research needs to stay humble and open minded and to not fall into the trap of thinking it knows best.... [eyeroll]If we are made of the atoms of the universe, if there is gravity pulling planets and whole star systems and galaxies around, why not even entertain and investigate the astrological notions of humans being affected by astrological events?Because that is what’s at the base of astrology as a science, which isn’t very comparable to do with a few apparent ‘astrology’ lines in a weekly magazine. That’s like reducing math to a few basic calculations that you can do with your 10 fingers, and then ridiculing it as childish, claiming it not to be a science.Or claiming that art doesn’t exist or isn’t real, just because every child can draw, or hit a few piano keys, but not every child turns out to be an artist or a musical genius. If you claim to be a scientist, then please, at least study the complex math, astronomy and psychology behind real astrology, before you rule it out. You might want to reconsider your prejudices once you get to know the science behind it.....The same goes for spiritual notions and claims of extraterrestrial visits and messages like cropcircles that is either not even considered in the book or taken a firm stand against. Look a little deeper into it, and you will see that a lot of the explanations, views, causalities are actually both interesting and probable, and fit with many of the scienctific principles and finds that is described in this book, and so deserve a lot more attention from science than scorn. What about time- and placetravel possibilities? And maybe, just maybe, extraterrestrials ciukd have technology that they don’t have to obey the same ‘slow’ laws that we abide by? What about at least just CONSIDERING these possibilities?Maybe there is information and keys to apparent mysteries right under your noses, that the ‘scientists’ are just too arrogant to consider, and therefore they will miss out. Untill the next non-dogmatic, fearless, open minded, curious, thinker comes along and makes discoveries and deductions, and experiements, and finds new proof and open up the whole field again...Here is a possible hypotheses, that would actually help explain some of the plot holes and mysteries in the evolutionary theory that claims that EVERYTHING happens by chance [cue; eyeroll]. The hypothesis goes that extraterrestrials helped ‘seed’ the planet, and potentially has been involved throughout at certain points, watching or interacting, like scientist, and we are the experimental objects. So maybe they experimented on Earth, on us, and that helped evolution along. So then it would not ALL just be plain coincidence, some of course, as a scientist controls certain factors and let others unfold to see what happens, but there would be an intelligence at play. Adding an intelligence factor that can observe, adjust, and manipulate with the objects and the process, would explain a lot of the ‘gaps’ that evolution theories and biologist can’t fill out or wrap their minds around. Sagan actually comes very close to this idea, as he does wonder if maybe alien forces ARE already here, invisibly watching us. But then how come he hasn’t even considered the idea or made the leap that they might have been here on/off throughout the millennia, helping evolution along? And that maybe back then they interacted with us? And maybe many of the old religions and descriptions of Gods is just that; humans interacting with more advanced extraterrestrials, or Gods, as they might have perceived them to be? Worth considering and investigating if you are a true scientist, claiming to wanting to know, and not being blinded by your prejudices or what you claim to know as the Truth, I’d say.Also; a real and good scientist should be careful of their own bias and prejudice as it closes down their mind to possibilities. I liked the ties to biological, historical and sociological and psychological areas the most, as those are my main field of interests, and overall I felt enriched by reading this book and by the knowledge it presented. I only wish Sagan and other scientists would use their voice and knowledge even more to speak for Earth and humans though, and how we are headed for self-destruction if we don’t change our ways and values."
163,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3389050-sean-delauder,5,"My earliest recollections of this book are a mix of the blurred stars of the book jacket, the original airing of the PBS series, and its connection to my father. Considering I was only 3 years old at the time, this strikes me as an indication of its import. What I remember distinctly are sitting beside the couch and watching with my father as a long DNA strand stretched out across the television screen and images of the hardbound book in my father's personal library.A few years after the first run of this series on PBS, my father died. Cosmos always held a certain fascination for me, as a book, as I identified it with my father, but I never read it. Not until a few years ago. Perhaps just to see what my father saw, or to learn what brought the book and series such reverence.Oh, and what a world.Inspirational, life affirming, and filled with starry-eyed wonder, Sagan's magnum opus pleads the case for science as the preferred lens through which to see the world. Written in a time when humanity seemed to teeter on the brink of mutually assured destruction, Sagan argued for rational behavior, for the unity of humanity and absurdity of petty power struggles, for the scientific method as a way to interpret events around us rather than prominent pseudosciences (e.g., astrology) with tenets that seemed deliberately vague and arbitrary (and surprisingly easy to debunk, given their popularity), how we benefit from being skeptical, and the great potential of the human race.This book earns my unadulterated praise for building upon a philosophy that human beings can do well for themselves if they'd bother considering their ridiculous behaviors and learn how to act sensibly. The potential is there, as evinced by the leaps made by individuals throughout human history. Whether or not we choose to stand upon the shoulders of giants, or cower in their shadows, remains to be seen.I like to believe that this was a philosophy my father shared and would have taught me firsthand if he'd been around. It's a philosophy I feel I adopted anyway, and, as a result of this similarity, I want to believe in some way a bit of him is preserved in me.But don't just read the book. To get the full experience, watch the PBS series released in 1980, narrated by Sagan himself and scored by Vangelis (later known for 
Chariots of Fire
, 
The Last of the Mohicans
,and 
Blade Runner
, to name a few, but his breakthrough, and one of his best works, remains one of the themes to the 1970 French documentary on the animal kingdom, L'Apocalypse des animaux, la petite fille de la mer).There's a reason Cosmos is the most widely viewed PBS Series in the world. Beautifully stated and brilliantly scored, it tells the story of humanity, our universe, and how we fit within it.On a personal level, it is a bridge back to my father, an inspiring philosophy, a source of wonder regarding how our world might evolve if the portions of ourselves that influence what is best in us are lost, and whether or not we can avoid disaster long enough to fully realize our potential in spite of ourselves.If you can't read the book, or watch the series, do yourself a favor and, at the very least, watch this.ADDENDUM:It has come to my attention that an updated version of this landmark series will be hosted in 2014 by none other than Neil deGrasse Tyson, entitled COSMOS: A SpaceTime Odyssey. The trailer shows the new version is very true to the original, with Sagan's infamous Cosmic Calendar, the spaceship of the mind, Johannes Kepler, and several other memorable moments from the 1980s series."

165,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5594063-anurag,5,"When you spot a rainbow, you point it out to people who might not be looking. When you see a shooting star flash across the sky but your friends miss it, you wish they could have seen it as well. It is in our nature to share the wonder of extraordinary experiences with others. We do it instinctively. Perhaps, we want so desperately for others to look because we know, subconsciously, that there is no way we could describe the hues of that rainbow or the awe inspired by that shooting star in our own words. I feel something similar about this book and I hope that you will read it for yourself. This book is a history of science and the culmination of one man's lifelong wonder for it. It is a paean to the fact that we are not the center of the universe, as individuals or species, and how that is in fact a beautiful thing. If nothing else, you will cherish that one lesson for long after you read this. I know I will."
166,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115626-nadine-jones,5,"This was absolutely amazing, and I can't believe it took me so long to get around to reading it. If you read only one book in your lifetime, this should be that book. It covers everything: the origins of the Universe, the creation of chemical elements, formation of planets, evolution of life, the slow process humankind has gone through to discover the world and Universe, why it has taken so long to relearn what was lost in the Dark Ages, the harmful effects of religion, the reason for so many Creation myths, the possibility of other life in the Universe, the danger of nuclear war (happily, this discussion felt quite dated), and why space exploration is important.I consider myself fortunate to have seen Mr Sagan speak, on the danger of nuclear proliferation. He was a fantastic speaker; I should have known then that his books would be equally (if not more!) fantastic."
167,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11713906-eduard-gafton,5,"“Cosmos is a Greek word for the order of the universe. It is, in a way, the opposite of Chaos. It implies the deep interconnectedness of all things. It conveys awe for the intricate and subtle way in which the universe is put together.” “The Cosmos is all that is or was or ever will be. Our feeblest contemplations of the Cosmos stir us -- there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, of falling from a height. We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries.” "
168,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32563817-douglas,2,"This would have been a great book at the time of its publication, but in 2019 it is a book about astronomy that was written a decade before the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope. In other words, it is quite outdated. Sagan is a talented writer, but I found myself tiring of his overawed tone by the later chapters. As work became significantly busier about halfway through reading this, I ended up leaving it to sit for over two weeks with just 78 pages left to read. Realistically, if I had been enjoying it more I would have found the time to finish it. If nothing else it provided a lesson in why one should not choose a book by fame alone.2/5 stars"
169,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11732515-kuhajeyan-gunaratnam,5,"Absolutely stunning book. I only heard less about Carl Sagan before I read this book, but now I can understand why he is among the best respected scholars of all time. Sagan, in depth knowledge and passion in every area of sciences cannot go without amusing anyone. Books not only about genesis of universe but speaks very well about origins of life and evolution, hence you feel more like complete handbook of science when you read it. I got glued to the book throughout, it is just fascinating as it is!A Must Read, never to be missed! "
170,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52228684-salman-israr,0,"Brilliant as show is.Sagan's prose is magical, a journey from Big Bang to evolution of stars, planets, solar systems, life on earth,possibility of extraterristrial life to history of Homo sapiens to Moons of Mars,Saturn etc.,an enthralling voyage."
171,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974210-erik-graff,3,"This would serve as a good, albeit somewhat dated, introduction to astronomy, astrophysics and cosmology. It was written with reference to the popular 13-part television series hosted by author Sagan and would be most profitably read subsequent to a viewing. I myself saw very little of the series--perhaps only the portion on Mars."

It wasn't just astronomy that I learned while watching Cosmos. It was inspiring, coaxing young minds to go out and look at the sky and imagine. Astronomy still interests me to date and the book is definitely a favorite. "

177,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6824064-zhixin,5,"Cosmos is a joyous romp through space and time; genuine wonder at the beauty of galaxies, the music of spheres, the mountain of history it took to get us to the knowledge we possess about the universe today. It is not so much a science book as it is a book about everything, giving us much-needed context on the scale of things — how vast a universe measured in light years, how temporary a human lifespan, how microscopic the building blocks of matter — and how splendous the whole concoction: tiny electrical forces of push and pull holding together entire galaxies, and creating beings capable of marvelling at it all.I especially enjoyed the chapters bringing me to Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, and allowing me to bear witness to the birth and death of stars. Venus: a hellish place with 480°C surface temperature and 90 atmospheres of surface pressure, and an eternal rain of sulphuric acid in the atmosphere which never reaches the surface due to the high temperature. Mars: open bodies of water are impossible because the pressure is too low to keep it from boiling. Jupiter: a failed star radiating light in the infrared spectrum, big enough to contain a thousand Earths. And stars: their gravity brings particles close together for nuclear forces to overcome the natural repulsion between protons and electrons, fusing hydrogen particles together to form helium and giving off gamma photons in the process. When all the hydrogen is fused, the mass of the star determines its eventual fate into black dwarf, neutron star, or black hole. Along the way, the methods that astronomy has developed, like astronomical spectroscopy, to deduce these faraway conditions, and the expeditions — including the failures — to these planets for verification.Of noteworthy mention is Sagan’s inclusion of the process of arriving at our present conclusions, as he briefly presents a history of mistaken beliefs continuously corrected by scientific inquiry. What this serves to reinforce is the idea that what we know about the world is subject to change — but this is beautiful because we, coming later on the timeline of human civilisation, can still contribute to this giant repository of knowledge.Science is not just a pure pursuit of knowledge; it is very much affected by prevailing systems of power and beliefs. Sagan synthesizes thousands of years of (mostly Western) civilised history to present an argument for the causes of the acceleration and deceleration of the rate of scientific discovery. A great scientific boom occurred around the 5th to 6th century BC in Ionia, with the seeds of thought for a world formed not by Gods but by natural processes, the establishment of medical tradition (Hippocrates), the conception of the atom (Greek for unable to be cut), and many more, because, Sagan believes, it was comprised of a group of islands with no single concentration of power to enforce social and intellectual conformity. Diversity is the key ingredient to progress, providing a healthy cross fertilisation of ideas. Yet its reliance on the slave economy led to a lack of impetus for advancing technology, as well as an increased disdain towards manual labour, which was placed in opposition to spiritual pursuits, associated with the so-called elites. Ironically, Pythagoras and his followers, with their belief in pure theory unsullied by the world, contributed to the demise of progress, and would later influence a Christianity that suppressed free thought in order to maintain its hold on power.I found the last couple of chapters — arguments for the possibility of life elsewhere, and a warning against self-destruction through war — less satisfying than the rest of the book, as it wades into social science territory that comes off less as condensed material than as simplistic models. I raised my eyebrows at Sagan’s summary of a James W. Prescott’s findings — cultures lavishing physical affection on infants and allowing expression of sexual activity in adolescents are disinclined to violence — which Sagan proffers as the solution to world peace. While well-intentioned, it does not stand up in the strength of its argument to the rest of the book, and would perhaps have been better left as a couple of concluding paragraphs painting our possible paths: humanity annihilated through nuclear wars, versus the continued potential for awe at the worlds left for us to discover.This is a book in love with the universe; you will come off it with a renewed sense of wonder, and a growing curiosity for all things space and quantum.4.5/5"
178,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,4,"I have read this book after having watched the (amazing!) thirteen parts documentary, so, to be honest, here's just a template to the show. In fact, I couldn't but hear Sagan's voice and picture images from the show while reading; a great testimony to how striking and enthralling 'Cosmos' is! Having said that, who doesn't like Carl Sagan? On paper or live, he truly owns it! There is something akin to childish wonders with him, and he never fails to take you in amazing journey. 'Cosmos' the book is like 'Cosmos' the documentary: a wealth of informations that leaves you thirsty for more, a true classic that goes beyond space to delve into history, biology, or, again, ecology in a breath-taking journey which is, in the end, all about us - the human drive to understand, explore, conquer. Sure, being passionate, lyric, enthusiastic, it suffers at time of wild speculations! Embracing such a wide range of topics, some are obviously also more engrossing than others, depending on your own personal likes and dislikes. But, considering this is was written about thirty years ago, it remains rich in prophecies, and, more importantly, still is relevant through and through. What else to add? Carl Sagan was one of those great mind who had the ability to fire up your imagination. 'Cosmos' is, again, one of his many books proving the point. Thrilling! "
179,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88527427-daniel-aronskind,4,"Certainly dense but once you get into a passage it’s enthralling. Some concepts were raised in ways that made me put the book down and reconsider what I’d read. Quotes:“The secrets of evolution are death and time.”“What a marvelous cooperation arrangement—plants and animals each inhaling the other’s exhalations, a kind of planet-wide mutual mouth-to-stoma resuscitation, the entire elegant cycle powered by a star 150 million kilometers away.”“But if the Cosmos is closed and light cannot escape from it, then it may be perfectly correct to deceive the universe as a black hole. If you wish to know what it is like inside a black hole, look around you.”It’s also insane how stacked the 6th century BC was: “Thales, Anaximander, and Pythagoras in Ionia, Pharaoh Necho in Egypt, Zoroaster in Persia, Confucius and Lao-Tse in China, Jewish prophets in Israel, Egypt and Babylonia, and Guatama Buddha in India”."
180,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39746437-jonraven,4,"A great read. Lots of interesting information. This is similar to a textbook, but written better. You could use this in a college level intro science/astronomy course if you desired! Much of it is historical.Chapter 7 on the Ionians was the best chapter. He can be a bit long winded from time to time. Really the book deserves a 5/5, but I have to take a star off because It's just not as good at conveying the more complex topics, as say, Asimov was in his science books. No one compares to Asimov in my experience, so perhaps this is a harsh comparison.I highly recommend this book! Bear in mind that this is more or less for the layman, but I'd say more targeted toward the somewhat educated. For the educated reader, this is great. For less educated persons, they'd probably still grasp most of the ideas, but have a hard time with maintaining interest because at times he does go on long tangents and the science might be a bit much for someone of lower reading level without a science background. Also, it's not a short book. MID READ SPOILSChapter 7 was phenomenal!! The story of the great Ionians of the Aegean Sea discovering science, and coming to many modern day conclusions, was exhilarating and yet also saddening... for because of Pythagoras and of the Pythagoreans, his devout followings firmness of beliefs in their Master Pythagoras... new ideas were shunned... and because the slave trade that thrust forward merchantilism and with it science, was ironically its undoing, as it created a new generation of lazy rich people, and poor slaves, neither of whom had any interest in science. Democritus had all his books burned and Plato encouraged this. Plato propped up his tyrant leader of the days. Dreadfully saddening. So the great science was pushed back and replaced with mysticism and un-empirical thought processes. Of course we still had Alexandria!!! But alas, we know what happened there... yet another tragedy and blow to science. We were well on our way to modern science 2500 years ago... and a bunch of zealots and slave owners basically screwed us all and repressed incredible breakthroughs! In fact Galileo call Copernicus restorer and confirmer, not discoverer of the heliocentric concept! Because it was Aristarcus who in fact discovered the hypothesis of the heliocentric model of the universe! Over 2000 years ago!!!"

184,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7260075-fee-anyau,3,Took me one whole year to finish this book. That probably explains much about my motivation in reading this genre.

This isn't a criticism of the book or of the narration, both of which are excellent. It's because I recently read and loved Welcome to the Universe: An Astrophysical Tour which is quite similar in the ground it covers, equally well written and, crucially, bang up to date in the science. Sagan's book was undoubtedly ground-breaking and later popular science books owe much to his legacy, but I feel if I was recommending a comprehensive pop science book about life, the universe and everything, it would make sense to recommend a new one, rather than one that, however well done at the time, undoubtedly now contains some stuff that has been superceded by later discoveries. I thought I might find it interesting to see how the popularisation of science began, but... well, I didn't.So I'm giving it four stars because it undoubtedly was a great book in its time and still has lots of interest in it, but scientific knowledge is ever-changing, so that, unlike in other fields, the newest one is probably always going to be the most informative (so long as it's written by the current leaders in the field)."

The knowledge was a little dated seen as I'm reading it 39 years after it's first publication but it was still enjoyable and interesting. Sagan's writing is full of a great personality that shines throughout, creating and testing out his own quirky wonders and imaginations as new ideas to be explored.'A book is made from a tree. It is an assemblage of flat, flexible parts (still called' leaves' ) imprinted with dark pigmented squiggles. One glance of it and you hear the voice of another person - perhaps someone dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, the author is speaking, clearly and silently, inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people, citizens of distant epochs, who never knew one another. Books break the shackles of time, proof that humans can work magic.'"

189,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32717494-venky,4,"In this monumental tour de force, the late Carl Sagan pays a stupendous tribute to Science, the vast Phalanx of Stars adorning a plethora of Galaxies and to the serendipitous findings that are the efforts of a few stellar men and women who strove to understand Evolution, Cosmos and the very meaning of life.In this gripping achievement of common sense, thought and reason,this beloved and genial astronomer does his best to make us understand our purpose on this Planet. Exquisitely tracing our path of evolution that involved, in what may seem to be an absurd improbability, a Devonian fish, to the act of firing a couple of Interstellar Spaceships (Voyagers I & II) into the depths of outer space, Carl Sagan eloquently, elegantly and enthusiastically holds forth on the Cosmological significance that is essential to appreciate our existence on Planet Earth. Although an encomium to Science, there runs throughout the book an invisible, but strong thread of spirituality and deep philosophy. Every page strives and, and succeeds in no small measure in underscoring the significantly infinitesimal position that mankind occupies in the Cosmic Playground. But completely ignorant of such a tiny confinement in the theatre of Space, man chooses to continually envelope himself in a self created blanket of vice and vicissitude. How vainglorious and trivial are the self proclaimed triumphs of the Homo Sapien when compared to the stirring functionalities of the Cosmos!Although some of the concepts such as black holes, quarks and supernovae pose a veritable challenge to even able quantum physicists, let alone an unsuspecting layman, Sagan takes care to handhold the reader through the noxious admixture of gases and vapours and deftly evades the path of careening comets and interstellar boulders. Sagan is not just an unflinching servant of Science, but an admirable teacher of the subject that is pinned to his heart. 'Cosmos' will stand the sternest test of anytime. But more than anything else it will serve as a beautiful and timely reminder to we earthlings to re-examine our foibles and follies and channel our tangible resources and intangible potentials towards the causes of empowerment, education and enlightenment instead of getting enmeshed, entangled and embroiled in the temporary passions of Power, Politics and Perniciousness. ""COSMOS"" - A HUMBLING BUT FULFILLING JOURNEY!"
190,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/830884-tony-viardo,5,"Full disclosure here, Carl Sagan is a personal inspiration for me. A person who has affected my philosophy and thinking ever since I first heard of him, watch his television documentaries, and then took the time to read his writing. The day he died, I felt a huge sense of loss, not for myself, but the world. This man was not only brilliant, a genius of the order that you see only once a generation, but he had the soul and sensitivity that defines the best of humanity. Overstating? I don't think so; he not only had the mental capacity to see the world differently, but he always--in his writing, science, achievements and activities--seemed to think FIRST, how any phenomena would impact the entire human race. And his conclusions, scientific or otherwise, always led him to the same course of action: A call for understanding, mutual respect and simple caring for one another. This is why he impacted me, and in many ways I carry on his mission.About this book: it captures the infectious wonderment of Sagan's mind and curiosity. His discussions about astronomy not only makes the science easy to grasp, it RIGHTFULLY puts the reader in absolute awe at the vastness and genius of how the universe is put together. This book, which is an encapsulation of the TV series of the same name--which incidentally helped spread science to more people around the world than any piece of scientific literature in history--teaches and informs, but inspires as well. Carl Sagan believed that knowledge, pure knowledge of how things work, is a magical bridge that will erase the differences that divide people, and build mutual understanding through awareness of our common humanity. This he believed will eventually over time, bring the world together, and keep us from destroying ourselves. Cosmos was a contribution to this dream by one of the greatest thinkers of our time; in history really. Sagan always saw the big picture, and by helping us see the same, he figured we could rise above the petty things that destroy us (like ignorance, fear and hatred). I'm sure if he were alive to write this review he would say: it won't solve all your problems or answer all your questions, but hopefully it can give you even one iota of knowledge and understanding, that will lift up your life and help you enrich the lives of those around you as well."

People don’t generally associate science with poetry, but the healthy dose of romanticism in Cosmos makes the connection undeniable. Paired with empirical knowledge, concise explanations, and vision, it is undoubtedly one of the best scientific works of the generation. And Sagan, with his vast experience and understanding of the cosmos, his enthusiasm regarding it, and, most importantly, his humble acceptance of the fact that we, as humans, are nothing more than a blip on the cosmic radar - is the perfect narrator for this work. He takes vastly complicated concepts and simplifies them, enough so that anyone, even the epitome of the layman (myself) can understand, learn about, and wonder at the universe right alongside the professionals. This review doesn’t do Cosmos any justice. Please read this book. It is not often that one as amazing as this one comes along. It touched upon so many subjects that I feel as though, after finishing it, I have briefly glimpsed a snapshot of the world; it’s science, history, politics, and philosophy - all in the space of 384 pages.

I bought it again (what universe do books you once owned get off to?) to remind myself of Sagan's brain and how he thought about the cosmos. I remember from the first time I read the book that Sagan was one of the few to consider ""life as we know it"" an egotistical concept about nature on other planets, in other galaxies. And to a girl scifi nerd, this was an important caveat. Of course, there was no 3rd grade on Mars! Of course there weren't boy bullies, and music lessons, and teachers who needed to be doing something else for a living. Perhaps a planet with silica beings, or gas giants who floated in the methane winds of Jupiter. Maybe salt plain beings: maybe Lot's wife was zapped in a fly-by incident? Or an amoeba immersed in a boiling pool of compounds on Venus, contemplating how lucky and alone it is. Or molten rock DNA strands on Mercury, slithering through the cracks in the crust. Why is our armature calcium on an aluminum-rich planet? What would a girl look like on Neptune? Are there girls on Neptune? I love this book.

Carl is a person with such incredible personality, the more you read him, the more you will want to listen to him. So, next in line was his ""Cosmos: A Personal Voyage"". While reading the book I felt that the episodes of the series are complementary to the corresponding chapters of the book. So even after completing 70% of the book, I started it all again, this time side by side with corresponding episode from the series. So, this time the experience was more fulfilling, more complete. The satisfaction was at its best.The best part of this classic and the series are that they don't try to introduce science as something distant. Rather they bring things closer, like something at your next door. And this way you feel more connected to the whole picture.

Sagan takes you on a journey that leaves you with the understanding that every living thing on this planet is the current iteration of a process that has been going on for literally billions of years. He also doesn't shrink away from ""political"" topics — which of course, given that they are matters involving the survival of our species, are hardly political at all.

These mere 5 stars wouldn't even quantify the quality of his existence let alone his knowledge in our origin and evolution. What is lacking in this book? Nothing. It touches every branch of field that humans know. There is physics, chemistry, biology, astrology, astronomy, history, mathematics, geography, politics and even the psychology of humans. It not only includes the origin and evolution of the universe but also on the future of humans too. There's time travel too. This book is where we came from, what we are and what we might become. It let's you think for yourself. And if you watch the series along with this book, it will be the toping on the cake. Just as an afterthought, be prepared to be amazed and spooked and freaked out.

From positrons to spaceships, from the golden days of the Alexandrian library to the present day, from the primordial soup to interstellar travel, from the lessons of our past to lessons for our future... Cosmos is a delightful, enriching read. I sincerely wish that it is made a part of the high school science syllabus for students across the world - one will benefit enormously from the lucid explanations of topics ranging from natural selection to hieroglyphics! One will begin to appreciate the enormous contributions made by thousands and thousands of generations to our ""modern"" lives... and, perhaps, one will also be motivated to think of answers to questions like how many inhabitable planets there could be in the universe, and, ""Who speaks for Earth""?"

Not only does it discuss the universe, but it talks about the history of scientific progress and the possibility of coming into contact with other civilizations in space. Keep in mind that this book was published in 1980, so there is a lot of ""proposed"" ideas and hopes by Sagan that have since been realized (and a lot of talk about the Soviet Union which, for some reason, made me giggle...). ""The Cosmos may be densely populated with intelligent beings. But the Darwinian lesson is clear: There will be no humans elsewhere. Only here. Only on this small planet. We are a rare as well as an endangered species. Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let him live.

The content is a selective history of science, couched in religious language, such as the first sentence ""The Cosmos is all that is or was or ever will be,"" a pretty direct challenge to ""In the beginning."" I was most disappointed in Sagan's dishonesty as a historian of Christianity: the Church gets dragged through the mud for antagonizing Galileo, but the Big Bang goes uncredited throughout the book, as if Sagan didn't know that it had been discovered by a Catholic priest."

I can't find an adjective that could describe his way of writing, it just takes you to another place, it feels like a journey and now I'm sad it ended, I couldn't believe it had ended, I need more of this in my life. He said so many things in a book so little that when I was reading about his opinion on nuclear weapons and political stuff I was wordless. How Sagan?"

In this work Carl Sagan invites the reader on a journey through space and time, well written, I was entertained and enlightened.

Even if the advanced concepts of science may be beyond some readers, I urge you not to be frustrated and to persevere in reading this amazing book. "

210,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39746437-jonraven,4,"A great read. Lots of interesting information. This is similar to a textbook, but written better. You could use this in a college level intro science/astronomy course if you desired! Much of it is historical.Chapter 7 on the Ionians was the best chapter. He can be a bit long winded from time to time. Really the book deserves a 5/5, but I have to take a star off because It's just not as good at conveying the more complex topics, as say, Asimov was in his science books. No one compares to Asimov in my experience, so perhaps this is a harsh comparison.I highly recommend this book! Bear in mind that this is more or less for the layman, but I'd say more targeted toward the somewhat educated. For the educated reader, this is great. For less educated persons, they'd probably still grasp most of the ideas, but have a hard time with maintaining interest because at times he does go on long tangents and the science might be a bit much for someone of lower reading level without a science background. Also, it's not a short book. MID READ SPOILSChapter 7 was phenomenal!! The story of the great Ionians of the Aegean Sea discovering science, and coming to many modern day conclusions, was exhilarating and yet also saddening... for because of Pythagoras and of the Pythagoreans, his devout followings firmness of beliefs in their Master Pythagoras... new ideas were shunned... and because the slave trade that thrust forward merchantilism and with it science, was ironically its undoing, as it created a new generation of lazy rich people, and poor slaves, neither of whom had any interest in science. Democritus had all his books burned and Plato encouraged this. Plato propped up his tyrant leader of the days. Dreadfully saddening. So the great science was pushed back and replaced with mysticism and un-empirical thought processes. Of course we still had Alexandria!!! But alas, we know what happened there... yet another tragedy and blow to science. We were well on our way to modern science 2500 years ago... and a bunch of zealots and slave owners basically screwed us all and repressed incredible breakthroughs! In fact Galileo call Copernicus restorer and confirmer, not discoverer of the heliocentric concept! Because it was Aristarcus who in fact discovered the hypothesis of the heliocentric model of the universe! Over 2000 years ago!!!"

214,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7260075-fee-anyau,3,Took me one whole year to finish this book. That probably explains much about my motivation in reading this genre. 
215,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17629329-leah,4,"I've listened to about a third of this and am giving it up. This isn't a criticism of the book or of the narration, both of which are excellent. It's because I recently read and loved Welcome to the Universe: An Astrophysical Tour which is quite similar in the ground it covers, equally well written and, crucially, bang up to date in the science. Sagan's book was undoubtedly ground-breaking and later popular science books owe much to his legacy, but I feel if I was recommending a comprehensive pop science book about life, the universe and everything, it would make sense to recommend a new one, rather than one that, however well done at the time, undoubtedly now contains some stuff that has been superceded by later discoveries. I thought I might find it interesting to see how the popularisation of science began, but... well, I didn't.So I'm giving it four stars because it undoubtedly was a great book in its time and still has lots of interest in it, but scientific knowledge is ever-changing, so that, unlike in other fields, the newest one is probably always going to be the most informative (so long as it's written by the current leaders in the field)."

The knowledge was a little dated seen as I'm reading it 39 years after it's first publication but it was still enjoyable and interesting. Sagan's writing is full of a great personality that shines throughout, creating and testing out his own quirky wonders and imaginations as new ideas to be explored.'A book is made from a tree. It is an assemblage of flat, flexible parts (still called' leaves' ) imprinted with dark pigmented squiggles. One glance of it and you hear the voice of another person - perhaps someone dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, the author is speaking, clearly and silently, inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people, citizens of distant epochs, who never knew one another. Books break the shackles of time, proof that humans can work magic.'"

219,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32717494-venky,4,"In this monumental tour de force, the late Carl Sagan pays a stupendous tribute to Science, the vast Phalanx of Stars adorning a plethora of Galaxies and to the serendipitous findings that are the efforts of a few stellar men and women who strove to understand Evolution, Cosmos and the very meaning of life.In this gripping achievement of common sense, thought and reason,this beloved and genial astronomer does his best to make us understand our purpose on this Planet. Exquisitely tracing our path of evolution that involved, in what may seem to be an absurd improbability, a Devonian fish, to the act of firing a couple of Interstellar Spaceships (Voyagers I & II) into the depths of outer space, Carl Sagan eloquently, elegantly and enthusiastically holds forth on the Cosmological significance that is essential to appreciate our existence on Planet Earth. Although an encomium to Science, there runs throughout the book an invisible, but strong thread of spirituality and deep philosophy. Every page strives and, and succeeds in no small measure in underscoring the significantly infinitesimal position that mankind occupies in the Cosmic Playground. But completely ignorant of such a tiny confinement in the theatre of Space, man chooses to continually envelope himself in a self created blanket of vice and vicissitude. How vainglorious and trivial are the self proclaimed triumphs of the Homo Sapien when compared to the stirring functionalities of the Cosmos!Although some of the concepts such as black holes, quarks and supernovae pose a veritable challenge to even able quantum physicists, let alone an unsuspecting layman, Sagan takes care to handhold the reader through the noxious admixture of gases and vapours and deftly evades the path of careening comets and interstellar boulders. Sagan is not just an unflinching servant of Science, but an admirable teacher of the subject that is pinned to his heart. 'Cosmos' will stand the sternest test of anytime. But more than anything else it will serve as a beautiful and timely reminder to we earthlings to re-examine our foibles and follies and channel our tangible resources and intangible potentials towards the causes of empowerment, education and enlightenment instead of getting enmeshed, entangled and embroiled in the temporary passions of Power, Politics and Perniciousness. ""COSMOS"" - A HUMBLING BUT FULFILLING JOURNEY!"
220,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/830884-tony-viardo,5,"Full disclosure here, Carl Sagan is a personal inspiration for me. A person who has affected my philosophy and thinking ever since I first heard of him, watch his television documentaries, and then took the time to read his writing. The day he died, I felt a huge sense of loss, not for myself, but the world. This man was not only brilliant, a genius of the order that you see only once a generation, but he had the soul and sensitivity that defines the best of humanity. Overstating? I don't think so; he not only had the mental capacity to see the world differently, but he always--in his writing, science, achievements and activities--seemed to think FIRST, how any phenomena would impact the entire human race. And his conclusions, scientific or otherwise, always led him to the same course of action: A call for understanding, mutual respect and simple caring for one another. This is why he impacted me, and in many ways I carry on his mission.About this book: it captures the infectious wonderment of Sagan's mind and curiosity. His discussions about astronomy not only makes the science easy to grasp, it RIGHTFULLY puts the reader in absolute awe at the vastness and genius of how the universe is put together. This book, which is an encapsulation of the TV series of the same name--which incidentally helped spread science to more people around the world than any piece of scientific literature in history--teaches and informs, but inspires as well. Carl Sagan believed that knowledge, pure knowledge of how things work, is a magical bridge that will erase the differences that divide people, and build mutual understanding through awareness of our common humanity. This he believed will eventually over time, bring the world together, and keep us from destroying ourselves. Cosmos was a contribution to this dream by one of the greatest thinkers of our time; in history really. Sagan always saw the big picture, and by helping us see the same, he figured we could rise above the petty things that destroy us (like ignorance, fear and hatred). I'm sure if he were alive to write this review he would say: it won't solve all your problems or answer all your questions, but hopefully it can give you even one iota of knowledge and understanding, that will lift up your life and help you enrich the lives of those around you as well."

Sagan takes you on a journey that leaves you with the understanding that every living thing on this planet is the current iteration of a process that has been going on for literally billions of years. He also doesn't shrink away from ""political"" topics — which of course, given that they are matters involving the survival of our species, are hardly political at all. I can't recommend this book highly enough."

These mere 5 stars wouldn't even quantify the quality of his existence let alone his knowledge in our origin and evolution. What is lacking in this book? Nothing. It touches every branch of field that humans know. There is physics, chemistry, biology, astrology, astronomy, history, mathematics, geography, politics and even the psychology of humans. It not only includes the origin and evolution of the universe but also on the future of humans too. There's time travel too. This book is where we came from, what we are and what we might become. It let's you think for yourself. And if you watch the series along with this book, it will be the toping on the cake. Just as an afterthought, be prepared to be amazed and spooked and freaked out. I don't want to be a spoilsport by revealing too much about the book. Why don't you find it out for yourself?"

Dr. Sagan's beautiful writing style filled me with awe and a resolve to keep exploring. From positrons to spaceships, from the golden days of the Alexandrian library to the present day, from the primordial soup to interstellar travel, from the lessons of our past to lessons for our future... Cosmos is a delightful, enriching read. I sincerely wish that it is made a part of the high school science syllabus for students across the world - one will benefit enormously from the lucid explanations of topics ranging from natural selection to hieroglyphics! One will begin to appreciate the enormous contributions made by thousands and thousands of generations to our ""modern"" lives... and, perhaps, one will also be motivated to think of answers to questions like how many inhabitable planets there could be in the universe, and, ""Who speaks for Earth""?"

Not only does it discuss the universe, but it talks about the history of scientific progress and the possibility of coming into contact with other civilizations in space. Keep in mind that this book was published in 1980, so there is a lot of ""proposed"" ideas and hopes by Sagan that have since been realized (and a lot of talk about the Soviet Union which, for some reason, made me giggle...). ""The Cosmos may be densely populated with intelligent beings. But the Darwinian lesson is clear: There will be no humans elsewhere. Only here. Only on this small planet. We are a rare as well as an endangered species. Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let him live.

262,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826429-sj-loria,5,"One of the BEST books I have ever read. This book is a science book written by a poet. Sagan is able to describe complex things in nature in a very logical, thorough and yet beautiful way. This book opens your eyes to the immensity and eternity of the cosmos as well as our place in it. Though we do not have a privileged position, we are never the less able to think critically about it and set sails on the cosmic ocean. The topics the book covers are several - the history of science versus religion, our inner solar system, the outer realms of the known universe, historical figures in science and more.This book kept me in rapture from the beginning to the end. It unites us as citizens of the world, a tiny speck in the spiral arm of a galaxy known as the Milky Way (why is it called the Milky Way? Sagan explains that in the book). We float like a dust mite in the vast cosmic sea, but through this book we are able to comprehend a bit of that ocean. In addition to comprehending a small part of it, we are able to appreciate it much more. A fascinating and truly incredible book.Quotes (as a preface, there are WAY too many to fit, but here goes a very small sampling):Lost somewhere between immensity and eternity is our tiny planetary home. 1Cosmos is the Greek word for the order of the universe. It is in a way, the opposite of Chaos. It implies the deep interconnectedness of all things. It conveys awe for the intricate and subtle way in which the universe is put together. 10Occasionally someone remarks on what a lucky coincidence it is that the Earth is perfectly suitable for life - moderate temperatures, liquid water, oxygen atmosphere, and so on. But this is, at least in part, a confusion of cause and effect. We earthlings are supremely well adapted to the environment of the Earth because we grew up here. 14If artificial selection can make such major changes in so short a period of time, what must natural selection, working over billions of years, be capable of? The answer is all the beauty and diversity of the biological world. Evolution is a fact, not a theory, and the mechanism of evolution is natural selection. 17What a marvelous cooperative arrangement – plants and animals each inhaling the other’s exhalations, a kind of planet-wide mutual mother-to-stomach resuscitation, the entire elegant cycle powered by a star 150 million kilometers away. 24Supported by the Church through the Dark Ages, Ptolemy’s [earth as center of the universe:] model helped prevent the advance of astronomy for a millennium. 39Kepler’s research was successful, a triumph, as was much of the rest of his life, of reason over superstition. 54The only other year like it in the history of physics was Einstein’s “Miracle Year” of 1905. When asked how he accomplished his astonishing discoveries, Newton replied unhelpfully, “By thinking upon them.” 56I do not know what I may appear to the world; but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy, playing on the seashore, in now and then finding a smoother pebble or prettier shell than ordinary, while the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me. – Newton. 59Science is generated by and devoted to free inquiry: the idea that any hypothesis, no matter how strange, deserves to be considered on its merits. The suppression of uncomfortable ideas may be common in religion and politics, but it is not the path to knowledge; it has no place in the endeavor of science. 74The microscope and the telescope, both developed in early seventeenth century Holland, represent an extension of human vision to the realms of the very small and the very large. 118If a faithful account was rendered of Man’s ideas upon Divinty, he would be obliged to acknowledge, that for the most part the word “gods” had been used to express the concealed, remote, unknown causes of the affects he witnessed…as soon as his mind can no longer follow the chain, he solves the difficulty, terminates his research, by ascribing it to his gods…does he, in fact, do anything more than substitute for the darkness of his own mind, a sound to which he has been accustomed to listen with reverential awe? Paul Heinrich Deitrich, 1770. 133For a long time the human instinct to understand was thwarted by facile religious explanations…[but starting in Ionian:] the great idea arose, the realization that there might be a way to know the world without the god hypothesis; that there might be principles, forces, laws of nature, through which the world could be understood without attributing the fall of every sparrow to the direct intervention of Zeus. 141A handful of sand contains about 10,000 grains, more than the number of starts we can see with the naked eye on a clear night. But the number of stars we can see is only the tiniest fraction of the number of stars that are…The total number of stars in the universe is greater than all the grains of sand on all the beaches of planet Earth. 161The themes of space and time are, as we have seen, intertwined. Worlds and stars, like people, are born, live and die. The lifetime of a human being is measured in decades; the lifetime of the Sun is a hundred million times longer. Compared to a star, we are like mayflies. 177Modern physics and chemistry have reduced the complexity of the sensible world to an astonishing simplicity: three units [protons, neutrons, and electrons:] put together in various patterns make, essentially, everything. 183All the elements of the Earth except hydrogen and some helium have been cooked by a kind of stellar alchemy billions of years ago in stars, some of which are today inconspicuous white dwarfs on the other side of the Milky Way Galaxy. The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff. 190We are, in the most profound sense, children of the Cosmos…hidden within each of us lies a kernel of awe. 199The study of the galaxies reveals a universal order and beauty. It also shows us chaotic violence on a scale hitherto undreamed of. That we live in a universe which permits life is remarkable. That we live in one which destroys galaxies and stars and worlds is also remarkable. The universe seems neither benign nor hostile, merely indifferent to the concerns of such puny creatures as we. 205In many cultures it is customary to answer that God created the universe out of nothing. But this is mere temporizing. If we wish courageously to pursue the question, we must of course ask next where God come from. And if we decide this to be unanswerable, why not save a step and decide that the origin of the universe is an unanswerable question. Or, if we say that God has always existed, why not save a step and conclude that the universe has always existed? 212It is said that men may not be the dreams of the gods, but rather that the gods are the dreams of men. 213Our passion for learning, evident in the behavior of each toddler, is the tool of our survival…What distinguishes our species is thought…We are, each of us, largely responsible for what gets put into our brains, for what, as adults, we wind up caring for and knowing about. No longer at the mercy of the reptile brain, we can change ourselves. 231One glance [at a book:] and you hear the voice of another person – perhaps someone dead for thousands of years…writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people, citizens of distant epochs, who never knew one another. Books break the shackles of time, proof that humans can work magic. 232In our history it was some horde of furry little mammals who hid from the dinosaurs, colonized the treetops and later scampered down to domesticate fire, invent writing, construct observatories, and launch space vehicles. 236Prescott believe that cultures with a predisposition for violence are composed of individuals who have been deprived – during at least one of two critical stages in life, infancy and adolescence – of the pleasures of the body. 274[Discussing the fall of Alexandria, and it’s last scientist a woman by the name of Hypatia:] “The growing Christian Church was consolidating its power and attempting to eradicate pagan influence and culture. Hypatia stood at the epicenter of these mighty social forces. Cyril, the archbishop of Alexandria, despised her because of her close friendship with the Roman governor, and because she was a symbol of learning and science, which were largely identified by the early Church with paganism. In great personal danger, she continued to teach and publish, until, in the year 415, on her way to work she was set upon by a fanatical mob of Cyril’s parishioners. They dragged her from her chariot, tore off her cloths, and, armed with abalone shells, flayed her flesh from her bones. Her remains were burned, her works obliterated, her name forgotten. Cyril was made a saint. 279If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies you will not find another. 283"
263,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57476518-helix,5,"It took me a month to finish this, partly because of real life, but also because, in a sense, this is a book that was not meant to be taken lightly. This is a book written with the utmost care, and you have to respect such books when you encountered one. I know a great book when I read one. Cosmos was a great book.I'm not sure if ""great"" was the right word, actually; ""profoundly moving"" might be more appopriate, though I suspect a lot of people have used quite the same vocabulary when describing this book. Cosmos and its illustrious author--Carl Sagan--did touch the life of many people, after all, and with perfectly good reasons. Sagan was eloquent, a master of words; he directed complex ideas and concepts like a conductor directed an orchestra. The end result was a beautiful symphony of ideas, masterfully conveyed and illustrated. I think it's no secret that science is daunting. I can't be the only one who thinks that. Sagan even stated in the last chapter that ""...science and learning is the privilege of the few."" How much of the state of things that we didn't know, because that door was barred from us, in one way or another? How many lights, how many curiosities, was extinguished? I think there was this post on Tumblr which basically stated, ""It disappointed me how much math I need to get close to the stars"", and I can forever relate to that post. A serious career in astronomy/space science/etc aside, it still takes you a lot of brainpower to even venture lightly to the world of science. But Carl Sagan was deemed as the man who brings science to the public with very, very good reason. Thanks to Cosmos, I can finally understand how fission process works, how atoms was formed, and the theory of relativity, among other things. I was educated in the best private schools of my part of the city, ended up a Social Studies major because I can't keep up with the rigorous demands of science (I excelled in Biology, though). Someone told me on Tumblr that this book has been very formative to them as a child. This is one of those interesting ""fork points"" in time that Sagan also mentioned--which spawned a dozen sci-fi plots--which immediately struck me: What if I found this book sooner? What if I've had a teacher like Sagan?We are all not as stupid (and conversely, not as smart or wise) as we often make ourselves to be. We so often downplayed our strengths, forever underselling our worth, in a culture that despises self-love and self-understanding. What Cosmos taught me was not only mere scientific facts, or how science works, but also a vast restructuring of my own thoughts. All my life I was told (and I told myself) that I'm bad at hard sciences. But reading this book, it makes me realised that I am not as stupid as I have so tirelessly convinced myself. Cosmos taught myself that I'm limitless, that if I applied myself I could accomplish great things, that my limitations sometimes can be pushed back. At the same time, it also taught me empathy and compassion that no self-help book ever could (not that I read a lot of those, I despised those). The pursuit of knowledge could solve a lot of problems that mankind faced. It's a fact. And the more I understand, the more reluctant I am to accept what my family and society has bequeathed to me, which is a bunch of R-Complex influenced ideology and mysticism. There is no such thing as an alien, within ourselves. We are all variations of the same idea, various applications of that idea. I might be too late and too old to go on a STEM track, but I think the last chapter might have inspired me to take up the second degree scholarship offer on Disruptive Innovation. We all deserved a better life.Anyway, back on track, I would say that this is a very dangerous book. I would say that this is the sort of book who will inspire you to become more, to dream bigger, because the Universe out there is waiting. And the alternative is nothing.I was, for lack of a better term, touched by Carl Sagan's tremendous humanity. Books are our own portable sort of magic--in his own words--and his book might be one of the greatest of them all. You could probably call this a how-to book on being a human, rather than a science manual. I can see how his thoughts have influenced people like Sir Arthur C Clarke, and it was thrilling, to read Cosmos in the 21st century and know that some of the ideas he had proposed, back in the Cold War era, like a vehicle to explore Mars, has come to pass. I wondered what Cosmos would sound like, had Sagan was still alive. I wondered how Sagan would react, if he was still alive. I think he was possibly delighted--that we had survived the Cold War fork in history without obliterating ourselves--but at the same time, he would probably be horrified at all the divisive ideologies and movements circulating around.I think a call for unity has never been uttered so eloquently, or so rationally. Cosmos is a book you must, hopefully, devote some time of your life to. It will profoundly transform your life. "

292,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826429-sj-loria,5,"One of the BEST books I have ever read. This book is a science book written by a poet. Sagan is able to describe complex things in nature in a very logical, thorough and yet beautiful way. This book opens your eyes to the immensity and eternity of the cosmos as well as our place in it. Though we do not have a privileged position, we are never the less able to think critically about it and set sails on the cosmic ocean. The topics the book covers are several - the history of science versus religion, our inner solar system, the outer realms of the known universe, historical figures in science and more.This book kept me in rapture from the beginning to the end. It unites us as citizens of the world, a tiny speck in the spiral arm of a galaxy known as the Milky Way (why is it called the Milky Way? Sagan explains that in the book). We float like a dust mite in the vast cosmic sea, but through this book we are able to comprehend a bit of that ocean. In addition to comprehending a small part of it, we are able to appreciate it much more. A fascinating and truly incredible book.Quotes (as a preface, there are WAY too many to fit, but here goes a very small sampling):Lost somewhere between immensity and eternity is our tiny planetary home. 1Cosmos is the Greek word for the order of the universe. It is in a way, the opposite of Chaos. It implies the deep interconnectedness of all things. It conveys awe for the intricate and subtle way in which the universe is put together. 10Occasionally someone remarks on what a lucky coincidence it is that the Earth is perfectly suitable for life - moderate temperatures, liquid water, oxygen atmosphere, and so on. But this is, at least in part, a confusion of cause and effect. We earthlings are supremely well adapted to the environment of the Earth because we grew up here. 14If artificial selection can make such major changes in so short a period of time, what must natural selection, working over billions of years, be capable of? The answer is all the beauty and diversity of the biological world. Evolution is a fact, not a theory, and the mechanism of evolution is natural selection. 17What a marvelous cooperative arrangement – plants and animals each inhaling the other’s exhalations, a kind of planet-wide mutual mother-to-stomach resuscitation, the entire elegant cycle powered by a star 150 million kilometers away. 24Supported by the Church through the Dark Ages, Ptolemy’s [earth as center of the universe:] model helped prevent the advance of astronomy for a millennium. 39Kepler’s research was successful, a triumph, as was much of the rest of his life, of reason over superstition. 54The only other year like it in the history of physics was Einstein’s “Miracle Year” of 1905. When asked how he accomplished his astonishing discoveries, Newton replied unhelpfully, “By thinking upon them.” 56I do not know what I may appear to the world; but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy, playing on the seashore, in now and then finding a smoother pebble or prettier shell than ordinary, while the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me. – Newton. 59Science is generated by and devoted to free inquiry: the idea that any hypothesis, no matter how strange, deserves to be considered on its merits. The suppression of uncomfortable ideas may be common in religion and politics, but it is not the path to knowledge; it has no place in the endeavor of science. 74The microscope and the telescope, both developed in early seventeenth century Holland, represent an extension of human vision to the realms of the very small and the very large. 118If a faithful account was rendered of Man’s ideas upon Divinty, he would be obliged to acknowledge, that for the most part the word “gods” had been used to express the concealed, remote, unknown causes of the affects he witnessed…as soon as his mind can no longer follow the chain, he solves the difficulty, terminates his research, by ascribing it to his gods…does he, in fact, do anything more than substitute for the darkness of his own mind, a sound to which he has been accustomed to listen with reverential awe? Paul Heinrich Deitrich, 1770. 133For a long time the human instinct to understand was thwarted by facile religious explanations…[but starting in Ionian:] the great idea arose, the realization that there might be a way to know the world without the god hypothesis; that there might be principles, forces, laws of nature, through which the world could be understood without attributing the fall of every sparrow to the direct intervention of Zeus. 141A handful of sand contains about 10,000 grains, more than the number of starts we can see with the naked eye on a clear night. But the number of stars we can see is only the tiniest fraction of the number of stars that are…The total number of stars in the universe is greater than all the grains of sand on all the beaches of planet Earth. 161The themes of space and time are, as we have seen, intertwined. Worlds and stars, like people, are born, live and die. The lifetime of a human being is measured in decades; the lifetime of the Sun is a hundred million times longer. Compared to a star, we are like mayflies. 177Modern physics and chemistry have reduced the complexity of the sensible world to an astonishing simplicity: three units [protons, neutrons, and electrons:] put together in various patterns make, essentially, everything. 183All the elements of the Earth except hydrogen and some helium have been cooked by a kind of stellar alchemy billions of years ago in stars, some of which are today inconspicuous white dwarfs on the other side of the Milky Way Galaxy. The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff. 190We are, in the most profound sense, children of the Cosmos…hidden within each of us lies a kernel of awe. 199The study of the galaxies reveals a universal order and beauty. It also shows us chaotic violence on a scale hitherto undreamed of. That we live in a universe which permits life is remarkable. That we live in one which destroys galaxies and stars and worlds is also remarkable. The universe seems neither benign nor hostile, merely indifferent to the concerns of such puny creatures as we. 205In many cultures it is customary to answer that God created the universe out of nothing. But this is mere temporizing. If we wish courageously to pursue the question, we must of course ask next where God come from. And if we decide this to be unanswerable, why not save a step and decide that the origin of the universe is an unanswerable question. Or, if we say that God has always existed, why not save a step and conclude that the universe has always existed? 212It is said that men may not be the dreams of the gods, but rather that the gods are the dreams of men. 213Our passion for learning, evident in the behavior of each toddler, is the tool of our survival…What distinguishes our species is thought…We are, each of us, largely responsible for what gets put into our brains, for what, as adults, we wind up caring for and knowing about. No longer at the mercy of the reptile brain, we can change ourselves. 231One glance [at a book:] and you hear the voice of another person – perhaps someone dead for thousands of years…writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people, citizens of distant epochs, who never knew one another. Books break the shackles of time, proof that humans can work magic. 232In our history it was some horde of furry little mammals who hid from the dinosaurs, colonized the treetops and later scampered down to domesticate fire, invent writing, construct observatories, and launch space vehicles. 236Prescott believe that cultures with a predisposition for violence are composed of individuals who have been deprived – during at least one of two critical stages in life, infancy and adolescence – of the pleasures of the body. 274[Discussing the fall of Alexandria, and it’s last scientist a woman by the name of Hypatia:] “The growing Christian Church was consolidating its power and attempting to eradicate pagan influence and culture. Hypatia stood at the epicenter of these mighty social forces. Cyril, the archbishop of Alexandria, despised her because of her close friendship with the Roman governor, and because she was a symbol of learning and science, which were largely identified by the early Church with paganism. In great personal danger, she continued to teach and publish, until, in the year 415, on her way to work she was set upon by a fanatical mob of Cyril’s parishioners. They dragged her from her chariot, tore off her cloths, and, armed with abalone shells, flayed her flesh from her bones. Her remains were burned, her works obliterated, her name forgotten. Cyril was made a saint. 279If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies you will not find another. 283"
293,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57476518-helix,5,"It took me a month to finish this, partly because of real life, but also because, in a sense, this is a book that was not meant to be taken lightly. This is a book written with the utmost care, and you have to respect such books when you encountered one. I know a great book when I read one. Cosmos was a great book.I'm not sure if ""great"" was the right word, actually; ""profoundly moving"" might be more appopriate, though I suspect a lot of people have used quite the same vocabulary when describing this book. Cosmos and its illustrious author--Carl Sagan--did touch the life of many people, after all, and with perfectly good reasons. Sagan was eloquent, a master of words; he directed complex ideas and concepts like a conductor directed an orchestra. The end result was a beautiful symphony of ideas, masterfully conveyed and illustrated. I think it's no secret that science is daunting. I can't be the only one who thinks that. Sagan even stated in the last chapter that ""...science and learning is the privilege of the few."" How much of the state of things that we didn't know, because that door was barred from us, in one way or another? How many lights, how many curiosities, was extinguished? I think there was this post on Tumblr which basically stated, ""It disappointed me how much math I need to get close to the stars"", and I can forever relate to that post. A serious career in astronomy/space science/etc aside, it still takes you a lot of brainpower to even venture lightly to the world of science. But Carl Sagan was deemed as the man who brings science to the public with very, very good reason. Thanks to Cosmos, I can finally understand how fission process works, how atoms was formed, and the theory of relativity, among other things. I was educated in the best private schools of my part of the city, ended up a Social Studies major because I can't keep up with the rigorous demands of science (I excelled in Biology, though). Someone told me on Tumblr that this book has been very formative to them as a child. This is one of those interesting ""fork points"" in time that Sagan also mentioned--which spawned a dozen sci-fi plots--which immediately struck me: What if I found this book sooner? What if I've had a teacher like Sagan?We are all not as stupid (and conversely, not as smart or wise) as we often make ourselves to be. We so often downplayed our strengths, forever underselling our worth, in a culture that despises self-love and self-understanding. What Cosmos taught me was not only mere scientific facts, or how science works, but also a vast restructuring of my own thoughts. All my life I was told (and I told myself) that I'm bad at hard sciences. But reading this book, it makes me realised that I am not as stupid as I have so tirelessly convinced myself. Cosmos taught myself that I'm limitless, that if I applied myself I could accomplish great things, that my limitations sometimes can be pushed back. At the same time, it also taught me empathy and compassion that no self-help book ever could (not that I read a lot of those, I despised those). The pursuit of knowledge could solve a lot of problems that mankind faced. It's a fact. And the more I understand, the more reluctant I am to accept what my family and society has bequeathed to me, which is a bunch of R-Complex influenced ideology and mysticism. There is no such thing as an alien, within ourselves. We are all variations of the same idea, various applications of that idea. I might be too late and too old to go on a STEM track, but I think the last chapter might have inspired me to take up the second degree scholarship offer on Disruptive Innovation. We all deserved a better life.Anyway, back on track, I would say that this is a very dangerous book. I would say that this is the sort of book who will inspire you to become more, to dream bigger, because the Universe out there is waiting. And the alternative is nothing.I was, for lack of a better term, touched by Carl Sagan's tremendous humanity. Books are our own portable sort of magic--in his own words--and his book might be one of the greatest of them all. You could probably call this a how-to book on being a human, rather than a science manual. I can see how his thoughts have influenced people like Sir Arthur C Clarke, and it was thrilling, to read Cosmos in the 21st century and know that some of the ideas he had proposed, back in the Cold War era, like a vehicle to explore Mars, has come to pass. I wondered what Cosmos would sound like, had Sagan was still alive. I wondered how Sagan would react, if he was still alive. I think he was possibly delighted--that we had survived the Cold War fork in history without obliterating ourselves--but at the same time, he would probably be horrified at all the divisive ideologies and movements circulating around.I think a call for unity has never been uttered so eloquently, or so rationally. Cosmos is a book you must, hopefully, devote some time of your life to. It will profoundly transform your life. "

304,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21126957-hind,5,Just found out why Sagan is so great.
305,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93922358-james,5,The words in this book ooze with Carl Sagan's appreciation for the beauty of the Cosmos. I'd say it's worth reading for that alone.Overall a good beginning introduction to astronomy.
306,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1275149-cheryl,4,"I approached this book with fear and trembling; while I knew much of the discoveries were outdated and science has revealed so much more about the universe, I revere Sagan as one of the few geniuses that see the big picture and can articulate it. in my earlier, restless, seeking years, I learned this lesson in the deserts of Utah: “Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality.” There are people with no sense of spiritual life, no sense of the soul, no sense of mystery, but that impoverished worldview usually disintegrates when faced with the red rock of Utah, or the Grand Canyon, or illness, or cancer, or death, and then it can be transformed if natural, human curiosity is allowed to flourish. How can Utah look like Mars, is this what Mars looks like? What what forces and time caused the Grand Canyon? Why suffering? How do we die peacefully? If you never wonder about those things, none of them, bless you with TV, I hope you never run out of mindless things to watch. Sagan educates and enlightens, he is a sage, a seer, a see-er, a wise one. Some of Cosmos is over my head, but there is such beauty, it is digestible. The sense of wonder is more powerful than any drug, I promise, and the high never ends. Today we have discovered a powerful and elegant way to understand the universe, a method called science; it has revealed to us a universe so ancient and so vast that human affairs seem at first sight to be of little consequence. We have grown distant from the Cosmos. It has seemed remote and irrelevant to everyday concerns. But science has found not only that the universe has a reeling and ecstatic grandeur, not only that it is accessible to human understanding, but also that we are, in a very real and profound sense, a part of that Cosmos, born from it, our fate deeply connected with it. The most basic human events and the most trivial trace back to the universe and its origins.In addition, science is a delight; evolution has arranged that we take pleasure in understanding—those who understand are more likely to survive. Science is an ongoing process. It never ends. There is no single ultimate truth to be achieved, after which all the scientists can retire. And because this is so, the world is far more interesting, both for the scientists and for the millions of people in every nation who, while not professional scientists, are deeply interested in the methods and findings of science. Lost somewhere between immensity and eternity is our tiny planetary home. They remind us that humans have evolved to wonder, that understanding is a joy, that knowledge is prerequisite to survival. The only typical place is within the vast, cold, universal vacuum, the everlasting night of intergalactic space, a place so strange and desolate that, by comparison, planets and stars and galaxies seem achingly rare and lovely. If we were randomly inserted into the Cosmos, the chance that we would find ourselves on or near a planet would be less than one in a billion trillion trillion* (1033, a one followed by 33 zeroes). In everyday life such odds are called compelling. Worlds are precious. Human beings grew up in forests; we have a natural affinity for them. How lovely a tree is, straining toward the sky. Its leaves harvest sunlight to photosynthesize, so trees compete by shadowing their neighbors. If you look closely you can often see two trees pushing and shoving with languid grace. Trees are great and beautiful machines, powered by sunlight, taking in water from the ground and carbon dioxide from the air, converting these materials into food for their use and ours. The plant uses the carbohydrates it makes as an energy source to go about its planty business. And we animals, who are ultimately parasites on the plants, steal the carbohydrates so we can go about our business. In eating the plants we combine the carbohydrates with oxygen dissolved in our blood because of our penchant for breathing air, and so extract the energy that makes us go. In the process we exhale carbon dioxide, which the plants then recycle to make more carbohydrates. What a marvelous cooperative arrangement—plants and animals each inhaling the other’s exhalations, a kind of planet-wide mutual mouth-to-stoma resuscitation, the entire elegant cycle powered by a star 150 million kilometers away. We today can recognize the antiquity of astrology in words such as disaster, which is Greek for “bad star,” influenza, Italian for (astral) “influence”; mazeltov, Hebrew—and, ultimately, Babylonian—for “good constellation,” or the Yiddish word shlamazel, applied to someone plagued by relentless ill-fortune, which again traces to the Babylonian astronomical lexicon. According to Pliny, there were Romans considered sideratio, “planet-struck.” Planets were widely thought to be a direct cause of death. Or consider consider: it means “with the planets,” evidently a prerequisite for serious reflection.  “Mortal as I am,” he wrote, “I know that I am born for a day. But when I follow at my pleasure the serried multitude of the stars in their circular course, my feet no longer touch the Earth …”  Because the Earth has a larger area than the Moon, we might have to wait something like ten thousand years between collisions that would make craters as big as a kilometer across on our planet. On Venus, on Earth and elsewhere in the solar system, there is evidence for catastrophic destruction, tempered or overwhelmed by slower, more uniform processes: on the Earth, for example, rainfall, coursing into rivulets, streams and rivers of running water, creating huge alluvial basins; on Mars, the remnants of ancient rivers, perhaps arising from beneath the ground; on Io, a moon of Jupiter, what seem to be broad channels made by flowing liquid sulfur. There are mighty weather systems on the Earth—and in the high atmosphere of Venus and on Jupiter. There are sandstorms on the Earth and on Mars; lightning on Jupiter and Venus and Earth. Volcanoes inject debris into the atmospheres of the Earth and Io. Internal geological processes slowly deform the surfaces of Venus, Mars, Ganymede and Europa, as well as Earth. Glaciers, proverbial for their slowness, produce major reworkings of landscapes on the Earth and probably also on Mars. Eating an apple is an immensely complicated process. In fact, if I had to synthesize my own enzymes, if I consciously had to remember and direct all the chemical steps required to get energy out of food, I would probably starve. Emotions and ritualized behavior patterns are built deeply into us. They are part of our humanity. But they are not characteristically human. Many other animals have feelings. What distinguishes our species is thought. The great libraries of the world contain millions of volumes, the equivalent of about 1014 bits of information in words, and perhaps 1015 bits in pictures. This is ten thousand times more information than in our genes, and about ten times more than in our brains. If I finish a book a week, I will read only a few thousand books in my lifetime, about a tenth of a percent of the contents of the greatest libraries of our time. The trick is to know which books to read. The information in books is not preprogrammed at birth but constantly changed, amended by events, adapted to the world. We inhabit a universe where atoms are made in the centers of stars; where each second a thousand suns are born; where life is sparked by sunlight and lightning in the airs and waters of youthful planets; where the raw material for biological evolution is sometimes made by the explosion of a star halfway across the Milky Way; where a thing as beautiful as a galaxy is formed a hundred billion times—a Cosmos of quasars and quarks, snowflakes and fireflies, where there may be black holes and other universes and extraterrestrial civilizations whose radio messages are at this moment reaching the Earth. How pallid by comparison are the pretensions of superstition and pseudoscience; how important it is for us to pursue and understand science, that characteristically human endeavor. Every aspect of Nature reveals a deep mystery and touches our sense of wonder and awe. Theophrastus was right. Those afraid of the universe as it really is, those who pretend to nonexistent knowledge and envision a Cosmos centered on human beings will prefer the fleeting comforts of superstition. They avoid rather than confront the world. But those with the courage to explore the weave and structure of the Cosmos, even where it differs profoundly from their wishes and prejudices, will penetrate its deepest mysteries. Alexandria was the greatest city the Western world had ever seen. People of all nations came there to live, to trade, to learn. On any given day, its harbors were thronged with merchants, scholars and tourists. This was a city where Greeks, Egyptians, Arabs, Syrians, Hebrews, Persians, Nubians, Phoenicians, Italians, Gauls and Iberians exchanged merchandise and ideas. It is probably here that the word cosmopolitan realized its true meaning—citizen, not just of a nation, but of the Cosmos,*  this: For unknown ages after the explosive outpouring of matter and energy of the Big Bang, the Cosmos was without form. There were no galaxies, no planets, no life. Deep, impenetrable darkness was everywhere, hydrogen atoms in the void. Here and there denser accumulations of gas were imperceptibly growing, globes of matter were condensing—hydrogen raindrops more massive than suns. Within these globes of gas was first kindled the nuclear fire latent in matter. A first generation of stars was born, flooding the Cosmos with light. There were in those times not yet any planets to receive the light, no living creatures to admire the radiance of the heavens. Deep in the stellar furnaces the alchemy of nuclear fusion created heavy elements, the ashes of hydrogen burning, the atomic building materials of future planets and lifeforms. Massive stars soon exhausted their stores of nuclear fuel. Rocked by colossal explosions, they returned most of their substance back into the thin gas from which they had once condensed. Here in the dark lush clouds between the stars, new raindrops made of many elements were forming, later generations of stars being born. Nearby, smaller raindrops grew, bodies far too little to ignite the nuclear fire, droplets in the interstellar mist on their way to form the planets. Among them was a small world of stone and iron, the early Earth. Congealing and warming, the Earth released the methane, ammonia, water and hydrogen gases that had been trapped within, forming the primitive atmosphere and the first oceans. Starlight from the Sun bathed and warmed the primeval Earth, drove storms, generated lightning and thunder. Volcanoes overflowed with lava. These processes disrupted molecules of the primitive atmosphere; the fragments fell back together again into more and more complex forms, which dissolved in the early oceans. After a time the seas achieved the consistency of a warm, dilute soup. Molecules were organized, and complex chemical reactions driven, on the surface of clays. And one day a molecule arose that quite by accident was able to make crude copies of itself out of the other molecules in the broth. As time passed, more elaborate and more accurate self-replicating molecules arose. Those combinations best suited to further replication were favored by the sieve of natural selection. Those that copied better produced more copies. And the primitive oceanic broth gradually grew thin as it was consumed by and transformed into complex condensations of self-replicating organic molecules. Gradually, imperceptibly, life had begun. Single-celled plants evolved, and life began to generate its own food. Photosynthesis transformed the atmosphere. Sex was invented. Once free-living forms banded together to make a complex cell with specialized functions. Chemical receptors evolved, and the Cosmos could taste and smell. One-celled organisms evolved into multicellular colonies, elaborating their various parts into specialized organ systems. Eyes and ears evolved, and now the Cosmos could see and hear. Plants and animals discovered that the land could support life. Organisms buzzed, crawled, scuttled, lumbered, glided, flapped, shimmied, climbed and soared. Colossal beasts thundered through the steaming jungles. Small creatures emerged, born live instead of in hard-shelled containers, with a fluid like the early oceans coursing through their veins. They survived by swiftness and cunning. And then, only a moment ago, some small arboreal animals scampered down from the trees. They became upright and taught themselves the use of tools, domesticated other animals, plants and fire, and devised language. The ash of stellar alchemy was now emerging into consciousness. At an ever-accelerating pace, it invented writing, cities, art and science, and sent spaceships to the planets and the stars. These are some of the things that hydrogen atoms do, given fifteen billion years of cosmic evolution. It has the sound of epic myth, and rightly. But it is simply a description of cosmic evolution as revealed by the science of our time. We are difficult to come by and a danger to ourselves. But any account of cosmic evolution makes it clear that all the creatures of the Earth, the latest manufactures of the galactic hydrogen industry, are beings to be cherished. Elsewhere there may be other equally astonishing transmutations of matter, so wistfully we listen for a humming in the sky. We have held the peculiar notion that a person or society that is a little different from us, whoever we are, is somehow strange or bizarre, to be distrusted or loathed. Think of the negative connotations of words like alien or outlandish. And yet the monuments and cultures of each of our civilizations merely represent different ways of being human. An extraterrestrial visitor, looking at the differences among human beings and their societies, would find those differences trivial compared to the similarities. The Cosmos may be densely populated with intelligent beings. But the Darwinian lesson is clear: There will be no humans elsewhere. Only here. Only on this small planet. We are a rare as well as an endangered species. Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another. Human history can be viewed as a slowly dawning awareness that we are members of a larger group. Initially our loyalties were to ourselves and our immediate family, next, to bands of wandering hunter-gatherers, then to tribes, small settlements, city-states, nations. We have broadened the circle of those we love. We have now organized what are modestly described as superpowers, which include groups of people from divergent ethnic and cultural backgrounds working in some sense together—surely a humanizing and character-building experience. If we are to survive, our loyalties must be broadened further, to include the whole human community, the entire planet Earth. Many of those who run the nations will find this idea unpleasant. They will fear the loss of power. We will hear much about treason and disloyalty. Rich nation-states will have to share their wealth with poor ones. But the choice, as H. G. Wells once said in a different context, is clearly the universe or nothing. "

311,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10974082-christine,3,"I'd heard the skies singing with its praises for years before I finally got the opportunity to read this book. If it wasn't non-fiction I would describe it as having a cult following, and maybe it does among scientists. The foreword in this edition is by Neil deGrasse Tyson, who is probably the coolest guy I've never met. So I had pretty high expectations for it, and for the most part it met them. I'm discovering that I want my non-fiction books to be very linear and direct; I want the line of knowledge and discovery and mistakes to start at the beginning and trundle along until the end. Side trips are acceptable, shaking up the timeline is not. But that's not really the way Sagan writes. He'll start at one point and wander forwards and back in that general area before hopping over to something different. Maybe he'll come back later. Maybe he won't. So if you don't have a decent grasp of the timeline before you start out it can be challenging to keep everything straight in your head. The other part I had a tough time with was the math. I haven't dealt with any theoretical math, algebra, or proofs since I was in high school. I don't remember Kepler's laws of planetary motion, if indeed I ever learned them. Sagan discusses them all, in detail, along with how Kepler discovered them. Which was useful. He also includes two appendices: ""Reductio ad Absurdum and the Square Root of Two,"" and ""The Five Pythagorean Solids."" They're both discussed in other chapters but not in the level of detail the appendices provide. They are pretty complex. Fascinating, but complex. Speaking as someone who hasn't done algebra for over a decade, even reading step by step I had a tough time following the math. I just can't quite remember how to make 2 E/r - E + 2 E/n = 2 into 1/n + 1/r = 1/2 + 1/E, even knowing I'm dividing both sides by 2 E. Maybe if I took the extra time to sit down and write it all out? When he says 2 E/r is that 2(E/r) or (2E)/r? Because they're not the same! I'm guessing it's the latter, based on the result in the next step, but speaking as someone who doesn't do a whole lot of math it's not printed out as clearly as it could be. I mean, what if someone wants to try this at home? Then again, maybe I'm being alarmist. It's just an appendix.Most of Sagan's side trips are fascinating. I wouldn't have expected to learn about Champollion making the breakthrough that finally allowed scholars to decipher Egyptian hieroglyphics, but it was in here. Sagan uses it as a metaphor for communicating with an alien civilization, to give us an idea of the difficulties we could face if we ever got the chance to do it, but also to prove that it could be possible. Just start by looking for patterns. The human brain excels at finding patterns. The thought that we may one day use that skill to allow us to decipher the language of an alien civilization and communicate with them is extravagantly exciting. Even if the chances that it will be in my lifetime are slim to none. Sagan holds out a lot of hope for the future of the human race, and his desire to explore and discover is contagious. It's heart-breaking to read Cosmos knowing the funding for NASA has been obliterated, in part because of Sagan's insistence that spectacular, ground-breaking discoveries about the nature of the universe aren't that expensive, compared to the funding given to the defense budget, and that every science dollar spent will come back to us sevenfold. (363) He makes clear his belief that if we continue down the path we're on we may destroy ourselves. His final point is that we can either focus on nuclear and conventional weaponry, or space. Not both. That's a complicated issue, and it's not going to be an easy decision to make. If we fund science at the expense of defensive and offensive weaponry, will we be able to protect ourselves? What does protection mean in an age of nuclear bombs? If we fund defense at the expense of science, will we make the kind of progress needed to solve the looming problems of the global future? Will we have a planet left to explore from? Or will we suddenly discover we're going to space whether we're ready or not, because while we were busy building bombs the world melted beneath us? Can we break the barriers between our countries, unite our leaders and our scientists, and work together for a common goal? Can't we all just get along?"

Eventhough it's a non fiction, its filled with emotion and passion and will ignite hope and a hunger to know more about the universe. The book is filled with basic cosmology, describes how the universe evolved and how it works in simple terms, filled with stories about the magnificent history of science and exploration since the first man started questioning nature, and how our thinking evolved ever since.

316,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60618227-amit-sareen,4,"If you look up at the stars and wonder about the universe, this book is for you. It doesn't have all the answers to your questions, what it has is - logical reasoning, analysis of data available from 13.8 billion years, deductions, and inferences. It helps one see the Cosmos in the light of the best minds that have dawned upon this little rock, the planet earth, wandering in the huge creation. It deals quite well with the question of life elsewhere in the universe, the extra-terrestrial, and the civilizations that have been on earth and are yet to come.I find that if you have some knowledge of physics, this book would be more helpful. It does deal with many important questions very well, but at times, the explanations are somewhat stretched (although these may be helpful for people with less understanding of physics). Towards the end, there are some, estimates and calculations done with some assumed figures for which I did not find a much suitable explanation (for assuming those numbers).I found it an interesting read for another reason - This book was written and published some 38 years ago (I'm currently in 2018!) which, in today's world, is a long-long ago with respect to the daily technological advancements we are making. But this is still relevant, the data, the thought processes, the inferences still remain the same. At that time, scientists did a great job at bringing all this data and analysis together which we are using today to help us advance at a very fast pace. It's also great to see some of the things as foreseen by scientists then and we've achieved them now. It's not a novel, it's a beautiful guide to our home, the Cosmos."
317,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26845173-seth,3,I read this in Sagan's voice. Billions upon billions of stars...
318,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3114740-stafford-davis,5,"In my view, this book and the accompanying PBS series combined into one entity is Carl Sagan’s masterpiece. He fuses astronomy, history, philosophy, religion, biography, speculation, and art into this project in such an unique and astonishing way that one can’t help but be completely enthralled with the information given. We start off as a passenger on a ‘spaceship of the imagination’ that takes us back and forth through time from the moment of the Big Bang to the end of the Earth – either by the Sun’s expansion into a red giant star about 6 billion years from now, or the end of humanity through self-destruction. In between and along the way we see the evolution of life with the progression of natural and artificial selection, to the rise and fall of the Ionians in Greece, we hear the questions posed about alien life and what it would mean to humanity, we find explorers of the future in their nuclear powered spaceships, and to the present where Sagan gives a moving plea in the final chapter, ‘Who Speaks for Earth?’ as he asks the people of the Earth to cooperate and help each other in ways that promote a global community that appreciates cultural diversity, as well as a common stewardship of the planet that we all share. Being that this is one of the best selling science books of all time and the most watched PBS series ever; Sagan’s message of education and wonder made it out to a lot of people – including a 4 year-old and a 31 year-old version of me! As a professional astronomer and science populizer, he understood the importance of communicating to the public the contemporary discoveries of science and the lessons of history.On exploration then and now:These voyages of exploration and discovery are the latest in a long series that have characterized and distinguished human history. In the 15th and 16th centuries you could travel from Spain to the Azores in a few days, the same time it takes us now to cross the channel from Earth to the Moon. It took then a few months to traverse the Atlantic Ocean and reach what was called the New World, the Americas. Today it takes a few months to cross the ocean of the inner solar system and make planet-fall on Mars or Venus, which are truly and literally new worlds awaiting us. In the 17th and 18th centuries you could travel from Holland to China in a year or two, the time it has taken Voyager to travel from Earth to Jupiter.On theology:Every human culture rejoices in the fact that there are cycles in nature. But how, it was thought, could such cycles come about unless the gods willed them? And if there are cycles in the years of humans, might there not be cycles in the aeons of the gods?... It is said that men may not be the dreams of the gods, but rather that the gods are the dreams of men.On humanity and stewardship:There are not yet any obvious signs of extraterrestrial intelligence and this makes us wonder whether civilizations like ours always rush implacably, headlong, toward self-destruction. National boundaries are not evident when we view the Earth from space. Fanatical ethnic or religious or national chauvinisms are a little difficult to maintain when we see our planet as a fragile blue crescent fading to become an inconspicuous point of light against the bastion and citadel of stars… What account would we give of our stewardship of the planet Earth? We have heard the rationales offered by the nuclear superpowers. We know who speaks for the nations. But who speaks for the human species? Who speaks for Earth?"
319,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48531520-danny,5,"Sagan’s seminal, stirring soliloquy to the stars subtly centres its sweeping sights simultaneously on the Sapien citizens of “the pale blue dot” and the wider cosmos in which we reside. I ran out of sibilance at the end there....In all seriousness though, this was a fascinating read even if I did switch off occasionally during the more densely scientific/mathematical moments. I’ve never read any Sagan though I’ve heard speeches of his and seen interviews etc and his writing here confirms what I’ve always believed about him- that he is a remarkable writer who illuminates complicated topics with a striking humanity that is never lost, even when the gaze is turned into the vast unknowability of the universe. It is hard not to be moved by Sagan’s optimism for humanity here, partly because of its appraisal of our glorious achievements, but also because of its prescient warnings to us as a species increasingly on the verge of our own destruction. Not much has improved in the 40 years since Sagan wrote this, and it’s hard not to hope that the cosmos will provide a reminder to us to pull together for our mutual survival. One things for sure: the universe won’t care either way..."
320,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6809550-ahmad-abugosh,3,"Although I didn't learn an awful lot and much of the info in it is outdated, I thoroughly enjoyed the spirit of the book."
321,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5698189-allison,4,"I was a little leery about the value of reading this book. 30 years is a lot of time in science (radio astronomy, for instance -- the capability Sagan uses to define technical civilizations -- is twice as old now as it was then), to say nothing of political and economic realities. I wasn't sure whether the whole thing would just be tremendously outdated.And... it is a little obsolete. Obsolete with a caveat though. Most notably is the fact that the book was written during the height of the Cold War, so the USSR's space and weapon capabilities are referred to throughout. Some of the science has indeed been either abandoned or developed to a much higher level -- as an example, Sagan writes that deforestation could either warm the planet by annihilating much of our CO2-devouring trees, or cool it down by introducing vast stretches of light-colored land, which would reflect more of the Sun's light back into space than the darker-colored forests these plains were overtaking. In 1980 they just didn't know which way it would go.From a science perspective, the entire book should indeed be read with the thought that it's ever-so-slightly out of date, and that while much of the information still holds true, it's best to consult more current sources for reference.The aforementioned caveat is that the facts aren't where Cosmos shines. Sagan had this absolutely incredible talent for sharing his excitement about science with his viewers, listeners, and readers. Every word drips with his blatant passion for the subject, and it is clearly apparent that even after what had already been a significant career, his wonder at and curiosity about the universe and all the beauty it contains had not waned. It's a science book that lends itself to an emotional investment. It's a science book that will make you (well, me, at least...) become more excited about science, and want to pick up more books and simply to learn more about the topics he writes of.And that is a wildly, incredibly, beautifully powerful thing.There are some weaknesses, to be sure. The romanticization goes a little far from time to time, most notably in the three pages of hypothetical thoughts of a pre-historic man, but perhaps also with the slightly-too-specific ruminations of how contact with another intelligent civilization could manifest.But those weaknesses are almost negligible compared to its strengths. We need more books (and TV shows and web series -- whatever medium works) to get people excited about the stars, the galaxies, and our minuscule-but-significant place within it all. We need to be told a little more often just how freaking small we are. Maybe it would push some to develop ambition beyond being on TV or having an enormous wedding. Maybe it would help ""smart"" to become a desirable characteristic again. Maybe it would allow us to look beyond whatever current political skirmish people are screaming about at a given moment, toward the notion that we are tiny creatures with the entire cosmos to explore."
322,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12626539-jerrodm,3,"Overall, a very enjoyable book, and one that made me smile with the quirky, compelling voice of the author as much as it made me feel ""wow"" moments about the universe. The book was written as a companion piece to the original Cosmos TV series, which was broadcast on PBS in the early 80's with the goal of popularizing science and encouraging scientific endeavor. The book largely follows the structure of the series, with 13 chapters to the TV series' 13 episodes. It uses the same structure--jumping back and forth between retellings of historical events, largely about the contributions of individuals and groups to what we now understand about the universe and our place in it to the actual science behind physics, biology, chemistry, etc.The book largely accomplishes its goal, and the writing is really quite nice, particularly given that it was written by a scientist--sorry, but most scientists (like most economists) are terrible writers. Sagan is not--he's engaging, concise, and has a gift for a nicely turned phrase. The book does become a little discursive at points: there are moments where I feel like the digressions become more about his personal musings and interests than about putting flesh on dry scientific bones. But for the most part the interweaving of the author's thoughts and perspectives, the individual stories and the hard science make for very engaging reading.Given that the book is coming up on 40 years old and that it's about popular science, you would think it would feel dated. There is a small bit of that--for example, the last chapter features a prominent discussion of the imminent threat to human civilization of unrestricted nuclear war caused by irrational deterrence policies. While nuclear weapons clearly remain the greatest long-term acute threat to humans and much of the rest of life on this planet, it seems quite a bit less likely than it must have in 1980 that the US and Russia are going to exchange a couple of hundred thermonuclear devices and wipe out most life on earth. I wonder what the ""warning"" chapter of the book would contain if it came out today--my guess is that it would be about the damage currently being inflicted on the planets ecosystems by human activities, an issue that was understood to a small degree in Sagan's day but not nearly as well as it is now.Cosmos is targeted to laypersons, and Sagan does a really lovely job of explaining concepts, even pretty difficult stuff like relativity and ""time travel"" in ways that non-technical audiences should be able to grasp. I'd recommend this book to anyone who is interested in science broadly--the main messages still feel relevant, and the connections to truth-seekers both ancient and modern make the book feel like an anthology of science history. Well worth the time and effort."
323,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15738127-anne-zappa,3,"This review comes from a non scientific mind even though I'm studying engineering which is more keen on contemplating & extrapolating the philosophical aspects of our curious instincts.As I read this book I kept brooding about why in the creation of our world was their a need to put those flickering bright spots in the sky. Trees exist to provide us O2, we exist to provide them CO2. Everything in nature has a purpose. Everything is balanced. What's their purpose? To keep us busy, to keep us thinking, to understand how insignificant we are in this vastly prodigious expanding universe. I couldn't get down to an answer obviously but I wouldn't put myself in the nihilistic sect of people for that. Was the ancient Ionian/Greek/Egyptian science something like golf, just a status symbol for emperors. The science(especially astronomy) of that epoch was not accessible to the masses & was of not much application in daily life(in that time). I'm talking about the time before the industrial revolution. The first major use of science that we ever had was in navigation, I wouldn't even call that science though, sailors were just observing the constellations to keep a check of their positions & even discovering that the earth is a sphere was a meticulous observation. No maths/physics involved, just meager observations of men who had nothing to do. So how was the boat made? That was science Mr Naive. Anyway why does it matter to know if it is the sun that circles the earth or the other way round? Was curiosity over-hyped just for some shallow people to consider themselves more eminent & noble than the everyman. I'm struggling with ambivalence here because I myself was just thinking about the purpose of the stars & am also accusing ancient scientists & emperors to be indulging in this exact same somewhat holy debauchery.Coming to our current epoch where we are trying to circumvent self destruction, where & when we are too dependent on technology, our whole life revolves around great scientific inventions, these same inventions that help us explore the universe have also given us weapons of mass destruction. Life is indeed ironic. Today when everyone is glued on a television or computer screen. When most of the questions that kept our ancestors in delirium have been answered which eventually lead us to question more, but we have just too many distractions.As birds sing, humans think.This magnificent & enigmatic universe has definitely devoid us of excuses to have a single boring day. I think a person who is not curious misses living life at a more intense level & reading this book made me curious about a lot of things."

326,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35643641-andr-s-astudillo,5,"I ended up crying, literally. Carl is one of those people you would never have the chance to meet, but you wished they had not died. Reading every chapter was learning, was reading history, reading poetry, was like reading a newspaper directly printed out for you. Unfortunately, Sagan died in 1996, when I was 8 years old. It made me sad that someone as dazzling, amazing, someone so educational and passionate for life, had died, but, who's to blame?, that's a small singularity over there for us. Carl wanted everyone to know about everything, he wanted people to challenge themselves, to ask questions, to speak for mankind. I noted that he is afraid, afraid of what we have become, afraid of not passing through this stage of ""technologically adolescent"" phase as he calls. He talks about myth and religion, obviously he believed in something; there's a part in which he mentions god as the laws of ""physics and nature"". However, he does not approach to the depiction of an old, white bearded white guy sitting on a trone and doing certain things from monday to saturday. There's so much to talk about when it comes to this book. I even feel happier when I remember I have a library (just 700 books) in my home. There's a chapter in which he says that we, human beings, have the proof of working magic, just by showing books. Reading this will make up your mind for many reasons, 1) there's so much one doesn't know, and the fact that there was a 1000 year hiatus for science since the destruction of the Library of Alexandria until the sixteenth century did not contribute to the development of science 2) in our entire lifetimes we will not even read 5% of the total of human knowledge, so we have to be really careful when it comes to buying books, 3) we belong to earth, and we are also part of something way bigger, so, we are a small fraction of the universe trying to comprehend itself, 4) homo hominis lupus est, is nothing but the R-Complex trying to behave for lust of power, that's why is easier to build a nuclear bomb than building a nuclear-powered starship for the sake of mankind and finally 5) Carl Sagan taugh us about humanity. Respect, love, and cherish civilizations, not to be a Hernan Cortez, not to discriminate people because of their gender, skin colour or geographical origin, all of us, with no exceptions are children of the Earth, of this small pale blue dot floating in a grain of sand, in the shores of the cosmic ocean.This is a book you will read and remember throughout your lifetime."
327,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"""Cosmos"" is mostly about the Earth and humans. Sagan spends some time in outer space, primarily in our local galaxy. The Big Bang and the life and death of stars are discussed primarily in relationship to ourselves. We are, he says in language he uses so well, remote descendants of the Big Bang. We are, he also says, ""solar powered."" Much of the rest of this book is on the intellectual history about how we have come to know the world beyond the earth, and how we are now attempting to communicate with other life that Sagan believes exists elsewhere, somewhere, in space. Sagan concludes with some ominous warnings about the dangers of the earth's destruction from nuclear weapons.Sagan is well-known for his ability to translate complex thoughts into terms that can be understood by the non-specialist. The normal human lifetime is longer than Voyager will take to go beyond Pluto's orbit. The number of stars in the universe is greater than all the grains of sand on the Earth's beaches. The book is filled with many great pictures. One picture of part of the sun's surface is covered with ""solar provinces"" that are ""turbulent cells"" where hot gas rises and sinks. Each cell is about ""a 1,000 kilometers across,"" the distance from ""Paris to Kiev."" Sagan tells us that our big dipper is called many different names around the world. He says atoms are mainly ""empty space"" and matter ""is comprised chiefly of nothing."" ""Essentially everything"" consists of three particles (protons, neutrons, electrons) put together in various patterns. Sagan states that in ""our tenure on this planet"" we have ""accumulated dangerous evolutionary baggage, hereditary propensities for aggression and ritual, submission to leaders and hostility to outsiders...."" that threaten our survival. But, as evidenced by our modern understanding of the cosmos, he places great weight on our intellectual capacity: ""no longer at the mercy of the reptile brain, we can change ourselves."" Sagan believes that we are able to see how dependent we are on this small earth and that we should not destroy it and ourselves by behavior that reflects our past. It's an uplifting but tenuous hope. How does an intellectual appreciation of distant threats provide sufficient motivation to overcome the individual survival energy that has been in our genes for millions of years? "
328,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37332006-ganesh-sanal,5,"Carl Sagan is the greatest communicator and populizer of the discipline of science. His was a time when we made large strides into the cosmos but were unsure of the long term future of our species. Realizing that the real power lie with the general public, Carl and his friends decided to change the world for good.The Selfish Gene, The God Delusion, A Brief History of Time and The Eerie Silence were better in content. Cosmos is, in a way, the summary of all these phenomenal but intensely specialised works. Maybe Carl targeted a less patient readership. But the book becomes worthwhile and one of my favorites at 
Chapter 13: Who speaks for earth
. This is where Carl becomes the legend that he truly is. He discuss what’s wrong with the world and how to fix it. We agree with him at the conclusion which is quite simple. The relentless pursuit of the unknown. All the reptilian leftovers in our brain that threaten our civilization gets dwarfed at our understanding of the tiny but almost unique position of ourselves in the cosmos.Many of the modern scientists, like Neil deGrasse Tyson and Paul Davies, were inspired into their field by this show. If this was made a compulsory read in every curriculum on the planet, we would have been at a whole lot better position.Well... What did I think??? A hell lot inspired. It was a long read with long chapters. I struggled to finish it. Carl seems to dislike punctuation and enjoy dangling modifiers as most authors of the past do. But despite all this, I was a hell lot inspired. I will never see the world the same way again. A true classic."
329,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3939397-martina,5,"Sagan's Cosmos is a lovely book. So lovely, in fact, that I regret not having read it when I was younger. I'm sure youngsters everywhere would find this book both fun and educational in so many ways. Even though one might think that the book solely deals with the universe, cosmic bodies and space travel, it's far more complex then that. I'd venture to say that the point of the book is to make the reader think about some fundamental questions like, ""Who are we?"" and ""What is this world/universe?"". Sagan goes about that task in an interesting way, by crafting a tale about life and, later on, the quest for knowledge, just liberally peppered with information about the universe and new breakthroughs in space travel. Very cleverly, Sagan starts off ab ovo in multiple aspects. After talking about the motivation for the book and the early origins of it (and the tv series) in the first chapter, he then continues to discuss yet another topic from the very beginning - the molecular chemistry of life - perhaps not in minute detail, but in a clear and concise fashion. He continues in the similar vein in the third chapter, with the start of yet another important thing - the human interest for stargazing, for knowing the universe, for establishing some sort of structures in the form of calendars. As the story progresses, and as the reader meets important people who have shaped the way we view the world today - Kepler, Newton, Huygens, da Vinci, Einstein and the myriad of philosophers and/or scientists of old Greece (Thales, Anaximader, Empedocles, Democritus, Anaxagoras, Aristarchus and Hypatia, to name a few) - it immediately becomes apparent how the road to our current knowledge of the universe has been rocky and fraught with many dangers. From pseudoscience to good old barbarism, there has been many things working against the progress of humankind. And although today's situation is by far the best if we look at human history as a whole, it's far from ideal. In my opinion, that's the biggest strength of Cosmos - raising awareness about how fragile life (and both knowledge and dreams) is. The wealth of historical and scientific information is a wonderful aspect of the book, and works well in underlining the main theme of the book. "

335,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93922358-james,5,The words in this book ooze with Carl Sagan's appreciation for the beauty of the Cosmos. I'd say it's worth reading for that alone.Overall a good beginning introduction to astronomy.
336,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1275149-cheryl,4,"I approached this book with fear and trembling; while I knew much of the discoveries were outdated and science has revealed so much more about the universe, I revere Sagan as one of the few geniuses that see the big picture and can articulate it. in my earlier, restless, seeking years, I learned this lesson in the deserts of Utah: “Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality.” There are people with no sense of spiritual life, no sense of the soul, no sense of mystery, but that impoverished worldview usually disintegrates when faced with the red rock of Utah, or the Grand Canyon, or illness, or cancer, or death, and then it can be transformed if natural, human curiosity is allowed to flourish. How can Utah look like Mars, is this what Mars looks like? What what forces and time caused the Grand Canyon? Why suffering? How do we die peacefully? If you never wonder about those things, none of them, bless you with TV, I hope you never run out of mindless things to watch. Sagan educates and enlightens, he is a sage, a seer, a see-er, a wise one. Some of Cosmos is over my head, but there is such beauty, it is digestible. The sense of wonder is more powerful than any drug, I promise, and the high never ends. Today we have discovered a powerful and elegant way to understand the universe, a method called science; it has revealed to us a universe so ancient and so vast that human affairs seem at first sight to be of little consequence. We have grown distant from the Cosmos. It has seemed remote and irrelevant to everyday concerns. But science has found not only that the universe has a reeling and ecstatic grandeur, not only that it is accessible to human understanding, but also that we are, in a very real and profound sense, a part of that Cosmos, born from it, our fate deeply connected with it. The most basic human events and the most trivial trace back to the universe and its origins.In addition, science is a delight; evolution has arranged that we take pleasure in understanding—those who understand are more likely to survive. Science is an ongoing process. It never ends. There is no single ultimate truth to be achieved, after which all the scientists can retire. And because this is so, the world is far more interesting, both for the scientists and for the millions of people in every nation who, while not professional scientists, are deeply interested in the methods and findings of science. Lost somewhere between immensity and eternity is our tiny planetary home. They remind us that humans have evolved to wonder, that understanding is a joy, that knowledge is prerequisite to survival. The only typical place is within the vast, cold, universal vacuum, the everlasting night of intergalactic space, a place so strange and desolate that, by comparison, planets and stars and galaxies seem achingly rare and lovely. If we were randomly inserted into the Cosmos, the chance that we would find ourselves on or near a planet would be less than one in a billion trillion trillion* (1033, a one followed by 33 zeroes). In everyday life such odds are called compelling. Worlds are precious. Human beings grew up in forests; we have a natural affinity for them. How lovely a tree is, straining toward the sky. Its leaves harvest sunlight to photosynthesize, so trees compete by shadowing their neighbors. If you look closely you can often see two trees pushing and shoving with languid grace. Trees are great and beautiful machines, powered by sunlight, taking in water from the ground and carbon dioxide from the air, converting these materials into food for their use and ours. The plant uses the carbohydrates it makes as an energy source to go about its planty business. And we animals, who are ultimately parasites on the plants, steal the carbohydrates so we can go about our business. In eating the plants we combine the carbohydrates with oxygen dissolved in our blood because of our penchant for breathing air, and so extract the energy that makes us go. In the process we exhale carbon dioxide, which the plants then recycle to make more carbohydrates. What a marvelous cooperative arrangement—plants and animals each inhaling the other’s exhalations, a kind of planet-wide mutual mouth-to-stoma resuscitation, the entire elegant cycle powered by a star 150 million kilometers away. We today can recognize the antiquity of astrology in words such as disaster, which is Greek for “bad star,” influenza, Italian for (astral) “influence”; mazeltov, Hebrew—and, ultimately, Babylonian—for “good constellation,” or the Yiddish word shlamazel, applied to someone plagued by relentless ill-fortune, which again traces to the Babylonian astronomical lexicon. According to Pliny, there were Romans considered sideratio, “planet-struck.” Planets were widely thought to be a direct cause of death. Or consider consider: it means “with the planets,” evidently a prerequisite for serious reflection.  “Mortal as I am,” he wrote, “I know that I am born for a day. But when I follow at my pleasure the serried multitude of the stars in their circular course, my feet no longer touch the Earth …”  Because the Earth has a larger area than the Moon, we might have to wait something like ten thousand years between collisions that would make craters as big as a kilometer across on our planet. On Venus, on Earth and elsewhere in the solar system, there is evidence for catastrophic destruction, tempered or overwhelmed by slower, more uniform processes: on the Earth, for example, rainfall, coursing into rivulets, streams and rivers of running water, creating huge alluvial basins; on Mars, the remnants of ancient rivers, perhaps arising from beneath the ground; on Io, a moon of Jupiter, what seem to be broad channels made by flowing liquid sulfur. There are mighty weather systems on the Earth—and in the high atmosphere of Venus and on Jupiter. There are sandstorms on the Earth and on Mars; lightning on Jupiter and Venus and Earth. Volcanoes inject debris into the atmospheres of the Earth and Io. Internal geological processes slowly deform the surfaces of Venus, Mars, Ganymede and Europa, as well as Earth. Glaciers, proverbial for their slowness, produce major reworkings of landscapes on the Earth and probably also on Mars. Eating an apple is an immensely complicated process. In fact, if I had to synthesize my own enzymes, if I consciously had to remember and direct all the chemical steps required to get energy out of food, I would probably starve. Emotions and ritualized behavior patterns are built deeply into us. They are part of our humanity. But they are not characteristically human. Many other animals have feelings. What distinguishes our species is thought. The great libraries of the world contain millions of volumes, the equivalent of about 1014 bits of information in words, and perhaps 1015 bits in pictures. This is ten thousand times more information than in our genes, and about ten times more than in our brains. If I finish a book a week, I will read only a few thousand books in my lifetime, about a tenth of a percent of the contents of the greatest libraries of our time. The trick is to know which books to read. The information in books is not preprogrammed at birth but constantly changed, amended by events, adapted to the world. We inhabit a universe where atoms are made in the centers of stars; where each second a thousand suns are born; where life is sparked by sunlight and lightning in the airs and waters of youthful planets; where the raw material for biological evolution is sometimes made by the explosion of a star halfway across the Milky Way; where a thing as beautiful as a galaxy is formed a hundred billion times—a Cosmos of quasars and quarks, snowflakes and fireflies, where there may be black holes and other universes and extraterrestrial civilizations whose radio messages are at this moment reaching the Earth. How pallid by comparison are the pretensions of superstition and pseudoscience; how important it is for us to pursue and understand science, that characteristically human endeavor. Every aspect of Nature reveals a deep mystery and touches our sense of wonder and awe. Theophrastus was right. Those afraid of the universe as it really is, those who pretend to nonexistent knowledge and envision a Cosmos centered on human beings will prefer the fleeting comforts of superstition. They avoid rather than confront the world. But those with the courage to explore the weave and structure of the Cosmos, even where it differs profoundly from their wishes and prejudices, will penetrate its deepest mysteries. Alexandria was the greatest city the Western world had ever seen. People of all nations came there to live, to trade, to learn. On any given day, its harbors were thronged with merchants, scholars and tourists. This was a city where Greeks, Egyptians, Arabs, Syrians, Hebrews, Persians, Nubians, Phoenicians, Italians, Gauls and Iberians exchanged merchandise and ideas. It is probably here that the word cosmopolitan realized its true meaning—citizen, not just of a nation, but of the Cosmos,*  this: For unknown ages after the explosive outpouring of matter and energy of the Big Bang, the Cosmos was without form. There were no galaxies, no planets, no life. Deep, impenetrable darkness was everywhere, hydrogen atoms in the void. Here and there denser accumulations of gas were imperceptibly growing, globes of matter were condensing—hydrogen raindrops more massive than suns. Within these globes of gas was first kindled the nuclear fire latent in matter. A first generation of stars was born, flooding the Cosmos with light. There were in those times not yet any planets to receive the light, no living creatures to admire the radiance of the heavens. Deep in the stellar furnaces the alchemy of nuclear fusion created heavy elements, the ashes of hydrogen burning, the atomic building materials of future planets and lifeforms. Massive stars soon exhausted their stores of nuclear fuel. Rocked by colossal explosions, they returned most of their substance back into the thin gas from which they had once condensed. Here in the dark lush clouds between the stars, new raindrops made of many elements were forming, later generations of stars being born. Nearby, smaller raindrops grew, bodies far too little to ignite the nuclear fire, droplets in the interstellar mist on their way to form the planets. Among them was a small world of stone and iron, the early Earth. Congealing and warming, the Earth released the methane, ammonia, water and hydrogen gases that had been trapped within, forming the primitive atmosphere and the first oceans. Starlight from the Sun bathed and warmed the primeval Earth, drove storms, generated lightning and thunder. Volcanoes overflowed with lava. These processes disrupted molecules of the primitive atmosphere; the fragments fell back together again into more and more complex forms, which dissolved in the early oceans. After a time the seas achieved the consistency of a warm, dilute soup. Molecules were organized, and complex chemical reactions driven, on the surface of clays. And one day a molecule arose that quite by accident was able to make crude copies of itself out of the other molecules in the broth. As time passed, more elaborate and more accurate self-replicating molecules arose. Those combinations best suited to further replication were favored by the sieve of natural selection. Those that copied better produced more copies. And the primitive oceanic broth gradually grew thin as it was consumed by and transformed into complex condensations of self-replicating organic molecules. Gradually, imperceptibly, life had begun. Single-celled plants evolved, and life began to generate its own food. Photosynthesis transformed the atmosphere. Sex was invented. Once free-living forms banded together to make a complex cell with specialized functions. Chemical receptors evolved, and the Cosmos could taste and smell. One-celled organisms evolved into multicellular colonies, elaborating their various parts into specialized organ systems. Eyes and ears evolved, and now the Cosmos could see and hear. Plants and animals discovered that the land could support life. Organisms buzzed, crawled, scuttled, lumbered, glided, flapped, shimmied, climbed and soared. Colossal beasts thundered through the steaming jungles. Small creatures emerged, born live instead of in hard-shelled containers, with a fluid like the early oceans coursing through their veins. They survived by swiftness and cunning. And then, only a moment ago, some small arboreal animals scampered down from the trees. They became upright and taught themselves the use of tools, domesticated other animals, plants and fire, and devised language. The ash of stellar alchemy was now emerging into consciousness. At an ever-accelerating pace, it invented writing, cities, art and science, and sent spaceships to the planets and the stars. These are some of the things that hydrogen atoms do, given fifteen billion years of cosmic evolution. It has the sound of epic myth, and rightly. But it is simply a description of cosmic evolution as revealed by the science of our time. We are difficult to come by and a danger to ourselves. But any account of cosmic evolution makes it clear that all the creatures of the Earth, the latest manufactures of the galactic hydrogen industry, are beings to be cherished. Elsewhere there may be other equally astonishing transmutations of matter, so wistfully we listen for a humming in the sky. We have held the peculiar notion that a person or society that is a little different from us, whoever we are, is somehow strange or bizarre, to be distrusted or loathed. Think of the negative connotations of words like alien or outlandish. And yet the monuments and cultures of each of our civilizations merely represent different ways of being human. An extraterrestrial visitor, looking at the differences among human beings and their societies, would find those differences trivial compared to the similarities. The Cosmos may be densely populated with intelligent beings. But the Darwinian lesson is clear: There will be no humans elsewhere. Only here. Only on this small planet. We are a rare as well as an endangered species. Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another. Human history can be viewed as a slowly dawning awareness that we are members of a larger group. Initially our loyalties were to ourselves and our immediate family, next, to bands of wandering hunter-gatherers, then to tribes, small settlements, city-states, nations. We have broadened the circle of those we love. We have now organized what are modestly described as superpowers, which include groups of people from divergent ethnic and cultural backgrounds working in some sense together—surely a humanizing and character-building experience. If we are to survive, our loyalties must be broadened further, to include the whole human community, the entire planet Earth. Many of those who run the nations will find this idea unpleasant. They will fear the loss of power. We will hear much about treason and disloyalty. Rich nation-states will have to share their wealth with poor ones. But the choice, as H. G. Wells once said in a different context, is clearly the universe or nothing. "

339,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21797839-rafael,5,"Cosmos By Carl Sagan ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ I think every Carl Sagan book should be mandatory in either school or university, Carl makes us wander to the universe and into ourselves, this is not an exact copy of the amazing cosmos tv series but a companion, going deeper on space exploration, evolution, education and even ethics on science, from the multiple cell organism evolution, thru the burning of the Alexandria library and finally to our future as a unique species, the word of carl will always resonate in the soul of the reader and even when reminding you the incredible mistake of some ”believers” that wiped out Alexandria, he will then fill you with hope with what humanity has achieved with science and perseverance, this book was wonderfully amazing and full of valuable information, as every Sagan book is one to revisit."

How pallid by comparison are the pretensions of superstition and pseudoscience; how important it is for us to pursue and understand science, that characteristically human endeavor. """
341,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10974082-christine,3,"I'd heard the skies singing with its praises for years before I finally got the opportunity to read this book. If it wasn't non-fiction I would describe it as having a cult following, and maybe it does among scientists. The foreword in this edition is by Neil deGrasse Tyson, who is probably the coolest guy I've never met. So I had pretty high expectations for it, and for the most part it met them. I'm discovering that I want my non-fiction books to be very linear and direct; I want the line of knowledge and discovery and mistakes to start at the beginning and trundle along until the end. Side trips are acceptable, shaking up the timeline is not. But that's not really the way Sagan writes. He'll start at one point and wander forwards and back in that general area before hopping over to something different. Maybe he'll come back later. Maybe he won't. So if you don't have a decent grasp of the timeline before you start out it can be challenging to keep everything straight in your head. The other part I had a tough time with was the math. I haven't dealt with any theoretical math, algebra, or proofs since I was in high school. I don't remember Kepler's laws of planetary motion, if indeed I ever learned them. Sagan discusses them all, in detail, along with how Kepler discovered them. Which was useful. He also includes two appendices: ""Reductio ad Absurdum and the Square Root of Two,"" and ""The Five Pythagorean Solids."" They're both discussed in other chapters but not in the level of detail the appendices provide. They are pretty complex. Fascinating, but complex. Speaking as someone who hasn't done algebra for over a decade, even reading step by step I had a tough time following the math. I just can't quite remember how to make 2 E/r - E + 2 E/n = 2 into 1/n + 1/r = 1/2 + 1/E, even knowing I'm dividing both sides by 2 E. Maybe if I took the extra time to sit down and write it all out? When he says 2 E/r is that 2(E/r) or (2E)/r? Because they're not the same! I'm guessing it's the latter, based on the result in the next step, but speaking as someone who doesn't do a whole lot of math it's not printed out as clearly as it could be. I mean, what if someone wants to try this at home? Then again, maybe I'm being alarmist. It's just an appendix.Most of Sagan's side trips are fascinating. I wouldn't have expected to learn about Champollion making the breakthrough that finally allowed scholars to decipher Egyptian hieroglyphics, but it was in here. Sagan uses it as a metaphor for communicating with an alien civilization, to give us an idea of the difficulties we could face if we ever got the chance to do it, but also to prove that it could be possible. Just start by looking for patterns. The human brain excels at finding patterns. The thought that we may one day use that skill to allow us to decipher the language of an alien civilization and communicate with them is extravagantly exciting. Even if the chances that it will be in my lifetime are slim to none. Sagan holds out a lot of hope for the future of the human race, and his desire to explore and discover is contagious. It's heart-breaking to read Cosmos knowing the funding for NASA has been obliterated, in part because of Sagan's insistence that spectacular, ground-breaking discoveries about the nature of the universe aren't that expensive, compared to the funding given to the defense budget, and that every science dollar spent will come back to us sevenfold. (363) He makes clear his belief that if we continue down the path we're on we may destroy ourselves. His final point is that we can either focus on nuclear and conventional weaponry, or space. Not both. That's a complicated issue, and it's not going to be an easy decision to make. If we fund science at the expense of defensive and offensive weaponry, will we be able to protect ourselves? What does protection mean in an age of nuclear bombs? If we fund defense at the expense of science, will we make the kind of progress needed to solve the looming problems of the global future? Will we have a planet left to explore from? Or will we suddenly discover we're going to space whether we're ready or not, because while we were busy building bombs the world melted beneath us? Can we break the barriers between our countries, unite our leaders and our scientists, and work together for a common goal? Can't we all just get along?"

Eventhough it's a non fiction, its filled with emotion and passion and will ignite hope and a hunger to know more about the universe. The book is filled with basic cosmology, describes how the universe evolved and how it works in simple terms, filled with stories about the magnificent history of science and exploration since the first man started questioning nature, and how our thinking evolved ever since. Everyone must read this book, it changes your prespective on life and our place in the cosmos."

346,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60618227-amit-sareen,4,"If you look up at the stars and wonder about the universe, this book is for you. It doesn't have all the answers to your questions, what it has is - logical reasoning, analysis of data available from 13.8 billion years, deductions, and inferences. It helps one see the Cosmos in the light of the best minds that have dawned upon this little rock, the planet earth, wandering in the huge creation. It deals quite well with the question of life elsewhere in the universe, the extra-terrestrial, and the civilizations that have been on earth and are yet to come.I find that if you have some knowledge of physics, this book would be more helpful. It does deal with many important questions very well, but at times, the explanations are somewhat stretched (although these may be helpful for people with less understanding of physics). Towards the end, there are some, estimates and calculations done with some assumed figures for which I did not find a much suitable explanation (for assuming those numbers).I found it an interesting read for another reason - This book was written and published some 38 years ago (I'm currently in 2018!) which, in today's world, is a long-long ago with respect to the daily technological advancements we are making. But this is still relevant, the data, the thought processes, the inferences still remain the same. At that time, scientists did a great job at bringing all this data and analysis together which we are using today to help us advance at a very fast pace. It's also great to see some of the things as foreseen by scientists then and we've achieved them now. It's not a novel, it's a beautiful guide to our home, the Cosmos."
347,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26845173-seth,3,I read this in Sagan's voice. Billions upon billions of stars...
348,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3114740-stafford-davis,5,"In my view, this book and the accompanying PBS series combined into one entity is Carl Sagan’s masterpiece. He fuses astronomy, history, philosophy, religion, biography, speculation, and art into this project in such an unique and astonishing way that one can’t help but be completely enthralled with the information given. We start off as a passenger on a ‘spaceship of the imagination’ that takes us back and forth through time from the moment of the Big Bang to the end of the Earth – either by the Sun’s expansion into a red giant star about 6 billion years from now, or the end of humanity through self-destruction. In between and along the way we see the evolution of life with the progression of natural and artificial selection, to the rise and fall of the Ionians in Greece, we hear the questions posed about alien life and what it would mean to humanity, we find explorers of the future in their nuclear powered spaceships, and to the present where Sagan gives a moving plea in the final chapter, ‘Who Speaks for Earth?’ as he asks the people of the Earth to cooperate and help each other in ways that promote a global community that appreciates cultural diversity, as well as a common stewardship of the planet that we all share. Being that this is one of the best selling science books of all time and the most watched PBS series ever; Sagan’s message of education and wonder made it out to a lot of people – including a 4 year-old and a 31 year-old version of me! As a professional astronomer and science populizer, he understood the importance of communicating to the public the contemporary discoveries of science and the lessons of history.On exploration then and now:These voyages of exploration and discovery are the latest in a long series that have characterized and distinguished human history. In the 15th and 16th centuries you could travel from Spain to the Azores in a few days, the same time it takes us now to cross the channel from Earth to the Moon. It took then a few months to traverse the Atlantic Ocean and reach what was called the New World, the Americas. Today it takes a few months to cross the ocean of the inner solar system and make planet-fall on Mars or Venus, which are truly and literally new worlds awaiting us. In the 17th and 18th centuries you could travel from Holland to China in a year or two, the time it has taken Voyager to travel from Earth to Jupiter.On theology:Every human culture rejoices in the fact that there are cycles in nature. But how, it was thought, could such cycles come about unless the gods willed them? And if there are cycles in the years of humans, might there not be cycles in the aeons of the gods?... It is said that men may not be the dreams of the gods, but rather that the gods are the dreams of men.On humanity and stewardship:There are not yet any obvious signs of extraterrestrial intelligence and this makes us wonder whether civilizations like ours always rush implacably, headlong, toward self-destruction. National boundaries are not evident when we view the Earth from space. Fanatical ethnic or religious or national chauvinisms are a little difficult to maintain when we see our planet as a fragile blue crescent fading to become an inconspicuous point of light against the bastion and citadel of stars… What account would we give of our stewardship of the planet Earth? We have heard the rationales offered by the nuclear superpowers. We know who speaks for the nations. But who speaks for the human species? Who speaks for Earth?"
349,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48531520-danny,5,"Sagan’s seminal, stirring soliloquy to the stars subtly centres its sweeping sights simultaneously on the Sapien citizens of “the pale blue dot” and the wider cosmos in which we reside. I ran out of sibilance at the end there....In all seriousness though, this was a fascinating read even if I did switch off occasionally during the more densely scientific/mathematical moments. I’ve never read any Sagan though I’ve heard speeches of his and seen interviews etc and his writing here confirms what I’ve always believed about him- that he is a remarkable writer who illuminates complicated topics with a striking humanity that is never lost, even when the gaze is turned into the vast unknowability of the universe. It is hard not to be moved by Sagan’s optimism for humanity here, partly because of its appraisal of our glorious achievements, but also because of its prescient warnings to us as a species increasingly on the verge of our own destruction. Not much has improved in the 40 years since Sagan wrote this, and it’s hard not to hope that the cosmos will provide a reminder to us to pull together for our mutual survival. One things for sure: the universe won’t care either way..."
350,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6809550-ahmad-abugosh,3,"Although I didn't learn an awful lot and much of the info in it is outdated, I thoroughly enjoyed the spirit of the book."
351,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5698189-allison,4,"I was a little leery about the value of reading this book. 30 years is a lot of time in science (radio astronomy, for instance -- the capability Sagan uses to define technical civilizations -- is twice as old now as it was then), to say nothing of political and economic realities. I wasn't sure whether the whole thing would just be tremendously outdated.And... it is a little obsolete. Obsolete with a caveat though. Most notably is the fact that the book was written during the height of the Cold War, so the USSR's space and weapon capabilities are referred to throughout. Some of the science has indeed been either abandoned or developed to a much higher level -- as an example, Sagan writes that deforestation could either warm the planet by annihilating much of our CO2-devouring trees, or cool it down by introducing vast stretches of light-colored land, which would reflect more of the Sun's light back into space than the darker-colored forests these plains were overtaking. In 1980 they just didn't know which way it would go.From a science perspective, the entire book should indeed be read with the thought that it's ever-so-slightly out of date, and that while much of the information still holds true, it's best to consult more current sources for reference.The aforementioned caveat is that the facts aren't where Cosmos shines. Sagan had this absolutely incredible talent for sharing his excitement about science with his viewers, listeners, and readers. Every word drips with his blatant passion for the subject, and it is clearly apparent that even after what had already been a significant career, his wonder at and curiosity about the universe and all the beauty it contains had not waned. It's a science book that lends itself to an emotional investment. It's a science book that will make you (well, me, at least...) become more excited about science, and want to pick up more books and simply to learn more about the topics he writes of.And that is a wildly, incredibly, beautifully powerful thing.There are some weaknesses, to be sure. The romanticization goes a little far from time to time, most notably in the three pages of hypothetical thoughts of a pre-historic man, but perhaps also with the slightly-too-specific ruminations of how contact with another intelligent civilization could manifest.But those weaknesses are almost negligible compared to its strengths. We need more books (and TV shows and web series -- whatever medium works) to get people excited about the stars, the galaxies, and our minuscule-but-significant place within it all. We need to be told a little more often just how freaking small we are. Maybe it would push some to develop ambition beyond being on TV or having an enormous wedding. Maybe it would help ""smart"" to become a desirable characteristic again. Maybe it would allow us to look beyond whatever current political skirmish people are screaming about at a given moment, toward the notion that we are tiny creatures with the entire cosmos to explore."
352,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12626539-jerrodm,3,"Overall, a very enjoyable book, and one that made me smile with the quirky, compelling voice of the author as much as it made me feel ""wow"" moments about the universe. The book was written as a companion piece to the original Cosmos TV series, which was broadcast on PBS in the early 80's with the goal of popularizing science and encouraging scientific endeavor. The book largely follows the structure of the series, with 13 chapters to the TV series' 13 episodes. It uses the same structure--jumping back and forth between retellings of historical events, largely about the contributions of individuals and groups to what we now understand about the universe and our place in it to the actual science behind physics, biology, chemistry, etc.The book largely accomplishes its goal, and the writing is really quite nice, particularly given that it was written by a scientist--sorry, but most scientists (like most economists) are terrible writers. Sagan is not--he's engaging, concise, and has a gift for a nicely turned phrase. The book does become a little discursive at points: there are moments where I feel like the digressions become more about his personal musings and interests than about putting flesh on dry scientific bones. But for the most part the interweaving of the author's thoughts and perspectives, the individual stories and the hard science make for very engaging reading.Given that the book is coming up on 40 years old and that it's about popular science, you would think it would feel dated. There is a small bit of that--for example, the last chapter features a prominent discussion of the imminent threat to human civilization of unrestricted nuclear war caused by irrational deterrence policies. While nuclear weapons clearly remain the greatest long-term acute threat to humans and much of the rest of life on this planet, it seems quite a bit less likely than it must have in 1980 that the US and Russia are going to exchange a couple of hundred thermonuclear devices and wipe out most life on earth. I wonder what the ""warning"" chapter of the book would contain if it came out today--my guess is that it would be about the damage currently being inflicted on the planets ecosystems by human activities, an issue that was understood to a small degree in Sagan's day but not nearly as well as it is now.Cosmos is targeted to laypersons, and Sagan does a really lovely job of explaining concepts, even pretty difficult stuff like relativity and ""time travel"" in ways that non-technical audiences should be able to grasp. I'd recommend this book to anyone who is interested in science broadly--the main messages still feel relevant, and the connections to truth-seekers both ancient and modern make the book feel like an anthology of science history. Well worth the time and effort."
353,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15738127-anne-zappa,3,"This review comes from a non scientific mind even though I'm studying engineering which is more keen on contemplating & extrapolating the philosophical aspects of our curious instincts.As I read this book I kept brooding about why in the creation of our world was their a need to put those flickering bright spots in the sky. Trees exist to provide us O2, we exist to provide them CO2. Everything in nature has a purpose. Everything is balanced. What's their purpose? To keep us busy, to keep us thinking, to understand how insignificant we are in this vastly prodigious expanding universe. I couldn't get down to an answer obviously but I wouldn't put myself in the nihilistic sect of people for that. Was the ancient Ionian/Greek/Egyptian science something like golf, just a status symbol for emperors. The science(especially astronomy) of that epoch was not accessible to the masses & was of not much application in daily life(in that time). I'm talking about the time before the industrial revolution. The first major use of science that we ever had was in navigation, I wouldn't even call that science though, sailors were just observing the constellations to keep a check of their positions & even discovering that the earth is a sphere was a meticulous observation. No maths/physics involved, just meager observations of men who had nothing to do. So how was the boat made? That was science Mr Naive. Anyway why does it matter to know if it is the sun that circles the earth or the other way round? Was curiosity over-hyped just for some shallow people to consider themselves more eminent & noble than the everyman. I'm struggling with ambivalence here because I myself was just thinking about the purpose of the stars & am also accusing ancient scientists & emperors to be indulging in this exact same somewhat holy debauchery.Coming to our current epoch where we are trying to circumvent self destruction, where & when we are too dependent on technology, our whole life revolves around great scientific inventions, these same inventions that help us explore the universe have also given us weapons of mass destruction. Life is indeed ironic. Today when everyone is glued on a television or computer screen. When most of the questions that kept our ancestors in delirium have been answered which eventually lead us to question more, but we have just too many distractions.As birds sing, humans think.This magnificent & enigmatic universe has definitely devoid us of excuses to have a single boring day. I think a person who is not curious misses living life at a more intense level & reading this book made me curious about a lot of things."

Carl is one of those people you would never have the chance to meet, but you wished they had not died. Reading every chapter was learning, was reading history, reading poetry, was like reading a newspaper directly printed out for you. Unfortunately, Sagan died in 1996, when I was 8 years old. It made me sad that someone as dazzling, amazing, someone so educational and passionate for life, had died, but, who's to blame?, that's a small singularity over there for us. Carl wanted everyone to know about everything, he wanted people to challenge themselves, to ask questions, to speak for mankind. I noted that he is afraid, afraid of what we have become, afraid of not passing through this stage of ""technologically adolescent"" phase as he calls. He talks about myth and religion, obviously he believed in something; there's a part in which he mentions god as the laws of ""physics and nature"". However, he does not approach to the depiction of an old, white bearded white guy sitting on a trone and doing certain things from monday to saturday. There's so much to talk about when it comes to this book. I even feel happier when I remember I have a library (just 700 books) in my home. There's a chapter in which he says that we, human beings, have the proof of working magic, just by showing books. Reading this will make up your mind for many reasons, 1) there's so much one doesn't know, and the fact that there was a 1000 year hiatus for science since the destruction of the Library of Alexandria until the sixteenth century did not contribute to the development of science 2) in our entire lifetimes we will not even read 5% of the total of human knowledge, so we have to be really careful when it comes to buying books, 3) we belong to earth, and we are also part of something way bigger, so, we are a small fraction of the universe trying to comprehend itself, 4) homo hominis lupus est, is nothing but the R-Complex trying to behave for lust of power, that's why is easier to build a nuclear bomb than building a nuclear-powered starship for the sake of mankind and finally 5) Carl Sagan taugh us about humanity. Respect, love, and cherish civilizations, not to be a Hernan Cortez, not to discriminate people because of their gender, skin colour or geographical origin, all of us, with no exceptions are children of the Earth, of this small pale blue dot floating in a grain of sand, in the shores of the cosmic ocean.This is a book you will read and remember throughout your lifetime."
357,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"""Cosmos"" is mostly about the Earth and humans. Sagan spends some time in outer space, primarily in our local galaxy. The Big Bang and the life and death of stars are discussed primarily in relationship to ourselves. We are, he says in language he uses so well, remote descendants of the Big Bang. We are, he also says, ""solar powered."" Much of the rest of this book is on the intellectual history about how we have come to know the world beyond the earth, and how we are now attempting to communicate with other life that Sagan believes exists elsewhere, somewhere, in space. Sagan concludes with some ominous warnings about the dangers of the earth's destruction from nuclear weapons.Sagan is well-known for his ability to translate complex thoughts into terms that can be understood by the non-specialist. The normal human lifetime is longer than Voyager will take to go beyond Pluto's orbit. The number of stars in the universe is greater than all the grains of sand on the Earth's beaches. The book is filled with many great pictures. One picture of part of the sun's surface is covered with ""solar provinces"" that are ""turbulent cells"" where hot gas rises and sinks. Each cell is about ""a 1,000 kilometers across,"" the distance from ""Paris to Kiev."" Sagan tells us that our big dipper is called many different names around the world. He says atoms are mainly ""empty space"" and matter ""is comprised chiefly of nothing."" ""Essentially everything"" consists of three particles (protons, neutrons, electrons) put together in various patterns. Sagan states that in ""our tenure on this planet"" we have ""accumulated dangerous evolutionary baggage, hereditary propensities for aggression and ritual, submission to leaders and hostility to outsiders...."" that threaten our survival. But, as evidenced by our modern understanding of the cosmos, he places great weight on our intellectual capacity: ""no longer at the mercy of the reptile brain, we can change ourselves."" Sagan believes that we are able to see how dependent we are on this small earth and that we should not destroy it and ourselves by behavior that reflects our past. It's an uplifting but tenuous hope. How does an intellectual appreciation of distant threats provide sufficient motivation to overcome the individual survival energy that has been in our genes for millions of years? "
358,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37332006-ganesh-sanal,5,"Carl Sagan is the greatest communicator and populizer of the discipline of science. His was a time when we made large strides into the cosmos but were unsure of the long term future of our species. Realizing that the real power lie with the general public, Carl and his friends decided to change the world for good.The Selfish Gene, The God Delusion, A Brief History of Time and The Eerie Silence were better in content. Cosmos is, in a way, the summary of all these phenomenal but intensely specialised works. Maybe Carl targeted a less patient readership. But the book becomes worthwhile and one of my favorites at 
Chapter 13: Who speaks for earth
. This is where Carl becomes the legend that he truly is. He discuss what’s wrong with the world and how to fix it. We agree with him at the conclusion which is quite simple. The relentless pursuit of the unknown. All the reptilian leftovers in our brain that threaten our civilization gets dwarfed at our understanding of the tiny but almost unique position of ourselves in the cosmos.Many of the modern scientists, like Neil deGrasse Tyson and Paul Davies, were inspired into their field by this show. If this was made a compulsory read in every curriculum on the planet, we would have been at a whole lot better position.Well... What did I think??? A hell lot inspired. It was a long read with long chapters. I struggled to finish it. Carl seems to dislike punctuation and enjoy dangling modifiers as most authors of the past do. But despite all this, I was a hell lot inspired. I will never see the world the same way again. A true classic."
359,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3939397-martina,5,"Sagan's Cosmos is a lovely book. So lovely, in fact, that I regret not having read it when I was younger. I'm sure youngsters everywhere would find this book both fun and educational in so many ways. Even though one might think that the book solely deals with the universe, cosmic bodies and space travel, it's far more complex then that. I'd venture to say that the point of the book is to make the reader think about some fundamental questions like, ""Who are we?"" and ""What is this world/universe?"". Sagan goes about that task in an interesting way, by crafting a tale about life and, later on, the quest for knowledge, just liberally peppered with information about the universe and new breakthroughs in space travel. Very cleverly, Sagan starts off ab ovo in multiple aspects. After talking about the motivation for the book and the early origins of it (and the tv series) in the first chapter, he then continues to discuss yet another topic from the very beginning - the molecular chemistry of life - perhaps not in minute detail, but in a clear and concise fashion. He continues in the similar vein in the third chapter, with the start of yet another important thing - the human interest for stargazing, for knowing the universe, for establishing some sort of structures in the form of calendars. As the story progresses, and as the reader meets important people who have shaped the way we view the world today - Kepler, Newton, Huygens, da Vinci, Einstein and the myriad of philosophers and/or scientists of old Greece (Thales, Anaximader, Empedocles, Democritus, Anaxagoras, Aristarchus and Hypatia, to name a few) - it immediately becomes apparent how the road to our current knowledge of the universe has been rocky and fraught with many dangers. From pseudoscience to good old barbarism, there has been many things working against the progress of humankind. And although today's situation is by far the best if we look at human history as a whole, it's far from ideal. In my opinion, that's the biggest strength of Cosmos - raising awareness about how fragile life (and both knowledge and dreams) is. The wealth of historical and scientific information is a wonderful aspect of the book, and works well in underlining the main theme of the book. "
360,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8277135-erik,3,"I am in my early 40s, and am a chemical engineer with an amateur interesting in astronomy and physics. Coming from this background, there were a few parts in here in which Sagan talks about things that were new to me, but overall he was talking about fairly basic stuff. I think the audience intended is for either younger readers or readers who haven't already done much or any reading about astronomy. Sagan's passion for astronomy and his interest in the search for extraterrestrial life comes through in an exciting way. Early on in the book Sagan makes a few derogatory comments about religion that I just ignored because I realize that they is obligatory in any popular science book, but they just keep coming. In fact, he seems to get rather preachy about about how backward, oppressed and uninformed believers in God are. This aspect of the book was, in fact, one of the things that kept me going . . . I wanted to see just how outspoken he would get. I won't take the time to give quotes and refute specific arguments from a decades-old book, but I will say that Sagan seemed to have fallen trap to what I believe to be the logical fallacy of assuming that all of religion is incorrect because certain aspects of it don't correspond with our observations . . . one example is the apparent contradiction between what the book of Genesis seems to be saying about the age of the earth and what can be seen in the geological and fossil record. Using reasons like this to conclude that there is no God and Jesus Christ is not good science.I cannot deny that many horrible things have been done over the centuries in the name of religion, but I have read enough history to believe that religion, per se, is not the cause. The cause is that most people have a tendency to be selfish and hate those that are different. Abolishing religion will not root this tendency out of people; there will simply be terrible atrocities perpetrated in the name of something else.I gave the book three stars because it was written well enough to really get me to think about some things. But it is too mixed with anti-religious propaganda to be really considered a science book, as I believe it is marketed. "
361,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8171905-william-girdler,5,"I don't know how to exactly review this.It's a love story. It's like listening to a love letter written to a dear friend about the writer's love of his life. The writer being Carl Sagan and the love of his life being The cosmos. (and also his wife, who gets one of my favorite dedications ever). As hackneyed as that sounds I really can't describe this book better in another way. The most compelling thing about this book is Sagan's love of space, earth, what makes us who and what we are and what we can be. It is one of the most enjoyable experiences one can have learning something. I love space. I love learning about it. And all the elements that make it up. I think mainly this is because astronomers seem to have an infectious love of their subject. Sagan gave such a love to Neil Degrasse Tyson (who opens the audio book I listened to) and Tyson has shared that with my generation including myself. Which is what lead me to go back to the source. I've seen Sagan's cosmos show in its entirety and this is part covering the same ground and a companion of said show. The book makes you feel infinitely small, yet infinitely important. The subject is taught in such a way that it's easily approachable and immensely interesting. I think I will definitely read more by Sagan. I love his poetic tone and his ability to express and impart ideas. I usually read via audiobooks and normally I don't review them as such on here, but I want to shout out this aspect for this particular book. Sagan's wife Ann Druyan wrote and narrated one introduction. Tyson another. And Seth McFarlane (who's work I mostly dislike but who I deeply respect for ensuring Tyson's updated Cosmos tv show exists) reads Sagan's original intro. The body of the book is read by one of my childhood heroes who helped instill my love of reading, LeVar Burton. This audio book is a work of art. So relaxing and all encompassing. As a finished listening I was already excited to listen to it again. I may start falling asleep to it or something. It's such a great production."
362,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13186882-birsilah-bakar,4,"This is one of the most amazing, eye-opening book I've ever read, besides The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The prose is simple yet enlightening. It's incredible how something so complicated could be so simple in his words.I picked this book us because I read The Sun Is Also a Star and it contained a little bit of Sagan gem in the beginning and I knew that I had to look it up. I swear it's not because I liked apple pie. Last Sunday I was having the most rotten day and my problems are piling higher and higher and as far as a bookworm goes, a bookstore is the cure. Saw Cosmos on sale so I began to read it almost immediately. Funny thing about something intangible and as far as infinite goes, all of my problems disappeared. I solved one problem on the same day. Today I solve another one. I will solve another problem later. I'm half human, half universe. I got this."
363,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4922982-nathan,5,"Carl Sagan's ""Cosmos"" is a something that isn't supposed to be left by the wayside. On the surface, Cosmos is about science. From the very small cells, to the universe itself, the book covers a bit of everything through the lens of the discoverer. Beyond the surface, Cosmos offers much much more. It offers an insight a Carl Sagan himself. Sagan clearly had a vision of the universe around him and was able to think vastly differently then many others. He could envision worlds which would seem impossible, but through science and observation, could very well exist. Sagan wasn't an American, he was an Earthling. Sagan understood that the borders we drew around ourselves were arbitrary compared to the reality. In the last chapter Sagan's understanding of the world clearly comes into view. While the outlook of humanity seems very doomed, he still holds optimism. Upon watching the television series with the same title, I though that perhaps Sagan was a bit preachy in his antiwar speech, but after reading this book, I can see where he comes from. It the fact that the story shaped by the cosmos, viewed through we humans, could be destroyed in only a few seconds because we haven't decided to evolve into something better. If you want to read this for the science, you may find yourself a bit disappointed and scared (because sometimes his ideas and theories are a bit cryptic, e.g. global warming). But, if you want to view the world through a new lens, to wrap your mind around something new and garner a new hue for the world, I would highly suggest this for your reading. In all honesty, my words are meaningless when trying to explain the great contribution the Sagan has attempted to inject into society (and sadly ignored for more ""pop culture"" garbage). Carl Sagan was a great man in life and can certainly find immortality in his words."
364,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9402537-preston-kutney,4,"This book is so packed with information, I really had to pace myself in order to digest it all. Some of the science is outdated, but the history of our understanding of the cosmos and space exploration section, as well as Sagan's musings on what the future holds for us Homo sapiens here on earth and our place in the universe are well worth it. The book also needs some subheadings or something, the length of the chapters was a little exhausting and Sagan's writing meandered at times. Sagan has such an incredible understanding of how our planet fits into the universe - he is able to divorce himself of all earthly bias and the limitations of human intuition to grasp the vast timescales and contradictions of astrophysics and come to clear conclusions. He writes from an almost extra-terrestrial viewpoint, writing objectively about mankind's follies and failings in a way that reminds me a little of the condescending tone BBC reporters use to talk about the United States' irrational gun laws or healthcare system. And the way he breaks down the probability of discovering intelligent life elsewhere in the universe is so systematic, thorough, and logically consistent, it gave me the chills! I also loved his perspective on intra-planetary relations, ie how humans in different regions should treat one another given our understanding of our cosmic uniqueness and the common goals of mankind. I felt some real shame as a human when Sagan explained how for the price of a couple nuclear submarines we could double the national space exploration budget. Instead of taking turns blowing things up we could channel human ingenuity and resources towards the more ennobling goals of expanding the cosmic footprint of mankind. Much simpler said than done, but Sagan states the obvious so eloquently that you want to shout it from the rooftops. "
365,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8234048-poorni,5,"OK, it took me time to read this one but not because it was boring but because it was simply brilliant. It is usually hard to read books written by scientists. I've always found them to be heavy on the science and very little thought is spared for the reader who might not be familiar with those concepts. Sagan stands out in this regard. The book is beautifully written. Sagan's prose is poetic. The book reads like an ode to the universe. Or like a passionate love letter. When you read the book, it becomes very evident to you that you are conversing with a mind that is so in love with the universe and everything in it; who is striving to understand even a grain's worth of it before his time is up. Sagan was a self- professed agnostic and I think that comes out very clearly in this book. He explains the science well but then when he expands his though process, you can feel his writing borders on a sense of awe an reverence for the universe. Sagan's writing is powerful. Many times, I had to catch my breath and read a line again; the impact was huge. With the most simple of words, Sagan weaves magic. He makes us realise how inconsequential we are in the grand scheme of things while at the same time telling us that we are all extraordinary, because we are all made of stars. Sagan has tried to resolve scientific concepts and human kind's awe for the universe in this book. He touches on everything from evolution, superstition, Kepler, relativity, planets, ancient scientists, nuclear war and the cosmos. He also handles concepts like religion, books, belief, intolerance and what not. Recommended reading for everyone. I read the e-version of the book, but I'm getting my hands on a hardbound version and its going on my bookshelf, and into the hands of my son as soon as he's old enough to understand at least parts of this. Absolutely breathtaking!! "
366,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24723429-aju-krishnan,4,"The Cosmos is everything that was, that is and that will ever be. Carl Sagan takes us through this exquisite journey starting with the origins and evolution of life on earth, then about our endeavors to explore the inner solar system comprising of the venus and mars. He points out that just like the americas and india were unexplored centuries ago, when the only known land was europe, such is our current situation on the shores of the cosmic ocean- with lot of worlds to be explored yet. He opines that the next striking thing to dawn upon us will be the news of contact with an extra-terrestrial civilization and that he is eagerly awaiting for it. He also explains how he is humbled by the immensity of space and how worthless is our fight for little more space in this pitiable corner of the cosmos. He explains how man since the ancient times, was keen to know what those shiny little things were up above in the night sky, and also how knowing their cycles meant the difference between life and death for him. He praises the greek for their practical wisdom and contributions to astronomy. He also approves the indian mythological concept of cycles of creation and destruction. He also presents an alarming fact that once a civilization reaches a certain amount of scientific progress, it tends to destroy ourselves, and that it is an inevitability in our near future. In last few chapters he talks about travel to nearby stars. It was an exciting read. Those who are passionate about astronomy, our origins and man's explorations into space will really love it. Now that I have completed it, I am eagerly waiting for Christopher Nolan's Interstellar to get released!"
367,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31684497-anoushka-gandhi,5,"It was truly an honour to read this book. I am so lucky to have been born after Carl Sagan, and to be born in a time when books can be published - more specifically, Carl Sagan's books. This book isn't just a favourite - it's a book I love.I don't really read non-fiction, so for people out there who don't either, this review is for you.Cosmos is a wonderful book that explores the origins of the universe and the origins of humanity at the same time. Carl Sagan is a wonderful writer who offers the reader a comprehensive understanding of the foundations of our universe, and the beginning of scientific thought. He reflects on the past of human beings, introduces us to theories about astronomy, and gives us hope for the future. Carl Sagan's words ignite the ""starstuff"" within you - truly.This book is a great read if you love learning. And if you don't, this book will make you love learning, and love reading, because Carl Sagan is a wonderful writer. He truly understands and appreciates the power of language, and it is evident in his writing. In some ways, he bares his thoughts to the reader - which is why you fall in love with distant galaxies and astronomy - because you can't help but see the universe through his eyes.And if you're not really interested in space, then that's okay. Because this book is also about the origins of humanity. Not just rational thought or science, but a lot of the milestones that made us who we are today. This book is both a museum of the universe and of the Earth - and I recommend it to lovers of reading, knowledge, science, history, or just anybody with a vested interest in humanity and its future."
368,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1779598-pete-dapixie,5,"I have hired this book from the local Astronomy Society library shelves, but also bought the full DVD series of what must be some of the finest t.v. ever made. So 30 years on I'm firstly watching one of the hour long programmes and then reading the relevant chapter in the book. I already know this is 5 star.Published in 1980 and based on Sagan's epic 13 part t.v. series, Cosmos is a remarkable journey. A trip for the mind and a meditation for the soul. Our travels into the Cosmos takes us through human history, from the Egyptian, Chinese and Greek early sciences into the European Enlightenment (or re-discovery). On to the 4 billion year formation of Hydrogen molecules into complex DNA, then off into space for a tour of the solar system. Sagan includes stops off the spaceship to hit the reader with Biology, or Ecology, or domesday scenarios of nuclear destruction. Then we're off to the stars again. The t.v. series is so good I'm only up to part 7, and each part I've watched twice. Carl Sagan is sadly missed. What this publication would have been with the images of Hubble! The book makes do with many fine paintings of solar and deep space subjects, but you feel Carl would have loved Hubble.Finally in the authors own words: The surface of the Earth is the shore of the cosmic ocean. From it we have learned most of what we know. Recently, we have waded a little out to sea, enough to dampen our toes or, at most, wet our ankles. The water seems inviting. The ocean calls. Some part of our being knows this is from where we came. We long to return."
369,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3495040-caroline,5,"This took a long time to get through, partly because it was so tempting to read it with Sagan's measured, stately narration as in the outstanding TV series. I also dragged my heels in the sections that most showed their age, such as the lengthy descriptions of the then-nascent Mars missions, the unknown cause of the extinction of the dinosaurs, and the calculation of sum totals of a species' information in terms of bits of data (he kindly defines for us what a bit is).I found myself wishing he hadn't passed away 15 years ago, as his voice is at once so rational and knowledgeable and so emotionally compelling that perhaps he is our species' best hope for sanity and peaceful cooperation--our best hope for a continuing future. Then again, precisely *because* he is able to channel his vision and understanding of the big picture to anyone who will stop to consider our place in the cosmos, his arguments will long outlive the both of us. This is ultimately the most powerful anti-war document I can imagine, written in the long shadow of nuclear proliferation. Even as he is clearly desperate for humanity to wake up to its possibilities, he delivers his message through such an unending awe for life on Earth that he is at once revered scientist and star-struck child--and he invites us to join him in both roles.I still prefer the raw power of the PBS series over the book (yes, even as the graphics have long since crossed over into the realm of cheese), but any devotee of the TV show would appreciate the chance to peruse the book at leisure. "
370,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47054186-seth-hanson,4," Cosmos is a nonfiction book written by the award winning astronomer Carl Sagen, and it is considered to be a classic of astronomy. It covers many topics related to astronomy, from the beginning of the universe to the possibilities of life on other planets to the future of the human race in space, all of them are covered in detail and in easy to understand language.  The book, which was originally written in conjunction with the Cosmos TV series, is a very interesting journey into the world of astronomy, with brief descriptions of much of the contents so as to fit more into the book, essentially filling all the basics of astronomy and all studies related to it into one book. The book also makes an interesting use of a combination of religious ideas and metaphors into the normally squarely scientific area of astronomy. While I personally feel that this is not a good scientific principal, I can certainly see how it would lead to not only a better understanding but also an increased interest and acceptance of some of the ideas elsewhere in the book, along with the ones being discussed. I liked this book, especially how it condensed many different areas of astronomy and science in general into the one book, but still making it all fit and feel like one book. I did, however, feel that the book did not have a very clear layout of the chapters, and therefor felt slightly disorganized. I would recommend this book to anyone at all interested in almost any branch of science, especially astronomy."
371,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2327135-linda,4,"In the life of a human being 30 years might seem as a lot of time, but compared to 30 years for modern science, it seems less than minuscule. A lot has happened since Cosmos was written and some of the theories expressed there are dated, some seemingly unanswerable questions have been answered and there are plenty of new pages of history to discover.That being said, I never approached reading Cosmos as a science book and I believe that nobody should. While it still contains some deal of dry science data (how many bits it was again, Mr. Sagan?), most of which is valid today as well, it is primary as popular-scientific book that succeeds more at being an intricate mixture of hard sciences - physics, chemistry, astronomy, biology - and different sub-types of philosophy, most notably metaphysics and cosmology with a great deal of history of science sprinkled on top for added value.As in most pop-sci books, the language is more than pleasant and allows the book to be read with ease, any science bits are described as simplified as possible and just like the TV-Series, Cosmos probably is the most quotable book I've encountered up to date.If I did not mind encroaching on people too much and I lived in a country where English was more widely spoken and I was more fanatical about science, I might go around preaching from it. Come to think of it, I might anyhow just for the laughs of it."
372,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8126830-jason,5,"My mother gave this book to me when I was in the 1st grade and it was one of the biggest eye openers of my childhood. Even though at the time I didn't understand most of the scientific jargon, my fascination with outer space and the planets drew me in and I was hooked. By the 3rd grade I was giving oral reports on black holes and the fabric of space-time and boring the hell out of my friends with my nonstop space rants. I've re-read it at least 6 different times since then as well as numerous other books by Steven Hawking and Kirshner and I can honestly say this is the greatest book about outer space/civilization/technology that I have ever read. The speculative fiction/non-fiction elements blend together perfectly and there is a never ending source of independence to what you can get out of this book. This book is a look at the big picture, the universe. Written by debatably the smartest astrophysicist of all time, Carl Sagan understood the universe possibly more than any human being who has ever lived. This book is the ""Space Bible"". Don't watch the series until you have read the book, and make sure it's the coffee table edition. The tiny paperback edition doesn't do justice to the amazing paintings. Every home in the world should have a copy. "

""the others chapters were also great but these two chapters really spoke to me especially chapter 13. the chapter ""who speaks for earth?"" deals with humans life long attribute that is greed and how our greed for power have made destructive weapons like nuclear weapon whose effect had devestating impact on the world especially people of japan. the holocaust brought by our own power.who will stand up against things like this except we the people whom the cosmos gave birth to. we must stand up and speak for earth ,our earth and protect whatever is left of it.  this book has definitely impacted my perspective on life and where we stand as homosapiens and how we are all interconnected with one another though cosmic evolution. ❤❤❤❤i love this book to infinity And beyond. 💜💜💜💜👍👍"
375,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/150963-luke,4,"This book had been on my list for a while and in my possession even longer. I decided it would get bumped up to ""on-deck"" when I saw a stranger holding it and overheard her commenting to a friend: ""I read Cosmos at least 1 time a year.""Having read Cosmos, I won't read it once a year, but I will make an effort to re-read the book while I'm still a young adult and hopefully read it again at a later date beyond that. The material in this book is awe inspiring and Carl Sagan has a real gift for eloquence and for communicating complex ideas effectively. Admittedly, some of the info is just a bit too hard to grasp (the size of the Universe), and other info is simply recondite mainly b/c it's outside the realm of our experience (relativity)... but the book is still definately worth a go. This seems silly to mention but I was impressed with Sagan's knowledge of certain aspects of ancient times and his quoting of very old text. Overall as a reader you feel in very good hands; those of an intellectual virtuoso. I highly recommend the book to others. "
376,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23015731-casey,5,"In a single sentence, this is a balm in book form for an existential crisis. I was feeling lost and confused in this painful universe and searching for something on the order of magnitude of religion to believe in, but religion has always seemed inadequate. If you've ever felt yourself moved or compelled by science, this is it.My first introduction to Carl Sagan's Cosmos was by my 8th grade science teacher, who wrote the chemical equations for photosynthesis and cellular respiration on the blackboard, one above the other, and asked us to stare at it until we had realized the beauty of this wonderous cycle that nature had set up. He then read the passage to us (the one about the mouth-to-stoma resuscitation), and that was my first glimpse of Sagan's ability to convey profound observations about the beauty of the universe in such simple and elegant terms.I grabbed this off a used bookstore shelf in search of something to believe in, and devoured it in one night. Felt a little better about my existence, and that of our world, afterwards. Absolutely incredible. "
377,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2873006-manikanta-avinash,5,"Carl Sagan's beautiful words transform you to outside the earth, into the cosmos and lets you appreciate the grandeur of the universe. It has so many unforgettable quotes which makes you ponder simultaneously on how precious human race is and also how trivial it is in the big picture. I think this is a must read not only for every science enthusiast but also for every person to appreciate the very fact we are ""alive"" and ""conscious"" in this universe and in his words how we are ""star stuff pondering stars"". His pitch for disarmament of nuclear weapons and increased investment in the cosmic exploration in the last chapter is nothing short of a historic speech if it has really been delivered on some big platform. I think every Nation head needs to read the last chapter especially in today's world to understand how important it is for us to make right decisions in this age. Read the book to appreciate the Universe and Nature and the fact that you are the result of innumerable, highly unlikely things occurring at the right place and the right time."
378,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14867749-saurabh-jhalani,5,"This was truly a mind-expanding and thought-provoking book. Made me ponder over a lot of things. Carl Sagan takes you on a journey to the end of universe, he makes you think about the origin of our species, about the origin of our planet and what might our species do in the future. This book has made me look at things from a different perspective. This book has made me realise that our planet is not such a bad place after all. We are so lucky to be part of this rare planet and we must do everything to savour it. The world, the people , everything that you see around yourself is made from the elements that created the universe- the cosmos. To quote from the book : The cosmos may be densely populated with intelligent beings. But the Darwinian lesson is clear: There will be no humans elsewhere. Only here. Only on this small planet. We are a rare as well as an endangered species. Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another. "
379,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4205939-sunny,3,"I found Cosmos to be an excellent, accessible introduction to a wide range of scientific discoveries from the past few centuries. I also appreciated how, despite the book's Western bent, Sagan incorporated pre-scientific ideas from several non-European cultures, to show how scientific discoveries are made in parallel.That said, I saw this book as more history than science — a history of science, yes, but still history. The benefit to this is that, although the book was published nearly 40 years ago, much of it still remains relevant; the downside to this is that it is not very in-depth, and the title felt misleading. Another downside, in my opinion, is that its philosophical musings were a bit tedious, but that's my personal taste.I would highly recommend this book for any non-STEM major friends that want to jump into scientific nonfiction but don't know where to start; otherwise, I would recommend Welcome to the Universe by Neil deGrasse Tyson for those looking for a more in-depth intro to astrophysics."
380,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37689288-che,5,"I picked up this book at the University of Chicago bookstore, and it is undoubtedly the best $20 that I have ever spent. Carl Sagan is not only a scientist, but a true humanitarian. His brilliant writing and compassionate narrative instilled in me a sense of awe and respect for science, the cosmos, and life. Every one of us is made of the elements from the stars, which are everywhere in the cosmos, but each human being is also the only instance of themself in the entire universe. Billions of billions of billions of atoms formed the cosmos, and the cosmos made the earth, and the earth made life, and humans. On a cosmic scale, warfare and animosity towards other members of our own species seem so trivial, yet they threaten the destruction of life that came from millions of years of painstaking evolution. In the cosmos, If we do not speak for earth, then no one will. And all of us together speak for earth. Seeing things from a cosmic perspective is humbling. I encourage you to go on a cosmic voyage with Carl Sagan, and set sail for the stars. "
381,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2327599-trevor-denton,5,"This is not just a sit-down-and-read-straight-through kind of book. It's more of a coffee table book, but that label tends to belittle its contents. This is a hugely eye-opening, all-encompassing coverage of the collective universe as experienced by the human race so far.The book's general theme, as with the TV series upon which it is based, is the uniqueness of human life in the midst of so much astrophysical indifference and chaos. The bulk of the text provides scientific facts about space, species, evolution, energy, motion, matter, and accompanying insight about the ramifications of said facts. But there seems to be an overarching message of existentialism - humanity holding its own fate in its hands. It encourages scientific inquiry and promotes a message of developing technology further for the purpose of educating ourselves further as living residents of a vast, mysterious universe, and how we might continue to survive as a species in such a volatile environment."
382,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7432477-jenny,5,"This should be required reading in schools. Its subject matter is focused on science but the telling of the story is so rich and embedded with historical and social commentary that makes it a gripping read and drives the pace along, despite being about something as lofty and uncommon in the average person's lives as astronomy. Carl Sagan makes astronomy and the sciences wholly approachable, while also contagiously spreading the nearly holy reverence he has for the cosmos, and rightly so. It reads like poetic literature, religious text, scientific briefing, philosophical tome, and a history of all existence. I was seriously blown away. It is hard to read this book and look at anything around us without a sense of connectedness and awe that we happen to exist as this bizarre collection of basic elements, each made distinct by electric and nuclear forces and an unfathomably long period of time, and are able to gather here and be able to read this book."

I've always enjoyed learning about space and the universe, but never really had the mathematical chops to make it into a real hobby. This book changed all that, and within an explanation of the history of astronomy, made it into a much more accessible area of study. I'm certainly not going to become an astronomer, but this book was eye-opening simply for how such complex concepts were re-written so as to be more easily understood. Science and scientists cannot remain in an ivory tower, and this book represents a concerted effort to remove that and make astronomy open to many. But what mostly struck me was the way that Dr. Sagan contextualized humans and their conflicts within the universe. He draws a picture of humans as simply an evolution of the cosmos, that we as a species are something both far lesser and far greater than how we view ourselves."
384,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5012269-siby,4,"This has been one of the most acclaimed books of the recent past and with good reason. I was pleasantly surprised at how relevant this book still is after decades of publication. Carl Sagan has done an excellent job of explaining the wonders of the cosmos in a language simple enough for a lay person to understand and appreciate. I have a fairly decent understanding and interest in the sciences and understood that the universe is immense and amazing. In spite of this, I was amazed at the magnitude of the universe in terms of distances and time which Sagan was able to convey in terms that one could easily relate to. This book gave me a new found appreciation for our planet, our lives and the very little time we have. Highly recommended. PS: I was lucky to get one of the editions with color illustrations and photographs, which really helps visualize the wonders that you are reading about."

I would have become an astronomer, no doubt about it. But I still feel very lucky to have read it. So maybe I will still.This is the book that should be taught in every school in every corner of the world, so we all have a chance to broaden our horizons no matter which primitive political system we are trapped in. If this book has tiny flaws or if the romanticism is found overpowering at times - it matters not, as the ideas gathered are enourmous and beautiful and incredibly inspiring. There is a reason Carl Sagan and Cosmos moved so many.I've so far gifted the book to three people, one of whom has already read it. I will keep doing the same with as many people as I can. I want them to get to know themselves, the matter and the void and be awed and inspired by the gigantic and the subatomic like I did."

Think of the negative connotations of words like alien or outlandish. And yet the monuments and cultures of each of our civilizations merely represent different ways of being human. An extraterrestrial visitor, looking at the differences among human beings and their societies, would find those differences trivial compared to the similarities.

Travel is broadening. There are worlds on which life has never arisen. There are worlds that have been charred and ruined by cosmic catastrophes. We are fortunate: we are alive, we are powerful ; the welfare of our civilization and our species is in our hands. If we do not speak for Earth, who will?

Of those, how many can say that the documentary shaped them in not one, but three ways? Dr. Carl Sagan's award winning series introduced me to science, history and the history of science, and the music of Vangelis. I was only four or five when I first watched this show on PBS and it enthralled me.Today I'm a historian and one of my specialties is the history of science. I'm a new age musician and my musical compositions are heavily influenced by the work of Vangelis. And I'm an amateur astronomer with a passion for exo-solar planets, a subject Dr. Sagan speaks about frequently during the series.It remains a classic of scientific writing and a icon of documentary excellence."
389,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2489331-abrahamus,3,"I remember watching this television series on PBS when it aired originally back in 1980. So here's the deal. Sagan was a die-hard atheist and I am a sold-out Christian. I disagree with him vehemently on just about every page—sometimes (depending on the chapter) maybe even every sentence. But his style is so engaging, and the material he brings together (especially the history) is just so dang captivatingly interesting, I can't help myself. (I first learned what a googol and a googolplex were from him, for crying out loud. That, at least, is worth a little love.) If you have the right grid to filter all the information through (i.e. a good grounding in Christian apologetics and worldview discourse) there's actually a good deal here to appreciate."
390,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8277135-erik,3,"I am in my early 40s, and am a chemical engineer with an amateur interesting in astronomy and physics. Coming from this background, there were a few parts in here in which Sagan talks about things that were new to me, but overall he was talking about fairly basic stuff. I think the audience intended is for either younger readers or readers who haven't already done much or any reading about astronomy. Sagan's passion for astronomy and his interest in the search for extraterrestrial life comes through in an exciting way. Early on in the book Sagan makes a few derogatory comments about religion that I just ignored because I realize that they is obligatory in any popular science book, but they just keep coming. In fact, he seems to get rather preachy about about how backward, oppressed and uninformed believers in God are. This aspect of the book was, in fact, one of the things that kept me going . . . I wanted to see just how outspoken he would get. I won't take the time to give quotes and refute specific arguments from a decades-old book, but I will say that Sagan seemed to have fallen trap to what I believe to be the logical fallacy of assuming that all of religion is incorrect because certain aspects of it don't correspond with our observations . . . one example is the apparent contradiction between what the book of Genesis seems to be saying about the age of the earth and what can be seen in the geological and fossil record. Using reasons like this to conclude that there is no God and Jesus Christ is not good science.I cannot deny that many horrible things have been done over the centuries in the name of religion, but I have read enough history to believe that religion, per se, is not the cause. The cause is that most people have a tendency to be selfish and hate those that are different. Abolishing religion will not root this tendency out of people; there will simply be terrible atrocities perpetrated in the name of something else.I gave the book three stars because it was written well enough to really get me to think about some things. But it is too mixed with anti-religious propaganda to be really considered a science book, as I believe it is marketed. "
391,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8171905-william-girdler,5,"I don't know how to exactly review this.It's a love story. It's like listening to a love letter written to a dear friend about the writer's love of his life. The writer being Carl Sagan and the love of his life being The cosmos. (and also his wife, who gets one of my favorite dedications ever). As hackneyed as that sounds I really can't describe this book better in another way. The most compelling thing about this book is Sagan's love of space, earth, what makes us who and what we are and what we can be. It is one of the most enjoyable experiences one can have learning something. I love space. I love learning about it. And all the elements that make it up. I think mainly this is because astronomers seem to have an infectious love of their subject. Sagan gave such a love to Neil Degrasse Tyson (who opens the audio book I listened to) and Tyson has shared that with my generation including myself. Which is what lead me to go back to the source. I've seen Sagan's cosmos show in its entirety and this is part covering the same ground and a companion of said show. The book makes you feel infinitely small, yet infinitely important. The subject is taught in such a way that it's easily approachable and immensely interesting. I think I will definitely read more by Sagan. I love his poetic tone and his ability to express and impart ideas. I usually read via audiobooks and normally I don't review them as such on here, but I want to shout out this aspect for this particular book. Sagan's wife Ann Druyan wrote and narrated one introduction. Tyson another. And Seth McFarlane (who's work I mostly dislike but who I deeply respect for ensuring Tyson's updated Cosmos tv show exists) reads Sagan's original intro. The body of the book is read by one of my childhood heroes who helped instill my love of reading, LeVar Burton. This audio book is a work of art. So relaxing and all encompassing. As a finished listening I was already excited to listen to it again. I may start falling asleep to it or something. It's such a great production."
392,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13186882-birsilah-bakar,4,"This is one of the most amazing, eye-opening book I've ever read, besides The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The prose is simple yet enlightening. It's incredible how something so complicated could be so simple in his words.I picked this book us because I read The Sun Is Also a Star and it contained a little bit of Sagan gem in the beginning and I knew that I had to look it up. I swear it's not because I liked apple pie. Last Sunday I was having the most rotten day and my problems are piling higher and higher and as far as a bookworm goes, a bookstore is the cure. Saw Cosmos on sale so I began to read it almost immediately. Funny thing about something intangible and as far as infinite goes, all of my problems disappeared. I solved one problem on the same day. Today I solve another one. I will solve another problem later. I'm half human, half universe. I got this."
393,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4922982-nathan,5,"Carl Sagan's ""Cosmos"" is a something that isn't supposed to be left by the wayside. On the surface, Cosmos is about science. From the very small cells, to the universe itself, the book covers a bit of everything through the lens of the discoverer. Beyond the surface, Cosmos offers much much more. It offers an insight a Carl Sagan himself. Sagan clearly had a vision of the universe around him and was able to think vastly differently then many others. He could envision worlds which would seem impossible, but through science and observation, could very well exist. Sagan wasn't an American, he was an Earthling. Sagan understood that the borders we drew around ourselves were arbitrary compared to the reality. In the last chapter Sagan's understanding of the world clearly comes into view. While the outlook of humanity seems very doomed, he still holds optimism. Upon watching the television series with the same title, I though that perhaps Sagan was a bit preachy in his antiwar speech, but after reading this book, I can see where he comes from. It the fact that the story shaped by the cosmos, viewed through we humans, could be destroyed in only a few seconds because we haven't decided to evolve into something better. If you want to read this for the science, you may find yourself a bit disappointed and scared (because sometimes his ideas and theories are a bit cryptic, e.g. global warming). But, if you want to view the world through a new lens, to wrap your mind around something new and garner a new hue for the world, I would highly suggest this for your reading. In all honesty, my words are meaningless when trying to explain the great contribution the Sagan has attempted to inject into society (and sadly ignored for more ""pop culture"" garbage). Carl Sagan was a great man in life and can certainly find immortality in his words."
394,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9402537-preston-kutney,4,"This book is so packed with information, I really had to pace myself in order to digest it all. Some of the science is outdated, but the history of our understanding of the cosmos and space exploration section, as well as Sagan's musings on what the future holds for us Homo sapiens here on earth and our place in the universe are well worth it. The book also needs some subheadings or something, the length of the chapters was a little exhausting and Sagan's writing meandered at times. Sagan has such an incredible understanding of how our planet fits into the universe - he is able to divorce himself of all earthly bias and the limitations of human intuition to grasp the vast timescales and contradictions of astrophysics and come to clear conclusions. He writes from an almost extra-terrestrial viewpoint, writing objectively about mankind's follies and failings in a way that reminds me a little of the condescending tone BBC reporters use to talk about the United States' irrational gun laws or healthcare system. And the way he breaks down the probability of discovering intelligent life elsewhere in the universe is so systematic, thorough, and logically consistent, it gave me the chills! I also loved his perspective on intra-planetary relations, ie how humans in different regions should treat one another given our understanding of our cosmic uniqueness and the common goals of mankind. I felt some real shame as a human when Sagan explained how for the price of a couple nuclear submarines we could double the national space exploration budget. Instead of taking turns blowing things up we could channel human ingenuity and resources towards the more ennobling goals of expanding the cosmic footprint of mankind. Much simpler said than done, but Sagan states the obvious so eloquently that you want to shout it from the rooftops. "
395,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8234048-poorni,5,"OK, it took me time to read this one but not because it was boring but because it was simply brilliant. It is usually hard to read books written by scientists. I've always found them to be heavy on the science and very little thought is spared for the reader who might not be familiar with those concepts. Sagan stands out in this regard. The book is beautifully written. Sagan's prose is poetic. The book reads like an ode to the universe. Or like a passionate love letter. When you read the book, it becomes very evident to you that you are conversing with a mind that is so in love with the universe and everything in it; who is striving to understand even a grain's worth of it before his time is up. Sagan was a self- professed agnostic and I think that comes out very clearly in this book. He explains the science well but then when he expands his though process, you can feel his writing borders on a sense of awe an reverence for the universe. Sagan's writing is powerful. Many times, I had to catch my breath and read a line again; the impact was huge. With the most simple of words, Sagan weaves magic. He makes us realise how inconsequential we are in the grand scheme of things while at the same time telling us that we are all extraordinary, because we are all made of stars. Sagan has tried to resolve scientific concepts and human kind's awe for the universe in this book. He touches on everything from evolution, superstition, Kepler, relativity, planets, ancient scientists, nuclear war and the cosmos. He also handles concepts like religion, books, belief, intolerance and what not. Recommended reading for everyone. I read the e-version of the book, but I'm getting my hands on a hardbound version and its going on my bookshelf, and into the hands of my son as soon as he's old enough to understand at least parts of this. Absolutely breathtaking!! "
396,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24723429-aju-krishnan,4,"The Cosmos is everything that was, that is and that will ever be. Carl Sagan takes us through this exquisite journey starting with the origins and evolution of life on earth, then about our endeavors to explore the inner solar system comprising of the venus and mars. He points out that just like the americas and india were unexplored centuries ago, when the only known land was europe, such is our current situation on the shores of the cosmic ocean- with lot of worlds to be explored yet. He opines that the next striking thing to dawn upon us will be the news of contact with an extra-terrestrial civilization and that he is eagerly awaiting for it. He also explains how he is humbled by the immensity of space and how worthless is our fight for little more space in this pitiable corner of the cosmos. He explains how man since the ancient times, was keen to know what those shiny little things were up above in the night sky, and also how knowing their cycles meant the difference between life and death for him. He praises the greek for their practical wisdom and contributions to astronomy. He also approves the indian mythological concept of cycles of creation and destruction. He also presents an alarming fact that once a civilization reaches a certain amount of scientific progress, it tends to destroy ourselves, and that it is an inevitability in our near future. In last few chapters he talks about travel to nearby stars. It was an exciting read. Those who are passionate about astronomy, our origins and man's explorations into space will really love it. Now that I have completed it, I am eagerly waiting for Christopher Nolan's Interstellar to get released!"
397,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31684497-anoushka-gandhi,5,"It was truly an honour to read this book. I am so lucky to have been born after Carl Sagan, and to be born in a time when books can be published - more specifically, Carl Sagan's books. This book isn't just a favourite - it's a book I love.I don't really read non-fiction, so for people out there who don't either, this review is for you.Cosmos is a wonderful book that explores the origins of the universe and the origins of humanity at the same time. Carl Sagan is a wonderful writer who offers the reader a comprehensive understanding of the foundations of our universe, and the beginning of scientific thought. He reflects on the past of human beings, introduces us to theories about astronomy, and gives us hope for the future. Carl Sagan's words ignite the ""starstuff"" within you - truly.This book is a great read if you love learning. And if you don't, this book will make you love learning, and love reading, because Carl Sagan is a wonderful writer. He truly understands and appreciates the power of language, and it is evident in his writing. In some ways, he bares his thoughts to the reader - which is why you fall in love with distant galaxies and astronomy - because you can't help but see the universe through his eyes.And if you're not really interested in space, then that's okay. Because this book is also about the origins of humanity. Not just rational thought or science, but a lot of the milestones that made us who we are today. This book is both a museum of the universe and of the Earth - and I recommend it to lovers of reading, knowledge, science, history, or just anybody with a vested interest in humanity and its future."
398,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1779598-pete-dapixie,5,"I have hired this book from the local Astronomy Society library shelves, but also bought the full DVD series of what must be some of the finest t.v. ever made. So 30 years on I'm firstly watching one of the hour long programmes and then reading the relevant chapter in the book. I already know this is 5 star.Published in 1980 and based on Sagan's epic 13 part t.v. series, Cosmos is a remarkable journey. A trip for the mind and a meditation for the soul. Our travels into the Cosmos takes us through human history, from the Egyptian, Chinese and Greek early sciences into the European Enlightenment (or re-discovery). On to the 4 billion year formation of Hydrogen molecules into complex DNA, then off into space for a tour of the solar system. Sagan includes stops off the spaceship to hit the reader with Biology, or Ecology, or domesday scenarios of nuclear destruction. Then we're off to the stars again. The t.v. series is so good I'm only up to part 7, and each part I've watched twice. Carl Sagan is sadly missed. What this publication would have been with the images of Hubble! The book makes do with many fine paintings of solar and deep space subjects, but you feel Carl would have loved Hubble.Finally in the authors own words: The surface of the Earth is the shore of the cosmic ocean. From it we have learned most of what we know. Recently, we have waded a little out to sea, enough to dampen our toes or, at most, wet our ankles. The water seems inviting. The ocean calls. Some part of our being knows this is from where we came. We long to return."
399,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3495040-caroline,5,"This took a long time to get through, partly because it was so tempting to read it with Sagan's measured, stately narration as in the outstanding TV series. I also dragged my heels in the sections that most showed their age, such as the lengthy descriptions of the then-nascent Mars missions, the unknown cause of the extinction of the dinosaurs, and the calculation of sum totals of a species' information in terms of bits of data (he kindly defines for us what a bit is).I found myself wishing he hadn't passed away 15 years ago, as his voice is at once so rational and knowledgeable and so emotionally compelling that perhaps he is our species' best hope for sanity and peaceful cooperation--our best hope for a continuing future. Then again, precisely *because* he is able to channel his vision and understanding of the big picture to anyone who will stop to consider our place in the cosmos, his arguments will long outlive the both of us. This is ultimately the most powerful anti-war document I can imagine, written in the long shadow of nuclear proliferation. Even as he is clearly desperate for humanity to wake up to its possibilities, he delivers his message through such an unending awe for life on Earth that he is at once revered scientist and star-struck child--and he invites us to join him in both roles.I still prefer the raw power of the PBS series over the book (yes, even as the graphics have long since crossed over into the realm of cheese), but any devotee of the TV show would appreciate the chance to peruse the book at leisure. "
400,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47054186-seth-hanson,4," Cosmos is a nonfiction book written by the award winning astronomer Carl Sagen, and it is considered to be a classic of astronomy. It covers many topics related to astronomy, from the beginning of the universe to the possibilities of life on other planets to the future of the human race in space, all of them are covered in detail and in easy to understand language.  The book, which was originally written in conjunction with the Cosmos TV series, is a very interesting journey into the world of astronomy, with brief descriptions of much of the contents so as to fit more into the book, essentially filling all the basics of astronomy and all studies related to it into one book. The book also makes an interesting use of a combination of religious ideas and metaphors into the normally squarely scientific area of astronomy. While I personally feel that this is not a good scientific principal, I can certainly see how it would lead to not only a better understanding but also an increased interest and acceptance of some of the ideas elsewhere in the book, along with the ones being discussed. I liked this book, especially how it condensed many different areas of astronomy and science in general into the one book, but still making it all fit and feel like one book. I did, however, feel that the book did not have a very clear layout of the chapters, and therefor felt slightly disorganized. I would recommend this book to anyone at all interested in almost any branch of science, especially astronomy."
401,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2327135-linda,4,"In the life of a human being 30 years might seem as a lot of time, but compared to 30 years for modern science, it seems less than minuscule. A lot has happened since Cosmos was written and some of the theories expressed there are dated, some seemingly unanswerable questions have been answered and there are plenty of new pages of history to discover.That being said, I never approached reading Cosmos as a science book and I believe that nobody should. While it still contains some deal of dry science data (how many bits it was again, Mr. Sagan?), most of which is valid today as well, it is primary as popular-scientific book that succeeds more at being an intricate mixture of hard sciences - physics, chemistry, astronomy, biology - and different sub-types of philosophy, most notably metaphysics and cosmology with a great deal of history of science sprinkled on top for added value.As in most pop-sci books, the language is more than pleasant and allows the book to be read with ease, any science bits are described as simplified as possible and just like the TV-Series, Cosmos probably is the most quotable book I've encountered up to date.If I did not mind encroaching on people too much and I lived in a country where English was more widely spoken and I was more fanatical about science, I might go around preaching from it. Come to think of it, I might anyhow just for the laughs of it."
402,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8126830-jason,5,"My mother gave this book to me when I was in the 1st grade and it was one of the biggest eye openers of my childhood. Even though at the time I didn't understand most of the scientific jargon, my fascination with outer space and the planets drew me in and I was hooked. By the 3rd grade I was giving oral reports on black holes and the fabric of space-time and boring the hell out of my friends with my nonstop space rants. I've re-read it at least 6 different times since then as well as numerous other books by Steven Hawking and Kirshner and I can honestly say this is the greatest book about outer space/civilization/technology that I have ever read. The speculative fiction/non-fiction elements blend together perfectly and there is a never ending source of independence to what you can get out of this book. This book is a look at the big picture, the universe. Written by debatably the smartest astrophysicist of all time, Carl Sagan understood the universe possibly more than any human being who has ever lived. This book is the ""Space Bible"". Don't watch the series until you have read the book, and make sure it's the coffee table edition. The tiny paperback edition doesn't do justice to the amazing paintings. Every home in the world should have a copy. "

I decided it would get bumped up to ""on-deck"" when I saw a stranger holding it and overheard her commenting to a friend: ""I read Cosmos at least 1 time a year.""Having read Cosmos, I won't read it once a year, but I will make an effort to re-read the book while I'm still a young adult and hopefully read it again at a later date beyond that. The material in this book is awe inspiring and Carl Sagan has a real gift for eloquence and for communicating complex ideas effectively. Admittedly, some of the info is just a bit too hard to grasp (the size of the Universe), and other info is simply recondite mainly b/c it's outside the realm of our experience (relativity)... but the book is still definately worth a go. This seems silly to mention but I was impressed with Sagan's knowledge of certain aspects of ancient times and his quoting of very old text. Overall as a reader you feel in very good hands; those of an intellectual virtuoso. I highly recommend the book to others. "
406,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23015731-casey,5,"In a single sentence, this is a balm in book form for an existential crisis. I was feeling lost and confused in this painful universe and searching for something on the order of magnitude of religion to believe in, but religion has always seemed inadequate. If you've ever felt yourself moved or compelled by science, this is it.My first introduction to Carl Sagan's Cosmos was by my 8th grade science teacher, who wrote the chemical equations for photosynthesis and cellular respiration on the blackboard, one above the other, and asked us to stare at it until we had realized the beauty of this wonderous cycle that nature had set up. He then read the passage to us (the one about the mouth-to-stoma resuscitation), and that was my first glimpse of Sagan's ability to convey profound observations about the beauty of the universe in such simple and elegant terms.I grabbed this off a used bookstore shelf in search of something to believe in, and devoured it in one night. Felt a little better about my existence, and that of our world, afterwards. Absolutely incredible. "

It has so many unforgettable quotes which makes you ponder simultaneously on how precious human race is and also how trivial it is in the big picture. I think this is a must read not only for every science enthusiast but also for every person to appreciate the very fact we are ""alive"" and ""conscious"" in this universe and in his words how we are ""star stuff pondering stars"". His pitch for disarmament of nuclear weapons and increased investment in the cosmic exploration in the last chapter is nothing short of a historic speech if it has really been delivered on some big platform. I think every Nation head needs to read the last chapter especially in today's world to understand how important it is for us to make right decisions in this age. Read the book to appreciate the Universe and Nature and the fact that you are the result of innumerable, highly unlikely things occurring at the right place and the right time."
408,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14867749-saurabh-jhalani,5,"This was truly a mind-expanding and thought-provoking book. Made me ponder over a lot of things. Carl Sagan takes you on a journey to the end of universe, he makes you think about the origin of our species, about the origin of our planet and what might our species do in the future. This book has made me look at things from a different perspective. This book has made me realise that our planet is not such a bad place after all. We are so lucky to be part of this rare planet and we must do everything to savour it. The world, the people , everything that you see around yourself is made from the elements that created the universe- the cosmos. To quote from the book : The cosmos may be densely populated with intelligent beings. But the Darwinian lesson is clear: There will be no humans elsewhere. Only here. Only on this small planet. We are a rare as well as an endangered species. Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another. "
409,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4205939-sunny,3,"I found Cosmos to be an excellent, accessible introduction to a wide range of scientific discoveries from the past few centuries. I also appreciated how, despite the book's Western bent, Sagan incorporated pre-scientific ideas from several non-European cultures, to show how scientific discoveries are made in parallel.That said, I saw this book as more history than science — a history of science, yes, but still history. The benefit to this is that, although the book was published nearly 40 years ago, much of it still remains relevant; the downside to this is that it is not very in-depth, and the title felt misleading. Another downside, in my opinion, is that its philosophical musings were a bit tedious, but that's my personal taste.I would highly recommend this book for any non-STEM major friends that want to jump into scientific nonfiction but don't know where to start; otherwise, I would recommend Welcome to the Universe by Neil deGrasse Tyson for those looking for a more in-depth intro to astrophysics."
410,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37689288-che,5,"I picked up this book at the University of Chicago bookstore, and it is undoubtedly the best $20 that I have ever spent. Carl Sagan is not only a scientist, but a true humanitarian. His brilliant writing and compassionate narrative instilled in me a sense of awe and respect for science, the cosmos, and life. Every one of us is made of the elements from the stars, which are everywhere in the cosmos, but each human being is also the only instance of themself in the entire universe. Billions of billions of billions of atoms formed the cosmos, and the cosmos made the earth, and the earth made life, and humans. On a cosmic scale, warfare and animosity towards other members of our own species seem so trivial, yet they threaten the destruction of life that came from millions of years of painstaking evolution. In the cosmos, If we do not speak for earth, then no one will. And all of us together speak for earth. Seeing things from a cosmic perspective is humbling. I encourage you to go on a cosmic voyage with Carl Sagan, and set sail for the stars. "
411,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2327599-trevor-denton,5,"This is not just a sit-down-and-read-straight-through kind of book. It's more of a coffee table book, but that label tends to belittle its contents. This is a hugely eye-opening, all-encompassing coverage of the collective universe as experienced by the human race so far.The book's general theme, as with the TV series upon which it is based, is the uniqueness of human life in the midst of so much astrophysical indifference and chaos. The bulk of the text provides scientific facts about space, species, evolution, energy, motion, matter, and accompanying insight about the ramifications of said facts. But there seems to be an overarching message of existentialism - humanity holding its own fate in its hands. It encourages scientific inquiry and promotes a message of developing technology further for the purpose of educating ourselves further as living residents of a vast, mysterious universe, and how we might continue to survive as a species in such a volatile environment."
412,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7432477-jenny,5,"This should be required reading in schools. Its subject matter is focused on science but the telling of the story is so rich and embedded with historical and social commentary that makes it a gripping read and drives the pace along, despite being about something as lofty and uncommon in the average person's lives as astronomy. Carl Sagan makes astronomy and the sciences wholly approachable, while also contagiously spreading the nearly holy reverence he has for the cosmos, and rightly so. It reads like poetic literature, religious text, scientific briefing, philosophical tome, and a history of all existence. I was seriously blown away. It is hard to read this book and look at anything around us without a sense of connectedness and awe that we happen to exist as this bizarre collection of basic elements, each made distinct by electric and nuclear forces and an unfathomably long period of time, and are able to gather here and be able to read this book."
413,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42541903-alice,5,"So I finished this last night/super early this morning (1 am) and am still slightly in awe. I've always enjoyed learning about space and the universe, but never really had the mathematical chops to make it into a real hobby. This book changed all that, and within an explanation of the history of astronomy, made it into a much more accessible area of study. I'm certainly not going to become an astronomer, but this book was eye-opening simply for how such complex concepts were re-written so as to be more easily understood. Science and scientists cannot remain in an ivory tower, and this book represents a concerted effort to remove that and make astronomy open to many. But what mostly struck me was the way that Dr. Sagan contextualized humans and their conflicts within the universe. He draws a picture of humans as simply an evolution of the cosmos, that we as a species are something both far lesser and far greater than how we view ourselves."

I was pleasantly surprised at how relevant this book still is after decades of publication. Carl Sagan has done an excellent job of explaining the wonders of the cosmos in a language simple enough for a lay person to understand and appreciate. I have a fairly decent understanding and interest in the sciences and understood that the universe is immense and amazing. In spite of this, I was amazed at the magnitude of the universe in terms of distances and time which Sagan was able to convey in terms that one could easily relate to. This book gave me a new found appreciation for our planet, our lives and the very little time we have. Highly recommended. PS: I was lucky to get one of the editions with color illustrations and photographs, which really helps visualize the wonders that you are reading about."

So maybe I will still.This is the book that should be taught in every school in every corner of the world, so we all have a chance to broaden our horizons no matter which primitive political system we are trapped in. If this book has tiny flaws or if the romanticism is found overpowering at times - it matters not, as the ideas gathered are enourmous and beautiful and incredibly inspiring. There is a reason Carl Sagan and Cosmos moved so many.I've so far gifted the book to three people, one of whom has already read it. I will keep doing the same with as many people as I can.

Think of the negative connotations of words like alien or outlandish. And yet the monuments and cultures of each of our civilizations merely represent different ways of being human. An extraterrestrial visitor, looking at the differences among human beings and their societies, would find those differences trivial compared to the similarities.

Travel is broadening. There are worlds on which life has never arisen. There are worlds that have been charred and ruined by cosmic catastrophes. We are fortunate: we are alive, we are powerful ; the welfare of our civilization and our species is in our hands. If we do not speak for Earth, who will?

I was only four or five when I first watched this show on PBS and it enthralled me.Today I'm a historian and one of my specialties is the history of science. I'm a new age musician and my musical compositions are heavily influenced by the work of Vangelis.

Sagan was a die-hard atheist and I am a sold-out Christian. I disagree with him vehemently on just about every page—sometimes (depending on the chapter) maybe even every sentence. But his style is so engaging, and the material he brings together (especially the history) is just so dang captivatingly interesting, I can't help myself. (I first learned what a googol and a googolplex were from him, for crying out loud. That, at least, is worth a little love.) If you have the right grid to filter all the information through (i.e. a good grounding in Christian apologetics and worldview discourse) there's actually a good deal here to appreciate."

Sagan's way of showing us mankind's evolution interconnection with the progress of the universe is tantalizing. The prospects of the future and the similarity of the now starting journey to the stars with the discovery of other worlds/civilizations inside the Earth are amazing. Genius, I say! I strongly recommend anyone with a bit of curiosity to read the book - although it is mainly science-driven, Sagan is a very good teacher and explains everything in the simplest form possible.

Books like these help you to understand why you are so amazed by the universe.

Another point is the lack of the Oriental or eastern culture (apart from the egyptiens ) which adds another dimension to that science and spirituality crossroad.

Wow just wow!! My mind is blown! Now, what is the sequel to this? This was written in the nineties, and amazing discoveries has been done since in astronomy, biology and quantum chemistry. Is there any book like this, for the non-scientific normal people that explains our current scientific state? I am saddened that carl sagan didn’t live long to tell more about the cosmos story.

I wish i can write down all the things i enjoyed but i have flawed memory and i have listened to the audio version of the books so there is no highlighting, ( btw, LeVar Burton does splendid job narrating the book, i still hear his “BUT...” in my head!! Magnificent voice and energy ), here is a list of what I could gather: “Exploration is in our nature. We began as wanderers, and we are wanderers still. We have lingered long enough on the shores of the cosmic ocean. We are ready at last to set sail for the stars.”“Imagination will often carry us into worlds that never were. But without it we go nowhere.”“If you wish to make an apple pie out of scratch, you must first invent the universe.”“Before we devised artificial lights and atmospheric pollution and modern forms of nocturnal entertainment, we watched the stars. There were practical calendrical reasons, of course, but there was more to it than that. Even today, the most jaded city dweller can be unexpectedly moved upon encountering a clear night sky studded with thousands of twinkling stars.”“Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.”“We can judge our progress by the courage of our questions and the depth of our answers, our willingness to embrace what is true rather than what feels good.”“Look again at that dot. That’s here. That’s home. That’s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every “superstar,” every “supreme leader,” every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there—on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.”“It pays to keep an open mind, but not so open your brains fall out.”“The brain is like a muscle. When it is in use we feel very good. Understanding is joyous.”“Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.”“Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.”“There are naive questions, tedious questions, ill-phrased questions, questions put after inadequate self-criticism. But every question is a cry to understand the world. There is no such thing as a dumb question.”"
444,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112803724-urayo-n-verges-rodr-guez,5,"Most non-fiction science books related to the physical sciences suffer mostly from an overzealous attempt at exposing the ""new science"", the most recent findings and theories. This is a double-edged sword. They can be good reads, and even contextually interesting -being able to see what we ""believed"" to be true science years ago. But there's a drawback in this approach. The books might be marvelously written, but they're usually doomed to become outdated or even obsolete as the years pass. Newer findings contradicting and questioning the old theories espoused in these works of literature. But Sagan avoids this doomed fate while even stating some outdated scientific arguments that require obvious updating. This book remains a fascinating work, regardless of this small shortcoming, because it takes a different approach. This book is about humanity, our origin, our collective quest for science, and what our place is among the Cosmos. In this approach, Sagan crafted a timeless piece of non-fiction science literature which stands the test of time. Curiosity feeds the hearth of humankind's capacity for doing research and accumulating knowledge. Humbling, exalting, humanistic, and naturalistic; transcending nationalities, ethnicities, and even species in some ways. Sagan attempts to ground humanity in an evolutionary cosmic view, trying to show us how minuscule we are while simultaneously showing how interrelated we are to everything else -in the planet and in the universe-, and how ingenious and incredible we can be. We're simple starstuff capable of understanding how small we are in this universe, and that's amazing. For Sagan, we should be humbled by the knowledge that billions of years of physical, chemical and biological processes have resulted in us, a bipedal race of apes capable of looking beyond our planet to our true origins in the Cosmos: the complex processes that gave rise to our Universe, our galaxy, our solar system, our planet, and us.Even so, Sagan attempts to not idealize our history too much, recognizing our flaws time and again throughout the pages. Our political, economic, and ideological shortcomings that have resulted in countless cases of human atrocities. He urges us to learn from these to break the wheel of repetition that limits humanity from ushering in a better era, not allowing us to improve ourselves as a species. Sagan is quick to judge the atrocities of our ancestors (slavery, imperialism, fascism, Stalinism, racism, sexism, etc.), even going so far as to argue for a complete reformulation of our society. He favors a careful reevaluation of our society, and the dissolution of our current status quo (the preservation of which, he warns us, will only assure our inevitable self-destruction as a species). But Sagan also deeply valued our capacity for creating knowledge, and the beautiful, unifying similarities that can be observed throughout our history as a species, across different eras and civilizations. Similarities that can be observed in their respective quests for natural truth, achieving independent discoveries and arriving at similar conclusions, all of this achieved by people separated across centuries in time, across different cultures and ethnicities, and across continents separated from each other by miles of water. Humanity can do great things and terrifying things, and it's what we choose to do that will dictate the future of our species."
445,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,5,"If you've known me for more than a little while, you know that one of my great loves in this world is science. Even though I tend to get stymied by the math, and I probably couldn't call up all the right data from my head at the right time, it is the idea of science and the stories of science that truly interest me. Just the fact that we live in a universe where it is possible to know how things work, where we can devise a way to look at the whole of creation, from things so large that they defy imagination to things so small that they can barely be said to exist at all. Science is imagination put into practice against the universe, and as much fun as stories and myths are, as hope and prayers may be, science is the best, most reliable way for us to come to grips with the Cosmos.It is to Carl Sagan that I owe this love of what humans have done with ourselves.When I was a kid, my father had a copy of Cosmos, and, since I was but a child, I never really read it. I tended more to flip through it for the interesting pictures - the speculative Jovian life forms on pages 42 and 43, the Viking photos of Mars in chapter 5, the gorgeous paintings of the views from other worlds around other stars, the photos of nebulae and galaxies, all of these things fascinated me, and if I had been a bit more patient I would have found out about them. But I was a kid, so that can be excused. What the book did for me was to open my mind to a universe of possibilities that were all within our reach, or at least would be someday.As I got older, I saw the TV miniseries of the same name on PBS. Now the pictures that I had lingered over in the book were right before me, accompanied by Sagan's soothing baritone. His ship of the imagination somehow managed to take us unfathomable distances from our home and bring us back again. He talked to his viewers like we were intelligent adults, fully capable of understanding and appreciating the vast scope of scientific discovery rather than a bunch of attention-deficit teenagers who couldn't be trusted to keep watching without a jump-cut every ten seconds. Carl Sagan believed, despite the occasional evidence to the contrary, that human beings were capable of overcoming our barbaric pasts and forging a bright new future together in the stars.The purpose of Cosmos, both the book and the TV show, was to educate. It was, as Sagan put it, ""to engage the heart as well as the mind,"" perhaps to help shed the image of science as a cold and passionless pursuit. He wanted to show how science became what is is, from the ancient scientist/philosophers in Ionia and Alexandria all the way up to the engineers and astronauts working at NASA. It's all part of a long chain of knowledge that ties human history together and which engages one of our deepest desires: to know how the universe works.Each chapter focuses on a different theme of knowledge - from the way the planets form and what they're like to the nature of the furthest reaches of space. He starts with how Eratosthenes measured the world with just a shadow and some math, and how the ancient thinkers of Alexandria were asking the same questions about the nature of the Earth that we ask today. He follows the tortured path of Johannes Kepler in his quest to understand how the planets move, the arrogant brilliance of Newton as he completely redefined the clockwork of the cosmos, and the casual miracle that Einstein pulled off when he told us that not only are we not the center of the universe but that there is no center. Each great mind led to another.Unfortunately, each setback cost us what may be valuable time. For all his wonderment, he understood how petty and ignorant human beings could be. From the beginning, and at various points in the book, he reminds us of the millennium we lost with the destruction and corruption of the ancient thinkers of the Mediterranean. As far as we can tell, the men and women who made their home in Alexandria were investigating questions and scientific problems that would have changed the way we understand the world. If the library hadn't been burned down, if religious terror hadn't murdered scientific insight, who knows where we would be today? It's impossible to know, but it's tempting to think that we might have been well on our way to the stars by now.The latter chapters underscore that theme pretty heavily, reminding us over and over again that we have one world, and only one world. Not only does Sagan fear that we could obliterate ourselves with the nuclear weapons we love and fear so much, but he also fears that self-annihilation may be a natural outcome to any intelligent civilization. Our search for intelligent life on other worlds may be fruitless, because they might be just as self-destructive as we are.But we don't know. We can't know, at least not yet. Our understanding of the universe is still not clear enough, our technology is still not good enough, and perhaps it never will be. But for all our stumbles and failures, Sagan wants us to remember and understand just how much humanity is capable of, and how good we could be if we really put our minds to it. And in that sense, there is a lot of value to reading it now, thirty years after it was published.While we have not eliminated nuclear weapons, we have made great strides towards controlling them and reducing their numbers. The hopes that Sagan had for future space exploration - Mars rovers, a probe to Titan, contact with comets - have all been made real, and with outstanding results. We know that the dinosaurs were wiped out by a meteor impact - something that Sagan is clearly unsure of at the time of writing. We have mapped the human genome and developed personal computers that have revolutionized the way we explore space. With the internet, any person on earth can catalog galaxies or explore the moon, there have been advances in nanotechnology and materials and bioengineering and evolution that would have made even Sagan's eyes pop.Despite all our flaws, we continue to advance. We continue to build knowledge upon knowledge and to further our understanding of how the universe works. Maybe we will one day leave this planet ourselves, perhaps just for a visit or perhaps to start a new world. Maybe if we persist in our quest to comprehend the world we live in, to shut out the howling and screaming of the voices of unreason, we can make the world a better place for generations to come. In the great argument that is raging these days between the rationalists and the believers, the faithful and the atheists, it has become fashionable to try and shout the other side down. To adopt a position that excludes compromise and promises only defeat for one side or another. Sagan never would have wanted that, and I think he hit upon a solution that needs to be revisited.Rather than try to turn people to science through cold logic or heated words, through derision and coercion and fear, do as Sagan did: win them over with wonder. The cosmos is too big, and there is too much to know to waste our time with petty arguments and pointless feuds. If you want people to appreciate science, turn to people like Sagan, or Neil deGrasse Tyson, or Phil Plait, or Michio Kaku, or Bill Nye, or Adam Savage,[1] people whose enthusiasm and love of science will instill people with wonder, one person at a time. And it is in that way that we will go furthest towards ensuring humanity's place among the stars.----------------------------------------------------""Every one of us is precious in the cosmic perspective. If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.""- Carl Sagan, Cosmos[1] In the interest of fairness, I tried to come up with female scientists who were at the forefront of popularizing science with the public. I drew a blank. If you know some, please let me know so I can put them on the list...."
446,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80831211-patrick-kelly,5,"Cosmos Phenomenal book. This is like seeing a star athlete a year or two before his peak. You’re getting to see his greatness but you know he is about to explode soon. This is Sagan on the verge of his greatness. He is hitting on so many topics, provoking the human imagination, tantalizing the mind, and curating curiosity of the universe. I normally read books at 1.25 speed and read one book at a time but I wanted to savior Sagan. I read at normal speed and listened in between reading other books. This is a wonderful adventure. Sagan talks about the origins of the universe, I have rarely heard him talk about black holes but he briefly does in this book. Theoretical physics was never his field of study but I wonder if he and Hawking had any interactions. Even just being two of the most famous scientists in the world. He talks about the creation of planets, the depths of the cosmos, the fragility of human existence, nuclear proliferation, galaxies, extraterrestrial life, and more. On planets: The planets in our solar system are wild. Mars is interesting because its close to us but the other planets have much more to offer. His discussions about Mercury, Venus, and Jupiter, are amazing. These planets are playgrounds for scientific discovery. When he was talking about Mars, he talked about the origins of life. I have long argued that science handcuffs itself with the requirements for life but Sagan has changed my mind. He dives in to chemistry and biology, showing that carbon, hydrogen, and other key elements are the building blocks for life. We are not just looking at our life but the elements that are must abundant in the universe and that form life. It is conceivable that life could be formed through aluminum and sulfur but it is highly unlikely. I learned in this section.His discussion of Jupiter is wild. Worth rereading.Sun/Stars: he has a whole section about stars and their origins. How the are born and die. It is very chemistry heavy. Suffice to say, our sun is rather small and ordinary. Everything comes from the sun. He uses the term ‘higher power’ to describe the sun and that it is acceptable to consider the sun a higher power. Chemistry/biology: I felt that this book had the most technical information about chemistry and biology. These are subjects that I struggle with. Sagan was dense but as usual fascinating with his talk about these fields. I really learned how the study of the universe is a shared field, it is not limited to astronomers. Chemists and biologists play a huge role in our understanding of the universe. Gravity and light have their own rules but much of the universe is governed by the rules and laws of chemistry and biology. These are fields that are not given enough attention.Galaxies: This is where he gets into numbers, time, and size. This is where my head really started to spin. The sheer size of the universe and what it contains is hard to comprehend. ‘There are more stars in the universe than there are grains of sand on all the beaches on earth.’ What the fuck!? We are nothing.He talks about pulsars, star clusters, different kinds of galaxies, the rotation of galaxies, the size of galaxies, galaxies colliding, and more. I want to write more but even thinking about it all I can say is ‘dude, dude, dude, the fucking universe’.A point that caught me ‘the distance between galaxies is often two million light years.’The fact that our galaxy rotates. I am gonna stop writing and just say, ‘read Carl Sagan.’Extraterrestrial life: a popular topic and fascination of Sagan’s. I believe that Sagan was a man that wanted nothing more than to find some evidence of life outside of earth. Sadly he never found it. He breaks down the numbers of life, the Drake equation, the way we could communication (prime numbers and radio waves), the time it would take to send and receive messages (centuries), the time to search for an expand out in the galaxy to find life, the evolution of life and civilization, and more. This is a section near the end of the book and the section on nuclear war follows it. It is the brilliance and heart break of Sagan. He looks at the possibility for life, the possibility for science, understanding our fragility of human existence, he sees how powerful and beautiful humans are, he loves humans and loves science, always the optimist, but also a realist. He saw that we could be greater but recognized that we were causing our own extinction. That it is likely we will never become a space faring civilization because we would destroy ourselves first. It’s possible that this is the path of other civilizations or others avoided the obsession, ignorance, greed, and malice that we commit. Sagan was an optimist but in many ways he also thought that we were utterly doomed. My personal thoughts about extraterrestrial life: The universe is 13 billions years old and have trillions of stars in it. It is the height of arrogance to think that we are the only life and the height of ignorance to act as if we are not directly causing our own extinction.Nuclear war: Sagan advocated strongly for nuclear proliferation. Seeing nuclear weapons as an existential threat to humanity. His advocacy on this and other political, social, and environmental issues, is one of the reasons why I love him. The next book I will read is ‘A path where no man thought’. His book about nuclear weapons. I will write more about his thoughts when I finish that book. The last half hour is mind blowing. It puts into perspective everything that Sagan is saying. Our tiny place on a pale blue dot. We found food prints that are a million or more years old that belong to one of our ancestors and we put foot prints on the moon. ‘We have an obligation to survive. Our loyalty is to the specious and the planet. We owe it to the cosmos to survive.’This is Sagan at is best. This is the greatest science educator humans have been gifted. This book is a master at his finest. I implore you to read this book. Quotes: ‘no about of intellect can stop you from being dead wrong’‘We are star stuff’‘There are so many examples of humans misuse of the earth. We should leave mars to the martians’‘Are we willing to tolerate ignorance and complacency on matters that effect the earth. Or will we think on longer time scales.’‘Possible that civilizations succumb to greed, ignorance, pollution, and nuclear war’‘Deterrence depends above all on psychological criteria, for purposes of deterrence a bluff taken seriously, is more useful that serious threat interpreted as a bluff’ Henry Kissinger on Nuclear Deterrence Some text messages that I sent while reading the book: Fuuuuccccckkkkk. When you get the point that Sagan has talked about how big the universe is, the number of stars, and galaxies, then the insanity of the circumstances for life to exist, then he talks about extraterrestrial life and you hear his fascination with it but he says that maybe civilizations succumb to ignorance, pollution, nuclear war, etc.Its such a ‘Carl Sagan, Jesus fucking Christ! The worm hole that you send me down. The gratitude for life, the terror of our world, the possibility of life out there, the loneliness of the universe, the beauty of science, the power of love. You make me feel so many things.’The universe is 13 billions years old and have trillions of stars in it. It is the height of arrogance to think that we are the only life and the height of ignorance to act as if we are not directly causing our own extinction."
447,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21820806-kirby,5,"Carl Sagan's Cosmos was genuinely enjoyable. It's filled with awe and wonder and hope and was uplifting and exactly what I needed. I considered reading The Sixth Extinction and decided against it once COVID-19 hit. Between the daily marathon press briefings and the talking heads on the news 24 hours a day and the impossibility of avoiding discussion of COVID-19 on social media, I believed The Sixth Extinction would exacerbate my depression. I needed something joyful in my reading life. Enter Cosmos.I listened to the audiobook narrated by LeVar Burton with a foreword by Neil deGrasse Tyson. I do so love LeVar Burton. Reading Rainbow was my childhood and sparked in me a love of reading.Sagan's language in Cosmos is beautiful. I liked the words he chose and the meandering flow of his writing. He writes intelligently about complex ideas, but I didn't feel like I was out of my depth. I felt like I understood the concepts in the book because Sagan's writing is so good, and I did learn a few things. The concepts in the book are imaginative without being silly and too over the top. I also enjoyed how the book translated to the TV show. I especially liked the following chapters:* Heaven and Hell - Not about the religious idea of Heaven and Hell but about the potential for heavenly and hellish worlds to exist in the universe* Blues for a Red Planet - About Mars*The Persistence of MemoryEven though Cosmos was written in 1980, it's not too noticeably outdated. Voyager 1 and 2 have both left the solar system and are traveling through interstellar space. We have put unmanned rovers on Mars, and both Spirit's and Opportunity's missions have ended while Curiosity continues its exploration. We have 3 billion more people on Earth. Cosmos didn't read at all like an old high school textbook. Sagan obviously held liberal views and said he was agnostic because, ""An atheist is someone who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has compelling evidence against the existence of God. I know of no such compelling evidence."" If these beliefs don't align at least somewhat with yours, then you may not like Cosmos.My only complaint - and it's a minor one about the audiobook specifically that didn't affect my rating of the book - is the narration is overacted and too staccato. I know Burton is passionate and was likely trying to create passion in the listener, but there are places where he sounds very William Shatner as Captain Kirk emphasizing words strangely. Burton sometimes sounds like he's out of breath. I would have liked to have the multiple narrators take turns reading chapters."
448,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88123673-eddie-chua,4,"A book that talks about the study of the stars, galaxy and our existence in all of this ""space"". It is interesting to read about Astronomy and science, the messages I picked up are about continuous learning and expansion. Author wrote ""In a cosmic perspective, most human concerns seem insignificant, even petty"". I could not stop myself from laughing and go into deeper reflection after reading that line. Too often, we place self as the center of the world, even the universes (hence the same pattern that planet Earth is the center of it), that we ignore on matters that should really matter. Matters of humanity, expansion of thinking, exploration and the betterment of our existence. We are but a dust, carbon particle on this planet, like our planet is in the entire galaxy. With a measured distance of 100 million light years, the ego truly oversell ourselves. The good news is like how author later put it ""humans have evolved to wonder, that understanding is a joy, that knowledge is prerequisite to survival. I believe our future depends on how well we know this Cosmos in which we float like a note of dust in the morning sky"". Ah, the importance of continuous learning. As our mind evolved and developed, using both our right and left hemisphere of thinking and creating, we can venture into the unknown. Without knowledge, one is unable to ""survive"" in this ever changing world. Knowledge comes from processing the endless information and learning to discern. When we stop learning and exploring, we stop growing and stop creating, as like the examples given of the Indians, Mayan and Aztec civilizations, due to their pervasiveness of the slave economy. So in terms of today's context, if I choose to be a ""salve"" to technology, I am the one that will be eliminated. Learning is not an option, it's a necessity and way of life.So his closing statements, where author asked ""who speaks for human? We all do"", this was a reminder that I got to do my part for I am a representation of this planet. Expanding on that, if I to be seen as representation from a country, from this planet, from this solar system, then how am I truly showing up as that representation."
449,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40996120-jenny-dahl-bakken,5,"Carl Sagan’s «Cosmos» is as inspiring and poignant today as when it was published. In it he shows us a way to the stars, from the very beginning of life itself until the distant future where our descendants travel the universe. He explores the history of our planet, of scientific thought and inquiry, the evolution of life, human brilliance and curiosity - but also the destructive parts of us that can end up destroying all of civilization.The book had the Cold War as a specter in the background, but yet it is as relevant today as when it was first published. Sagan shows how human intelligence and spirit can be used for good - or for bad. How compassion and hatred both exist in us, and how we can work together to prioritize one over the other. The same technology, he points out, can be used for warfare or galactic exploration. Humanity can travel to the stars for less than what we use on military spending in a year. But to manage it we need to work together. In 2020, as distrust, anti-scientific attitudes and displays of power amongst world leaders are once again evident, this book is as important as ever. If we recognize the signs we might be able to prevent the next burning of the “Library at Alexandria” and the descent into ignorance that would follow. An ignorance that could be the end of humanity.Sagan makes a case for nature, science, curiosity, love, companionship, free thought, demilitarization, cooperation, sexual freedom and human enterprise. He gives us hope that a better world is possible, if we can only stop our skirmishes and ask ourselves the question: who speaks for Earth? Who will stand for humanity? What will be left of us if we don’t manage to speak as one, to realize we all share this planet; that each one of us is a cosmic incredulity, a wonder, so insignificantly few in the grand scheme of things that we need to start preserving humanity as one? Everyone should read this book, feel inspired - and thereafter we should start doing what we can for the world of tomorrow. We can start, as Sagan puts it, by kissing our infants."
450,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7400919-pedro,5,"Probably one of the best books I've ever read, and most definitely the best non-fiction/science popularizing book. Sagan's way of showing us mankind's evolution interconnection with the progress of the universe is tantalizing. The prospects of the future and the similarity of the now starting journey to the stars with the discovery of other worlds/civilizations inside the Earth are amazing. Genius, I say! I strongly recommend anyone with a bit of curiosity to read the book - although it is mainly science-driven, Sagan is a very good teacher and explains everything in the simplest form possible. If you don't like reading (but then you wouldn't be on a reading social network, would you?), do at least take a peek at the TV series..."

Books like these help you to understand why you are so amazed by the universe.

We have lingered long enough on the shores of the cosmic ocean. We are ready at last to set sail for the stars.”“Imagination will often carry us into worlds that never were. But without it we go nowhere.”“If you wish to make an apple pie out of scratch, you must first invent the universe.”“Before we devised artificial lights and atmospheric pollution and modern forms of nocturnal entertainment, we watched the stars. There were practical calendrical reasons, of course, but there was more to it than that. Even today, the most jaded city dweller can be unexpectedly moved upon encountering a clear night sky studded with thousands of twinkling stars.”“Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.”“We can judge our progress by the courage of our questions and the depth of our answers, our willingness to embrace what is true rather than what feels good.”“Look again at that dot. That’s here. That’s home. That’s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every “superstar,” every “supreme leader,” every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there—on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.”“It pays to keep an open mind, but not so open your brains fall out.”“The brain is like a muscle. When it is in use we feel very good. Understanding is joyous.”“Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.”“Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.”“There are naive questions, tedious questions, ill-phrased questions, questions put after inadequate self-criticism. But every question is a cry to understand the world. There is no such thing as a dumb question.”"

This is a double-edged sword. They can be good reads, and even contextually interesting -being able to see what we ""believed"" to be true science years ago. But there's a drawback in this approach. The books might be marvelously written, but they're usually doomed to become outdated or even obsolete as the years pass. Newer findings contradicting and questioning the old theories espoused in these works of literature. But Sagan avoids this doomed fate while even stating some outdated scientific arguments that require obvious updating. This book remains a fascinating work, regardless of this small shortcoming, because it takes a different approach. This book is about humanity, our origin, our collective quest for science, and what our place is among the Cosmos. In this approach, Sagan crafted a timeless piece of non-fiction science literature which stands the test of time. Curiosity feeds the hearth of humankind's capacity for doing research and accumulating knowledge. Humbling, exalting, humanistic, and naturalistic; transcending nationalities, ethnicities, and even species in some ways. Sagan attempts to ground humanity in an evolutionary cosmic view, trying to show us how minuscule we are while simultaneously showing how interrelated we are to everything else -in the planet and in the universe-, and how ingenious and incredible we can be. We're simple starstuff capable of understanding how small we are in this universe, and that's amazing. For Sagan, we should be humbled by the knowledge that billions of years of physical, chemical and biological processes have resulted in us, a bipedal race of apes capable of looking beyond our planet to our true origins in the Cosmos: the complex processes that gave rise to our Universe, our galaxy, our solar system, our planet, and us.Even so, Sagan attempts to not idealize our history too much, recognizing our flaws time and again throughout the pages. Our political, economic, and ideological shortcomings that have resulted in countless cases of human atrocities. He urges us to learn from these to break the wheel of repetition that limits humanity from ushering in a better era, not allowing us to improve ourselves as a species. Sagan is quick to judge the atrocities of our ancestors (slavery, imperialism, fascism, Stalinism, racism, sexism, etc.), even going so far as to argue for a complete reformulation of our society. He favors a careful reevaluation of our society, and the dissolution of our current status quo (the preservation of which, he warns us, will only assure our inevitable self-destruction as a species). But Sagan also deeply valued our capacity for creating knowledge, and the beautiful, unifying similarities that can be observed throughout our history as a species, across different eras and civilizations. Similarities that can be observed in their respective quests for natural truth, achieving independent discoveries and arriving at similar conclusions, all of this achieved by people separated across centuries in time, across different cultures and ethnicities, and across continents separated from each other by miles of water. Humanity can do great things and terrifying things, and it's what we choose to do that will dictate the future of our species."
475,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,5,"If you've known me for more than a little while, you know that one of my great loves in this world is science. Even though I tend to get stymied by the math, and I probably couldn't call up all the right data from my head at the right time, it is the idea of science and the stories of science that truly interest me. Just the fact that we live in a universe where it is possible to know how things work, where we can devise a way to look at the whole of creation, from things so large that they defy imagination to things so small that they can barely be said to exist at all. Science is imagination put into practice against the universe, and as much fun as stories and myths are, as hope and prayers may be, science is the best, most reliable way for us to come to grips with the Cosmos.It is to Carl Sagan that I owe this love of what humans have done with ourselves.When I was a kid, my father had a copy of Cosmos, and, since I was but a child, I never really read it. I tended more to flip through it for the interesting pictures - the speculative Jovian life forms on pages 42 and 43, the Viking photos of Mars in chapter 5, the gorgeous paintings of the views from other worlds around other stars, the photos of nebulae and galaxies, all of these things fascinated me, and if I had been a bit more patient I would have found out about them. But I was a kid, so that can be excused. What the book did for me was to open my mind to a universe of possibilities that were all within our reach, or at least would be someday.As I got older, I saw the TV miniseries of the same name on PBS. Now the pictures that I had lingered over in the book were right before me, accompanied by Sagan's soothing baritone. His ship of the imagination somehow managed to take us unfathomable distances from our home and bring us back again. He talked to his viewers like we were intelligent adults, fully capable of understanding and appreciating the vast scope of scientific discovery rather than a bunch of attention-deficit teenagers who couldn't be trusted to keep watching without a jump-cut every ten seconds. Carl Sagan believed, despite the occasional evidence to the contrary, that human beings were capable of overcoming our barbaric pasts and forging a bright new future together in the stars.The purpose of Cosmos, both the book and the TV show, was to educate. It was, as Sagan put it, ""to engage the heart as well as the mind,"" perhaps to help shed the image of science as a cold and passionless pursuit. He wanted to show how science became what is is, from the ancient scientist/philosophers in Ionia and Alexandria all the way up to the engineers and astronauts working at NASA. It's all part of a long chain of knowledge that ties human history together and which engages one of our deepest desires: to know how the universe works.Each chapter focuses on a different theme of knowledge - from the way the planets form and what they're like to the nature of the furthest reaches of space. He starts with how Eratosthenes measured the world with just a shadow and some math, and how the ancient thinkers of Alexandria were asking the same questions about the nature of the Earth that we ask today. He follows the tortured path of Johannes Kepler in his quest to understand how the planets move, the arrogant brilliance of Newton as he completely redefined the clockwork of the cosmos, and the casual miracle that Einstein pulled off when he told us that not only are we not the center of the universe but that there is no center. Each great mind led to another.Unfortunately, each setback cost us what may be valuable time. For all his wonderment, he understood how petty and ignorant human beings could be. From the beginning, and at various points in the book, he reminds us of the millennium we lost with the destruction and corruption of the ancient thinkers of the Mediterranean. As far as we can tell, the men and women who made their home in Alexandria were investigating questions and scientific problems that would have changed the way we understand the world. If the library hadn't been burned down, if religious terror hadn't murdered scientific insight, who knows where we would be today? It's impossible to know, but it's tempting to think that we might have been well on our way to the stars by now.The latter chapters underscore that theme pretty heavily, reminding us over and over again that we have one world, and only one world. Not only does Sagan fear that we could obliterate ourselves with the nuclear weapons we love and fear so much, but he also fears that self-annihilation may be a natural outcome to any intelligent civilization. Our search for intelligent life on other worlds may be fruitless, because they might be just as self-destructive as we are.But we don't know. We can't know, at least not yet. Our understanding of the universe is still not clear enough, our technology is still not good enough, and perhaps it never will be. But for all our stumbles and failures, Sagan wants us to remember and understand just how much humanity is capable of, and how good we could be if we really put our minds to it. And in that sense, there is a lot of value to reading it now, thirty years after it was published.While we have not eliminated nuclear weapons, we have made great strides towards controlling them and reducing their numbers. The hopes that Sagan had for future space exploration - Mars rovers, a probe to Titan, contact with comets - have all been made real, and with outstanding results. We know that the dinosaurs were wiped out by a meteor impact - something that Sagan is clearly unsure of at the time of writing. We have mapped the human genome and developed personal computers that have revolutionized the way we explore space. With the internet, any person on earth can catalog galaxies or explore the moon, there have been advances in nanotechnology and materials and bioengineering and evolution that would have made even Sagan's eyes pop.Despite all our flaws, we continue to advance. We continue to build knowledge upon knowledge and to further our understanding of how the universe works. Maybe we will one day leave this planet ourselves, perhaps just for a visit or perhaps to start a new world. Maybe if we persist in our quest to comprehend the world we live in, to shut out the howling and screaming of the voices of unreason, we can make the world a better place for generations to come. In the great argument that is raging these days between the rationalists and the believers, the faithful and the atheists, it has become fashionable to try and shout the other side down. To adopt a position that excludes compromise and promises only defeat for one side or another. Sagan never would have wanted that, and I think he hit upon a solution that needs to be revisited.Rather than try to turn people to science through cold logic or heated words, through derision and coercion and fear, do as Sagan did: win them over with wonder. The cosmos is too big, and there is too much to know to waste our time with petty arguments and pointless feuds. If you want people to appreciate science, turn to people like Sagan, or Neil deGrasse Tyson, or Phil Plait, or Michio Kaku, or Bill Nye, or Adam Savage,[1] people whose enthusiasm and love of science will instill people with wonder, one person at a time. And it is in that way that we will go furthest towards ensuring humanity's place among the stars.----------------------------------------------------""Every one of us is precious in the cosmic perspective. If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.""- Carl Sagan, Cosmos[1] In the interest of fairness, I tried to come up with female scientists who were at the forefront of popularizing science with the public.

476,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80831211-patrick-kelly,5,"Cosmos Phenomenal book. This is like seeing a star athlete a year or two before his peak. You’re getting to see his greatness but you know he is about to explode soon. This is Sagan on the verge of his greatness. He is hitting on so many topics, provoking the human imagination, tantalizing the mind, and curating curiosity of the universe. I normally read books at 1.25 speed and read one book at a time but I wanted to savior Sagan. I read at normal speed and listened in between reading other books. This is a wonderful adventure. Sagan talks about the origins of the universe, I have rarely heard him talk about black holes but he briefly does in this book. Theoretical physics was never his field of study but I wonder if he and Hawking had any interactions. Even just being two of the most famous scientists in the world. He talks about the creation of planets, the depths of the cosmos, the fragility of human existence, nuclear proliferation, galaxies, extraterrestrial life, and more. On planets: The planets in our solar system are wild. Mars is interesting because its close to us but the other planets have much more to offer. His discussions about Mercury, Venus, and Jupiter, are amazing. These planets are playgrounds for scientific discovery. When he was talking about Mars, he talked about the origins of life. I have long argued that science handcuffs itself with the requirements for life but Sagan has changed my mind. He dives in to chemistry and biology, showing that carbon, hydrogen, and other key elements are the building blocks for life. We are not just looking at our life but the elements that are must abundant in the universe and that form life. It is conceivable that life could be formed through aluminum and sulfur but it is highly unlikely. I learned in this section.His discussion of Jupiter is wild. Worth rereading.Sun/Stars: he has a whole section about stars and their origins. How the are born and die. It is very chemistry heavy. Suffice to say, our sun is rather small and ordinary. Everything comes from the sun. He uses the term ‘higher power’ to describe the sun and that it is acceptable to consider the sun a higher power. Chemistry/biology: I felt that this book had the most technical information about chemistry and biology. These are subjects that I struggle with. Sagan was dense but as usual fascinating with his talk about these fields. I really learned how the study of the universe is a shared field, it is not limited to astronomers. Chemists and biologists play a huge role in our understanding of the universe. Gravity and light have their own rules but much of the universe is governed by the rules and laws of chemistry and biology. These are fields that are not given enough attention.Galaxies: This is where he gets into numbers, time, and size. This is where my head really started to spin. The sheer size of the universe and what it contains is hard to comprehend. ‘There are more stars in the universe than there are grains of sand on all the beaches on earth.’ What the fuck!? We are nothing.He talks about pulsars, star clusters, different kinds of galaxies, the rotation of galaxies, the size of galaxies, galaxies colliding, and more. I want to write more but even thinking about it all I can say is ‘dude, dude, dude, the fucking universe’.A point that caught me ‘the distance between galaxies is often two million light years.’The fact that our galaxy rotates. I am gonna stop writing and just say, ‘read Carl Sagan.’Extraterrestrial life: a popular topic and fascination of Sagan’s. I believe that Sagan was a man that wanted nothing more than to find some evidence of life outside of earth. Sadly he never found it. He breaks down the numbers of life, the Drake equation, the way we could communication (prime numbers and radio waves), the time it would take to send and receive messages (centuries), the time to search for an expand out in the galaxy to find life, the evolution of life and civilization, and more. This is a section near the end of the book and the section on nuclear war follows it. It is the brilliance and heart break of Sagan. He looks at the possibility for life, the possibility for science, understanding our fragility of human existence, he sees how powerful and beautiful humans are, he loves humans and loves science, always the optimist, but also a realist. He saw that we could be greater but recognized that we were causing our own extinction. That it is likely we will never become a space faring civilization because we would destroy ourselves first. It’s possible that this is the path of other civilizations or others avoided the obsession, ignorance, greed, and malice that we commit. Sagan was an optimist but in many ways he also thought that we were utterly doomed. My personal thoughts about extraterrestrial life: The universe is 13 billions years old and have trillions of stars in it. It is the height of arrogance to think that we are the only life and the height of ignorance to act as if we are not directly causing our own extinction.Nuclear war: Sagan advocated strongly for nuclear proliferation. Seeing nuclear weapons as an existential threat to humanity. His advocacy on this and other political, social, and environmental issues, is one of the reasons why I love him. The next book I will read is ‘A path where no man thought’. His book about nuclear weapons. I will write more about his thoughts when I finish that book. The last half hour is mind blowing. It puts into perspective everything that Sagan is saying. Our tiny place on a pale blue dot. We found food prints that are a million or more years old that belong to one of our ancestors and we put foot prints on the moon. ‘We have an obligation to survive. Our loyalty is to the specious and the planet. We owe it to the cosmos to survive.’This is Sagan at is best. This is the greatest science educator humans have been gifted. This book is a master at his finest. I implore you to read this book. Quotes: ‘no about of intellect can stop you from being dead wrong’‘We are star stuff’‘There are so many examples of humans misuse of the earth. We should leave mars to the martians’‘Are we willing to tolerate ignorance and complacency on matters that effect the earth. Or will we think on longer time scales.’‘Possible that civilizations succumb to greed, ignorance, pollution, and nuclear war’‘Deterrence depends above all on psychological criteria, for purposes of deterrence a bluff taken seriously, is more useful that serious threat interpreted as a bluff’ Henry Kissinger on Nuclear Deterrence Some text messages that I sent while reading the book: Fuuuuccccckkkkk. When you get the point that Sagan has talked about how big the universe is, the number of stars, and galaxies, then the insanity of the circumstances for life to exist, then he talks about extraterrestrial life and you hear his fascination with it but he says that maybe civilizations succumb to ignorance, pollution, nuclear war, etc.Its such a ‘Carl Sagan, Jesus fucking Christ! The worm hole that you send me down. The gratitude for life, the terror of our world, the possibility of life out there, the loneliness of the universe, the beauty of science, the power of love. You make me feel so many things.’The universe is 13 billions years old and have trillions of stars in it. It is the height of arrogance to think that we are the only life and the height of ignorance to act as if we are not directly causing our own extinction."
477,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21820806-kirby,5,"Carl Sagan's Cosmos was genuinely enjoyable. It's filled with awe and wonder and hope and was uplifting and exactly what I needed. I considered reading The Sixth Extinction and decided against it once COVID-19 hit. Between the daily marathon press briefings and the talking heads on the news 24 hours a day and the impossibility of avoiding discussion of COVID-19 on social media, I believed The Sixth Extinction would exacerbate my depression. I needed something joyful in my reading life. Enter Cosmos.I listened to the audiobook narrated by LeVar Burton with a foreword by Neil deGrasse Tyson. I do so love LeVar Burton. Reading Rainbow was my childhood and sparked in me a love of reading.Sagan's language in Cosmos is beautiful. I liked the words he chose and the meandering flow of his writing. He writes intelligently about complex ideas, but I didn't feel like I was out of my depth. I felt like I understood the concepts in the book because Sagan's writing is so good, and I did learn a few things. The concepts in the book are imaginative without being silly and too over the top. I also enjoyed how the book translated to the TV show. I especially liked the following chapters:* Heaven and Hell - Not about the religious idea of Heaven and Hell but about the potential for heavenly and hellish worlds to exist in the universe* Blues for a Red Planet - About Mars*The Persistence of MemoryEven though Cosmos was written in 1980, it's not too noticeably outdated. Voyager 1 and 2 have both left the solar system and are traveling through interstellar space. We have put unmanned rovers on Mars, and both Spirit's and Opportunity's missions have ended while Curiosity continues its exploration. We have 3 billion more people on Earth. Cosmos didn't read at all like an old high school textbook. Sagan obviously held liberal views and said he was agnostic because, ""An atheist is someone who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has compelling evidence against the existence of God. I know of no such compelling evidence."" If these beliefs don't align at least somewhat with yours, then you may not like Cosmos.My only complaint - and it's a minor one about the audiobook specifically that didn't affect my rating of the book - is the narration is overacted and too staccato. I know Burton is passionate and was likely trying to create passion in the listener, but there are places where he sounds very William Shatner as Captain Kirk emphasizing words strangely. Burton sometimes sounds like he's out of breath. I would have liked to have the multiple narrators take turns reading chapters."
478,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88123673-eddie-chua,4,"A book that talks about the study of the stars, galaxy and our existence in all of this ""space"". It is interesting to read about Astronomy and science, the messages I picked up are about continuous learning and expansion. Author wrote ""In a cosmic perspective, most human concerns seem insignificant, even petty"". I could not stop myself from laughing and go into deeper reflection after reading that line. Too often, we place self as the center of the world, even the universes (hence the same pattern that planet Earth is the center of it), that we ignore on matters that should really matter. Matters of humanity, expansion of thinking, exploration and the betterment of our existence. We are but a dust, carbon particle on this planet, like our planet is in the entire galaxy. With a measured distance of 100 million light years, the ego truly oversell ourselves. The good news is like how author later put it ""humans have evolved to wonder, that understanding is a joy, that knowledge is prerequisite to survival. I believe our future depends on how well we know this Cosmos in which we float like a note of dust in the morning sky"". Ah, the importance of continuous learning. As our mind evolved and developed, using both our right and left hemisphere of thinking and creating, we can venture into the unknown. Without knowledge, one is unable to ""survive"" in this ever changing world. Knowledge comes from processing the endless information and learning to discern. When we stop learning and exploring, we stop growing and stop creating, as like the examples given of the Indians, Mayan and Aztec civilizations, due to their pervasiveness of the slave economy. So in terms of today's context, if I choose to be a ""salve"" to technology, I am the one that will be eliminated. Learning is not an option, it's a necessity and way of life.So his closing statements, where author asked ""who speaks for human? We all do"", this was a reminder that I got to do my part for I am a representation of this planet. Expanding on that, if I to be seen as representation from a country, from this planet, from this solar system, then how am I truly showing up as that representation."
479,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40996120-jenny-dahl-bakken,5,"Carl Sagan’s «Cosmos» is as inspiring and poignant today as when it was published. In it he shows us a way to the stars, from the very beginning of life itself until the distant future where our descendants travel the universe. He explores the history of our planet, of scientific thought and inquiry, the evolution of life, human brilliance and curiosity - but also the destructive parts of us that can end up destroying all of civilization.The book had the Cold War as a specter in the background, but yet it is as relevant today as when it was first published. Sagan shows how human intelligence and spirit can be used for good - or for bad. How compassion and hatred both exist in us, and how we can work together to prioritize one over the other. The same technology, he points out, can be used for warfare or galactic exploration. Humanity can travel to the stars for less than what we use on military spending in a year. But to manage it we need to work together. In 2020, as distrust, anti-scientific attitudes and displays of power amongst world leaders are once again evident, this book is as important as ever. If we recognize the signs we might be able to prevent the next burning of the “Library at Alexandria” and the descent into ignorance that would follow. An ignorance that could be the end of humanity.Sagan makes a case for nature, science, curiosity, love, companionship, free thought, demilitarization, cooperation, sexual freedom and human enterprise. He gives us hope that a better world is possible, if we can only stop our skirmishes and ask ourselves the question: who speaks for Earth? Who will stand for humanity? What will be left of us if we don’t manage to speak as one, to realize we all share this planet; that each one of us is a cosmic incredulity, a wonder, so insignificantly few in the grand scheme of things that we need to start preserving humanity as one? Everyone should read this book, feel inspired - and thereafter we should start doing what we can for the world of tomorrow. We can start, as Sagan puts it, by kissing our infants."
480,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24956756-drew,5,"This was my first book by Sagan despite him being one of my childhood heroes, mainly due to the original Cosmos show and a few excerpts from his writings (the Pale Blue Dot passage, for example).Put simply, this book inspired me, and I don’t think I can honestly say that any other book has ever done so. Entertained, yes. Enlightened, of course. But never inspired. After three decades, I thought I was just the uninspired type. A book about science made me emotional. It made me think about humanity as a whole, about our amazing yet fragile progress on the long timeline of the universe, about our future. And more importantly, about my personal part in that future. Times are dark and we are seemingly more divided than we’ve been in many decades. Yet from where he sat only a few years ago, Carl Sagan had advice for us. He seemed to see the intrinsic problems facing us as a species, the flaws that might lead to our ultimate destruction, yes. But also—ever the inspiration—he saw a way forward. And maybe unsurprisingly, that way forward is simple and heartfelt. Simple, but perhaps not easy. There was so much in this book that hit home for me, or fascinated me, or gave me a sense of a kind of cosmic vertigo (in the best possible way). I found myself rereading passages on biology, chemistry, and physics in order to ensure I understood, out of a genuine interest in those subjects as presented by Sagan. With very few exceptions, interest in science hasn’t been my nature. I thought maybe I just didn’t have the brain for it. Turns out I didn’t have the right teacher. This kind of communication of science, this kind of inspiration... we need it more than ever. No one living now seems to be coming close, at least not anyone doing it on a large scale in popular media. I wish we still had someone like him, and like my little obsession with Joseph Campbell, I’m sure I’ll be reading a lot more of Sagan’s work."
481,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3434288-jennifer,5,"Given the stunning eloquence with which Sagan writes Cosmos, I wish I were able to express my thoughts on the book in a more articulate way. Sadly, my writing caliber is not up to the challenge yet, so I’ll just start with “I loved this book.” Even though Sagan built his career in astronomy, he shows such respect towards all areas of knowledge, including the history --some of my favorite passages are ones where he discusses different stories of scientific discovery (never knew that Kepler and Tycho Brahe had such a troubled working relationship) or looks to the past for guidance on what to expect in the future (such as when he pointed to the meeting of Europeans and indigenous peoples in the Americas as a potential case study for future extraterrestrial contact). While all the material in the book was fascinating, one of my favorite chapters was “Blues for a Red Planet,” which chronicles the exploration of Mars by the Viking missions, as well as the challenges faced in the years of preparation leading up to launch. Even though the information related is several decades old, it deepened my respect for the ingenuity and expertise that went into the program and reminded me just how incredible it is that we’ve landed machines that were able to conduct experiments on the dirt of a planet hundreds of millions of miles away. I’m sure Sagan would be overjoyed to learn about the progress made on Mars rovers in the years since. Cosmos is absolutely wonderful in every sense and I’m sure it will continue to inspire curiosity in scientific endeavors and an appreciation for our place in the universe for many future generations of readers.

482,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71488312-jakob-mills,5,"Personal ReviewI thought that this was a very good book. It was very informative. The author talked about astronomy through history and many of the big discoveries and how they changed through the years. The author made learning very fun for the common person. I thought that every chapter had something unique to offer and learn about.SummaryAt the beginning of each chapter the author starts it off with a historical quote dealing with that specific chapter. There is an introduction that gives an overview of the entire book and a very philosophical perspective on the subject. The author talks about some of the theories we have today and how they were influenced by discoveries thousands of years ago. He also explains the culture and government of the people that made these great discoveries. After this, the author shifts to talking about some of the modern day adventures of human space craft and how we are soon to visit other worlds. He talks about how science is sort of a religion and how it has changed the way the human race has thought over our thousands of years as a species. The author sort of goes back and forth to ancient and common times throughout the rest of the book.RecommendationI think that any scientist or anybody interested in physics would love this book. Just the fact that it is written by one of the most famous scientists of our time, Carl Sagan, is very appealing in itself. I also think that a high school physics student would be very well off if they read this book. The author does a very good job of explaining many very complex principles at the most elementary level possible."

It should be free!I think we would have an even greater appreciation of science in society if this were more widely read. It's a fascinating look at the history of science and the development of ideas. What's more, Carl Sagan is a beautiful person, and it's very intimate to hear his childhood outlook and what sparked his curiosity. The speculations of how past events have turned out can be disheartening. Dr. Sagan defends the complexities of whale communication; how they can communicate thousands of kilometers apart, essentially having evolved a natural telephone system they've relied upon for centuries. He laments the disruptions human navies have caused by our wanton use of sonar and radio communications to the extent that whales are limited to communication of a few kilometers. There is also the then unknown effects of climate change and the recognition of the small progress we've had today.I thought this book would be far outdated, but I now believe it is timeless. Also, if Levar Burton had read all my textbooks to me, I would've had multiple PhD's in science by now."

""On another planet, with a different sequence of random processes to make hereditary diversity and a different environment to select particular combinations of genes, the chances of finding beings who are physically very similar to us is, I believe, near zero. The chances of finding another form of intelligence is not. Their brains may well have evolved from the inside out. They may have switching elements analogous to our neurons.

Or perhaps the equivalent of neurons elsewhere would not be in direct physical contact but in radio communication so that a single intelligent being could be distributed among many different organisms, or even many different planets, each with a part of the intelligence of the whole, each contributing by radio to an intelligence much greater than itself"" "
485,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31194984-virag-padalkar,5,"What a fascinating book! And so eloquently written. Carl Sagan has a knack for evoking the sense of a higher purpose without invoking gods and superstitions. From the birth of the cosmos to the tragedy of the Ionian civilization to the destruction of the library at Alexandria to today; He manages to place in front of us our own checkered past and at the same time manages to place in front of us our glorious achievements. Take for example this extract from the climactic chapter of this book - ""The choice is stark and ironic. The same rocket boosters used to launch probes to the planets are poised to send nuclear warheads to the nations. The radioactive power sources on Viking and Voyager derive from the same technology that makes nuclear weapons.""The book ends with a reminder that we have a greater responsibility and a higher loyalty (pun unintended) - ""Our obligation to survive is owed not just to ourselves but also to that Cosmos, ancient and vast, from which we spring.""Wow. "
486,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2346033-alex,4,"Quasars. Globular clusters. Black holes. Welcome to the cosmos. I love science even though I find it difficult to discuss and often hard to follow. Sagan does his best to make the planets and movements of our solar system and the universe at large comprehensible and reminds us that we are made of star stuff. He fills our minds with wonder while soaring across the history of stellar human achievement and knowledge. The journey goes from vast expanse of space to our own planet and the miracle of human reproduction, with the end result being a greater appreciation for the world that surrounds us and the struggles we've had just to learn what we know now. Sagan's call to action at the end of the book is as pertinent now as it was in the 1970s: we need to learn to come together and to take care of our planet - because if we don't, who will speak for Earth? In the anti-factual era we find ourselves in, Sagan's voice is dearly missed, but his ideas survive to keep the light of hope and truth alive. "
487,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47729884-alexandra-bazhenova-sorokina,5,"One of the most poetic non-fiction books I’ve read and a manifesto at the same time. It’s curious how Sagan actually tells the story of cosmos as the history of the Earth, of astronomy and of space exploration in order to prove the same point that post-modernist philosophers such as Derrida are trying to make: that of decentralization and deconstruction of authority as a bearer of truth. I’ve always known it, but never understood so vividly that the human knowledge makes it clearer each century - we are not the center of the universe. Such a simple statement, bringing the human race to the next step of development after our narcissistic “terrible three”, and it is definitely not clear yet to most of the world leaders. Apart from this political side, it is just incredibly beautiful, albeit a bit too candid at times, Sagan creating an idea of our galaxy as a home and of the universe as an ocean to explore, not to be afraid of. Although we’ve come to know a lot more about space since 1980, the book seems to have aged really well."
488,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4372320-matija,5,"A poignant book with unparalleled breadth of perspective. Countless other reviews already describe it in detail and extoll its virtues, but Cosmos surpassed any expectations I might have had based on high praise lavished on it here and elsewhere. Its masterful synthesis of the history of science and the human race, of cosmos and life on Earth and maybe elsewhere with more recent achievements and insights of our infant species and further with projections into possible futures, grim or splendid as they may be, will stay with me forever. Its admonition against the perils of war made ever more devastating by our growing technical prowess and its voice replete with awe beckoning us to direct our enterprise toward the exploration of our home universe and the stars so that we may survive the adolescence of our species is as relevant now as it was when Sagan first wrote it. Everyone should read this book, period. Put it on your list, make sure you get to it. Put it in your library for your kids to find one day. Now."
489,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26955278-chrysten-lofton,4," 4.0 ⭐ “If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.”   I am young in the act and identity of reading. Even being this young, I’m sure it’s the most important thing of all time, the most important thing I’ve ever done to and for myself, and I’m sure it has more consequence on me than any other experience, person, or event. I am troubled by all the books I’ve yet to read, and I hurry through them as fast as my brain will allow (not very fast, I’m sad to say, but I do try). I'm choosy with nonfiction. I try for things that have made a cultural impact, things I hope will impact me. Cosmos is on a lot of lists like, “Books Everybody Should Read At Least Once”, and “Books To Read Before You Die”, but that’s not why I picked it. I just dig cosmology. I don’t find the subject itself very accessible, I struggle to wrap my head around the seemingly-abstract ideas that might make sense mathematically, but come out as gibberish to me. It’s just that when one of those ideas finally does stick, I see the truth of the subject. Cosmology is one of the few things humanity pursues that admits size. I continuously study history & religion, and everything seems to always be reducing, and compartmentalizing, and shrinking the sum of the world. Cosmology just unleashes that motherfucker inside of your head, and makes no apologies for it. Why should it? Cosmology and its experts didn’t make the universe, after all. They’re just pointing it out. Due to my intellectual limitations, I really need for books like this to be accessible (I’ve been reading A Brief History of Time little by little for months because it takes me so long to understand the concept before I can move on). Cosmos is accessible, but there’s something so cool and so special about it.  Sagan translated the unapologetic size, order, and chaos of his subject, and spun it into poetry. Delicate, human poetry. Sagan, in the space of a few words, takes all that bigness, loneliness, chaos, and even the frustration of not understanding, and points to our ultimate inclusion in all things. As I read Cosmos, I realized I was reading a love letter. If someone must succumb to the vast size of things, how endearing to be led there by a poet. Someone who sees it all, and is truly in love.  I was reminded of Stephen King’s On Writing. King and Sagan sound similar to me because of the love and authority from which they speak. They also have a love for books and education that they speak on seductively. If you think reading is a bore, or don’t think it’s important, just let Stephen or Carl take you to church for a minute. Carl: “Books permit us to voyage through time, to tap the wisdom of our ancestors. The library connects us with the insight and knowledge, painfully extracted from Nature, of the greatest minds that ever were, with the best teachers, drawn from the entire planet and from all our history, to instruct us without tiring, and to inspire us to make our own contribution to the collective knowledge of the human species. I think the health of our civilization, the depth of our awareness about the underpinnings of our culture and our concern for the future can all be tested by how well we support our libraries.” Stephen: “He sat there studiously bent over his work (Bill saw him), which lay in a slant of crisp white winterlight, his face sober and absorbed, knowing that to be a librarian was to come as close as any human being can to sitting in the peak-seat of eternity’s engine.” ( - IT ) And again, in regard to the act of reading words and receiving an image, “ This is what were look­ing at, and we all see it. I didn’t tell you. You didn’t ask me. I never opened my mouth and you never opened yours. We’re not even in the same year together, let alone the same room . . . except we are together. We’re close. We’re having a meeting of the minds.” (- On Writing)  Cosmos, in the same spirit of love, also convicts. There’s a lot our species needs to hold itself accountable for, and it can. In a world where deflecting responsibility or delaying urgent change is common, Cosmos tells hard truths. We can, we just don’t—and why is that? And are we open to self-correction? How long do we want to debate it?  My husband gave a five start review to Stephen King’s On Writing, and he’s not a writer. You don’t have to be into cosmology to love Cosmos. There’s just something all too relatable and beautiful when people speak and you just know, by their spirit and the way they articulate, that they’ve stumbled on to something they can’t keep to themselves. It’s undeniable poetry, and it always leaves me a little dizzy and bubbling over inside my heart. It’s a reverent thing to me. Sagan does this using history, science, humor, and love. And since his subject is life, and all its extensions, your inclusion is inevitable. If you add Cosmos to your library, you’ll catch some of that love yourself. The book deems itself a personal journey, and while that journey was Sagan’s, you may find yourself on your own personal voyage as well. And if that’s not reverent, I don’t know what is. I also watched and enjoyed the 2014 documentary tribute to this book, Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, and this series deserves praise all across the board, but especially for it’s cosmic calendar break down of the history of planet Earth. And, if you don’t listen to the audio version of Cosmos narrated by the iconic LeVar Burton, you do yourself a disservice."

When I express my real love and admiration for this book, I’ve had people say to me “Well, you know, the book is out of date.” These people could not have gotten the theme of the book more wrong. (The statement is often accompanied with a condescending chuckle, which doesn’t help things.) Cosmos is about the beauty of science, the opening of our minds to the marvels and glories of the World and Universe around us. It is book that is in every way about the beauty of exploration and the joy and wonder of that journey. And since it’s a journey, to say that some areas of science have moved on from what is discussed/described in the book completely misses the point. Cosmos is about the journey; Sagan is an explorer. Nobody would be happier to find new inroads and ideas in the scientific world than Carl Sagan. Read the book to learn about appreciating the voyage that scientific study takes us on."

It's easy to follow and doesn't expect any prior knowledge of the subject, but it doesn't talk down or condescend to the reader and is confident enough to tackle difficult subjects.It also has a good mix of scepticism and speculation, it avoids entering into psuedo-science or conspiracy theory territory while still giving a fair hearing to concepts like time travel and aliens that any kid reading the book would be mesmerised by.Maybe if I'd read this back when it was bought for me I would have been inspired to do something useful with my life instead of just reading books, but alas."

A must read if you're curious about Life, Universe and Everything!, its cult classic status is no surprise at all. Gives many topics a whole new perspective. And the topics range from history and science to religion and philosophy. In essence - The Cosmos!Reading this book made me once again ponder about many of the unanswered questions I had as a child. Also provides multiple possible answers for those questions. Carl Sagan succeeds in making one think of all the trifles of everyday life (that we put on a pedestal) as silly. Cosmos has definitely had a noticeable impact at least on this little mind of mine."
493,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102746429-vyacheslav-shen,4,"The awesome book and brilliant propaganda of science. It gives so many ideas, opinions, points of view to think about such as extraterrestrial life, the history of science and so on. Also, this book is so informative because the content covers all existing sciences and even pseudoscience such as astrology. What I liked the most were three things. First, I have learned about the history of astronomy and human development in general; the book gave me a great opportunity to get to know the greatest human-beings who contributed to human progress. Second, it is a beautiful book. Carl Sagan described human discoveries especially in cosmology very well; reading this book was like watching a documentary with all these beautiful pictures of the cosmos. Thirdly, in the end, the author discusses who we (humanity) are and what was our past and what will be our future; Telling what conclusion he made would be a spoiler but I think everyone who is interested in the science should read the last chapter.However, I gave only 4 stars because almost all the materials were familiar to me from the documentaries I watched in National Geographic/ Discovery. So for me, it was like watching a similar documentary. My recommendation is to suggest this book to school students who are just starting their journey in the academics. "

I cried multiple times, laughed multiple times and thought a whole fucking heap about life, the universe and everything. It was a beautiful and incredibly relevant book—a huge credit to Carl Sagan seeing as it was first pubbed in the eighties. It made me happy and optimistic to be alive and a million other things. I'd recommend it to anyone and it's the best male-written book I’ve read this year.  Space people, get around it."
495,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29311506-murilo-monteiro,5,"This book is brilliant. The book covers so many topics and is easy to follow through. From natural selection to black holes, European exploration, ancient civilizations, extraterrestrial life, chemistry, philosophy, linguistics, mercantilism, physics...the list goes on. But, first, this book is about human curiosity and how it can take us far. How a specie born around a peripheral star within a random galaxy called Milky Way and, not even being the physically strongest within your own planet, managed to conquer, to know and build so many things? And how life is possible? Is carbon-based the only way life can exist? There is so much more to question, though.Sagan is a dreamer and a man ahead of his time. And you can easily feel it through his writing. Definitely, one of those people I'd love to spend an afternoon by the sea talking about anything that comes to our minds.(The book is a bit outdated since many discoveries have been made, but still worth.)"
496,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27777097-thomas-jacob-jr,5,"There seem to be several reasons why Cosmos remains a classic so many years after its publication. Carl Sagan is a science educator without peer, and his voice lends a sense of both wonder and gravity this book. He incorporates history, philosophy, astrophysics, mathematics, and even ethics and politics in a way that never seems overbearing or obtuse -- instead, these disparate threads are woven together into a grand narrative of mankind's obsession with the universe. Additionally, I listened to Cosmos in its brand new audiobook version, read dramatically by LeVar Burton. His style takes a bit of time to get used to -- he reads with such verve and passion that I'm sure many may find his performance too dramatic -- but a few chapters in I began to really enjoy his enthusiasm. The introductory bits are read by Neil DeGrasse Tyson and Seth MacFarlane, both of whom do an excellent job. "

If only everyone could read this book, imbibe what Carl wants to convey, human beings would understand a great deal about themselves and others. We will realize how ephemeral our existence is against the backdrop of cosmos and at the same time how precious the life is because of the small probability of the existence of beings like us. Looking from a cosmic perspective, like extra-terrestrials, we would realize how petty our problems are – our issues with another gender, race, religions, nationalities, people having different sets of philosophies and way of living. It will be clear to us how irresponsible our actions are towards the only planet we can call home right now. Reptilian nature of R-complex of our brains has been dominating the cerebral cortex – the seat of our humanity and this has made us the nuclear hostages of the 21st century. We are walking on a thin line, on one side lies self-destruction through nonsense fights amongst each other and another side has the opportunity to achieve the heights, even difficult to imagine, through thoughtful use of science and technology. Every step should be taken with utmost care.Marked by Carl Sagan’s ability to make things interesting to read and easy to absorb, this is a must read for anyone willing to listen to the melody of cosmos and find our place and reason to exist amongst the stars. "
498,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61802882-bj-rn,5,"Following the light of the sun, Carl Sagan leads us on a Voyage into the farthest expanse of the galaxy back to the smallest component of ourselves. Effortlessly to the beginning of everything into the future. Summarizing seamlessly how each generation sits like dwarfs on the shoulder of past giants reaching further than ever before. His book is awesome in the awe-inspiring way it used to mean. The way Sagan ties everything together in such simplicity leaves me with a feeling of pure joy. I don't think I can look at the night sky the same way after reading this book."
499,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64551352-daniel,4,"Though it shows its age in some specific respects, due to thirty years of scientific discovery since its publication (this book came before we understood the nature of quasars, before the confirmation of quarks and other elementary particles in the Standard Model, and before we realized we are situated in the Virgo Supercluster of galaxies, among other things), Cosmos still astonishes with its poignant blend of scientific inquiry and philosophical musing. If its only objective is to broaden one's perspective from one's immediate surroundings to the grandiosity of the cosmos itself, then it succeeds. It is an exploration of our history as always learning, curious creatures—our successes as well as our failures. Many pages are also devoted to imagining what possible future lays before us. Shall we learn to travel close to the speed of light, colonizing planets in systems light-years from our own? Or will we destroy ourselves first, as perhaps many other intelligent species have before us (this may be why the galaxy seems so... quiet), either with nuclear weapons (Sagan's key concern), or with the more timely spectre of climate change (something that this book slightly predates). In its final pages, Sagan pleas for peace. Humanity ought not destroy itself over ultimately petty differences, but rather share a common purpose as a species: to explore and learn as much as we can about our ancient and beautiful home, the cosmos. It's interesting reading such a thing in the era of Trump, where such unification of humanity seems impossible. But given enough time, and resisting the worst of our destructive and apathetic impulses, Sagan's plea seems possible. Having just finished the book, I'm left slightly more optimistic for our little species."

Or the swan....Well wasn't it a surprise that the very next day as I was reading this book, Sagan described this very same constellation among others in our galaxy...This book by Sagan is a wonderful look into our universe and into ourselves.... We are all made up of star dust... And what makes up stars more than the light that they gives off....I read somewhere that the western approach to Einstein's Theory of Relativity involves a observer and that which he is observing... And in between the two they are both separated by time...That the speed of light is 'relative' due to the distance that the observer is away from the light he is observing... Hence the relativity.... For instance the sun could've have blown up 8 minutes ago since it takes 8 minutes for the light from the sun to reach us... or... As i noticed lying under the stars last weekend that as soon as the sun comes up, the stars in the sky disappear.... The stars are still there but are hidden from the light emerging from the sun... It's all relative...The eastern approach however, is that to truly study the speed of light we must sit on the light... We must move with the light... This is where the observer and the observed become one... And when the two become one there is no time separating them... This is when we begin to move with light....If we are made up of stardust, why can we not emit light like the stars?Sagan writes, ""The Hindu religion is the only one of the world's great faiths dedicated to the idea that the Cosmos itself undergoes an immense, indeed an infinite, number of deaths and rebirths. it is the only religion in which the time scales correspond, no doubt by accident, to those of modern scientific cosmology.""This book is like a door that opens up the expanse of imagination... it's like finding our way outside a room...

You left too soon.
510,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24956756-drew,5,"This was my first book by Sagan despite him being one of my childhood heroes, mainly due to the original Cosmos show and a few excerpts from his writings (the Pale Blue Dot passage, for example).Put simply, this book inspired me, and I don’t think I can honestly say that any other book has ever done so. Entertained, yes. Enlightened, of course. But never inspired. After three decades, I thought I was just the uninspired type. A book about science made me emotional. It made me think about humanity as a whole, about our amazing yet fragile progress on the long timeline of the universe, about our future. And more importantly, about my personal part in that future. Times are dark and we are seemingly more divided than we’ve been in many decades. Yet from where he sat only a few years ago, Carl Sagan had advice for us. He seemed to see the intrinsic problems facing us as a species, the flaws that might lead to our ultimate destruction, yes. But also—ever the inspiration—he saw a way forward. And maybe unsurprisingly, that way forward is simple and heartfelt. Simple, but perhaps not easy. There was so much in this book that hit home for me, or fascinated me, or gave me a sense of a kind of cosmic vertigo (in the best possible way). I found myself rereading passages on biology, chemistry, and physics in order to ensure I understood, out of a genuine interest in those subjects as presented by Sagan. With very few exceptions, interest in science hasn’t been my nature. I thought maybe I just didn’t have the brain for it. Turns out I didn’t have the right teacher. This kind of communication of science, this kind of inspiration... we need it more than ever. No one living now seems to be coming close, at least not anyone doing it on a large scale in popular media. I wish we still had someone like him, and like my little obsession with Joseph Campbell, I’m sure I’ll be reading a lot more of Sagan’s work."
511,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3434288-jennifer,5,"Given the stunning eloquence with which Sagan writes Cosmos, I wish I were able to express my thoughts on the book in a more articulate way. Sadly, my writing caliber is not up to the challenge yet, so I’ll just start with “I loved this book.” Even though Sagan built his career in astronomy, he shows such respect towards all areas of knowledge, including the history --some of my favorite passages are ones where he discusses different stories of scientific discovery (never knew that Kepler and Tycho Brahe had such a troubled working relationship) or looks to the past for guidance on what to expect in the future (such as when he pointed to the meeting of Europeans and indigenous peoples in the Americas as a potential case study for future extraterrestrial contact). While all the material in the book was fascinating, one of my favorite chapters was “Blues for a Red Planet,” which chronicles the exploration of Mars by the Viking missions, as well as the challenges faced in the years of preparation leading up to launch. Even though the information related is several decades old, it deepened my respect for the ingenuity and expertise that went into the program and reminded me just how incredible it is that we’ve landed machines that were able to conduct experiments on the dirt of a planet hundreds of millions of miles away. I’m sure Sagan would be overjoyed to learn about the progress made on Mars rovers in the years since. Cosmos is absolutely wonderful in every sense and I’m sure it will continue to inspire curiosity in scientific endeavors and an appreciation for our place in the universe for many future generations of readers.

512,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71488312-jakob-mills,5,"Personal ReviewI thought that this was a very good book. It was very informative. The author talked about astronomy through history and many of the big discoveries and how they changed through the years. The author made learning very fun for the common person. I thought that every chapter had something unique to offer and learn about.SummaryAt the beginning of each chapter the author starts it off with a historical quote dealing with that specific chapter. There is an introduction that gives an overview of the entire book and a very philosophical perspective on the subject. The author talks about some of the theories we have today and how they were influenced by discoveries thousands of years ago. He also explains the culture and government of the people that made these great discoveries. After this, the author shifts to talking about some of the modern day adventures of human space craft and how we are soon to visit other worlds. He talks about how science is sort of a religion and how it has changed the way the human race has thought over our thousands of years as a species. The author sort of goes back and forth to ancient and common times throughout the rest of the book.RecommendationI think that any scientist or anybody interested in physics would love this book. Just the fact that it is written by one of the most famous scientists of our time, Carl Sagan, is very appealing in itself. I also think that a high school physics student would be very well off if they read this book. The author does a very good job of explaining many very complex principles at the most elementary level possible."

It should be free!I think we would have an even greater appreciation of science in society if this were more widely read. It's a fascinating look at the history of science and the development of ideas. What's more, Carl Sagan is a beautiful person, and it's very intimate to hear his childhood outlook and what sparked his curiosity. The speculations of how past events have turned out can be disheartening. Dr. Sagan defends the complexities of whale communication; how they can communicate thousands of kilometers apart, essentially having evolved a natural telephone system they've relied upon for centuries. He laments the disruptions human navies have caused by our wanton use of sonar and radio communications to the extent that whales are limited to communication of a few kilometers. There is also the then unknown effects of climate change and the recognition of the small progress we've had today.I thought this book would be far outdated, but I now believe it is timeless. Also, if Levar Burton had read all my textbooks to me, I would've had multiple PhD's in science by now."

""On another planet, with a different sequence of random processes to make hereditary diversity and a different environment to select particular combinations of genes, the chances of finding beings who are physically very similar to us is, I believe, near zero. The chances of finding another form of intelligence is not. Their brains may well have evolved from the inside out. They may have switching elements analogous to our neurons. But the neurons may be very different; perhaps superconductors that work at very low temperatures rather than organic devices that work at room temperature, in which case their speed of thought will be 10*7 times faster than ours. Or perhaps the equivalent of neurons elsewhere would not be in direct physical contact but in radio communication so that a single intelligent being could be distributed among many different organisms, or even many different planets, each with a part of the intelligence of the whole, each contributing by radio to an intelligence much greater than itself"" "
515,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31194984-virag-padalkar,5,"What a fascinating book! And so eloquently written. Carl Sagan has a knack for evoking the sense of a higher purpose without invoking gods and superstitions. From the birth of the cosmos to the tragedy of the Ionian civilization to the destruction of the library at Alexandria to today; He manages to place in front of us our own checkered past and at the same time manages to place in front of us our glorious achievements. Take for example this extract from the climactic chapter of this book - ""The choice is stark and ironic. The same rocket boosters used to launch probes to the planets are poised to send nuclear warheads to the nations. The radioactive power sources on Viking and Voyager derive from the same technology that makes nuclear weapons.""The book ends with a reminder that we have a greater responsibility and a higher loyalty (pun unintended) - ""Our obligation to survive is owed not just to ourselves but also to that Cosmos, ancient and vast, from which we spring.""Wow. "
516,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2346033-alex,4,"Quasars. Globular clusters. Black holes. Welcome to the cosmos. I love science even though I find it difficult to discuss and often hard to follow. Sagan does his best to make the planets and movements of our solar system and the universe at large comprehensible and reminds us that we are made of star stuff. He fills our minds with wonder while soaring across the history of stellar human achievement and knowledge. The journey goes from vast expanse of space to our own planet and the miracle of human reproduction, with the end result being a greater appreciation for the world that surrounds us and the struggles we've had just to learn what we know now. Sagan's call to action at the end of the book is as pertinent now as it was in the 1970s: we need to learn to come together and to take care of our planet - because if we don't, who will speak for Earth? In the anti-factual era we find ourselves in, Sagan's voice is dearly missed, but his ideas survive to keep the light of hope and truth alive. "
517,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47729884-alexandra-bazhenova-sorokina,5,"One of the most poetic non-fiction books I’ve read and a manifesto at the same time. It’s curious how Sagan actually tells the story of cosmos as the history of the Earth, of astronomy and of space exploration in order to prove the same point that post-modernist philosophers such as Derrida are trying to make: that of decentralization and deconstruction of authority as a bearer of truth. I’ve always known it, but never understood so vividly that the human knowledge makes it clearer each century - we are not the center of the universe. Such a simple statement, bringing the human race to the next step of development after our narcissistic “terrible three”, and it is definitely not clear yet to most of the world leaders. Apart from this political side, it is just incredibly beautiful, albeit a bit too candid at times, Sagan creating an idea of our galaxy as a home and of the universe as an ocean to explore, not to be afraid of. Although we’ve come to know a lot more about space since 1980, the book seems to have aged really well."
518,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4372320-matija,5,"A poignant book with unparalleled breadth of perspective. Countless other reviews already describe it in detail and extoll its virtues, but Cosmos surpassed any expectations I might have had based on high praise lavished on it here and elsewhere. Its masterful synthesis of the history of science and the human race, of cosmos and life on Earth and maybe elsewhere with more recent achievements and insights of our infant species and further with projections into possible futures, grim or splendid as they may be, will stay with me forever. Its admonition against the perils of war made ever more devastating by our growing technical prowess and its voice replete with awe beckoning us to direct our enterprise toward the exploration of our home universe and the stars so that we may survive the adolescence of our species is as relevant now as it was when Sagan first wrote it. Everyone should read this book, period. Put it on your list, make sure you get to it. Put it in your library for your kids to find one day. Now."
519,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26955278-chrysten-lofton,4," 4.0 ⭐ “If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.”   I am young in the act and identity of reading. Even being this young, I’m sure it’s the most important thing of all time, the most important thing I’ve ever done to and for myself, and I’m sure it has more consequence on me than any other experience, person, or event. I am troubled by all the books I’ve yet to read, and I hurry through them as fast as my brain will allow (not very fast, I’m sad to say, but I do try). I'm choosy with nonfiction. I try for things that have made a cultural impact, things I hope will impact me. Cosmos is on a lot of lists like, “Books Everybody Should Read At Least Once”, and “Books To Read Before You Die”, but that’s not why I picked it. I just dig cosmology. I don’t find the subject itself very accessible, I struggle to wrap my head around the seemingly-abstract ideas that might make sense mathematically, but come out as gibberish to me. It’s just that when one of those ideas finally does stick, I see the truth of the subject. Cosmology is one of the few things humanity pursues that admits size. I continuously study history & religion, and everything seems to always be reducing, and compartmentalizing, and shrinking the sum of the world. Cosmology just unleashes that motherfucker inside of your head, and makes no apologies for it. Why should it? Cosmology and its experts didn’t make the universe, after all. They’re just pointing it out. Due to my intellectual limitations, I really need for books like this to be accessible (I’ve been reading A Brief History of Time little by little for months because it takes me so long to understand the concept before I can move on). Cosmos is accessible, but there’s something so cool and so special about it.  Sagan translated the unapologetic size, order, and chaos of his subject, and spun it into poetry. Delicate, human poetry. Sagan, in the space of a few words, takes all that bigness, loneliness, chaos, and even the frustration of not understanding, and points to our ultimate inclusion in all things. As I read Cosmos, I realized I was reading a love letter. If someone must succumb to the vast size of things, how endearing to be led there by a poet. Someone who sees it all, and is truly in love.  I was reminded of Stephen King’s On Writing. King and Sagan sound similar to me because of the love and authority from which they speak. They also have a love for books and education that they speak on seductively. If you think reading is a bore, or don’t think it’s important, just let Stephen or Carl take you to church for a minute. Carl: “Books permit us to voyage through time, to tap the wisdom of our ancestors. The library connects us with the insight and knowledge, painfully extracted from Nature, of the greatest minds that ever were, with the best teachers, drawn from the entire planet and from all our history, to instruct us without tiring, and to inspire us to make our own contribution to the collective knowledge of the human species. I think the health of our civilization, the depth of our awareness about the underpinnings of our culture and our concern for the future can all be tested by how well we support our libraries.” Stephen: “He sat there studiously bent over his work (Bill saw him), which lay in a slant of crisp white winterlight, his face sober and absorbed, knowing that to be a librarian was to come as close as any human being can to sitting in the peak-seat of eternity’s engine.” ( - IT ) And again, in regard to the act of reading words and receiving an image, “ This is what were look­ing at, and we all see it. I didn’t tell you. You didn’t ask me. I never opened my mouth and you never opened yours. We’re not even in the same year together, let alone the same room . . . except we are together. We’re close. We’re having a meeting of the minds.” (- On Writing)  Cosmos, in the same spirit of love, also convicts. There’s a lot our species needs to hold itself accountable for, and it can. In a world where deflecting responsibility or delaying urgent change is common, Cosmos tells hard truths. We can, we just don’t—and why is that? And are we open to self-correction? How long do we want to debate it?  My husband gave a five start review to Stephen King’s On Writing, and he’s not a writer. You don’t have to be into cosmology to love Cosmos. There’s just something all too relatable and beautiful when people speak and you just know, by their spirit and the way they articulate, that they’ve stumbled on to something they can’t keep to themselves. It’s undeniable poetry, and it always leaves me a little dizzy and bubbling over inside my heart. It’s a reverent thing to me. Sagan does this using history, science, humor, and love. And since his subject is life, and all its extensions, your inclusion is inevitable. If you add Cosmos to your library, you’ll catch some of that love yourself. The book deems itself a personal journey, and while that journey was Sagan’s, you may find yourself on your own personal voyage as well. And if that’s not reverent, I don’t know what is. I also watched and enjoyed the 2014 documentary tribute to this book, Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, and this series deserves praise all across the board, but especially for it’s cosmic calendar break down of the history of planet Earth. And, if you don’t listen to the audio version of Cosmos narrated by the iconic LeVar Burton, you do yourself a disservice."
520,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/572656-john-porter,5,"So, look. When I express my real love and admiration for this book, I’ve had people say to me “Well, you know, the book is out of date.” These people could not have gotten the theme of the book more wrong. (The statement is often accompanied with a condescending chuckle, which doesn’t help things.) Cosmos is about the beauty of science, the opening of our minds to the marvels and glories of the World and Universe around us. It is book that is in every way about the beauty of exploration and the joy and wonder of that journey. And since it’s a journey, to say that some areas of science have moved on from what is discussed/described in the book completely misses the point. Cosmos is about the journey; Sagan is an explorer. Nobody would be happier to find new inroads and ideas in the scientific world than Carl Sagan. Read the book to learn about appreciating the voyage that scientific study takes us on."

It's easy to follow and doesn't expect any prior knowledge of the subject, but it doesn't talk down or condescend to the reader and is confident enough to tackle difficult subjects.It also has a good mix of scepticism and speculation, it avoids entering into psuedo-science or conspiracy theory territory while still giving a fair hearing to concepts like time travel and aliens that any kid reading the book would be mesmerised by.Maybe if I'd read this back when it was bought for me I would have been inspired to do something useful with my life instead of just reading books, but alas."

A must read if you're curious about Life, Universe and Everything!, its cult classic status is no surprise at all. Gives many topics a whole new perspective. And the topics range from history and science to religion and philosophy. In essence - The Cosmos!Reading this book made me once again ponder about many of the unanswered questions I had as a child. Also provides multiple possible answers for those questions. Carl Sagan succeeds in making one think of all the trifles of everyday life (that we put on a pedestal) as silly. Cosmos has definitely had a noticeable impact at least on this little mind of mine."
523,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102746429-vyacheslav-shen,4,"The awesome book and brilliant propaganda of science. It gives so many ideas, opinions, points of view to think about such as extraterrestrial life, the history of science and so on. Also, this book is so informative because the content covers all existing sciences and even pseudoscience such as astrology. What I liked the most were three things. First, I have learned about the history of astronomy and human development in general; the book gave me a great opportunity to get to know the greatest human-beings who contributed to human progress. Second, it is a beautiful book. Carl Sagan described human discoveries especially in cosmology very well; reading this book was like watching a documentary with all these beautiful pictures of the cosmos. Thirdly, in the end, the author discusses who we (humanity) are and what was our past and what will be our future; Telling what conclusion he made would be a spoiler but I think everyone who is interested in the science should read the last chapter.However, I gave only 4 stars because almost all the materials were familiar to me from the documentaries I watched in National Geographic/ Discovery. So for me, it was like watching a similar documentary. My recommendation is to suggest this book to school students who are just starting their journey in the academics. "

I cried multiple times, laughed multiple times and thought a whole fucking heap about life, the universe and everything. It was a beautiful and incredibly relevant book—a huge credit to Carl Sagan seeing as it was first pubbed in the eighties. It made me happy and optimistic to be alive and a million other things. I'd recommend it to anyone and it's the best male-written book I’ve read this year.  Space people, get around it."
525,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29311506-murilo-monteiro,5,"This book is brilliant. The book covers so many topics and is easy to follow through. From natural selection to black holes, European exploration, ancient civilizations, extraterrestrial life, chemistry, philosophy, linguistics, mercantilism, physics...the list goes on. But, first, this book is about human curiosity and how it can take us far. How a specie born around a peripheral star within a random galaxy called Milky Way and, not even being the physically strongest within your own planet, managed to conquer, to know and build so many things? And how life is possible? Is carbon-based the only way life can exist? There is so much more to question, though.Sagan is a dreamer and a man ahead of his time. And you can easily feel it through his writing. Definitely, one of those people I'd love to spend an afternoon by the sea talking about anything that comes to our minds.(The book is a bit outdated since many discoveries have been made, but still worth.)"
526,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27777097-thomas-jacob-jr,5,"There seem to be several reasons why Cosmos remains a classic so many years after its publication. Carl Sagan is a science educator without peer, and his voice lends a sense of both wonder and gravity this book. He incorporates history, philosophy, astrophysics, mathematics, and even ethics and politics in a way that never seems overbearing or obtuse -- instead, these disparate threads are woven together into a grand narrative of mankind's obsession with the universe. Additionally, I listened to Cosmos in its brand new audiobook version, read dramatically by LeVar Burton. His style takes a bit of time to get used to -- he reads with such verve and passion that I'm sure many may find his performance too dramatic -- but a few chapters in I began to really enjoy his enthusiasm. The introductory bits are read by Neil DeGrasse Tyson and Seth MacFarlane, both of whom do an excellent job. "

If only everyone could read this book, imbibe what Carl wants to convey, human beings would understand a great deal about themselves and others. We will realize how ephemeral our existence is against the backdrop of cosmos and at the same time how precious the life is because of the small probability of the existence of beings like us. Looking from a cosmic perspective, like extra-terrestrials, we would realize how petty our problems are – our issues with another gender, race, religions, nationalities, people having different sets of philosophies and way of living. It will be clear to us how irresponsible our actions are towards the only planet we can call home right now. Reptilian nature of R-complex of our brains has been dominating the cerebral cortex – the seat of our humanity and this has made us the nuclear hostages of the 21st century. We are walking on a thin line, on one side lies self-destruction through nonsense fights amongst each other and another side has the opportunity to achieve the heights, even difficult to imagine, through thoughtful use of science and technology. Every step should be taken with utmost care.Marked by Carl Sagan’s ability to make things interesting to read and easy to absorb, this is a must read for anyone willing to listen to the melody of cosmos and find our place and reason to exist amongst the stars. "
528,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61802882-bj-rn,5,"Following the light of the sun, Carl Sagan leads us on a Voyage into the farthest expanse of the galaxy back to the smallest component of ourselves. Effortlessly to the beginning of everything into the future. Summarizing seamlessly how each generation sits like dwarfs on the shoulder of past giants reaching further than ever before. His book is awesome in the awe-inspiring way it used to mean. The way Sagan ties everything together in such simplicity leaves me with a feeling of pure joy. I don't think I can look at the night sky the same way after reading this book."
529,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64551352-daniel,4,"Though it shows its age in some specific respects, due to thirty years of scientific discovery since its publication (this book came before we understood the nature of quasars, before the confirmation of quarks and other elementary particles in the Standard Model, and before we realized we are situated in the Virgo Supercluster of galaxies, among other things), Cosmos still astonishes with its poignant blend of scientific inquiry and philosophical musing. If its only objective is to broaden one's perspective from one's immediate surroundings to the grandiosity of the cosmos itself, then it succeeds. It is an exploration of our history as always learning, curious creatures—our successes as well as our failures. Many pages are also devoted to imagining what possible future lays before us. Shall we learn to travel close to the speed of light, colonizing planets in systems light-years from our own? Or will we destroy ourselves first, as perhaps many other intelligent species have before us (this may be why the galaxy seems so... quiet), either with nuclear weapons (Sagan's key concern), or with the more timely spectre of climate change (something that this book slightly predates). In its final pages, Sagan pleas for peace. Humanity ought not destroy itself over ultimately petty differences, but rather share a common purpose as a species: to explore and learn as much as we can about our ancient and beautiful home, the cosmos. It's interesting reading such a thing in the era of Trump, where such unification of humanity seems impossible. But given enough time, and resisting the worst of our destructive and apathetic impulses, Sagan's plea seems possible. Having just finished the book, I'm left slightly more optimistic for our little species."

Or the swan....Well wasn't it a surprise that the very next day as I was reading this book, Sagan described this very same constellation among others in our galaxy...This book by Sagan is a wonderful look into our universe and into ourselves.... We are all made up of star dust... And what makes up stars more than the light that they gives off....I read somewhere that the western approach to Einstein's Theory of Relativity involves a observer and that which he is observing... And in between the two they are both separated by time...That the speed of light is 'relative' due to the distance that the observer is away from the light he is observing... Hence the relativity.... For instance the sun could've have blown up 8 minutes ago since it takes 8 minutes for the light from the sun to reach us... or... As i noticed lying under the stars last weekend that as soon as the sun comes up, the stars in the sky disappear.... The stars are still there but are hidden from the light emerging from the sun... It's all relative...The eastern approach however, is that to truly study the speed of light we must sit on the light... We must move with the light... This is where the observer and the observed become one... And when the two become one there is no time separating them... This is when we begin to move with light....If we are made up of stardust, why can we not emit light like the stars?Sagan writes, ""The Hindu religion is the only one of the world's great faiths dedicated to the idea that the Cosmos itself undergoes an immense, indeed an infinite, number of deaths and rebirths. it is the only religion in which the time scales correspond, no doubt by accident, to those of modern scientific cosmology.""This book is like a door that opens up the expanse of imagination... it's like finding our way outside a room...

545,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11060926-ding-ong,4,Great story telling. Some imagination required especially for those who are not in the field of physics and astronomy. Quite a good companion book to a Brief History of Time to reinforce the concepts and scale of the universe. 
546,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11131504-jim-joyce,5,Having watched the TV series and read the companion book in 1980 it is clear that not many advances have been made in space exploration 38 years. I listened to the new audio version and it is very well done. We are making bombers not advancing our scientific knowledge.
547,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20344784,5,"Like many other readers: No words can describe such a book. The one I do not want to be finished. How many stars can I give to such a book by Sagan the late? Not sure if I write a star cluster or more comparing to many professional and popular books I have read and reviewed. It is a 286 pages quote book. Professionally I can tell this is not a real popular science (yellow)book, nor professional. This a brilliant non- formula master piece, which Sagan wrote and promoted in his lectures and TV talks by heart in a professional scientific manner during the years."
548,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71455786-ebru,5,Hail the great Carl Sagan!This books is a gem and homage to science and scientific endeavour. I wonder what he would make of the current anti-intellectualism and reverence to backward beliefs but also the internet and the technological developments and advances. 
549,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19011157-martin-szabo,4,"A love letter to science. Very persuasive in sciency parts. However, he wasn't nearly as persuasive when he was in the humanities domain and ranting against religion. This book is good if you can filter out those parts."
550,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59657223-soumyajyoti-nandy,5,"One of the best books i have ever read. Wish i had read it earlier. Simple writing, plus so much information in a single book. The best part, it never felt too much, the delivery of information was perfect."
551,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9761569-mike,4,"I’d recommend watching the original series instead of reading the book. Sagan is poetic, the information is fascinating, but I didn’t find the book super engaging throughout. I’d recommend some Stephen Hawking or Neil de Grasse Tyson before this. Love Sagan, but this book was a bit of work to get through."
552,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116092820-meg-briers,4,"after spending the good part of two decades swearing I hate physics, I've read a surprising amount of physics recently and found it absolutely spellbinding....Sagan is a poet and a book writing genius. "

554,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10138496-g-han,5,"Every time I read a little of this book, I fell into a deep sleep while thinking about the stars."
555,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3067059-avdotja,4,A compelling read if a bit outdated.
556,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15311353-bunleng,0,"Cosmos covers a lot of fascinating things about the universe. Carl Sagan is a truly phenomenal scientist of the twentieth century. I feel so fortunate to know him in my life. He is a deep thinker with an amazing sense of language. However, compared Cosmos to The Pale Blue Dot, I'd probably say I like The Pale Blue Dot better. It's very informative and eloquent. "
557,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70070672-keith-wilson,5,Read a few times. Masterful.
558,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46654175-laura-trombley,5,"Read this. It is so much and it will blow your mind, but it needs to be blown. "
559,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7645507-jason-schneeberger,5,Just as legendary as I expected it to be!
560,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32546962-fernanda-bakker,5,Can I give this one 100 stars? Everyone should have the chance to appreciate this masterpiece. Amazing!
561,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2166236-vince-snow,4,"Very interesting. I liked the stuff on the ancient Greeks, I liked the stuff on the Cold War and the stuff on aliens. I wish he would’ve spent less time talking about how God is not real."
562,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37963904-kushagra-pandey,5,"In the universe of books, Cosmos (book) shines like a Quasar in a nearby galaxy."
563,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2182101-barb,5,"Carl Sagan was my hero when I was a teenager. This book had a huge influence on me then. I still think it is a great book. It presented some really interesting ideas but, wow, Sagan was very worried about nuclear weapons! I suppose we should all be worried about the ultimate fate of our world. I just don't see nuclear war as an absolute inevitability. Interesting though was the idea that as the population increases the scientific progress decreases. So, Sagan theorizes, if we don't do something about the world's rapidly increasing population we will never be able to explore the galaxy. A lot of interesting science in this book & maybe a bit too heavy on the politics for my tastes but a lot of food for thought for sure."
564,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58356674-jethorensin,5,"If you like keeping up with modern astronomical findings, you will most probably know a lot of the information contained in this book, which is to be expected if you take into account when it was written. There are still many general historic information and details and even inside information about NASA missions that will make the reading worthwhile, even for that category of readers. If not, then this is the ideal book to understand the concept of Cosmos and explore and realise a lot of things about the world we live in. I consider this book and the documentary a masterpiece of human evolution."
565,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21325157-jeena-papaadi,5,"What a brilliant book! Thank you, Carl Sagan."
566,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62635315-krk-the-unkillable,5,"Neil DeGrasse Tyson WISHES.Man, Carl Sagan was the bomb. Cosmos is an endlessly engaging beginner's guide to understanding the universe that's impossible to put down even if you've learned most of this stuff before. Sagan's writing is terrifically clear, evocative, and entertaining, and his wit, passion, and boundless optimism shines on every page. Reading this book is like getting an injection of unfiltered childlike wonder, and that's not the only way in which it's like heroin--just like any great first nod, it can easily develop into a much more elaborate, lifelong interest. Also, it makes staring at the night sky way more fun. I finished Cosmos more earnestly dazzled by how amazing both science and the universe are than I can remember being in years (at least while sober). This really is one of the absolute masterpieces of popular science nonfiction that ranks alongside the best of Hawking, Dawkins, Tyson, and Kaku. It may be nearly 40 years old, but as such things go, it's definitely more of a Zooey Deschanel than a Bam Margera. *Bill Nye intro voice* sCiEnCe RuLeS"

568,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27524357-benjamin,4,My first read of Carl Sagan. Found it quite readable and inspiring and still relevant today. 
569,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32345596-james,5,"Sagan impresses upon his readers the crushing weight of insignificance, yet in the same breath leaves us in awe of the triumphs and failures of the human enterprise."
