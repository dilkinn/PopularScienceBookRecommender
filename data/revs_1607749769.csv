1,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33447134-book-riot-community,0,"I love books that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike, and Rachel Ignotofsky’s Women in Science fits the bill perfectly. It’s an illustrated collection of short biographies on fifty female pioneers in the STEM field. The stories of these inspiring innovators are accompanied by stunning illustrations. This book is an absolute joy to read. Buy one for every girl and woman in your life!–Kate Scottfrom The Best Books We Read In July 2016: http://bookriot.com/2016/08/01/riot-r..."
2,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3268839-theresa-alan,5,"I bought this book for my niece’s sixth birthday and we read it together along with her mom. I loved the illustrations and learned a lot about women I’ve never even heard of, such as physicist Lise Meitner, who was driven out of Germany during WWII because she was Jewish—and was thus denied her half of the Nobel Prize for her findings in nuclear fusion. I also learned more about women I have heard of, such as Jane Goodall, Marie Curie, and Rachel Carson. The obstacles these women faced are appalling and makes their accomplishments even more impressive. I’m going to buy a copy for myself because this is the kind of book you can return to again and again. Many of the topics were over my niece’s head—frankly, some concepts neither my sister nor I fully understood—but the different brief bios of the women provide a wonderful jumping off point for discussion of science and the evolving role of women in history."

Buy a copy for your niece and your little brother and your obnoxious uncle who thinks he understands the world because he majored in history 40 years ago. Buy one for your local elementary school. Buy one for friends who haven't even had babies yet, because they're going to want their kids to have this."

I am so in love with this gorgeously packaged, inspirational little gem that I am going have to invest in a permanent copy for my bookshelf. This is a keeper!"
5,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7897151-amanda,4,"I found this quite readable for the way it was published, which necessarily throws a lot of information and names at you one after another. I learned quite a few scientific tidbits whilst reading about these noteworthy women. The infographics and illustrations were really wonderful. The information provided was a perfect blend of biography, fun facts and scientific explanations. I highly recommend this, especially as a gift for anyone interested in science, women, history, art and pretty books!"
6,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126933-lata,5,"Quirky, whimsical illustrations accompany 1-page biographies of each female scientist. Each woman profiled worked incredibly hard, and was subjected to all sorts of resistance since women were either believed to be unable to learn, or forbidden to learn, or had a variety of obstacles thrown in their way, both at school and at work. And yet the amazing things each of the featured women did, contributing equations, methodologies, techniques and approaches still in use, or that became critical stepping stones for other research and development. I loved this book, and was in awe of each scientist I read about. Coming from a STEM background, I firmly believe that it's important to give girls around the world education, opportunities and support so they can explore, discover, and create."

It's beautiful to look at, and the casual, peppy style just made me happy while reading it. The bios are short, but tantalizing. I want very badly to know more about some of these scientists.Even though I've read quite a few popular science books, I was only familiar with a handful of these 50 women (even enough to recognize names), which is a shame."

10,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1845210-pam,2,"This book irritated the heck out of me. I am a scientist and a children's book writer (and a woman). I was super excited to read it. But there were so many factual misrepresentations and errors in the introduction alone that I didn't know if I could trust anything in the book. It wasn't until I got to the profile of Lise Meitner that I wanted to throw the book across the room, though.First off, Meitner came from a well-educated, well-off family. Though it was, in general, less common for women to be college-educated at the time, I have never read anything that suggested she had a particularly hard time of it. She was also nearly immediately awarded a university appointment--and at one of the best research institutes in the world. She was a well-respected and active member of the German intellectual community, and her struggles within it had far more to do with her being Jewish than being a woman. In addition, and most important: Lise Meitner DID NOT DISCOVER FISSION. There are a million systemic reasons that women have not made the contributions to science that men have, but to take an invention/contribution and falsely attribute it to a woman, as this author seems to do a number of times, is not doing anyone any favors. In fact, Lise Meitner did make an important contribution to the history of Fission research. Otto Hahn discovered fission in their lab after Meitner was forced to flee Germany before WWII. He did not understand how his apparent results could be possible. Meitner and her nephew came up with a theoretical model for fission which explained his results. This was, I gather, how their research generally worked. Hahn did the experiments and Meitner explained them with models. In any case, I was so curious about where the author was getting her facts that I looked at the back of the book: no references. Looked on her website. Also nothing about Lise Meitner. I suspect that there are factual misrepresentations and errors about a lot of the people profiled in this book, I just don't happen to know as much about them. I get the point of a book like this, but I don't think misleading children with shoddy reporting and then covering up your sources is doing a good deed."
11,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu,4,"One of the drawbacks of listening to audiobooks is that you don't see the book. Had I seen this I would have realized it wasn't made for a nearly 50-year-old reader. This is, however, a solid primer designed for young readers. I figured it out when the narrator used ""poop"" when ""feces"" could have been used. Oh well, I still enjoyed the book and learned a little bit about a few of the lesser known women in the STEM fields. I bought my 10-year-old niece a book very much like this for Christmas. Instead of it focusing specifically on scientists, it was more about adventurous women in general, so it included Earhart and such. I hope she's read it and I hope it instills in her a drive to smash the glass ceiling just as this book strives to do."
12,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/732347-kelly,0,"I hate the description of this being ""charming"" because that's so diminutive, but this book is damn charming. The illustrations are excellent and the scientists that Ignotofsky highlights feature those whose names we know (like Marie Curie) and those who we don't. It's inclusive, and it's just the right amount of information written out to intrigue readers to want to know more. The design, which features short facts about the women featured, does a huge service so that it's not information overload. "
13,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18202588-anna,5,great book and a great gift suggestion to any girl/woman interested in or doing science! I love the illustration and all texts are as informed as needed for such a book... Totally suggested
14,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67560744-merewyn,5," :D Inspiring! Now I feel like I can take on the world after reading about all of these phenomenal extraordinary people who faced all manner of set backs and challenges in their lives! :) I would most DEFINITELY Recommend this to anyone who has young daughters, or just to anyone who wants to learn about women's contributions to science and the STEM fields as a whole! Most of these women I had Never heard of in my life! I didn't know that Jocelyn Bell Burnell discovered the pulsar, or that Vera Rubin discovered proof that dark matter exists! I didn't know that Rosalind Franklin discovered the DNA double-helix, or that Grace Hopper invented the first compiler and the first complex computer language COBOL. For any silly person who claims that civilization and all modern-day society was crafted by the work of men alone, I DARE you to read this book. But for me: I feel inspired to grab my binoculars and star-chart and start studying the sky! I feel inspired to go online and start learning to code! I feel inspired to learn more and expand my knowledge further than that which it is right now! :D  ;) Read the book! It'll give you a ""I-can-do-anything!""-kind of high XD Lol  But seriously :) if you need inspiration and feel stuck in a rut, then this is a book for you. People who faced all types of hard knocks in their lives and who kept right on trucking along and following their dream to the end... Reading about their lives and what they did to accomplish all that they had makes you want to go out there into the world and challenge dragons :)"
15,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2365252-eva,5,"This book is such a delight, well-researched but accessible, fun but encouraging and educational. It acknowledges in full how hard it was and still is for women to have the same access to education, funding and resources as men have but doesn't leave a bitter aftertaste and finishes with a positive outlook into the future. I really hope this book will find accompany whole new generations of girls in science, and that it will be soon translated into as many languages as possible. "
16,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32133867-amanda-dana,5,"I almost cried when I started to look through Women in Science. I wish someone had told me that it was okay to think that math was hard, but that I would get through it. That science was difficult at times, but since I loved it, I would be able to make it. It's hard not to get upset when so few women have pushed their way through a man's field. In this day and age, when girls have more access to tools that will help them get the help they need to go into a STEM profession, these women did it all on their own. The book is tight, sturdy, and chalk full of heroines of the STEM field. From current geniuses, to historical science mavericks, this book covers fifty female scientists that have shaped our world today. Women in Science is written and illustrated by the talented Rachel Ignotofsky. The colors are bright, the art is fantastic, and the information is inspiring for any geek girl looking to go into the science field. I couldn't recommend it enough.​***I received a review copy from Blogging for Books in exchange for an honest review***You can read more of my reviews at www.amandadana.com[image error]"

This book features 50 women who have made invaluable contributions to science - ranging from the ancient Hypatia of Alexandria, to Maryam Mirzakhani, a winner of the 2014 Fields Medal. I got to learn about the trailblazing work of a lot of women in STEM I didn't know of previously, thanks to the well written short biographies complemented by the excellent illustrations. Truly an inspiring read. In our society where gender stereotypes are still very prevalent, I wish all little science-curious girls could have access to a copy of this book, to know that if they want to do this stuff, they're not alone. https://xkcd.com/896/"

There is even a card box: 100 postcards of the illustrations of this book!I read most of the part yesterday and was happily surprised to know some of the women and getting introduced to many. I just was so sad that there are no Arab women in the list, and I know I met many friends and teachers who loved science; it's sad none of them made her mark yet or if she did she was unknown."

24,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/727334-amy,5,"This is such a fantastic book! Unique, interesting and perfectly put together! The book itself is literally a work of art. The illustrations are fantastic! This book features 50 amazing women from the world of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. It covers everything from ancient items to the present! I learned so much about trailblazing women - many of whom I had never heard of! I learned so much with this book! Each scientist gets a spread in the book - one full of detailed writing about their lives and work and one illustration (and some words). It's just packed full of information and wonderful illustrations! There are also really cool timelines, a glossary and a list of other women in science. I love that it really focuses on the fact that the next great scientist could be any of us! This is one that I loved and plan to share with my 11 year old. I think it's important for her to see how many cool things women have done ... and I suspect she'll find it to be lots of fun! I can't wait for Rachel Ignotofsky to write more great books like this!

But a lot of the women were unknown, their stories made fascinating reading.It's depressing to read how so many universities didn't admit women to their Masters programs or employ women in full-time positions. Also, most of the women scientists faced ridicule from their male peers & the scientific community at large. Yet they persisted and achieved great things.The book has some amazing illustrations & tidbits about each of the women. It would make a great gift for inspiring young girls who wish to take up science. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book; now I wish to read about each of the women featured in the book in even greater detail."

29,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4538194-alexandra,2,"cute little picture book showcasing women in the STEM fields (science, technology, engineering & math). the illustrations were plentiful and added a really nice touch to the descriptions.at times it sort of felt like the author was adding her own opinions instead of stating pure facts, saying things like so and so ""should have won the nobel prize"" or so and so was the smartest in her class of all boys. it's like we get it you're a feminist but tone it down a notch.it was nice learning a bit about many women i had never heard of before, and it definitely prompted further interest in their stories, however the overall feel of the book was very...try hard? i don't know how to explain it. for example, in the conclusion the author states, ""women make up half our population, and we simply cannot afford to ignore that brain power--the progress of humankind depends on our continual search for knowledge. the women in this book prove to the world that no matter your gender, your race or your background, anyone can achieve great things.""and it's like..yeah..i know. it's 2017. beat a dead horse why don't you. not a fan."
30,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67321332-maria,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed Women in Science, it's a light, charming and delightful read appropriate for all ages. "
31,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31439703-anne-marie,5,"What an amazing collection of pioneering female scientists! The author includes a wide breadth of scientists across time (although mainly focused in the 19th-21st centuries due to history and records) and disciplines. It just goes to show how little we are taught in school about who discovers the things we learn about. I would (and I suspect many girls and boys) have greatly benefitted from learning that women helped disprove physics laws, discovered the nerve growth factor, discovered the structure of penicillin and insulin, and so much more! Also - Watson and Crick (of DNA fame) did Rosalind Franklin dirty. My only wish is that future sequels (and I dearly hope there are future books in this series) include more female scientists outside of the USA. Other than some of the earlier scientists working primarily out of Europe most of the female scientists covered did their work in the USA (which I understand is in part of because of the author's nationality and the active work America does in the science fields). There are many amazing women doing research all over the world and I'm sure many of them are the firsts in their field/country as well!Overall, I recommend this to everyone regardless of gender - and especially to young ones interested in science (or, like me - adults interested in science or women kicking ass). I will definitely be re-reading this book in the future - and memorizing facts to whip out at parties!PS. The artwork was ADORABLE. I loved all the little details and the colour schemes so much. "
32,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57379876-amanda--a-scientist-reads,5,"I would guess guide to women in science is likely meant for girls ages 8 and up, but was an enjoyable read for this mid-30s woman as well. Learning more about the women in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) that came before me is a hobby, but this was done in a unique way that included women from around the world in a wide variety of fields. The illustrations are lovely, and each woman has a two page spread. One page is an illustration with additional bulleted style information, and a quote to take away, the other is similarly illustrated with the main focus being the story of her life. I personally really enjoyed the layout of the individual stories, and also liked that they showed that each woman had other things they were interested in, and in some cases multiple fields they excelled in. Some of the scientific terms might need to be defined for younger children, but there is a glossary in the back with many of the more unusual terms. I think this is actually a positive, however. As a child I hated being talked down to, and like that this is a starting point to learn the actual terms used by scientists. They aren't necessarily hard words, more that they likely haven't come across them in school yet. As a whole, this book is still largely accessible, but you might have to explain things like ""pulsar"" and ""crystallography"". It is US focused, so far as the discussion on how women in STEM related fields has changed through time, but would be an enjoyable read for any budding young scientists you know. "

I translated the main points of each woman's story and work, and then I'd read the whole thing while she admired the beautiful illustrations. Just perfect. We had some great conversations thanks to this book, about the women in it, the women in our lives and so on.I wish Ignotofsky would make a similar book about 50 women who shone in the field of culture and arts and music and literature. "
36,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2867944-mad-mags,4,"From Ada Lovelace to Wang Zhenyi: A Celebration of Women Scientists(Full disclosure: I received a free book for review through Blogging for Books.)It's made to believeWomen are the same as men; Are you not convinced Daughters can also be heroic?- Wang Zhenyi""Nothing says trouble like a woman in pants.""If there's a girl in your life who's into science - be it astronomy, psychology, or paleontology; even just a little! we're talking the teeniest, tiniest bit! - you need to introduce her to the work of Rachel Ignotofsky. A graphic artist/illustrator, Ignotofsky uses her art to ""make learning exciting."" Her first book, Women in Science: 50 Fearless Pioneers Who Changed the World, is a mashup of her many passions: art, history, science, and feminism - namely, celebrating the many contributions (many of them overlooked by and even erased from history) women have made to their respective scientific fields. The result is a smart, inspirational book that's both informative and lovely. Ada Lovelace. Elizabeth Blackwell. Marie Curie. Rachel Carson. Jane Goodall. Some of the women profiled here have managed, against all odds, to claim their rightful places as household names. But have you heard of Wang Zhenyi, 18th century astronomer, mathematician, and poet? How about Mamie Pipps Clark, a psychologist and civil rights activist who, along with her husband, conducted the infamous (and devastating) Doll Experiment, thus helping to end segregation in public schools? Or Jocelyn Bell Burnell, the Irish astrophysicist who discovered pulsars at the age of 24? As if these achievements aren't impressive enough on their own, consider that many of these women did so even when they were barred from higher education, prohibited from publishing papers, or even expected to obey their fathers and husbands, no matter the cost. (Prior to 1974, women couldn't apply for a line of credit; abortion was not legalized until 1973, and even today it can be difficult for low-income women to access; and marital rape wasn't recognized as a crime federally until 1993.) Of course, women of color face(d) even more barriers than their white counterparts: slavery, segregation, Jim Crow, and voter disenfranchisement, to name a few that are discussed here. Just as the fight for women's rights factors heavily into the histories included here, in her profiles of African-American scientists - Mamie Pipps Clark, Katherine Johnson, Jane Cooke Wright, Annie Easley, Patricia Bath, and Mae Jemison - abolition, civil rights, and anti-racism play a large role as well. In addition to being a computer programmer, mathematician, and honest-to-goodness rocket scientist, Annie Easley taught her fellow black Alabamians how to ace Jim Crow voting tests - and also tutored under-privileged city kids in her spare time. In 1992, Mae Jemison became the first African-American woman in space; she famously credits Star Trek's Lieutenant Uhura as a role model, thus illustrating the importance of representation in pop culture. (Enter: Women in Science! How meta!)While there's definitely an American bent to Women in Science, Ignotofsky includes women scientists from all over the world: Australia, Austria, China, Egypt, England, France, Germany, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Poland, Prague, and Russia. There's a fair amount of ethnic and racial diversity, which is awesome, and I also love that Jane Goodall, primatologist and animal rights activist, gets a nod. Each profile is short - just a single page opposite a page of artwork - yet Ignotofsky manages to pack a ton of information in there, including in cute little scribbles and doodles in the margins. The art is whimsical and rendered in rich, vibrant colors; it's so gorgeous I could all but eat it with my eyeballs. The sheer eye-catchiness makes this book great for kids, but adults are also sure to love it: it's astute, stirring, and all but guaranteed to hit you right in the feels. (Three words: Wang Zhenyi's poetry.) I'm really looking forward to her next book, a guided journal called I Love Science: A Journal for Self-Discovery and Big Ideas, due out in March 2017. Ignotofsky's artwork is perfectly suited for the journal format, and I've never heard of a journal quite like it. Probably these two together would make a really shiny gift for science-curious geek girls.http://www.easyvegan.info/2016/08/24/..."

The author also provided the charming and quaint illustrations featured on the cover and throughout the book. Fifty women of science are given a spotlight, and over a dozen more are also nicely acknowledged. This is a work of wonder, enlightening and inspiring to all ages and genres. Among the more well-known ladies are Marie Curie, Lillian Gilbreth, Alice Ball, Rachel Carson, Jane Goodall, and Hedy Lamarr. While best known as a Hollywood star, and often referred to as ""the most beautiful woman in the world"", Ms. Lamarr was also quite the inventor. Her creation, FHSS (frequency-hopping spread spectrum), was not only used by our military to control torpedoes and communications, it is also the basis for the technology used today with smartphones, GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth devices. Equally impressive and amazing are the endeavors and accomplishments of all the women of science. None of these ladies took no for an answer, they never gave up on what they believed, and the world will always be a better place for their magnificent efforts. Women and girls will be encouraged and motivated, and men and boys will be impressed and awed.

I also never buy books, but I bought this one! I knew it would be worth it, since my library doesn't have it and I would like to have some inspiration in my life. Complete with illustrations and details about the early life of these women in science and the universities they went to (Ivy Leagues and Stanford!!), this book is very educational and inspirational for anyone, especially impressionable young people like me. As you might know, I'm a female who will most likely go into a STEM field—definitely science or engineering. Naturally, I really wanted some role models and then I saw this book floating around the internet! So I had to read it. Even if you just look at what these women have accomplished in their lives, I'm amazed and impressed. I want to accomplish as much as they have. The author included information showing how these women had to work against sexism and for some, racism. It's powerful in this way. There is one thing that I must mention: Now I really want a book describing modern scientists and those who are changing the world today. Anyway, I really recommend checking out this book, even if you're not interested in science, specifically. I honestly wish I could be as smart as the women in this book and change the world (for good) as they have, socially and in science. "

The illustrations (and end papers!) are seriously gorgeous (my daughter has a Rosalind Franklin  t-shirt the writer/artist designed) and Ignotofsky gets props for making sure the scientists weren’t all white women. But the text is pretty dull, and sometimes not so coherent (I mean, some of the science is complicated as hell, and I'm sure I'd have a hard time distilling it too, but I'm not writing a book about amazing scientific breakthroughs, am I). I'm also giving side eye to the fact that there is a scientist born in the 1940s whose birthdate Ignotofsky doesn’t know so the book says ""194?"" and I’m all YOU COULDN’T EMAIL HER??? But dang. That art tho."

Reading this was an eye opener, being a woman in science myself I realized through this book that dealing with sexism in the laboratory or workplace is a colossal task and the fact that so many women have done it in the past only inspires us to try and do what they have. The book is not just about that, some quoted anecdotes and facts which have nothing to do with all the bias are purely inspirational. The illustrations are gorgeous, I particularly loved the colours. If I were a millionaire I would have given this book to every girl on this earth, probably to all the boys first! "
41,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14202818-natalie-carey,5,"I loved this and want my own copy pretty desperately. It's fantastic, and I'm glad it's geared toward a younger audience (though it's amazing for adults too, particularly those that maybe come from privilege and don't see any social hierarchical issues..?). The sad part is that I am a scientist, and had only heard of maybe a handful of the women in this book. Of course I knew about many and/or most of the breakthroughs made, but didn't recognize their names, because they're so often left out of, and forgotten by, history. This really re-inspires me to continue on in my career and always strive for more, to learn more, and pursue more. "

44,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51524202-clelixedda,5,"This book features 50 women scientists, most of them pioneers in their fields. These women have diverse backgrounds and ethnicities, but are united by their love for science and the difficulties they had to overcome to become successful (or even to just be able to do science). Every one of these women is introduced by a very short biography and the most important keywords for her research, as well as a list of her outstanding achievements (like being awarded a Nobel prize or becoming the first female professor at her university or in her field). I love this book! Although the texts are really rather short, I could learn something new about longtime heroes of mine (I did not know previously that Grace Hopper had been on David Letterman. Thank you for this glorious discovery :D), as well as get to know other inspiring scientists that I can't wait to discover more about! Also, it's just beautiful to look at, with gorgeous colors and illustrations. The language is quite simple, so I think even older children can enjoy it (if they do not understand every word, there is a helpful glossary at the end), but it is an inspiring read for adults as well."

And showcases them in a colorful, adorable way. I wish I had this book when I was younger, when science me didn't know who else to look up to. This book has POC scientists! Young scientists! Different kinds of scientists! Scientists of different body types! Yay!!!If you know any youngin who wants to pursue a career in science, GIVE THEM THIS LITTLE BOOK"

The illustrations and the way that this book is laid out is spectacular. Just enough information to be informative without too dense.

The curation of selected women in the book is also very good and the book os well researched. It is also not presented as dry facts.

The charming illustrations with bright colours on black background and the small quirky titbits of information on individual women make it very interesting and inspiring."

Ignotofsky manages to include a wide variety of women from a variety of times and places, all with different science backgrounds. Whether you're interested in reading about paleontologists or astrophysicists or inventors, you will find what you are looking for. The book also contains women of various fame, with some of them being commonly known and others being much less talked about. I have been especially interested in women in STEM recently and have done a fair bit of reading, and I still found myself reading about women I hadn't heard of. Any child or adult interested in the history of women in STEM will find this introductory book to be enjoyable and enlightening. A great place to start!"

This book spans from well-known female scientists like Marie Curie to lesser known female scientists like Marie Anning and Katherine Johnson. This books exposes children to female scientists who are often overlooked in history and science text books and will hopefully help them expand their ideas on what it means to be a scientist. These women brought a unique perspective to their work, and this book makes students more aware of that.I would use this book in a 7th grade classroom as a model text. Students could create a two-page spread like the ones seen in this book for their favorite historical figure/author. Students would have to incorporate some kind of illustration of the person into their work, and then write a short paper detailing their accomplishments and what makes them worth knowing about. This exercise would give students a chance to practice non-fiction informative writing."

We make up half the population and a woman can absolutely be the person to create a cure for cancer, or discover the next black hole, or a new species, or uncover an extinct species, be the first person on Mars, anything. These women show us that we can not be held back or limited by our circumstances. And that knowledge really is an incredibly powerful thing to always work to obtain. No matter the costs."
62,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53329-abby-johnson,4,"A diverse array of women scientists get brief bios here in a visually appealing (although the text is VERY small) book. Your standards are here (Marie Curie, Jane Goodall) as well as many lesser-known women who made significant achievements in science, despite systems set up to keep them from contributing. This is a great book to have in any library and would make a great gift for parents of girls interested in science. Pair it with picture book biographies for the kiddos to read (several of the women featured in this book have had great picture book bios written of them). "

The art is wonderful and suits each women and her achievements, it's really approachable for children who want to know more about women in different fields. The main thing I didn't appreciate is the lack of Arab women, and there's some Arab women and women of Arabic descent who contributed to science, It made me feel sad that 60% were from USA and 30% from Europe, and the remaining 10% didn't include any Arab women. Other than that, I really enjoyed reading it and knowing more about these women, that even though their fields aren't what I'm mainly interested in, I was proud of them."

65,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8848366-shannon,4,"Women in Science is a beautifully illustrated compilation of interesting women who helped change the face of science and technology. The women included range from ones we have heard of like Jane Goodall and Marie Curie to many I’d never heard of before like Hypatia who was an Egyptian mathematician, philosopher, and astronomer from about 370 CE. As a fully illustrated book, it is sure to catch the eye of curious children, but as the book is full of only small biographies on each woman, its use primary is a coffee table book. The illustrations are well done and unique to this illustrator. I would definitely recommend it for any young girl curious about STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). I received this book from Blogging for Books in exchange for an honest review.Check out my reviews on my blog!"
66,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241621-ruthann,5,"This beautiful picture book includes one-page bios and lovely illustrations of 50 female scientists, arranged chronologically in time. It would be a wonderful gift for young readers, but as an adult, I learn a lot from reading picture books like this! I felt the thrill of recognition of scientists that I admire and the buzz of curiosity when I encountered women who were new to me. And I could not stop myself from reading aloud fun facts or particularly fist-pump-inducing quotes to my husband, like this thought from Elizabeth Blackwell (1821-1910), the first woman to receive a medical degree and the founder of the Woman’s Medical College of the New York Infirmary, as well as the London School of Medicine for Women: “If the present arrangements of society will not admit of woman’s free development, then society must be remodelled.” BOOYAH."
67,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14072411-melissa,4,This is one of those books that should be on the shelves of every girls's library. Then they can learn about a few of the women of science who changed history and helped pave the way for the future generation of female scientists. The thing I really disliked though were the cartoonish illustrations they chose to go with. The illustrations seem to be more for younger kids while the writing is more for an older kid. It would be nice to see a book like this with actual pictures when possible and different illustrations.

72,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9352370-rayna,5,"Although both men and women have the same thirst for knowledge, women have not always been given the same opportunities to explore the answers.These 50 mini-biographies highlight some of the top female contributors to science, showcasing their work, discoveries, challenges & barriers, and life stories. The illustrations were very fun and colourful, and there were also some little facts alongside each biography, making this book very eye-catching and full of great information.These women's journeys are all unique and interesting, but there are many commonalities among their lives - both good and bad. They were all determined and intelligent women who had to overcome some ridiculous obstacles and criticisms just to make their important contributions to their fields. Basically all of these women were told they shouldn't be pursuing their STEM interests, even though that is what they were most passionate about. Their level of intelligence and new ways of thinking and discovering didn't matter simply because they were women. I'm very proud of just how wrong they proved those grumpy men to be.It blows my mind and makes me so angry that many of them had to carry out their work and research in basements, attics, and sheds - usually for no pay and no recognition. Imagine how much more advanced the scientific community would be if these brilliant minds had been encouraged to their full potential...Two of the 50 women that really caught my interest were Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin and Barbara McClintock, a cytogeneticist and astrophysicist, respectively. Cecilia was frowned up for being spirited and wearing pants, and her work wasn't believed for nearly 20 years. Barbara had original ideas when approaching astronomy and was told her discovery was impossible, even though it really wasn't.And these are just two examples of the many brilliant minds that were repeated told no, don't, can't, shouldn't, not now, not for you, not for women. It's a damn good thing they all chose to do it anyway. I really hope this book inspires young girls to pursue their dreams of studying within the many opportunities of STEM and offers validation that their ideas are all worth something."
73,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71023848-ana,2,"I so wish I liked this book, but I don't and here's why.What is the target audience here? It's too silly for an adult, but also too overwhelming for a child. It starts a topic and leaves it at that, as if it's written for a child's attention span, but then it talks about crystallography and spermatogenesis.Sources? There's an enormous list of sources on the author's website, but a lot of it is unattainable, so how am I supposed to know if a scientist from this book really was smarter than the boys in her class? If I'm reading a book supposedly about facts, and every now and then I think: ""Where the hell did the author get this information?"", it's not written very well.Which brings me to - misinformation. Some of the stuff written in the book is just straight up incorrect. Some stuff is partially correct, leaving out any bits that might lessen(?) someone's importance. And some stuff is still being debated in the science community. I'll pull an Ignotofsky here and say you just have to trust me on that one. I did my research, I swear.One of my biggest problems with this book is that I feel like it won't make a difference at all or it will make the wrong kind of difference. Most of us here would talk to our kids about Marie Curie and Hedy Lamarr even if this book didn't exist. My parents did that with me and I was convinced I could do anything before I could even pronounce ""patriarchy"". And I was convinced of it at no one's expense. The whole ""she was smarter than the boys"" and ""her father wanted her to marry and make babies"" business is uncomfortable to read. I feel like the girls that have fathers like this and would benefit from a little encouragement in the form of this book would probably never lay their hands on a book like this exactly because of the environment they're growing up in. All in all, this book would have fared better as a children's book. More beautiful and unique artwork, less text and fewer personal opinions of the author would have made it a gorgeous little book encouraging girls to be themselves without instilling in them this idea that men would try to force them to be housewives or that they would steal their lab results."
74,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1976637-jeff,4,"I heard Rachel Ignotofsky interviewed about her book on a science podcast and around the same time Lisa received is as a Christmas present so it was added to my TBR list. Rachel wrote and illustrated the book which is subtitled ""50 Fearless Pioneers Who Changed the World"". What a great idea this book is, and it should be sitting on a table in every science classroom to shed light on the forgotten women who contributed so much to science and society. Last year, another science podcast I listen to featured a ""forgotten superheroes of science"" in each episode where I became acquainted with a number of the women highlighted in the book. Unfortunately, a number of them were never known in the first place so it was nice to be introduced to them here. The women featured in the book range in history from Hypatia (350 CE - 415 CE) to Maryam Mirzakhani (1977 - 2017). Each two-page profile includes neat illustrations of the woman and a page describing their scientific contributions. In addition to the women featured there are thumbnails of fourteen other ""more women in science"", a neat illustrated glossary, a list of sources (films, websites, books), and an index. The writing overflows with science but it is written at a middle school-ish level (I think) and some of the more complex concepts are explained so the book never comes across as inaccessible. A common theme: women worked in substandard conditions when even allowed to do science at all, and their discoveries were regularly credited to men in order for the results to be published and reviewed. Many of the women in this book were forced to work on their own or risk their careers or even more for science (Hypatia was killed by religious zealots for her ""pagan"" scientific teaching) and many were recognized only posthumously. Highly recommended!"
75,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29648451-amanda-knox,3,"I want to begin by saying that my review may not be totally fair. This is a book intended for children (allegedly) and I am not a child, nor did I read it with one. That being said, I was really excited when the first line read, ""Nothing says trouble like a woman in pants"" (6). Yes! But as I went on, I found the stories challenging to read (SO many science words) and disjointed the way I had to flip-flop between story and glossary. I don't know how this will hold any child's attention. Also, a problem that I have with the larger effort of writing women into history is that we end up with slim volumes that barely scratch the surface of hundreds of women's lives. Ignotofsky falls into this trap by attempting to write one-page biographies of amazing women. Finally, she goes back and forth with feminist language. Sure, she opens up with that great pants line, but at one point she also writes, ""When her secondary school wouldn't let girls into the science lab, her parents threw a fit until she was allowed in the class"" (101). No! They did not ""throw a fit."" They fought an administration to win their daughter her right to science education, a fight the subject likely had to continue throughout her life. At that point, I stopped reading the book even with just a few biographies left. In short, if your child is particularly inquisitive and willing to use this book as a steppingstone toward other more detailed sources, by all means, start here. If they aren't, don't bother. "
76,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/309689-lara,3,"I love Rachel Ignotofsky's illustrations, and love the idea of this book, but a few things detracted from it for me. There are a number of annoying typos (for instance ""suggeragist"" instead of ""sufferagist""), which I was mostly able to gloss over, but her language at times seemed very much based in opinion and not fact, which seemed odd for a book about scientists. There's lots of diversity here, but also some conspicuous gaps, and I wondered why her profiles skip from antiquity straight to the late 1600s. And then in each mini-bio there are a number of random facts scattered around the edge of the page, and those really annoyed me because they so often either really intrigued me, only then there's no further information about them, or they just seemed...not totally related to the scientist herself and seemed too general. And I thought it was weird that if a scientist was married, her maiden name is just never even mentioned. Beautiful art, and a good selection of scientists, and I can see how this might be super inspiring for young girls wanting to go into science. As an adult, I guess I just hoped for more from it."
77,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4057501-karissa,5,"I got this book from a co-worker to read. This was a very well done book that has brief biographies of 50 women in science. It's put together very nicely and in a way that should be accessible to all ages. The majority of the book is comprised of two page spreads on different women who made significant contributions to science in some way. These sections are interspersed with small sections on stats about women in STEM careers and descriptions of different scientific equipmentI loved all the fun facts shown on the pages and I enjoyed the illustration style and how fun and colorful it was. My only small complaint is that I wish that instead of a characterized sketch there had been an actual photo of the woman in question included. I just feel like this would have showed the variety of types of women who work in science and emphasized the fact that it’s not how you look, it’s what you do that’s important.Overall I really enjoyed this! This would be a great read for anyone; especially good for girls and women who are interested in science. This is one of the best books I have seen about women in science. It does a great job of highlighting these women’s lives in a brief page space."
78,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876605-kam-yung-soh,4,"A fascinating book about fifty women who overcame various odds to make their mark in the scientific field. Nice illustrations of the women are featured which include little titbits that highlight particular points about the women's lives.Most people will have probably heard about some of the more prominent women featured here, like Marie Curie, Jane Goodall or Valentina Tereshkova. While the others are possibly less well known to the general public, they are equally noteworthy.A common theme that runs through the stories of the women are the obstacles put into their path: being denied an education, being treated as less intelligent then men or denied opportunities (much less equal opportunities to men). The women overcome them and their importance has become recognised (for some, after their deaths).Mainly aimed at younger readers (although the stories should also be eye-openers to adults), the stories show that you shouldn't judge the ability of a person based on their gender or their background."
79,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12612401-joanna,5,"A woman of science a day keeps the sexism away? I wish, but I have thoroughly enjoyed reading about one of these woman each day for a couple months. It’s very cool to learn more about household names (like Marie Curie) and also to hear for the first time about women I should definitely have known before now (like Gertrude Eliot). It is often both frustrating and empowering to hear these amazing women’s stories, and I just hope that as the years go by any attempt to revise this book would require volumes upon volumes of additions as women are finally treated as the equals they naturally are. I hope that not just a handful of these women become common faces in our history, but ALL of them become as easy to recall as they countless men who dominate our history classes, books, and collective minds. Thank you, Rachel Ignotofsky for introducing me and reintroducing me to all these wonderful women in a beautiful and easy to read way. I will gladly eat up any other similar books you decide to undertake. "
80,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/142980-rachel,4,"This is such a cute book of women scientists. It's not the kind of book I can sit down and read straight through, but I enjoyed picking it up and reading a short biography every now and then. The doodle portraits are eye-catching, and although there is some repetition of doodles, it helps unify the illustrations. I do lots of research for short biographies like these for work, and I know how much work it must have been to complie 50 of these. Ignotofsky found interesting details and quotes for each women--which must have been difficult sometimes, since not every scientist is going to have quotable material highlighted on a famous quote page somewhere! Another reviewer mentioned that there are some factual errors, which is sad, but I'll forgive it since I haven't researched any of these ladies personally. I loved the research, writing, and illustrations."

I loved how they mentioned a number of books written by these women it I think it would have been great if they included a page in the back with a list of the most popular books published by these women. In addition, I was really disappointed in the references page. I understand you did a lot of research but I don’t want to go to an entire other website to see what sources you use. I also feel like even though the second half of the book was very diverse, the first half seemed to be mostly about white American women which was a little frustrating because I know there were other discoveries outside of the US. Overall, I think it’s still an amazing resource to open up conversations about women in STEM. "

Ignotofsky writes about complex STEM concepts concisely and celebrates the women in this book along with future generations of girls. She never sugarcoats things--when women's accomplishments were misappropriated, unacknowledged, or stifled by racism and sexism, Ignotofsky calls it that plainly. This was a wonderful, inspiring book. It did make me cry, and frequently exclaim with admiration as I learned more about the women who built our modern sciences from scratch and those who still shape them today. I'll be buying this for my nieces immediately!"
83,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/706630-april-helms,3,"Mixed feelings on this one. I did like the individual stories, and the variety of different sciences represented. The illustrations are cute, too. However, I've never been a huge fan of the scattered text style, and that, plus the small font size, made this a bit challenging to read. The illustrations and brevity of the stories would suggest a book aimed at earlier grade school (2-4 grade), but the font size and the stories themselves suggest older grade school. Still, this is a good source book if you can get past the irritating format, and a good springboard for students looking for someone different to do a report on."

This is a gorgeous book, each page bright, colourful and richly illustrated. I spent more time studying the colour and illustrations than reading the text. This is a treat to read. I’d only heard of a few women of the fifty featured here so it was a pleasure to read about so many women who did amazing things and in some cases changed the world, not just for other women but for everyone. Brainy women are cool and sort of sexy. "

There are short one-page biographies highlighting the 50 ""Fearless Pioneers"" along with supplemental materials and a two-page listing of other women in science with one-sentence overviews on each. The bibliography in the back gives some great starting points for those who want to learn more. "
86,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73737978-elianarz,0,This book is about Women that did great things in science. All of these women studied math and science to do great things for the world. One woman I found interesting was Hypathia who was one of the first women to ever study math. She was born in Egypt a very long time ago. She was also one of the first woman teacher in Egypt. I like this book very much because every page is about a different woman who changed the world through science. This book is non-fiction.

There is a bit of overlap between this book and Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls, but I still highly recommend buying both.Currently my daughter is fascinated with Katia Krafft, a volcanologist and geologist, who died by molten lava. I adore that these stories are sparking curiosity and further research for my kiddo."
88,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2027269-the-reading-countess,4,"Written and illustrated by Rachel Ignotofsky, this book heralds science (and math, for that matter). Sure, there are only women scientists (and mathematicians) included, but the content for which they are to be lauded is the star-and rightly so. I know a boy science aficionado who won't mind in the least, and more importantly, probably won't even notice, that the pages are filled with females. The text is dense. The illustrations will keep readers' attention. And the glossary at the back of the book is engaging. I can't wait to book talk Women in Science!"

90,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46129565-lisa-berry-koeppen,5,This was an amazing book but also sad to read how much they were discriminated against. Speaks greatly to their remarkable spirit and work ethic. I do wish it was arranged differently so I was easier for me to use it in my class. Found my niece reading it while in the bathroom so it was an attention getter even for a 7 year old.
91,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50271305-marta,4,"4,5 *I already knew about some of these ladies and had read about others in similar books. However, it was still an interesting book, and I found it very detailed, while not getting overwhelming. But because it was purely science-focused, sometimes I found muself not as interested in it. Would still definitely recommend it tho!!"
92,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3939397-martina,4,"A delightful little read. This would be perfect for children who are already interested in science, but also those youngsters who need a little more motivation. The text is appropriate for that age bracket, albeit some facts are exaggerated or presented a bit simplistically. Nonetheless, that didn't diminish my enjoyment of the book. Plus, the illustrations are lovely."
93,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81934817-kelly,3,"This is a nice, interesting and informative book for boys and girls. Also a great book for middle school math and science teachers to keep in their classroom! I liked the way the author presented each woman. Two pages were dedicated to each scientist and those pages were illustrated and chock full of fun facts, a short bio, quotes, and information on their fields of study. These are truly remarkable women, and yes, fearless."
94,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62502311-freya-smeets,5,"A very humbling book. These women have achieved such great and wonderful things while battling a male-centred world. They have paved the way for female scientists of the present and future, and I feel very grateful for the opportunities their actions have given me.Also, the illustrations are lovely. "

If you want to find out more about awesome inspirational women, you have to check this out. This book is beautiful and well researched. Moreover, it is very easy to understand. It is very friendly and the lamguage used is accessible. If you want to see me get overly excited about this book, you need to check this video. Enjoy!"
96,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2159577-allison,3,"I liked it, didn't love it. Would keep a copy on my shelf to inspire my kids.I personally felt a little disconnected as someone who loves the arts, which feels like the opposite of STEM. Yes, girls and women, discover things, but make art too. :)"
97,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28255179-susan-morris,5,"What a cool book! I don’t understand all the science, but these women and the contributions they made to science - often against all the odds - are fascinating. I want to give this book to young girls I know. (Own)"
98,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22531703-jaci,5,"I have finished reading this book 4 months later.I know, it’s a lot of time. But I was reading this book little by little.In general, I’m really amazed with this book, not only because the graphics are beautiful, but also because the biographies were interesting.Every woman could do things that were impossible and forbidden to women.I’m majoring in Mathematics, so this book inspired me a lot.Now, people have an open mind, but the barrier for women in science still exists. Although, we’re not going to give up. Maybe some of us we will appear in “Women in science 2”. Nothing is impossible."
99,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10664859-annamae,4,"I enjoyed the adventure through this book, I learned so much about several women I was already familiar with there amazing accomplishments. Additionally I was introduced to several new individuals I was never even aware had made such huge contributions to their fields. A fantastic read to learn a bit more and compliment any science course. "
100,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9387838-natasha,5,"I literally had never heard of 90% of these women presented in the book. My education is not in the hard sciences, but still what a shame that we were not taught about these women in elementary school. We wouldn’t have a lot of things without them!"
101,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/547807-cara,3,"The font and pictures really took something away for me. Otherwise, it was a cool look at women who made a difference."

109,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33229287-catherine,5,This is a great book for all ages! Fun drawings and facts accompany a summary of each scientist’s life. I would love to see this book turned into a podcast.

113,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81820258-mariana-costa,4,"Really inspiring for girls and women. The kind of book we want to have in our bookshelves. The illustrations are quite enchanting. I'm just giving it 4 stars because, at least in the brazilian edition (by Blucher), the texts could have a better layout."
114,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,Exceptional book for a teen audience or anyone writing a report. I would love to read a book about the same women that includes much more detail.

116,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6574868-anniem,4,"Not the best as an audio, but still good. The format isn’t really designed to be an audio only format. The print version is laid out good and has great illustrations. "
117,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33520974-melissa,5,"I loved this book! I listened to it, but I wish I had the physical book as well. Each woman’s profile goes so quickly that it’s easy to lose track of names."
