1,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33447134-book-riot-community,0,"I love books that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike, and Rachel Ignotofsky’s Women in Science fits the bill perfectly. It’s an illustrated collection of short biographies on fifty female pioneers in the STEM field. The stories of these inspiring innovators are accompanied by stunning illustrations. This book is an absolute joy to read. Buy one for every girl and woman in your life!–Kate Scottfrom The Best Books We Read In July 2016: http://bookriot.com/2016/08/01/riot-r..."
2,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3268839-theresa-alan,5,"I bought this book for my niece’s sixth birthday and we read it together along with her mom. I loved the illustrations and learned a lot about women I’ve never even heard of, such as physicist Lise Meitner, who was driven out of Germany during WWII because she was Jewish—and was thus denied her half of the Nobel Prize for her findings in nuclear fusion. I also learned more about women I have heard of, such as Jane Goodall, Marie Curie, and Rachel Carson. The obstacles these women faced are appalling and makes their accomplishments even more impressive. I’m going to buy a copy for myself because this is the kind of book you can return to again and again. Many of the topics were over my niece’s head—frankly, some concepts neither my sister nor I fully understood—but the different brief bios of the women provide a wonderful jumping off point for discussion of science and the evolving role of women in history."

Buy a copy for your niece and your little brother and your obnoxious uncle who thinks he understands the world because he majored in history 40 years ago. Buy one for your local elementary school. Buy one for friends who haven't even had babies yet, because they're going to want their kids to have this."

I am so in love with this gorgeously packaged, inspirational little gem that I am going have to invest in a permanent copy for my bookshelf. This is a keeper!"
5,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7897151-amanda,4,"I found this quite readable for the way it was published, which necessarily throws a lot of information and names at you one after another. I learned quite a few scientific tidbits whilst reading about these noteworthy women. The infographics and illustrations were really wonderful. The information provided was a perfect blend of biography, fun facts and scientific explanations. I highly recommend this, especially as a gift for anyone interested in science, women, history, art and pretty books!"
6,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126933-lata,5,"Quirky, whimsical illustrations accompany 1-page biographies of each female scientist. Each woman profiled worked incredibly hard, and was subjected to all sorts of resistance since women were either believed to be unable to learn, or forbidden to learn, or had a variety of obstacles thrown in their way, both at school and at work. And yet the amazing things each of the featured women did, contributing equations, methodologies, techniques and approaches still in use, or that became critical stepping stones for other research and development. I loved this book, and was in awe of each scientist I read about. Coming from a STEM background, I firmly believe that it's important to give girls around the world education, opportunities and support so they can explore, discover, and create."

It's beautiful to look at, and the casual, peppy style just made me happy while reading it. The bios are short, but tantalizing. I want very badly to know more about some of these scientists.Even though I've read quite a few popular science books, I was only familiar with a handful of these 50 women (even enough to recognize names), which is a shame."

10,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1845210-pam,2,"This book irritated the heck out of me. I am a scientist and a children's book writer (and a woman). I was super excited to read it. But there were so many factual misrepresentations and errors in the introduction alone that I didn't know if I could trust anything in the book. It wasn't until I got to the profile of Lise Meitner that I wanted to throw the book across the room, though.First off, Meitner came from a well-educated, well-off family. Though it was, in general, less common for women to be college-educated at the time, I have never read anything that suggested she had a particularly hard time of it. She was also nearly immediately awarded a university appointment--and at one of the best research institutes in the world. She was a well-respected and active member of the German intellectual community, and her struggles within it had far more to do with her being Jewish than being a woman. In addition, and most important: Lise Meitner DID NOT DISCOVER FISSION. There are a million systemic reasons that women have not made the contributions to science that men have, but to take an invention/contribution and falsely attribute it to a woman, as this author seems to do a number of times, is not doing anyone any favors. In fact, Lise Meitner did make an important contribution to the history of Fission research. Otto Hahn discovered fission in their lab after Meitner was forced to flee Germany before WWII. He did not understand how his apparent results could be possible. Meitner and her nephew came up with a theoretical model for fission which explained his results. This was, I gather, how their research generally worked. Hahn did the experiments and Meitner explained them with models. In any case, I was so curious about where the author was getting her facts that I looked at the back of the book: no references. Looked on her website. Also nothing about Lise Meitner. I suspect that there are factual misrepresentations and errors about a lot of the people profiled in this book, I just don't happen to know as much about them. I get the point of a book like this, but I don't think misleading children with shoddy reporting and then covering up your sources is doing a good deed."
11,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu,4,"One of the drawbacks of listening to audiobooks is that you don't see the book. Had I seen this I would have realized it wasn't made for a nearly 50-year-old reader. This is, however, a solid primer designed for young readers. I figured it out when the narrator used ""poop"" when ""feces"" could have been used. Oh well, I still enjoyed the book and learned a little bit about a few of the lesser known women in the STEM fields. I bought my 10-year-old niece a book very much like this for Christmas. Instead of it focusing specifically on scientists, it was more about adventurous women in general, so it included Earhart and such. I hope she's read it and I hope it instills in her a drive to smash the glass ceiling just as this book strives to do."
12,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/732347-kelly,0,"I hate the description of this being ""charming"" because that's so diminutive, but this book is damn charming. The illustrations are excellent and the scientists that Ignotofsky highlights feature those whose names we know (like Marie Curie) and those who we don't. It's inclusive, and it's just the right amount of information written out to intrigue readers to want to know more. The design, which features short facts about the women featured, does a huge service so that it's not information overload. "
13,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18202588-anna,5,great book and a great gift suggestion to any girl/woman interested in or doing science! I love the illustration and all texts are as informed as needed for such a book... Totally suggested
14,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67560744-merewyn,5," :D Inspiring! Now I feel like I can take on the world after reading about all of these phenomenal extraordinary people who faced all manner of set backs and challenges in their lives! :) I would most DEFINITELY Recommend this to anyone who has young daughters, or just to anyone who wants to learn about women's contributions to science and the STEM fields as a whole! Most of these women I had Never heard of in my life! I didn't know that Jocelyn Bell Burnell discovered the pulsar, or that Vera Rubin discovered proof that dark matter exists! I didn't know that Rosalind Franklin discovered the DNA double-helix, or that Grace Hopper invented the first compiler and the first complex computer language COBOL. For any silly person who claims that civilization and all modern-day society was crafted by the work of men alone, I DARE you to read this book. But for me: I feel inspired to grab my binoculars and star-chart and start studying the sky! I feel inspired to go online and start learning to code! I feel inspired to learn more and expand my knowledge further than that which it is right now! :D  ;) Read the book! It'll give you a ""I-can-do-anything!""-kind of high XD Lol  But seriously :) if you need inspiration and feel stuck in a rut, then this is a book for you. People who faced all types of hard knocks in their lives and who kept right on trucking along and following their dream to the end... Reading about their lives and what they did to accomplish all that they had makes you want to go out there into the world and challenge dragons :)"
15,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2365252-eva,5,"This book is such a delight, well-researched but accessible, fun but encouraging and educational. It acknowledges in full how hard it was and still is for women to have the same access to education, funding and resources as men have but doesn't leave a bitter aftertaste and finishes with a positive outlook into the future. I really hope this book will find accompany whole new generations of girls in science, and that it will be soon translated into as many languages as possible. "
16,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32133867-amanda-dana,5,"I almost cried when I started to look through Women in Science. I wish someone had told me that it was okay to think that math was hard, but that I would get through it. That science was difficult at times, but since I loved it, I would be able to make it. It's hard not to get upset when so few women have pushed their way through a man's field. In this day and age, when girls have more access to tools that will help them get the help they need to go into a STEM profession, these women did it all on their own. The book is tight, sturdy, and chalk full of heroines of the STEM field. From current geniuses, to historical science mavericks, this book covers fifty female scientists that have shaped our world today. Women in Science is written and illustrated by the talented Rachel Ignotofsky. The colors are bright, the art is fantastic, and the information is inspiring for any geek girl looking to go into the science field. I couldn't recommend it enough.​***I received a review copy from Blogging for Books in exchange for an honest review***You can read more of my reviews at www.amandadana.com[image error]"

This book features 50 women who have made invaluable contributions to science - ranging from the ancient Hypatia of Alexandria, to Maryam Mirzakhani, a winner of the 2014 Fields Medal. I got to learn about the trailblazing work of a lot of women in STEM I didn't know of previously, thanks to the well written short biographies complemented by the excellent illustrations. Truly an inspiring read. In our society where gender stereotypes are still very prevalent, I wish all little science-curious girls could have access to a copy of this book, to know that if they want to do this stuff, they're not alone. https://xkcd.com/896/"

There is even a card box: 100 postcards of the illustrations of this book!I read most of the part yesterday and was happily surprised to know some of the women and getting introduced to many. I just was so sad that there are no Arab women in the list, and I know I met many friends and teachers who loved science; it's sad none of them made her mark yet or if she did she was unknown."

24,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/727334-amy,5,"This is such a fantastic book! Unique, interesting and perfectly put together! The book itself is literally a work of art. The illustrations are fantastic! This book features 50 amazing women from the world of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. It covers everything from ancient items to the present! I learned so much about trailblazing women - many of whom I had never heard of! I learned so much with this book! Each scientist gets a spread in the book - one full of detailed writing about their lives and work and one illustration (and some words). It's just packed full of information and wonderful illustrations! There are also really cool timelines, a glossary and a list of other women in science. I love that it really focuses on the fact that the next great scientist could be any of us! This is one that I loved and plan to share with my 11 year old. I think it's important for her to see how many cool things women have done ... and I suspect she'll find it to be lots of fun! I can't wait for Rachel Ignotofsky to write more great books like this!

But a lot of the women were unknown, their stories made fascinating reading.It's depressing to read how so many universities didn't admit women to their Masters programs or employ women in full-time positions. Also, most of the women scientists faced ridicule from their male peers & the scientific community at large. Yet they persisted and achieved great things.The book has some amazing illustrations & tidbits about each of the women. It would make a great gift for inspiring young girls who wish to take up science. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book; now I wish to read about each of the women featured in the book in even greater detail."

29,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4538194-alexandra,2,"cute little picture book showcasing women in the STEM fields (science, technology, engineering & math). the illustrations were plentiful and added a really nice touch to the descriptions.at times it sort of felt like the author was adding her own opinions instead of stating pure facts, saying things like so and so ""should have won the nobel prize"" or so and so was the smartest in her class of all boys. it's like we get it you're a feminist but tone it down a notch.it was nice learning a bit about many women i had never heard of before, and it definitely prompted further interest in their stories, however the overall feel of the book was very...try hard? i don't know how to explain it. for example, in the conclusion the author states, ""women make up half our population, and we simply cannot afford to ignore that brain power--the progress of humankind depends on our continual search for knowledge. the women in this book prove to the world that no matter your gender, your race or your background, anyone can achieve great things.""and it's like..yeah..i know. it's 2017. beat a dead horse why don't you. not a fan."
30,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67321332-maria,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed Women in Science, it's a light, charming and delightful read appropriate for all ages. "
31,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31439703-anne-marie,5,"What an amazing collection of pioneering female scientists! The author includes a wide breadth of scientists across time (although mainly focused in the 19th-21st centuries due to history and records) and disciplines. It just goes to show how little we are taught in school about who discovers the things we learn about. I would (and I suspect many girls and boys) have greatly benefitted from learning that women helped disprove physics laws, discovered the nerve growth factor, discovered the structure of penicillin and insulin, and so much more! Also - Watson and Crick (of DNA fame) did Rosalind Franklin dirty. My only wish is that future sequels (and I dearly hope there are future books in this series) include more female scientists outside of the USA. Other than some of the earlier scientists working primarily out of Europe most of the female scientists covered did their work in the USA (which I understand is in part of because of the author's nationality and the active work America does in the science fields). There are many amazing women doing research all over the world and I'm sure many of them are the firsts in their field/country as well!Overall, I recommend this to everyone regardless of gender - and especially to young ones interested in science (or, like me - adults interested in science or women kicking ass). I will definitely be re-reading this book in the future - and memorizing facts to whip out at parties!PS. The artwork was ADORABLE. I loved all the little details and the colour schemes so much. "
32,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57379876-amanda--a-scientist-reads,5,"I would guess guide to women in science is likely meant for girls ages 8 and up, but was an enjoyable read for this mid-30s woman as well. Learning more about the women in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) that came before me is a hobby, but this was done in a unique way that included women from around the world in a wide variety of fields. The illustrations are lovely, and each woman has a two page spread. One page is an illustration with additional bulleted style information, and a quote to take away, the other is similarly illustrated with the main focus being the story of her life. I personally really enjoyed the layout of the individual stories, and also liked that they showed that each woman had other things they were interested in, and in some cases multiple fields they excelled in. Some of the scientific terms might need to be defined for younger children, but there is a glossary in the back with many of the more unusual terms. I think this is actually a positive, however. As a child I hated being talked down to, and like that this is a starting point to learn the actual terms used by scientists. They aren't necessarily hard words, more that they likely haven't come across them in school yet. As a whole, this book is still largely accessible, but you might have to explain things like ""pulsar"" and ""crystallography"". It is US focused, so far as the discussion on how women in STEM related fields has changed through time, but would be an enjoyable read for any budding young scientists you know. "

I translated the main points of each woman's story and work, and then I'd read the whole thing while she admired the beautiful illustrations. Just perfect. We had some great conversations thanks to this book, about the women in it, the women in our lives and so on.I wish Ignotofsky would make a similar book about 50 women who shone in the field of culture and arts and music and literature. "
36,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2867944-mad-mags,4,"From Ada Lovelace to Wang Zhenyi: A Celebration of Women Scientists(Full disclosure: I received a free book for review through Blogging for Books.)It's made to believeWomen are the same as men; Are you not convinced Daughters can also be heroic?- Wang Zhenyi""Nothing says trouble like a woman in pants.""If there's a girl in your life who's into science - be it astronomy, psychology, or paleontology; even just a little! we're talking the teeniest, tiniest bit! - you need to introduce her to the work of Rachel Ignotofsky. A graphic artist/illustrator, Ignotofsky uses her art to ""make learning exciting."" Her first book, Women in Science: 50 Fearless Pioneers Who Changed the World, is a mashup of her many passions: art, history, science, and feminism - namely, celebrating the many contributions (many of them overlooked by and even erased from history) women have made to their respective scientific fields. The result is a smart, inspirational book that's both informative and lovely. Ada Lovelace. Elizabeth Blackwell. Marie Curie. Rachel Carson. Jane Goodall. Some of the women profiled here have managed, against all odds, to claim their rightful places as household names. But have you heard of Wang Zhenyi, 18th century astronomer, mathematician, and poet? How about Mamie Pipps Clark, a psychologist and civil rights activist who, along with her husband, conducted the infamous (and devastating) Doll Experiment, thus helping to end segregation in public schools? Or Jocelyn Bell Burnell, the Irish astrophysicist who discovered pulsars at the age of 24? As if these achievements aren't impressive enough on their own, consider that many of these women did so even when they were barred from higher education, prohibited from publishing papers, or even expected to obey their fathers and husbands, no matter the cost. (Prior to 1974, women couldn't apply for a line of credit; abortion was not legalized until 1973, and even today it can be difficult for low-income women to access; and marital rape wasn't recognized as a crime federally until 1993.) Of course, women of color face(d) even more barriers than their white counterparts: slavery, segregation, Jim Crow, and voter disenfranchisement, to name a few that are discussed here. Just as the fight for women's rights factors heavily into the histories included here, in her profiles of African-American scientists - Mamie Pipps Clark, Katherine Johnson, Jane Cooke Wright, Annie Easley, Patricia Bath, and Mae Jemison - abolition, civil rights, and anti-racism play a large role as well. In addition to being a computer programmer, mathematician, and honest-to-goodness rocket scientist, Annie Easley taught her fellow black Alabamians how to ace Jim Crow voting tests - and also tutored under-privileged city kids in her spare time. In 1992, Mae Jemison became the first African-American woman in space; she famously credits Star Trek's Lieutenant Uhura as a role model, thus illustrating the importance of representation in pop culture. (Enter: Women in Science! How meta!)While there's definitely an American bent to Women in Science, Ignotofsky includes women scientists from all over the world: Australia, Austria, China, Egypt, England, France, Germany, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Poland, Prague, and Russia. There's a fair amount of ethnic and racial diversity, which is awesome, and I also love that Jane Goodall, primatologist and animal rights activist, gets a nod. Each profile is short - just a single page opposite a page of artwork - yet Ignotofsky manages to pack a ton of information in there, including in cute little scribbles and doodles in the margins. The art is whimsical and rendered in rich, vibrant colors; it's so gorgeous I could all but eat it with my eyeballs. The sheer eye-catchiness makes this book great for kids, but adults are also sure to love it: it's astute, stirring, and all but guaranteed to hit you right in the feels. (Three words: Wang Zhenyi's poetry.) I'm really looking forward to her next book, a guided journal called I Love Science: A Journal for Self-Discovery and Big Ideas, due out in March 2017. Ignotofsky's artwork is perfectly suited for the journal format, and I've never heard of a journal quite like it. Probably these two together would make a really shiny gift for science-curious geek girls.http://www.easyvegan.info/2016/08/24/..."

The author also provided the charming and quaint illustrations featured on the cover and throughout the book. Fifty women of science are given a spotlight, and over a dozen more are also nicely acknowledged. This is a work of wonder, enlightening and inspiring to all ages and genres. Among the more well-known ladies are Marie Curie, Lillian Gilbreth, Alice Ball, Rachel Carson, Jane Goodall, and Hedy Lamarr. While best known as a Hollywood star, and often referred to as ""the most beautiful woman in the world"", Ms. Lamarr was also quite the inventor. Her creation, FHSS (frequency-hopping spread spectrum), was not only used by our military to control torpedoes and communications, it is also the basis for the technology used today with smartphones, GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth devices. Equally impressive and amazing are the endeavors and accomplishments of all the women of science. None of these ladies took no for an answer, they never gave up on what they believed, and the world will always be a better place for their magnificent efforts. Women and girls will be encouraged and motivated, and men and boys will be impressed and awed.

I also never buy books, but I bought this one! I knew it would be worth it, since my library doesn't have it and I would like to have some inspiration in my life. Complete with illustrations and details about the early life of these women in science and the universities they went to (Ivy Leagues and Stanford!!), this book is very educational and inspirational for anyone, especially impressionable young people like me. As you might know, I'm a female who will most likely go into a STEM field—definitely science or engineering. Naturally, I really wanted some role models and then I saw this book floating around the internet! So I had to read it. Even if you just look at what these women have accomplished in their lives, I'm amazed and impressed. I want to accomplish as much as they have. The author included information showing how these women had to work against sexism and for some, racism. It's powerful in this way. There is one thing that I must mention: Now I really want a book describing modern scientists and those who are changing the world today. Anyway, I really recommend checking out this book, even if you're not interested in science, specifically. I honestly wish I could be as smart as the women in this book and change the world (for good) as they have, socially and in science. "

This books exposes children to female scientists who are often overlooked in history and science text books and will hopefully help them expand their ideas on what it means to be a scientist. These women brought a unique perspective to their work, and this book makes students more aware of that.I would use this book in a 7th grade classroom as a model text. Students could create a two-page spread like the ones seen in this book for their favorite historical figure/author. Students would have to incorporate some kind of illustration of the person into their work, and then write a short paper detailing their accomplishments and what makes them worth knowing about. This exercise would give students a chance to practice non-fiction informative writing."

61,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31439703-anne-marie,5,"What an amazing collection of pioneering female scientists! The author includes a wide breadth of scientists across time (although mainly focused in the 19th-21st centuries due to history and records) and disciplines. It just goes to show how little we are taught in school about who discovers the things we learn about. I would (and I suspect many girls and boys) have greatly benefitted from learning that women helped disprove physics laws, discovered the nerve growth factor, discovered the structure of penicillin and insulin, and so much more! Also - Watson and Crick (of DNA fame) did Rosalind Franklin dirty. My only wish is that future sequels (and I dearly hope there are future books in this series) include more female scientists outside of the USA. Other than some of the earlier scientists working primarily out of Europe most of the female scientists covered did their work in the USA (which I understand is in part of because of the author's nationality and the active work America does in the science fields). There are many amazing women doing research all over the world and I'm sure many of them are the firsts in their field/country as well!Overall, I recommend this to everyone regardless of gender - and especially to young ones interested in science (or, like me - adults interested in science or women kicking ass). I will definitely be re-reading this book in the future - and memorizing facts to whip out at parties!PS. The artwork was ADORABLE. I loved all the little details and the colour schemes so much. "

Learning more about the women in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) that came before me is a hobby, but this was done in a unique way that included women from around the world in a wide variety of fields. The illustrations are lovely, and each woman has a two page spread. One page is an illustration with additional bulleted style information, and a quote to take away, the other is similarly illustrated with the main focus being the story of her life. I personally really enjoyed the layout of the individual stories, and also liked that they showed that each woman had other things they were interested in, and in some cases multiple fields they excelled in. Some of the scientific terms might need to be defined for younger children, but there is a glossary in the back with many of the more unusual terms. I think this is actually a positive, however. As a child I hated being talked down to, and like that this is a starting point to learn the actual terms used by scientists. They aren't necessarily hard words, more that they likely haven't come across them in school yet. As a whole, this book is still largely accessible, but you might have to explain things like ""pulsar"" and ""crystallography"". It is US focused, so far as the discussion on how women in STEM related fields has changed through time, but would be an enjoyable read for any budding young scientists you know. "

We had some great conversations thanks to this book, about the women in it, the women in our lives and so on.I wish Ignotofsky would make a similar book about 50 women who shone in the field of culture and arts and music and literature.

66,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2867944-mad-mags,4,"From Ada Lovelace to Wang Zhenyi: A Celebration of Women Scientists(Full disclosure: I received a free book for review through Blogging for Books.)It's made to believeWomen are the same as men; Are you not convinced Daughters can also be heroic?- Wang Zhenyi""Nothing says trouble like a woman in pants.""If there's a girl in your life who's into science - be it astronomy, psychology, or paleontology; even just a little! we're talking the teeniest, tiniest bit! - you need to introduce her to the work of Rachel Ignotofsky. A graphic artist/illustrator, Ignotofsky uses her art to ""make learning exciting."" Her first book, Women in Science: 50 Fearless Pioneers Who Changed the World, is a mashup of her many passions: art, history, science, and feminism - namely, celebrating the many contributions (many of them overlooked by and even erased from history) women have made to their respective scientific fields. The result is a smart, inspirational book that's both informative and lovely. Ada Lovelace. Elizabeth Blackwell. Marie Curie. Rachel Carson. Jane Goodall. Some of the women profiled here have managed, against all odds, to claim their rightful places as household names. But have you heard of Wang Zhenyi, 18th century astronomer, mathematician, and poet? How about Mamie Pipps Clark, a psychologist and civil rights activist who, along with her husband, conducted the infamous (and devastating) Doll Experiment, thus helping to end segregation in public schools? Or Jocelyn Bell Burnell, the Irish astrophysicist who discovered pulsars at the age of 24? As if these achievements aren't impressive enough on their own, consider that many of these women did so even when they were barred from higher education, prohibited from publishing papers, or even expected to obey their fathers and husbands, no matter the cost. (Prior to 1974, women couldn't apply for a line of credit; abortion was not legalized until 1973, and even today it can be difficult for low-income women to access; and marital rape wasn't recognized as a crime federally until 1993.) Of course, women of color face(d) even more barriers than their white counterparts: slavery, segregation, Jim Crow, and voter disenfranchisement, to name a few that are discussed here. Just as the fight for women's rights factors heavily into the histories included here, in her profiles of African-American scientists - Mamie Pipps Clark, Katherine Johnson, Jane Cooke Wright, Annie Easley, Patricia Bath, and Mae Jemison - abolition, civil rights, and anti-racism play a large role as well. In addition to being a computer programmer, mathematician, and honest-to-goodness rocket scientist, Annie Easley taught her fellow black Alabamians how to ace Jim Crow voting tests - and also tutored under-privileged city kids in her spare time. In 1992, Mae Jemison became the first African-American woman in space; she famously credits Star Trek's Lieutenant Uhura as a role model, thus illustrating the importance of representation in pop culture. (Enter: Women in Science! How meta!)While there's definitely an American bent to Women in Science, Ignotofsky includes women scientists from all over the world: Australia, Austria, China, Egypt, England, France, Germany, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Poland, Prague, and Russia. There's a fair amount of ethnic and racial diversity, which is awesome, and I also love that Jane Goodall, primatologist and animal rights activist, gets a nod. Each profile is short - just a single page opposite a page of artwork - yet Ignotofsky manages to pack a ton of information in there, including in cute little scribbles and doodles in the margins. The art is whimsical and rendered in rich, vibrant colors; it's so gorgeous I could all but eat it with my eyeballs. The sheer eye-catchiness makes this book great for kids, but adults are also sure to love it: it's astute, stirring, and all but guaranteed to hit you right in the feels. (Three words: Wang Zhenyi's poetry.) I'm really looking forward to her next book, a guided journal called I Love Science: A Journal for Self-Discovery and Big Ideas, due out in March 2017. Ignotofsky's artwork is perfectly suited for the journal format, and I've never heard of a journal quite like it. Probably these two together would make a really shiny gift for science-curious geek girls.http://www.easyvegan.info/2016/08/24/..."

The author also provided the charming and quaint illustrations featured on the cover and throughout the book. Fifty women of science are given a spotlight, and over a dozen more are also nicely acknowledged. This is a work of wonder, enlightening and inspiring to all ages and genres. Among the more well-known ladies are Marie Curie, Lillian Gilbreth, Alice Ball, Rachel Carson, Jane Goodall, and Hedy Lamarr. While best known as a Hollywood star, and often referred to as ""the most beautiful woman in the world"", Ms. Lamarr was also quite the inventor. Her creation, FHSS (frequency-hopping spread spectrum), was not only used by our military to control torpedoes and communications, it is also the basis for the technology used today with smartphones, GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth devices. Equally impressive and amazing are the endeavors and accomplishments of all the women of science. None of these ladies took no for an answer, they never gave up on what they believed, and the world will always be a better place for their magnificent efforts. Women and girls will be encouraged and motivated, and men and boys will be impressed and awed.

I also never buy books, but I bought this one! I knew it would be worth it, since my library doesn't have it and I would like to have some inspiration in my life. Complete with illustrations and details about the early life of these women in science and the universities they went to (Ivy Leagues and Stanford!!), this book is very educational and inspirational for anyone, especially impressionable young people like me. As you might know, I'm a female who will most likely go into a STEM field—definitely science or engineering. Naturally, I really wanted some role models and then I saw this book floating around the internet! So I had to read it. Even if you just look at what these women have accomplished in their lives, I'm amazed and impressed. I want to accomplish as much as they have. The author included information showing how these women had to work against sexism and for some, racism. It's powerful in this way. There is one thing that I must mention: Now I really want a book describing modern scientists and those who are changing the world today. Anyway, I really recommend checking out this book, even if you're not interested in science, specifically. I honestly wish I could be as smart as the women in this book and change the world (for good) as they have, socially and in science. "

The author includes a wide breadth of scientists across time (although mainly focused in the 19th-21st centuries due to history and records) and disciplines. It just goes to show how little we are taught in school about who discovers the things we learn about. I would (and I suspect many girls and boys) have greatly benefitted from learning that women helped disprove physics laws, discovered the nerve growth factor, discovered the structure of penicillin and insulin, and so much more! Also - Watson and Crick (of DNA fame) did Rosalind Franklin dirty. My only wish is that future sequels (and I dearly hope there are future books in this series) include more female scientists outside of the USA. Other than some of the earlier scientists working primarily out of Europe most of the female scientists covered did their work in the USA (which I understand is in part of because of the author's nationality and the active work America does in the science fields). There are many amazing women doing research all over the world and I'm sure many of them are the firsts in their field/country as well!Overall, I recommend this to everyone regardless of gender - and especially to young ones interested in science (or, like me - adults interested in science or women kicking ass).

A graphic artist/illustrator, Ignotofsky uses her art to ""make learning exciting."" Her first book, Women in Science: 50 Fearless Pioneers Who Changed the World, is a mashup of her many passions: art, history, science, and feminism - namely, celebrating the many contributions (many of them overlooked by and even erased from history) women have made to their respective scientific fields. The result is a smart, inspirational book that's both informative and lovely. Ada Lovelace. Elizabeth Blackwell. Marie Curie. Rachel Carson. Jane Goodall. Some of the women profiled here have managed, against all odds, to claim their rightful places as household names. But have you heard of Wang Zhenyi, 18th century astronomer, mathematician, and poet? How about Mamie Pipps Clark, a psychologist and civil rights activist who, along with her husband, conducted the infamous (and devastating) Doll Experiment, thus helping to end segregation in public schools? Or Jocelyn Bell Burnell, the Irish astrophysicist who discovered pulsars at the age of 24? As if these achievements aren't impressive enough on their own, consider that many of these women did so even when they were barred from higher education, prohibited from publishing papers, or even expected to obey their fathers and husbands, no matter the cost. (Prior to 1974, women couldn't apply for a line of credit; abortion was not legalized until 1973, and even today it can be difficult for low-income women to access; and marital rape wasn't recognized as a crime federally until 1993.) Of course, women of color face(d) even more barriers than their white counterparts: slavery, segregation, Jim Crow, and voter disenfranchisement, to name a few that are discussed here. Just as the fight for women's rights factors heavily into the histories included here, in her profiles of African-American scientists - Mamie Pipps Clark, Katherine Johnson, Jane Cooke Wright, Annie Easley, Patricia Bath, and Mae Jemison - abolition, civil rights, and anti-racism play a large role as well. In addition to being a computer programmer, mathematician, and honest-to-goodness rocket scientist, Annie Easley taught her fellow black Alabamians how to ace Jim Crow voting tests - and also tutored under-privileged city kids in her spare time. In 1992, Mae Jemison became the first African-American woman in space; she famously credits Star Trek's Lieutenant Uhura as a role model, thus illustrating the importance of representation in pop culture. (Enter: Women in Science! How meta!)While there's definitely an American bent to Women in Science, Ignotofsky includes women scientists from all over the world: Australia, Austria, China, Egypt, England, France, Germany, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Poland, Prague, and Russia. There's a fair amount of ethnic and racial diversity, which is awesome, and I also love that Jane Goodall, primatologist and animal rights activist, gets a nod. Each profile is short - just a single page opposite a page of artwork - yet Ignotofsky manages to pack a ton of information in there, including in cute little scribbles and doodles in the margins. The art is whimsical and rendered in rich, vibrant colors; it's so gorgeous I could all but eat it with my eyeballs. The sheer eye-catchiness makes this book great for kids, but adults are also sure to love it: it's astute, stirring, and all but guaranteed to hit you right in the feels. (Three words: Wang Zhenyi's poetry.) I'm really looking forward to her next book, a guided journal called I Love Science: A Journal for Self-Discovery and Big Ideas, due out in March 2017. Ignotofsky's artwork is perfectly suited for the journal format, and I've never heard of a journal quite like it. Probably these two together would make a really shiny gift for science-curious geek girls.http://www.easyvegan.info/2016/08/24/..."

The author also provided the charming and quaint illustrations featured on the cover and throughout the book. Fifty women of science are given a spotlight, and over a dozen more are also nicely acknowledged. This is a work of wonder, enlightening and inspiring to all ages and genres. Among the more well-known ladies are Marie Curie, Lillian Gilbreth, Alice Ball, Rachel Carson, Jane Goodall, and Hedy Lamarr. While best known as a Hollywood star, and often referred to as ""the most beautiful woman in the world"", Ms. Lamarr was also quite the inventor. Her creation, FHSS (frequency-hopping spread spectrum), was not only used by our military to control torpedoes and communications, it is also the basis for the technology used today with smartphones, GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth devices. Equally impressive and amazing are the endeavors and accomplishments of all the women of science. None of these ladies took no for an answer, they never gave up on what they believed, and the world will always be a better place for their magnificent efforts. Women and girls will be encouraged and motivated, and men and boys will be impressed and awed.

98,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47798396-kristen,5,"Overall, Women in Science a really cute book. Although aimed for younger girls, anyone can read it, regardless of age or gender. I also never buy books, but I bought this one! I knew it would be worth it, since my library doesn't have it and I would like to have some inspiration in my life. Complete with illustrations and details about the early life of these women in science and the universities they went to (Ivy Leagues and Stanford!!), this book is very educational and inspirational for anyone, especially impressionable young people like me. As you might know, I'm a female who will most likely go into a STEM field—definitely science or engineering. Naturally, I really wanted some role models and then I saw this book floating around the internet! So I had to read it. Even if you just look at what these women have accomplished in their lives, I'm amazed and impressed. I want to accomplish as much as they have. The author included information showing how these women had to work against sexism and for some, racism. It's powerful in this way. There is one thing that I must mention: Now I really want a book describing modern scientists and those who are changing the world today. Anyway, I really recommend checking out this book, even if you're not interested in science, specifically. I honestly wish I could be as smart as the women in this book and change the world (for good) as they have, socially and in science. "

The illustrations (and end papers!) are seriously gorgeous (my daughter has a Rosalind Franklin  t-shirt the writer/artist designed) and Ignotofsky gets props for making sure the scientists weren’t all white women. But the text is pretty dull, and sometimes not so coherent (I mean, some of the science is complicated as hell, and I'm sure I'd have a hard time distilling it too, but I'm not writing a book about amazing scientific breakthroughs, am I). I'm also giving side eye to the fact that there is a scientist born in the 1940s whose birthdate Ignotofsky doesn’t know so the book says ""194?"" and I’m all YOU COULDN’T EMAIL HER??? But dang. That art tho."

Reading this was an eye opener, being a woman in science myself I realized through this book that dealing with sexism in the laboratory or workplace is a colossal task and the fact that so many women have done it in the past only inspires us to try and do what they have. The book is not just about that, some quoted anecdotes and facts which have nothing to do with all the bias are purely inspirational. The illustrations are gorgeous, I particularly loved the colours. If I were a millionaire I would have given this book to every girl on this earth, probably to all the boys first! "

It's fantastic, and I'm glad it's geared toward a younger audience (though it's amazing for adults too, particularly those that maybe come from privilege and don't see any social hierarchical issues..?). The sad part is that I am a scientist, and had only heard of maybe a handful of the women in this book. Of course I knew about many and/or most of the breakthroughs made, but didn't recognize their names, because they're so often left out of, and forgotten by, history. This really re-inspires me to continue on in my career and always strive for more, to learn more, and pursue more. "

These women have diverse backgrounds and ethnicities, but are united by their love for science and the difficulties they had to overcome to become successful (or even to just be able to do science). Every one of these women is introduced by a very short biography and the most important keywords for her research, as well as a list of her outstanding achievements (like being awarded a Nobel prize or becoming the first female professor at her university or in her field). I love this book! Although the texts are really rather short, I could learn something new about longtime heroes of mine (I did not know previously that Grace Hopper had been on David Letterman. Thank you for this glorious discovery :D), as well as get to know other inspiring scientists that I can't wait to discover more about! Also, it's just beautiful to look at, with gorgeous colors and illustrations. The language is quite simple, so I think even older children can enjoy it (if they do not understand every word, there is a helpful glossary at the end), but it is an inspiring read for adults as well."

Whether you're interested in reading about paleontologists or astrophysicists or inventors, you will find what you are looking for. The book also contains women of various fame, with some of them being commonly known and others being much less talked about. I have been especially interested in women in STEM recently and have done a fair bit of reading, and I still found myself reading about women I hadn't heard of.

These women have diverse backgrounds and ethnicities, but are united by their love for science and the difficulties they had to overcome to become successful (or even to just be able to do science). Every one of these women is introduced by a very short biography and the most important keywords for her research, as well as a list of her outstanding achievements (like being awarded a Nobel prize or becoming the first female professor at her university or in her field). I love this book! Although the texts are really rather short, I could learn something new about longtime heroes of mine (I did not know previously that Grace Hopper had been on David Letterman. Thank you for this glorious discovery :D), as well as get to know other inspiring scientists that I can't wait to discover more about! Also, it's just beautiful to look at, with gorgeous colors and illustrations.

Whether you're interested in reading about paleontologists or astrophysicists or inventors, you will find what you are looking for. The book also contains women of various fame, with some of them being commonly known and others being much less talked about. I have been especially interested in women in STEM recently and have done a fair bit of reading, and I still found myself reading about women I hadn't heard of. Any child or adult interested in the history of women in STEM will find this introductory book to be enjoyable and enlightening. A great place to start!"

This book spans from well-known female scientists like Marie Curie to lesser known female scientists like Marie Anning and Katherine Johnson. This books exposes children to female scientists who are often overlooked in history and science text books and will hopefully help them expand their ideas on what it means to be a scientist. These women brought a unique perspective to their work, and this book makes students more aware of that.I would use this book in a 7th grade classroom as a model text. Students could create a two-page spread like the ones seen in this book for their favorite historical figure/author. Students would have to incorporate some kind of illustration of the person into their work, and then write a short paper detailing their accomplishments and what makes them worth knowing about. This exercise would give students a chance to practice non-fiction informative writing."

151,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31439703-anne-marie,5,"What an amazing collection of pioneering female scientists! The author includes a wide breadth of scientists across time (although mainly focused in the 19th-21st centuries due to history and records) and disciplines. It just goes to show how little we are taught in school about who discovers the things we learn about. I would (and I suspect many girls and boys) have greatly benefitted from learning that women helped disprove physics laws, discovered the nerve growth factor, discovered the structure of penicillin and insulin, and so much more! Also - Watson and Crick (of DNA fame) did Rosalind Franklin dirty. My only wish is that future sequels (and I dearly hope there are future books in this series) include more female scientists outside of the USA. Other than some of the earlier scientists working primarily out of Europe most of the female scientists covered did their work in the USA (which I understand is in part of because of the author's nationality and the active work America does in the science fields). There are many amazing women doing research all over the world and I'm sure many of them are the firsts in their field/country as well!Overall, I recommend this to everyone regardless of gender - and especially to young ones interested in science (or, like me - adults interested in science or women kicking ass). I will definitely be re-reading this book in the future - and memorizing facts to whip out at parties!PS. The artwork was ADORABLE. I loved all the little details and the colour schemes so much. "

Learning more about the women in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) that came before me is a hobby, but this was done in a unique way that included women from around the world in a wide variety of fields. The illustrations are lovely, and each woman has a two page spread. One page is an illustration with additional bulleted style information, and a quote to take away, the other is similarly illustrated with the main focus being the story of her life. I personally really enjoyed the layout of the individual stories, and also liked that they showed that each woman had other things they were interested in, and in some cases multiple fields they excelled in. Some of the scientific terms might need to be defined for younger children, but there is a glossary in the back with many of the more unusual terms. I think this is actually a positive, however. As a child I hated being talked down to, and like that this is a starting point to learn the actual terms used by scientists. They aren't necessarily hard words, more that they likely haven't come across them in school yet. As a whole, this book is still largely accessible, but you might have to explain things like ""pulsar"" and ""crystallography"". It is US focused, so far as the discussion on how women in STEM related fields has changed through time, but would be an enjoyable read for any budding young scientists you know. "

181,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31439703-anne-marie,5,"What an amazing collection of pioneering female scientists! The author includes a wide breadth of scientists across time (although mainly focused in the 19th-21st centuries due to history and records) and disciplines. It just goes to show how little we are taught in school about who discovers the things we learn about. I would (and I suspect many girls and boys) have greatly benefitted from learning that women helped disprove physics laws, discovered the nerve growth factor, discovered the structure of penicillin and insulin, and so much more! Also - Watson and Crick (of DNA fame) did Rosalind Franklin dirty. My only wish is that future sequels (and I dearly hope there are future books in this series) include more female scientists outside of the USA. Other than some of the earlier scientists working primarily out of Europe most of the female scientists covered did their work in the USA (which I understand is in part of because of the author's nationality and the active work America does in the science fields). There are many amazing women doing research all over the world and I'm sure many of them are the firsts in their field/country as well!Overall, I recommend this to everyone regardless of gender - and especially to young ones interested in science (or, like me - adults interested in science or women kicking ass). I will definitely be re-reading this book in the future - and memorizing facts to whip out at parties!PS. The artwork was ADORABLE. I loved all the little details and the colour schemes so much. "

Learning more about the women in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) that came before me is a hobby, but this was done in a unique way that included women from around the world in a wide variety of fields. The illustrations are lovely, and each woman has a two page spread. One page is an illustration with additional bulleted style information, and a quote to take away, the other is similarly illustrated with the main focus being the story of her life. I personally really enjoyed the layout of the individual stories, and also liked that they showed that each woman had other things they were interested in, and in some cases multiple fields they excelled in. Some of the scientific terms might need to be defined for younger children, but there is a glossary in the back with many of the more unusual terms. I think this is actually a positive, however. As a child I hated being talked down to, and like that this is a starting point to learn the actual terms used by scientists. They aren't necessarily hard words, more that they likely haven't come across them in school yet. As a whole, this book is still largely accessible, but you might have to explain things like ""pulsar"" and ""crystallography"". It is US focused, so far as the discussion on how women in STEM related fields has changed through time, but would be an enjoyable read for any budding young scientists you know. "

I translated the main points of each woman's story and work, and then I'd read the whole thing while she admired the beautiful illustrations. Just perfect. We had some great conversations thanks to this book, about the women in it, the women in our lives and so on.I wish Ignotofsky would make a similar book about 50 women who shone in the field of culture and arts and music and literature.

186,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2867944-mad-mags,4,"From Ada Lovelace to Wang Zhenyi: A Celebration of Women Scientists(Full disclosure: I received a free book for review through Blogging for Books.)It's made to believeWomen are the same as men; Are you not convinced Daughters can also be heroic?- Wang Zhenyi""Nothing says trouble like a woman in pants.""If there's a girl in your life who's into science - be it astronomy, psychology, or paleontology; even just a little! we're talking the teeniest, tiniest bit! - you need to introduce her to the work of Rachel Ignotofsky. A graphic artist/illustrator, Ignotofsky uses her art to ""make learning exciting."" Her first book, Women in Science: 50 Fearless Pioneers Who Changed the World, is a mashup of her many passions: art, history, science, and feminism - namely, celebrating the many contributions (many of them overlooked by and even erased from history) women have made to their respective scientific fields. The result is a smart, inspirational book that's both informative and lovely. Ada Lovelace. Elizabeth Blackwell. Marie Curie. Rachel Carson. Jane Goodall. Some of the women profiled here have managed, against all odds, to claim their rightful places as household names. But have you heard of Wang Zhenyi, 18th century astronomer, mathematician, and poet? How about Mamie Pipps Clark, a psychologist and civil rights activist who, along with her husband, conducted the infamous (and devastating) Doll Experiment, thus helping to end segregation in public schools? Or Jocelyn Bell Burnell, the Irish astrophysicist who discovered pulsars at the age of 24? As if these achievements aren't impressive enough on their own, consider that many of these women did so even when they were barred from higher education, prohibited from publishing papers, or even expected to obey their fathers and husbands, no matter the cost. (Prior to 1974, women couldn't apply for a line of credit; abortion was not legalized until 1973, and even today it can be difficult for low-income women to access; and marital rape wasn't recognized as a crime federally until 1993.) Of course, women of color face(d) even more barriers than their white counterparts: slavery, segregation, Jim Crow, and voter disenfranchisement, to name a few that are discussed here. Just as the fight for women's rights factors heavily into the histories included here, in her profiles of African-American scientists - Mamie Pipps Clark, Katherine Johnson, Jane Cooke Wright, Annie Easley, Patricia Bath, and Mae Jemison - abolition, civil rights, and anti-racism play a large role as well. In addition to being a computer programmer, mathematician, and honest-to-goodness rocket scientist, Annie Easley taught her fellow black Alabamians how to ace Jim Crow voting tests - and also tutored under-privileged city kids in her spare time. In 1992, Mae Jemison became the first African-American woman in space; she famously credits Star Trek's Lieutenant Uhura as a role model, thus illustrating the importance of representation in pop culture. (Enter: Women in Science! How meta!)While there's definitely an American bent to Women in Science, Ignotofsky includes women scientists from all over the world: Australia, Austria, China, Egypt, England, France, Germany, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Poland, Prague, and Russia. There's a fair amount of ethnic and racial diversity, which is awesome, and I also love that Jane Goodall, primatologist and animal rights activist, gets a nod. Each profile is short - just a single page opposite a page of artwork - yet Ignotofsky manages to pack a ton of information in there, including in cute little scribbles and doodles in the margins. The art is whimsical and rendered in rich, vibrant colors; it's so gorgeous I could all but eat it with my eyeballs. The sheer eye-catchiness makes this book great for kids, but adults are also sure to love it: it's astute, stirring, and all but guaranteed to hit you right in the feels. (Three words: Wang Zhenyi's poetry.) I'm really looking forward to her next book, a guided journal called I Love Science: A Journal for Self-Discovery and Big Ideas, due out in March 2017. Ignotofsky's artwork is perfectly suited for the journal format, and I've never heard of a journal quite like it. Probably these two together would make a really shiny gift for science-curious geek girls.http://www.easyvegan.info/2016/08/24/..."

The author also provided the charming and quaint illustrations featured on the cover and throughout the book. Fifty women of science are given a spotlight, and over a dozen more are also nicely acknowledged. This is a work of wonder, enlightening and inspiring to all ages and genres. Among the more well-known ladies are Marie Curie, Lillian Gilbreth, Alice Ball, Rachel Carson, Jane Goodall, and Hedy Lamarr. While best known as a Hollywood star, and often referred to as ""the most beautiful woman in the world"", Ms. Lamarr was also quite the inventor. Her creation, FHSS (frequency-hopping spread spectrum), was not only used by our military to control torpedoes and communications, it is also the basis for the technology used today with smartphones, GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth devices. Equally impressive and amazing are the endeavors and accomplishments of all the women of science. None of these ladies took no for an answer, they never gave up on what they believed, and the world will always be a better place for their magnificent efforts. Women and girls will be encouraged and motivated, and men and boys will be impressed and awed.

I also never buy books, but I bought this one! I knew it would be worth it, since my library doesn't have it and I would like to have some inspiration in my life. Complete with illustrations and details about the early life of these women in science and the universities they went to (Ivy Leagues and Stanford!!), this book is very educational and inspirational for anyone, especially impressionable young people like me. As you might know, I'm a female who will most likely go into a STEM field—definitely science or engineering. Naturally, I really wanted some role models and then I saw this book floating around the internet! So I had to read it. Even if you just look at what these women have accomplished in their lives, I'm amazed and impressed. I want to accomplish as much as they have. The author included information showing how these women had to work against sexism and for some, racism. It's powerful in this way. There is one thing that I must mention: Now I really want a book describing modern scientists and those who are changing the world today. Anyway, I really recommend checking out this book, even if you're not interested in science, specifically. I honestly wish I could be as smart as the women in this book and change the world (for good) as they have, socially and in science. "

The illustrations (and end papers!) are seriously gorgeous (my daughter has a Rosalind Franklin  t-shirt the writer/artist designed) and Ignotofsky gets props for making sure the scientists weren’t all white women. But the text is pretty dull, and sometimes not so coherent (I mean, some of the science is complicated as hell, and I'm sure I'd have a hard time distilling it too, but I'm not writing a book about amazing scientific breakthroughs, am I). I'm also giving side eye to the fact that there is a scientist born in the 1940s whose birthdate Ignotofsky doesn’t know so the book says ""194?"" and I’m all YOU COULDN’T EMAIL HER??? But dang. That art tho."

Reading this was an eye opener, being a woman in science myself I realized through this book that dealing with sexism in the laboratory or workplace is a colossal task and the fact that so many women have done it in the past only inspires us to try and do what they have. The book is not just about that, some quoted anecdotes and facts which have nothing to do with all the bias are purely inspirational. The illustrations are gorgeous, I particularly loved the colours. If I were a millionaire I would have given this book to every girl on this earth, probably to all the boys first! "

It's fantastic, and I'm glad it's geared toward a younger audience (though it's amazing for adults too, particularly those that maybe come from privilege and don't see any social hierarchical issues..?). The sad part is that I am a scientist, and had only heard of maybe a handful of the women in this book. Of course I knew about many and/or most of the breakthroughs made, but didn't recognize their names, because they're so often left out of, and forgotten by, history.

I would (and I suspect many girls and boys) have greatly benefitted from learning that women helped disprove physics laws, discovered the nerve growth factor, discovered the structure of penicillin and insulin, and so much more! Also - Watson and Crick (of DNA fame) did Rosalind Franklin dirty. My only wish is that future sequels (and I dearly hope there are future books in this series) include more female scientists outside of the USA. Other than some of the earlier scientists working primarily out of Europe most of the female scientists covered did their work in the USA (which I understand is in part of because of the author's nationality and the active work America does in the science fields).

The author also provided the charming and quaint illustrations featured on the cover and throughout the book. Fifty women of science are given a spotlight, and over a dozen more are also nicely acknowledged. This is a work of wonder, enlightening and inspiring to all ages and genres. Among the more well-known ladies are Marie Curie, Lillian Gilbreth, Alice Ball, Rachel Carson, Jane Goodall, and Hedy Lamarr. While best known as a Hollywood star, and often referred to as ""the most beautiful woman in the world"", Ms. Lamarr was also quite the inventor. Her creation, FHSS (frequency-hopping spread spectrum), was not only used by our military to control torpedoes and communications, it is also the basis for the technology used today with smartphones, GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth devices. Equally impressive and amazing are the endeavors and accomplishments of all the women of science. None of these ladies took no for an answer, they never gave up on what they believed, and the world will always be a better place for their magnificent efforts. Women and girls will be encouraged and motivated, and men and boys will be impressed and awed.

218,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47798396-kristen,5,"Overall, Women in Science a really cute book. Although aimed for younger girls, anyone can read it, regardless of age or gender. I also never buy books, but I bought this one! I knew it would be worth it, since my library doesn't have it and I would like to have some inspiration in my life. Complete with illustrations and details about the early life of these women in science and the universities they went to (Ivy Leagues and Stanford!!), this book is very educational and inspirational for anyone, especially impressionable young people like me. As you might know, I'm a female who will most likely go into a STEM field—definitely science or engineering. Naturally, I really wanted some role models and then I saw this book floating around the internet! So I had to read it. Even if you just look at what these women have accomplished in their lives, I'm amazed and impressed. I want to accomplish as much as they have. The author included information showing how these women had to work against sexism and for some, racism. It's powerful in this way. There is one thing that I must mention: Now I really want a book describing modern scientists and those who are changing the world today. Anyway, I really recommend checking out this book, even if you're not interested in science, specifically. I honestly wish I could be as smart as the women in this book and change the world (for good) as they have, socially and in science. "
219,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1249329-marjorie-ingall,4,"OMG SO PUUURRRRRTY. The illustrations (and end papers!) are seriously gorgeous (my daughter has a Rosalind Franklin  t-shirt the writer/artist designed) and Ignotofsky gets props for making sure the scientists weren’t all white women. But the text is pretty dull, and sometimes not so coherent (I mean, some of the science is complicated as hell, and I'm sure I'd have a hard time distilling it too, but I'm not writing a book about amazing scientific breakthroughs, am I). I'm also giving side eye to the fact that there is a scientist born in the 1940s whose birthdate Ignotofsky doesn’t know so the book says ""194?"" and I’m all YOU COULDN’T EMAIL HER??? But dang. That art tho."

Reading this was an eye opener, being a woman in science myself I realized through this book that dealing with sexism in the laboratory or workplace is a colossal task and the fact that so many women have done it in the past only inspires us to try and do what they have. The book is not just about that, some quoted anecdotes and facts which have nothing to do with all the bias are purely inspirational. The illustrations are gorgeous, I particularly loved the colours. If I were a millionaire I would have given this book to every girl on this earth, probably to all the boys first! "

It's fantastic, and I'm glad it's geared toward a younger audience (though it's amazing for adults too, particularly those that maybe come from privilege and don't see any social hierarchical issues..?). The sad part is that I am a scientist, and had only heard of maybe a handful of the women in this book. Of course I knew about many and/or most of the breakthroughs made, but didn't recognize their names, because they're so often left out of, and forgotten by, history. This really re-inspires me to continue on in my career and always strive for more, to learn more, and pursue more. "

These women have diverse backgrounds and ethnicities, but are united by their love for science and the difficulties they had to overcome to become successful (or even to just be able to do science). Every one of these women is introduced by a very short biography and the most important keywords for her research, as well as a list of her outstanding achievements (like being awarded a Nobel prize or becoming the first female professor at her university or in her field). I love this book! Although the texts are really rather short, I could learn something new about longtime heroes of mine (I did not know previously that Grace Hopper had been on David Letterman. Thank you for this glorious discovery :D), as well as get to know other inspiring scientists that I can't wait to discover more about! Also, it's just beautiful to look at, with gorgeous colors and illustrations. The language is quite simple, so I think even older children can enjoy it (if they do not understand every word, there is a helpful glossary at the end), but it is an inspiring read for adults as well."

Ignotofsky manages to include a wide variety of women from a variety of times and places, all with different science backgrounds. Whether you're interested in reading about paleontologists or astrophysicists or inventors, you will find what you are looking for. The book also contains women of various fame, with some of them being commonly known and others being much less talked about. I have been especially interested in women in STEM recently and have done a fair bit of reading, and I still found myself reading about women I hadn't heard of.

This book spans from well-known female scientists like Marie Curie to lesser known female scientists like Marie Anning and Katherine Johnson. This books exposes children to female scientists who are often overlooked in history and science text books and will hopefully help them expand their ideas on what it means to be a scientist. These women brought a unique perspective to their work, and this book makes students more aware of that.I would use this book in a 7th grade classroom as a model text. Students could create a two-page spread like the ones seen in this book for their favorite historical figure/author. Students would have to incorporate some kind of illustration of the person into their work, and then write a short paper detailing their accomplishments and what makes them worth knowing about. This exercise would give students a chance to practice non-fiction informative writing."

Ignotofsky manages to include a wide variety of women from a variety of times and places, all with different science backgrounds. Whether you're interested in reading about paleontologists or astrophysicists or inventors, you will find what you are looking for. The book also contains women of various fame, with some of them being commonly known and others being much less talked about. I have been especially interested in women in STEM recently and have done a fair bit of reading, and I still found myself reading about women I hadn't heard of. Any child or adult interested in the history of women in STEM will find this introductory book to be enjoyable and enlightening. A great place to start!"

This book spans from well-known female scientists like Marie Curie to lesser known female scientists like Marie Anning and Katherine Johnson. This books exposes children to female scientists who are often overlooked in history and science text books and will hopefully help them expand their ideas on what it means to be a scientist. These women brought a unique perspective to their work, and this book makes students more aware of that.I would use this book in a 7th grade classroom as a model text. Students could create a two-page spread like the ones seen in this book for their favorite historical figure/author. Students would have to incorporate some kind of illustration of the person into their work, and then write a short paper detailing their accomplishments and what makes them worth knowing about. This exercise would give students a chance to practice non-fiction informative writing."

271,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31439703-anne-marie,5,"What an amazing collection of pioneering female scientists! The author includes a wide breadth of scientists across time (although mainly focused in the 19th-21st centuries due to history and records) and disciplines. It just goes to show how little we are taught in school about who discovers the things we learn about. I would (and I suspect many girls and boys) have greatly benefitted from learning that women helped disprove physics laws, discovered the nerve growth factor, discovered the structure of penicillin and insulin, and so much more! Also - Watson and Crick (of DNA fame) did Rosalind Franklin dirty. My only wish is that future sequels (and I dearly hope there are future books in this series) include more female scientists outside of the USA. Other than some of the earlier scientists working primarily out of Europe most of the female scientists covered did their work in the USA (which I understand is in part of because of the author's nationality and the active work America does in the science fields). There are many amazing women doing research all over the world and I'm sure many of them are the firsts in their field/country as well!Overall, I recommend this to everyone regardless of gender - and especially to young ones interested in science (or, like me - adults interested in science or women kicking ass). I will definitely be re-reading this book in the future - and memorizing facts to whip out at parties!PS. The artwork was ADORABLE. I loved all the little details and the colour schemes so much. "

Learning more about the women in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) that came before me is a hobby, but this was done in a unique way that included women from around the world in a wide variety of fields. The illustrations are lovely, and each woman has a two page spread. One page is an illustration with additional bulleted style information, and a quote to take away, the other is similarly illustrated with the main focus being the story of her life. I personally really enjoyed the layout of the individual stories, and also liked that they showed that each woman had other things they were interested in, and in some cases multiple fields they excelled in. Some of the scientific terms might need to be defined for younger children, but there is a glossary in the back with many of the more unusual terms. I think this is actually a positive, however. As a child I hated being talked down to, and like that this is a starting point to learn the actual terms used by scientists. They aren't necessarily hard words, more that they likely haven't come across them in school yet. As a whole, this book is still largely accessible, but you might have to explain things like ""pulsar"" and ""crystallography"". It is US focused, so far as the discussion on how women in STEM related fields has changed through time, but would be an enjoyable read for any budding young scientists you know. "

276,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2867944-mad-mags,4,"From Ada Lovelace to Wang Zhenyi: A Celebration of Women Scientists(Full disclosure: I received a free book for review through Blogging for Books.)It's made to believeWomen are the same as men; Are you not convinced Daughters can also be heroic?- Wang Zhenyi""Nothing says trouble like a woman in pants.""If there's a girl in your life who's into science - be it astronomy, psychology, or paleontology; even just a little! we're talking the teeniest, tiniest bit! - you need to introduce her to the work of Rachel Ignotofsky. A graphic artist/illustrator, Ignotofsky uses her art to ""make learning exciting."" Her first book, Women in Science: 50 Fearless Pioneers Who Changed the World, is a mashup of her many passions: art, history, science, and feminism - namely, celebrating the many contributions (many of them overlooked by and even erased from history) women have made to their respective scientific fields. The result is a smart, inspirational book that's both informative and lovely. Ada Lovelace. Elizabeth Blackwell. Marie Curie. Rachel Carson. Jane Goodall. Some of the women profiled here have managed, against all odds, to claim their rightful places as household names. But have you heard of Wang Zhenyi, 18th century astronomer, mathematician, and poet? How about Mamie Pipps Clark, a psychologist and civil rights activist who, along with her husband, conducted the infamous (and devastating) Doll Experiment, thus helping to end segregation in public schools? Or Jocelyn Bell Burnell, the Irish astrophysicist who discovered pulsars at the age of 24? As if these achievements aren't impressive enough on their own, consider that many of these women did so even when they were barred from higher education, prohibited from publishing papers, or even expected to obey their fathers and husbands, no matter the cost. (Prior to 1974, women couldn't apply for a line of credit; abortion was not legalized until 1973, and even today it can be difficult for low-income women to access; and marital rape wasn't recognized as a crime federally until 1993.) Of course, women of color face(d) even more barriers than their white counterparts: slavery, segregation, Jim Crow, and voter disenfranchisement, to name a few that are discussed here. Just as the fight for women's rights factors heavily into the histories included here, in her profiles of African-American scientists - Mamie Pipps Clark, Katherine Johnson, Jane Cooke Wright, Annie Easley, Patricia Bath, and Mae Jemison - abolition, civil rights, and anti-racism play a large role as well. In addition to being a computer programmer, mathematician, and honest-to-goodness rocket scientist, Annie Easley taught her fellow black Alabamians how to ace Jim Crow voting tests - and also tutored under-privileged city kids in her spare time. In 1992, Mae Jemison became the first African-American woman in space; she famously credits Star Trek's Lieutenant Uhura as a role model, thus illustrating the importance of representation in pop culture. (Enter: Women in Science! How meta!)While there's definitely an American bent to Women in Science, Ignotofsky includes women scientists from all over the world: Australia, Austria, China, Egypt, England, France, Germany, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Poland, Prague, and Russia. There's a fair amount of ethnic and racial diversity, which is awesome, and I also love that Jane Goodall, primatologist and animal rights activist, gets a nod. Each profile is short - just a single page opposite a page of artwork - yet Ignotofsky manages to pack a ton of information in there, including in cute little scribbles and doodles in the margins. The art is whimsical and rendered in rich, vibrant colors; it's so gorgeous I could all but eat it with my eyeballs. The sheer eye-catchiness makes this book great for kids, but adults are also sure to love it: it's astute, stirring, and all but guaranteed to hit you right in the feels. (Three words: Wang Zhenyi's poetry.) I'm really looking forward to her next book, a guided journal called I Love Science: A Journal for Self-Discovery and Big Ideas, due out in March 2017. Ignotofsky's artwork is perfectly suited for the journal format, and I've never heard of a journal quite like it.

I loved the illustrations and how the book often touched on the social context that shaped these women's lives. So many of the female scientists and mathematicians were not just good at STEM subjects but people who cared about art, creativity, and constructively changing society."

The curation of selected women in the book is also very good and the book os well researched. It is also not presented as dry facts. Though this is targeted towards teenagers, I quite enjoyed the books for it's informative content and artwork. The charming illustrations with bright colours on black background and the small quirky titbits of information on individual women make it very interesting and inspiring."

Though their names may not appear in history books alongside their male counterparts, their contributions will never be forgotten. Filled with trivia, diagrams and extensive colored illustrations, this resource is a must read for curious minds."

Ignotofsky manages to include a wide variety of women from a variety of times and places, all with different science backgrounds. Whether you're interested in reading about paleontologists or astrophysicists or inventors, you will find what you are looking for. The book also contains women of various fame, with some of them being commonly known and others being much less talked about. I have been especially interested in women in STEM recently and have done a fair bit of reading, and I still found myself reading about women I hadn't heard of. Any child or adult interested in the history of women in STEM will find this introductory book to be enjoyable and enlightening. A great place to start!"

296,1607749769,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66001213-dana-durusu,0,"""Women in Science: 50 Fearless Pioneers Who Changed the World"" is an illustrated recording of 50 famous female scientists and their contributions in their respective STEM fields. This book spans from well-known female scientists like Marie Curie to lesser known female scientists like Marie Anning and Katherine Johnson. This books exposes children to female scientists who are often overlooked in history and science text books and will hopefully help them expand their ideas on what it means to be a scientist. These women brought a unique perspective to their work, and this book makes students more aware of that.I would use this book in a 7th grade classroom as a model text. Students could create a two-page spread like the ones seen in this book for their favorite historical figure/author. Students would have to incorporate some kind of illustration of the person into their work, and then write a short paper detailing their accomplishments and what makes them worth knowing about. This exercise would give students a chance to practice non-fiction informative writing."

I liked this book, I really did, it has many inspirational (female) scientists in it with various different backgrounds (both in culture and careers). It was very fun to read about all their different stories"

I also promptly ordered this book for my nieces, who are probably, the more age-appropriate target for this. :)See my blog (spoilers possible!) here: https://ichleseblog.wordpress.com/201...."
