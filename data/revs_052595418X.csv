0,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826429-sj-loria,4,"This review will be three parts. First a quick paragraph about what this book is. Then, some of the practical tips and facts from the book itself and finally a why this book matters (and how it relates to The End of Absence) kind of rant. Also quotes at the end.1. What this book is.I'm not entirely sure if this book is supposed to address what it means to have an organized mind or how one can implement structure in order to achieve an organized mind. It's a bit of both, which services perhaps to clutter its overall purpose. It also addresses organization across so many different facets of life (the workplace, the home, teaching, thinking) that the scope perhaps dilutes the effectiveness. It tries to be something for everything, and maybe that's not possible. I appreciate the effort, but not all sections are equally strong and it takes on too much. It’s interesting to learn about the different types of memory and which parts of your brain are involved in thinking them though, that’s neat.2. Practical tips and factsExternalize (write things down, label drawers) and categorize (do now, delegate, do later, and check your lists to revise them)Guard your mind, create a schedule that maximizes your effectiveness that takes into account neurological scienceHave a junk drawer, but remember to organize that every once in a whileCompartmentalizeTake naps, day dreamThere is no such thing as multi-tasking, don’t kid yourself, it’s inefficientThinking takes energy, neurons are living cells and require oxygen and glucoseSort things in to categories, and then sort these into categories with periodic checksOnly check your email three times a dayThere is the central-decision making mode and the mind wandering mode, both are important for brain development and success so you should allow yourself to do both (and all the app noise doesn’t let mind wandering mode happen)Gay people are actually important for preserving family genes because they invest in the childcare of an infant but don’t produce any offspring (apparently he’s summarizing Richard Dawkins on this point, interesting)The serotonin transporter gene SLC6A4 has been found to correlate with artistic behaviors as well as spirituality, both of which appear to favor the mind-wandering mode. [This is the most scientific way one can possibly say “it’s ok to zone out and marvel at clouds.”] 47Value the long term goal, not the short term rushThe process of learning yields better results than the googlization of facts style of learning - I call it the elbow grease approach. This means write things down on paper, say them outloud, learn the old fashioned way if you want to get the maximum effect. Typing on a screen is easy, not to mention the 48 other tabs that are distracting you and the glow of the screen that your brain isn't used to.3. Why this book matters.(I typed this up stream of consciousness style in an electronics store yesterday) So I'm at a store where they are currently looking at my phone because the headphone jack doesn't work properly. For the record, I love music. I spoil the sense of hearing because I cherish music. Excellence in sound. So during exercise this morning when the sound once again came out of only one ear (regardless of the headphone) yet again I said, OK, it's worth going into an electronic store to get this fixed.They're looking at it in the back room, as I'm in a room full of dazzling screens on every side. Literally, all sides. Today my goal was also to type up my review to The Organized Mind, and I had been zoning out and thinking about the point of the process of discovery as it relates to learning. How actually looking something up makes you learn it far better. I was reminiscing about riding my bike to the library, I’m watching two kids not facing each other staring at a screen and speaking to one another through the headsets.He handed me this tool and said, “Here you go, I don't want you to be bored while you wait” as he left. I wanted to tell him, but, it's not a bad thing to be bored. Neurological research is showing more and more the precious importance of the ability to be bored. It's more important in the development of children and adolescents, more than two hours of screen time is related with increased ADHD rates, aggressive behaviors and antisocial behaviors...and probably negative life outcomes once those kids live long enough to test that hypothesis. And probably very negative long term effects on the ability to connect with other people. Family, friends, romantic partners…yikesNews flash, your 2,000 twitter followers don't actually give a shit about you, they just want to see sexy photos. And while the endorphin rush from seeing 295 updates does feel good, I’ll concur to that, but in the long run that shit is the loneliest way to live.The point of The Organized Mind and also The End of Absence and a lot of the scientific research I've read over the past few years is this. Guard your mind. Yes, it's cool to live in the dazzling array of electronics, but while it's convenient that you can instantly find out how much the Empire State Building weighs that doesn't mean you always should. The grey matter up there, and the process of evolving into how we put grey matter up there, took place over hundreds of thousands of years and the instantaneous pop up window way of learning isn't quite in sync with us as a mammal. Read books, daydream, take naps, create spaces where electronics are put away completely. It’s you who should be doing the becoming, not your damn fool computer.Oddly enough, it's essentially in line with Eastern philosophical thinking. If you want to get a summary of The Organized Mind go to a yoga class, or read Peace is Every Step. It's the same point, but one approaches from the western, empirical scientific process based thinking, the other from the more intuitive, collective, calm eastern way of thinking. The both point to the same truth.You must live a certain way, make certain choices that seem boring but in the long run are better for you and essential for your ability to maintain a relationship.Says the man who is typing this all up on a computer, and as we all know we're happy computers exist and I'm happy you're reading this but let's both go do ourselves a favor and turn these things off, go read a book or go have a conversation with a loved one.Last point, then we’ll get to the practical stuff. I saw a couple the other day probably in their 80s walk arm in arm to the car. He opened the door for her as she got in the car, they smiled at one another, and then he hurried around to his side of the car. There’s wisdom in that. Out with the old, in with the new and the shiny and the screens, but as we evolve we can retain the best of the old ways as we improve with the new electronic toys. At least I think that’s possible. At least I choose to live my life in a way that I maintain that hope, because it’s a simple choice in this situation, not a data driven empirical analysis, and I would rather chose the side of life here that results in a more fulfilling life. Be organized. Be your best organized self.QuotesFrom the many thousands of ways that individuals differ from one another, a mathematical model can be constructed that accounts for a great deal of variation, organizing human differences into five categories: extroversion, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness to new experience, conscientiousness….conscientiousness is the best predictor of many important human outcomes.In 2011 Americans took in five times as much information every day as they did in 1986 – the equivalent of 175 newspapers. During our leisure time, not counting work, each of us processes 34 gigabytes of 100,000 words every day…our brains do have the ability to process the information we take in, but at a cost: We can have trouble separating the trivial from the important, and all this information processing makes us tired…with a processing limit of 120 bits per second, this means you can barely understand two people talking to you at the same time. 7The amount of scientific information we’ve discovered in the last twenty years is more than all the discoveries up to that point, from the beginning of language [ed note, in terms of quantity, not quality or importance to human knowledge]. Five exabites (5 x 10 to the 18th) of new data were produced in January 2012 alone – that’s 50,000 times the number of words in the entire Library of Congress. 15 The serotonin transporter gene SLC6A4 has been found to correlate with artistic behaviors as well as spirituality, both of which appear to favor the mind-wandering mode. [This is the most scientific way one can possibly say “it’s ok to zone out and marvel at clouds.”] 47People who read literary fiction (as opposed to popular fiction or nonfiction) were better able to detect another person’s emotions. 119By 1859, the average family group in Europe had dropped from twenty people to ten living in close proximity, and by 1960 that number was just five. Today, 50% of Americans live alone. 121Online interaction works best as a supplement, not a replacement for inperson contact. The cost of all our electronic connectedness appears to be that it limits our biological capacity to connect with other people. 127Studies have shown a dramatic decline in empathy among college students, who apparently are far less likely to say that it is valuable to put oneself in the place of others or to try and understand their feelings. It is not just because they’re reading less literary fiction, it’s because they’re spending more time alone under the illusion that they’re being social. 131“It takes time to shift your attention from task to task. It takes less energy to focus. That means that people who organize their time in a way that allows them to focus are not only going to get more done, but they’ll be less tired and less nurochemically depleted after doing it. Daydreaming also takes less energy than multitasking. And the natural intuitive see-saw between focusing and daydreaming helps to recalibrate the brain. Multitasking does not.Perhaps most important, multitasking by definition disrupts the kind of sustained thought usually necessary for problem solving and for creativity…in multitasking we unknowingly enter an addiction loop as the brain’s novelty centers become rewarded for processing shiny new stimuli, to the detriment of our prefrontal cortex, which wants to stay on task and gain the reward of sustained effort and attention. We need to train ourselves to go for the long reward, and forgo the short one. Don’t forget the awareness of an unread email sitting in your inbox can effectively reduce your IQ by 10 points, and that multitasking causes information you want to learn to be directed to the wrong part of the brain.” 170Sleep is among the most critical factors for peak performance, memory, productivity, immune function, and mood regulation. Even a mild sleep reduction or departure from a set sleep routine can produce detrimental effects on cognitive performance for many days afterwards. 189Even give or ten minute “power naps” can turn around negative emotions and increase happiness. 193Most students today do not know the pleasure of serendipity that comes from browsing through stacks of old academic journals, turning past “irrelevant” articles on the way to the one they’re looking for, finding their brains attracted to a particularly interesting graph or title. Instead, they insert the name of the journal article they want and the computer delivers it to them with surgical precision, effortlessly. Efficient, yes. Inspiring, and capable of unlocking creative potential, not so much. 378"
1,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4162791-claudia-putnam,3,"Who came up with this title, anyway? The marketing dept missed it on this one. It's more about why we're NOT organized than about how to organize. You could say it's about how brains try to organize info, and the barriers to organization in this day and age. There's very little actionable advice. A lot of digression into everything the author has ever learned about how brains function. Whether it's sleep phases, flow states, rational decision-making--most of this stuff has been published elsewhere. So, I guess you'd call this a synthetic work. Nothing wrong with it, except that very little of it seemed new to me. For example, the sleep phases stuff has been passed around on FB for ages now, and the REAL question is, what to do about it? If humans are more naturally oriented to a lunar cycle (which makes sense given that for most of our evolutionary history we were hunter-gatherers and not farmers), how to we get society to function on a 25-hour daily schedule? If people naturally sleep about 4 hours, wake up for about 2, and then return to sleep for another 4, again, how is that supposed to fit in today's world? (Also, what should they do in the 2 hours? Get up and do stuff? Lie there in the dark?) Since most of us don't have personal assistants, pretty much all that was useful was the index cards thing, using calendars more comprehensively (man, do I miss Palm Pilots... we're still not back to where we were 10 years ago regarding calendaring), and blocking off no-internet time for uninterrupted work, which I already do. (I highly recommend the Chrome extension stayfocusd (the name is not a typo) for blocking/limiting social media and other selected websites, including Goodreads. Unfortunately, Android does not enable browser extensions, so you can still run apps on phones, which is a nasty sneakaround for the addicted.) Lots of info on raising children, some really shallow discussion of complementary & alternative medicine, a long discussion on medical decision-making, and a lot about rational decisionmaking, which has been covered by lots of other people in full-length books. In short, the book wasn't very well organized, and you kind of have to have an organized mind in the first place to pick out the relevant details about organizing your mind. "
2,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a wonderful book about the modern mind. Neuroscientist Daniel Levitin has written a comprehensive, yet engaging book about brain science, organization techniques, office clutter, memory, and the ever-present kitchen junk drawer! Levitin has interesting things to say about the curse of e-mail, and the curse of passwords in the computer era. So, what is the greatest organizational component of the mind? It is attention--the ""most essential mental resource for any organism ... The attentional filter is one of evolution's greatest achievements."" It allows us to take in all these details in real-time, non-stop, yet not get bogged down and distracted by irrelevant details.There is a more than a little bit of a self-help attitude in this book. Levitin recommends making use of 3x5 index cards to jot down notes and ""to do"" lists all the time. The cards can be reordered and re-prioritized whenever desired. By writing things down, it gives your mind permission to go off and focus on other things. Levitin makes numerous references to executives who have assistants whose job it is to keep the day's agenda straight, and to keep the big shot's activities rolling along. This allows the executive to focus on the task at hand, and keeps irrelevant distractions at bay.Levitin has nothing but bad things to say about multitasking. He writes that multitasking can increase the production of the stress hormone cortisol and the fight-or-flight hormone adrenaline. These chemicals can overstimulate the brain and cause scrambled thinking. Multitasking put the brain into a feedback loop that rewards it for losing focus, and causes one to constantly search for external stimulation.Levitin describes how sleep is not an all-or-nothing state. Parts of the brain can be awake while other parts sleep. I personally can think of times, when driving along a featureless highway, when I suddenly realized that I didn't remember being conscious for the last minute or so. Part of my conscious brain may have fallen asleep, while my subconscious brain took over the driving. Oh, and while we are on the subject of highway driving, Levitin reviews the logic behind the numbering system for interstate highways. I never realized just how much information is packed into the numbers that are used for interstate highways!So much, so very very much of this book really hit home for me. For example, Levitin writes about how couples in a close relationship implicitly share responsibility for things that need to be remembered. Neither member of the couple knows everything--both members have unique expertise. And, to the point, 
after a very long relationship, if one partner dies, the other partner can be left stuck not knowing how vast swaths of day-to-day life are navigated.
 I personally know just how true this is.Then, Levitin talks about matchmaking or ""romantic partner assistance"", a job that is actually thousands of years old. However, in the past decade, one-third of all marriages in America began with an online relationship. Half of these relationships were via social media, while the other half began on dating sites.I thought that the book was excellent until I came up to the very last paragraph of the book. At that point, I realized that Levitin had read my mind, and shouted out the very best for last: 
Every so often, the universe has a way of [cleaning up] for us. We unexpectedly lose a friend, a beloved pet, a business deal, or an entire global economy collapses. The best way to improve upon the brains that nature gave us is to learn to adjust agreeably to new circumstances. My own experience is that when I've lost something I thought was irreplaceable, it's usually replaced with something much better. The key to change is having faith that when we get rid of the old, something or someone even more magnificent will take its place.

3,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2547702-gretchen-rubin,0,This is a very wide-ranging book that covers a lot of ground about how the mind works. I was particularly intrigued by the discussion of the default mode (also called the task-negative mode) of the brain.
4,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10243691-kent,1,"This book is a dangerous combination of mildly compelling and vastly overwritten. I'd be reading and getting frustrated by the repetitive use of examples, the divergence from the main theme, the pointless asides, and then OCCASIONALLY an interesting tidbit would crop up. In the end, it wasn't enough to hold me, and I ended up skipping/speeding through massive portions of it (audiobook). The first chapter about the mind's states of attention, and the challenges of/resources lost when switching through those modes, was interesting. But then it devolved into overwrought chapters about the history of categorization, chapters on how to take pills and handle social media, and more I can't recall because it just wasn't worth it. This could be summed up by an Inc. or Fast Company productivity listicle. Here's my shot at it. Save yourself a LOT of time: * use external systems to aid your memory* use affordances to create cues for what to do (a key hook by the door, for example)* the brain is great at noticing change, so arrange things differently when you want to remember/notice them* attention takes resources, so give yourself breaks to rest* shut down external distractions (email/chat/text/etc) when you need to get stuff done. "
5,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/591296-amanda,3,"Can I just say that I found it incredibly ironic that a book on organization in an age of INFORMATION OVERLOAD was so very long? It would have been well-serviced by a developmental editor, one capable of trimming the often protracted prose and tightening the book's overall focus. This book is slightly misleading as it's not really a ""how to get organized"" manifesto. It takes lengthy detours into the inner workings of the mind, including how the brain organizes information as well as the ways in which the twenty-first century interfere with that biological system. I dearly love cognitive science, though, so I found those parts quite enthralling.For anyone interested in learning more about memory, this book provides a wonderful dip into the proverbial pool of cognitive science. It's less helpful when it comes to providing ways to better organize information, time, and our world. The first section, with its exploration of cognitive science, sets the stage well, but the following sections often didn't follow through on the promise of organization. The section on the social world especially seemed to detour in ways that only grew more frustrating with the section's end, when the author admits that everyone has their own way of organizing their social world and he can't quite help. There's no denying Levitin is a strong writer. Like his past books, the prose in The Organized Mind is immensely readable, but the author's rather annoying tendency to outline in extremely meticulous detail example after example after example can muddle his overall point and slow the reader's pace. This is a good one to skim (especially the first section!), but I wouldn't recommend sludging through the whole thing."
6,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy,4,"I dipped into this off and on as one of the books I kept at my desk at work. Full confession: I did not read every word on every page. I stuck to a close read of the chapters most relevant to my interests and the work I do as a librarian, and skimmed the rest. This is quite the comprehensive overview of the neuroscience of information organization.The first chapter, ""Too Much Information, Too Many Decisions: The Inside History of Cognitive Overload,"" had a lot to say about how people handle the flood of information in the 21st century. I thought a lot about what I read in this chapter, how it applies to undergraduates that I teach research skills and information literacy skills to, and explains a lot about why despite hours of instruction on the scholarly sources, some students will still just do a Google search. He also introduced me to the idea of satisficing, the idea of ""good enough,"" and how it applies to information. Fascinating, and my group of librarians has had several interesting conversations about this idea - how it relates to the evaluation of resources, to-do lists, even revising. He follows this by talking about ""Highly Successful Persons"" and how the most successful people are likely to have staff who do a lot of information filtering for them, allowing them the luxury of focus, deep thinking, and creativity. So what do the rest of us do? We have to create systems of filtering before we even get bogged down. (And of course my brain is off thinking about how to use this idea as a librarian.)In the chapter, ""Organizing our Social World,"" I was fascinated by the section on people being indirect. It is something I've struggled with since moving to the south (where people will not say ""I disagree with you"" but also in my marriage! I never just say ""Please put X away"" but approach it indirectly. And since my husband, according to Levitin, will not display ""cooperative behavior"" and play part of my social game, I am not successful in my indirect request. But fascinating!The chapter called ""What to Teach our Children"" also had some interesting information about evaluating sources, fake news, and what the immediacy of information means for the younger generation. The notes in the back have even more information and I found myself sucked into them at times. I wouldn't overlook them. But this is not a quick read."
7,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,4,"I first heard about this book when Daniel Levitin appeared on a Spark episode to talk about organization. I recommend you follow the link and listen to the interview; his examples are pretty much straight from the book, so it should give you a good idea of whether or not to read this. I mentioned the book to my friend Rebecca, because it seemed like she would be interested in it. Lo and behold, she goes out and buys the book herself … and then turns around and lends it to me before she reads it, because she has other books to read first. I don’t know this happened, but somehow I managed to acquire excellent friends.Anyway, The Organized Mind is not a GTD (Getting Things Done) book in that it doesn’t pretend to have one amazing system to turn you into a productivity powerhouse. Rather, Levitin aims to use cutting-edge neuroscience and cognitive psychology to give the reader some insight into how our brains organize information and use that to make decisions. As he points out several times, humans are unique among animals for our ability to plan for the future and visualize alternative scenarios. But another thing that makes us unique is our ability to hack our own brains.That’s what Levitin is trying to teach us here. He’s showing us how to hack our brains.It doesn’t matter if you’re the best (or worst, I guess, depending on your perspective) procrastinator: you can still be productive if you can find a system that works for you. And the best way to do that is to be aware of how your brain works, and to work with your brain rather than fighting it.The first part of the The Organized Mind addresses the way our brain reacts to external information. Levitin identifies two complementary modes of attentional awareness: the default mode, or mind-wandering/daydreaming mode, and the central executive. The former is so named because it appears to be what our brains lapse into given the chance. It’s good for creativity, for chewing over tough problems “subconsciously” (in quotations because Levitin points out that consciousness is a more fluid notion than it used to be). The latter is what takes charge when we need to accomplish a specific task. It says, “Hey, we need to do this now!” If you’re following a recipe or, like me, writing a book review, your central executive is keeping you on task.I like how Levitin’s careful explication of current neuroscience reinforces how we used to view the brain in such black-and-white, siloed terms. To some extent this remains the baseline in mainstream perceptions of the brain: you are a “left-brain” or “right-brain” individual; you are logical or you are linguistic. Eyeroll. Levitin points out that being detail-oriented and organized is not necessarily antithetical to creativity; some of the most successful creative people succeed because their organizational system gives them more time to be creative. Similarly, specific cognitive functions are not always localized; sometimes they are distributed among neural networks throughout the brain. This is particularly important when forming memories—the same memory might be triggered by a sight, sound, smell, or link to another memory or concept, because of how memories get formed by our networks. Levitin is very skilled at using computer metaphors for describing how the brain stores information without making the common mistake of likening the brain too much to a computer.Of course, even with a better understanding of how our brain works, there are limits to how far we can push that lump of grey matter. Levitin is a big proponent of cognitive offloading as a way of dealing with information overload. Basically: if you write something down, your brain treats it as stored, and stops mulling it over so much. Want to stop worrying about how much you have to do? Jot down a to-do list. Consequently, in this model of cognition, external organization systems are not just productivity fetishes but potentially useful adaptations. The Organized Mind explores several such systems, from the random-access 3x5 index card system to flat files and computer storage. Levitin makes it clear that he’s not trying to advocate “One System to Rule Them All” but instead encourage the reader to find something that works for them.I was surprised by how fascinating I found some of the history behind these systems. We take file folders for granted, but there was a time when they were being introduced and everyone was as excited about them as we are about the new iPhone. (Apparently Dewey premiered some of this technology at 1893 World’s Fair, which would be the equivalent of a modern day tech expo like CES.) There are some interesting anecdotes, such as the fact that the majority of people didn’t know the order of the alphabet in the eighteenth century. As a student of English literature I knew about the great variation in spelling, but it just didn’t occur to me that the order of the alphabet would be so unimportant. This just demonstrates how our current cultural values bias our view and assumptions of the past.At times Levitin’s digressions get the best of him, and he wanders off into tangents that don’t seem as related to organization as I would have liked. His discussions of statistical decision-making reminds me a lot of 
How Not to Be Wrong
, with a few of the examples almost verbatim. And he refers to the work of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky quite a bit, being a student of the latter, so there is some overlap with 
Thinking, Fast and Slow
. For what it’s worth, Levitin’s writing is more enjoyable.The Organized Mind also has much to say about education, a topic I’m just a little passionate about. Neuroscience seems to support constructivism—the theory of learning that promotes student-led inquiry and construction of knowledge, rather than merely receiving it from an expert. Levitin points out that doing something imprints skills on our brain in a way that merely reading about or hearing about something does not. There are a couple of times in my notes where I’ve just jotted down, “Flipped classroom!” (a term in which students learn by tackling problems set by the instructor, who acts as another resource or guide but doesn’t actually lecture or otherwise instruct). And the conclusion is basically an impassioned plea by Levitin to make sure we are teaching students what they need to know for now rather than what we thought they needed to know a decade or two ago. In the Internet age, students need to be critical thinkers and problem solvers. It’s not about what you know, it’s about what you know about how you can get the knowledge you need.I can’t not recommend this book. It’s intelligent, insightful, and well-written. The barrier to entry is on the higher side; even after hiding away the four-fold tables primer in an appendix, Levitin leaves an awful lot of science and math vocabulary out on the lawn for the neighbours to see. (Is that … is that a correlation coefficient in your driveway? How gauche!) I say this not to frighten but to be upfront: this is not a beach read type of popular science book but a “frown and think” type. I still recommend it, but know what to expect and what frame of mind you’ll need to get the most out of it.Oh, one last thing: this might seem like a thick book. However, if you are like me, the first thing you will do is flip to the back and see if there is an index and notes. There are, and they are over a hundred pages combined. This is a well-indexed, well-annotated science book, and that is even better. Sexy, even. Because I have a confession, ladies: I like big brains. I cannot lie. And you other brothers? You cannot deny that when a girl walks in with a big heavy bag and shoves a book full of learning in your face you get pumped … to spend a weekend reading about cognitive neuroscience.Or is that just me?

8,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4103406-nick-richtsmeier,3,"Books like An Organized Mind are such a struggle to review. On one hand there were sections of this book that were so rich and so valuable that I either went and implemented the changes suggested or spent hours thinking through how the issues Levitin raises have broad and sometimes unintended consequences. And yet, I find it difficult to rate this book more than 3 stars. It was dense, and not in a good way. There were long sections of under-edited rambling. The author was over-indulgent with his own ideas and lacked the discipline to edit what should be included and shouldn't be included in this valuable popular examination of human neurology and behavior.Herein lies the irony. How is it that book shouting about the importance of the organization, satisficing and de-cluttering in the age of over-information be so cluttered by... over-information? It is a quandary I myself don't have the proximity to the author to address. All I can offer is the warning to those who would wish to find a clear path to their own mental organization from Levitin's book--you won't find it here.What you will find are moments of uncommon brilliance that I can't imagine have missed by avoiding this book. And along side those moments are stretches of common ramblings that a skilled writer and ideator like Levitin should have been able to avoid. "
9,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5647191-orsolya,3,"Our brains are remarkably able to store an insurmountable wealth of information… Or are they? Having not been biologically created to receive as much stimuli as we do in the modern world; how can our brains cope? How is the information stored and organized? Best-selling author, psychologist, and neuroscientist Daniel J. Levitin explores these questions in, “The Organized Mind: Thinking Straight in the Age of Information Overload. Levitin divides “The Organized Mind” into three main parts with the first explaining how information is sorted within the brain on a neurological standpoint; followed by how we organize our outside world and then a ‘how-to’ of sorts. For those who enjoy neuroscience, the first section will be especially pleasing as Levitin strikes again with his ability to mix neuroscience and psychology in an entertaining and readable way but without dummying down the information. In fact, Levitin is one of the few authors who present scientific jargon without overwhelming the reader; blowing one away with amazing information and thus keeping reader attention. Levitin also incorporates some humor, interactive exercises, and easy-to-understand examples into the text which breaks the heaviness of the topic. This is well-received as “The Organized Mind” is a slower read not because of poor writing but because there is a lot of information to absorb. The negative of this is that some of the material will quickly become dated as time goes on. Unfortunately, “The Organized Mind” takes a drastic turn after approximately 80 pages, entering the second section. Ironically for a book on organization, it feels like Levitin can not maintain his focus and strays on various tangents; losing his thesis. Although his scope of research and intelligence is impressive; the presentation lacks a cohesive strand bouncing from psychology to case studies to science but without truly connecting these ideas: everything is very choppy and cut apart. These areas are also interspersed with tips on organization which are so out of place (and sometimes, plain ridiculous); that they can be skimmed or skipped all together. Also evident is Levitin’s habit of repetition of ideas or using the idea differently in various sections to appeal to the topic at hand. As a result, “The Organized Mind” weakens in strength and slows its pace. As “The Organized Mind” proceeds, it truly loses its message with much of Levitin’s text being conjecture or even common sense, filling pages merely to add length. On the other hand, the material is still interesting enough to justify continued reading. “The Organized Mind” can be compared to a conversation which is “all over the place” but still with enough depth to find it satisfying. The concluding chapters of the second section elevate the confusion even more as they have no correlation with the topic and are lax in the science. In fact, there are many “I have no idea what is going on!”-moments. Levitin strays greatly from the aim of “The Organized Mind” and even ventures down a social history path. At this juncture, the text is very ‘up and down’. Similarly, the final (third) section of “The Organized Mind” strays from both its individual sectional intention and that of the overall book. The message of the organization theme is lost and once again, the science is eschewed. To add to the disappointment, the ending is abrupt and doesn’t summarize the book resulting in a weak and less-than-memorable ending. “The Organized Mind” rounds out with an appendix and notes which include sources. Although the notes are (author-admittedly) not exhaustive; they show great research and even encourage further reading. Unfortunately, only the beginning of “The Organized Mind” is powerful and on-par with Levitin’s usual excellence. After this, the text is jumbled and the thesis is lost producing a weak work. Despite these major flaws, “The Organized Mind” is still an interesting piece and is much better than other books on similar topics. The bottom line though: it is not cohesive and not as great as expected from Levitin. “The Organized Mind” is recommended for fans of the author or those who search out all neuroscience books but it is not necessary to rush into it.

For people of any age, the world is becoming increasingly linear---a word I'm using in its figurative rather than mathematical sense. Nonlinear thinkers, including many artists, are feeling more marginalized as a result. As a society, it seems we take less time for art. In doing so, we may be missing out on something that is deeply valuable and important from a neurobiological standpoint. Artists recontextualize reality and offer visions that were previously invisible. Creativity engages the brain's daydreaming mode directly and stimulates the free flow and association of ideas, forging links between concept and neural nodes that might not otherwise be made. In this way, engagement in art as either a creator or consumer helps us by hitting the reset button in our brains. Time stops. We contemplate. We reimagine our relationship to the world.Being creative means allowing the nonlinear to intrude on the linear, and to exercise some control over the output. The major achievements in science and art over the last several thousand years required induction, rather than deduction--required extrapolation from the known to the unknown and, to a large extent, blindly guessing what should come next and being right some of the time. In short, they required great creativity combined with a measure of luck. There is a mystery to how these steps forward are made, but we can stack the decks in our favor. We can organize our time, and our minds, to leave time for creativity, for mind-wandering, for each of us to make our own unique contribution in our time here.
Overlong with nothing new to say, Levitin is only successful in 'organizing' for uninformed readers some oft-referenced case studies from cognitive science and offering some half-hearted advice for practical application.Admittedly I have some familiarity with the subject material, but I had almost no reason to annotate while reading. Too late and undercooked."

The book was ok. It repeats a lot of the popular experiments other authors of popular psychology books use, which makes me wonder if maybe the Invisible Gorilla etc. are the only experiments that have been done in the past 20 years. Regardless, I wasn't sure why they were there. They're interesting experiments and he wrote about them well, but they had only tangential relevance to the book's subjects (of organizing and not being overwhelmed by information overload), and it struck me as both unfortunate and ironic that a book about how much we are overloaded by information nowadays chose to communicate that by overloading readers with information. Come on. Did we really need a 20 page discourse on the origins and development of the flat-file hanging-folder system? No.If you are already a fairly organized person, you won't find anything new here. The advice portion can be summed up in a paragraph:1. Externalize your organization. Don't keep everything in your head. Make folders, boxes, cubbies, ticklers, whatever; it doesn't matter so much what you do, as that the information is organized in the physical world.2. Put everything in your calendar. Also put reminders for everything in your calendar.3. Don't check your email and social media compulsively. Use tools to put limits on how much you can be distracted online.4. Use file folders and organize them, maybe alphabetically or by subject. (I'm not kidding. He discusses the pros and cons of each.)5. Really lucky people get to hire assistants to be their organization for them. Chances are, you don't.If these are things you already do, or already know, then you are screwed, my friend, because there is apparently nothing else to be done to manage the overwhelm. "

This book is such a book. It is a clearing house of recent findings in psychology and brain science that involve everyday life and information on the internet. It does not give a recipe or winning plan but merely relates fascinating information about how our brains work and how information works on the internet. The self help advice is deeply disguised as a nonfiction presentation which is detailed and doesn't talk down to the reader. It is a good well written presentation of really good information for people who detest self help. Really enjoyable a true rating would be four and half stars.

16,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18949674-mike,5,"Nothing reveals more about our vigorous, bootstrap American culture than self-help literature. And nothing reveals more about our own insecurity and alienation than that same literature. While we are simultaneously driven to control our destinies, we are also driven to reach for a book to rescue us from our inability. This reveals our deep-seated dread of contingency and imperfection and our deep-seated hunger for universality and perfection. The desire for change implies the need for change. I see that same dread and hope in my own encounter with this genre. I don’t remember the moment that the pendulum began swinging toward self-reflexivity, but I’m pretty sure that prior to my self-help binge, I was perfectly capable of doing the things that much of the self-help literature suggested. I was fine at reading books until I read Mortimer Adler's _How to Read a Book_, after which I couldn’t make heads or tails of a book. Should I be underlining it, highlighting it, making an outline, memorizing the page numbers, indexing them all? After reading David Allen’s _Getting Things Done_, I remember coming to a crisis point in my ability to properly prioritize my tasks. Granted that I now had a system to process incoming tasks, I now found that my previous knack for “just knowing” which tasks took higher priority had withered to the point that I could no longer decide if it were more important to “process my inbox” or “pay my electric bill.” That’s the problem with much of the self-help literature I’ve encountered. So much of the conventional wisdom in that literature, if applied too heavy handedly, can make one’s life worse than no system at all. Moreover, the people who tend to love this genre are generally conscientious (and insecure) folks anyway, so there is a very real danger that if such books are not careful, they can do more harm than good. Enter stage left: _The Organized Mind_ by Daniel Levitin. At the height of my crisis point, I suddenly realized three things about getting things done: 1. I cannot possibly do everything that comes across my “to do” list; 2. consequently, I need to learn how to prioritize and vet the things that do come through this list, and 3. how on earth am I supposed to be creative and add meaning to this world when I’m constantly having to shuffle my pile of tasks around? Levitin’s solution to my problem is neuroscience. Underlying the entirety of this book is the assumption that current neuroscientific research is a needed voice in this desperately overblown and oversold genre. His central, and more explicit, purpose is to convey the beautiful insight that an optimal human life balances both creativity with rationality, chaos with organization. You get from this book the much needed counterpart to almost all other self help literature: the recognition that this world is a complex and baffling place, and the human mind copes with that by categorizing it, but only imperfectly. At the end of the day, our categorizing and filing and sorting and sifting can’t do it all, and as we finally compartmentalize most of what we have, we’re still left with a handful of things that we must toss in a “junk drawer.” In other words, at the very least, we should recognize that no organizational system is air tight, and for us as human beings, that’s just fine. This book is structured into three parts. The categorization of these parts isn’t all that clear, even after having read the book. I'll take a stab at it though. Part one contains chapters 1 and 2, detailing his introductory assumptions. Chapter 1 claims that only over the last couple of decades has the sheer volume of data we face as a people increased to a critical state, and we are overloaded and struggling to manage it; chapter 2 argues that human memory is best served by (in fact, depends upon) categorization (or abstraction) from data, and it forms the very basis of human language. Part two, chapter 3-7, appears to be the application of those first principles to domains in our lives. Chapter 3 argues that we organize our homes best by externalizing our memories into our living spaces. Chapter 4 argues that we best organize our social lives through understanding social reasoning (and avoiding things like the fundamental attribution error). Chapter 5 digs deeper into subjective perceptions as it relates to time and attention—and why it passes so differently for so many activities and stages of life. Chapter 6 discusses medical decision making using statistical reasoning—which, he argues, we aren’t very good at doing, and chapter 7 discusses both the structures of business organizations, a defense of all this paperwork (finally!), and how a good business model will allow for human creativity. Part three, chapters 8 and 9, seems to serve as both a conclusion to the book and a “junk drawer” for his stray observations not easily categorized in the rest of the book. Chapter 8 argues that we should be teaching our children information literacy above all, and chapter 9 argues very eloquently that human creativity and human rationality should serve complimentary roles, rather than in opposition to one other.What makes this book so valuable, contrary to so many other self-help books, is that it doesn’t indulge in pandering or pedantry. Too many books are weak on research and overbearing in maxims. Daniel Levitin manages to avoid both an academic tediousness and a layperson’s favoritism for his/her pet rule. This work is both accessible to an average (but educated) reader, but rigorous enough for an academic reader (though probably not as useful to an established neuroscientist—for obvious reasons). Pedagogically, the book is structured quite well—each chapter building upon itself. That is, from a pedagogical standpoint, his reiteration of previous concepts helps the reader to learn things through repetition, like the role of the prefrontal cortex as the “executive center.” Having no background in neuroanatomy, this was appreciated. Nevertheless, there are some areas that didn’t quite work. For one, the chapters themselves are a bit lengthy. This is, I think, due to his categorization system. A great example of this is chapter 4, where he attempts to address how to organize our “social world.” The chapter begins with crowdsourcing, then moves to the sociology of cities/networking, then externalizing our memories to close social connections, then group membership decisions, social networking, intimacy, the virtue of “agreeableness,” matchmaking, online dating, lie detection, honesty and forgiveness, conversational implicatures and indirect speech acts, social contracts, oxytocin and vasopressin’s relationship to relationships, the “invisibility” problem of mental states, a discussion of judging others based on external criteria, belief perseverance, in-group/out-group bias, and wraps up by discussing bystander inaction—all in that order. These subjects fall under only five headings within the chapter (if you count the beginning of the chapter as a heading); most of his ideas just move from one paragraph to the next, like a stream of consciousness narrative. It’s enjoyable to read, and it does seems to make intuitive sense to go in the directions he does, but it becomes unwieldy and difficult to remember which path you’ve taken to get where you are. I also noticed that misleading title. I had picked it up thinking I would get a book about developing a way to organize what goes into my head, and how to arrange all of that information while it’s in there. Instead, I got a book that suggested offloading as much of that information as possible! It’s good advice, in retrospect, but it wasn’t what I was after when I picked it up. Perhaps that is his purpose, though—to rope in those who naively believe that they can have a memory megastructure inside their little heads. Instead, when all the science is tallied and reconciled, he reveals this as a lost cause.Overall, these weaknesses may actually be a result of his “joining of creativity and rationality.” They are large categories, but he allows himself the indulgence of meandering through much of the research to ensure that he’s covered a whole lot of material—to show the narrative relationship in much of human knowledge, rather than removing pieces that don’t neatly fit into easy categories. I like it. I think the primary point he is trying to convey, though, can best be summarized by a quote from the last chapter. With all the vast and inundating amounts of information at our fingertips, it’s becoming increasingly more important to recognize where computers and databases cannot go—and to recognize what characteristics of our humanness make us such a powerful and progressive species: our creativity. Computers, encyclopedias, and databases don’t have it. We do. Thus, he can say, “nonlinear, creative thinking [should] be tethered to rational, linear thinking in order to implement it in the most robust and rigorous way possible—the dreams of men and women paired with the vast resources of computers” (380). As we continue to consume our self-help candy, it’s best to attend to the insecurities that provide the impetus for so much of it. Computers we are not, but artists we are. If there is anything we should be more optimistic about, it’s the very human ability to take the data we’re given (and we can’t handle very much), and to dream and imagine where it might take us, or what it might mean. Looking at massive bones buried deep in the earth, we can imagine both dragons and dinosaurs. That’s just who we are. I think this book is a wonderful edition to a genre that is implicitly pessimistic about human organizational potential. Rather than lamenting “messiness,” Levitin celebrates it as that which gives us so much of life’s meaning. To rephrase Jesus of Nazareth when he said “man was not made for the Sabbath, but the Sabbath for man.” So we might say that we are not created for organization, but organization was created for us—to free us to be more human."

It is also much too long and in need of serious editing, another case of way too much writing for the actual content. I was going along pretty well on the content until we got to the chapter on hard decisions, in which he introduces all kinds of stuff relating to making life-and-death decisions. He talks about statistics, probability (confusing the two, actually) and decision theory. The valuable part of this chapter is his journalistic work reporting on how doctors and surgeons help us all make decisions on prostate cancer. The material on statistics and decision theory, however, lost me. A note: Bayesian statistics are not all about ""conditional probability"" (probability of this given that)--Bayes rule is about updating a prior distribution with data into a posterior distribution. How he can talk about Bayesian statistics without actually using the concept of a distribution at all is beyond me. Another note: a contingency table is not a decision tree. Really weird approach to decisions. He'd be much better off using the usual tree graph or (sigh) a Bayesian network representation. Then he got to alternative medicine. He defines ""medicine"" as treatments based on scientific evidence. Really! Shouldn't be talking so much to doctors, perhaps a little bit more to philosophers of science. He never mentions to important concept of ""evidence-based medicine"", which is, after all, unusual in today's medical world. It is not an oxymoron. Doctors don't prove things, they know things. It's not the same thing. And alternative medicine is not the simple negation of medicine--treatment not based on evidence. That's called circular reasoning--and without bothering to define ""evidence"" in any convincing way. I'm left thinking his real approach to evidence is like art: you know it when you see it :) . At that point, my brain shut down on me and I gave up."

25,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25116535-sahar-sabati,4,"In an eye opening NPR talk, Harvard professor Ann Blair discusses how information overload is certainly not unique to the digital age. This same concern accompanied every invention related to any increase in our ability to more efficiently share more information.The question of organizing information started the instant humans invented writing. How will the information be stored? How will it be categorised? How can it easily be accessed, seeing as how the same information can be the answer to very different questions? Current questions regarding the unprecedented amount of information available in the digital age are similar to those we faced in the past. As we managed then to address them, we will be able to yet again learn to manage information overload and, taking full advantage of it, advance as a society.These are some of the questions that McGill professor Daniel J. Levitin addresses in his latest book, The Organized Mind: Thinking Straight in the Age of Information Overload. In the same tradition as his two best-selling books, This Is Your Brain On Music: The Science of a Human Obsession, and The World in Six Songs: How the Musical Brain Created Human Nature, he walks us through complex concepts, explaining its intricacies in a clear and engaging voice. The fact that Levitin is a neuroscientist, a professor of Psychology and Behavioural Neuroscience at McGill University in Montreal where he runs the Laboratory for Music Cognition, Perception and Expertise lends the book scientific legitimacy. This is balanced by his philosophical side—reflected in pieces such as Amnesia and the Self That Remains When Memory Is Lost—which makes the science relatable to daily life.The three parts in The Organized Mind build on each other in a way long-time readers of my blog will immediately recognize. Levitin begins by discussing the information overload we are currently experiencing and how humans, on an individual level, are attempting to organise and use as much as of it as they can. In the second part, the author takes a step back from the individual to discuss the implications of information overload at the level of the home and of society, touching upon the way we can organise both in a more efficient way. The third and final part discusses the future, both in terms of how to raise our children in an age of information overload as well as what organizing information could look like as we continue evolving.That a vital part of our education should be to learn how to sift through and organize information in such a way that allows us to make decisions is one of the most important things I took from The Organized Mind. The quick shift from information available in books to information available online did not give us time to learn how to sift and organise efficiently enough, which creates a sense of helplessness and disempowerment. One sign of this is how the wealth of sometimes contradictory information keeps individuals from making decisions regarding diet or lifestyle best suited to them. Similarly, the wealth of sometimes contradictory information keeps individuals from making decisions regarding their contribution to the well-being of their communities. In both cases, individuals have good intentions that get lost in a sea of information. There is probably a strong connection with the increasing levels of apathy and lethargy and the sense of disempowerment related to information overload.While reading The Organized Mind will unfortunately not turn you into a master information organizer and retriever, it does give insight into how successful members of society, such as business executives, highly credentialed professionals, artists, and athletes, have “learned to maximize their creativity and efficiency by organizing their lives so that they can spend less time on the mundane, and more time on the inspiring, comforting, and rewarding things in life,” which is something that everyone can benefit from."

27,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49850369-son-tung,4,"This seems to be just right for me at the current level of knowledge. Ironically, i'm overloaded with infomation from this book, mostly on scientific explanation of the brain. And from solid science, small handy tips offered here make really good sense. Its for the best when i can find a justified reason for small advices on efficiency, creativity (which often see as short articles circulated on social media). A few important points which i have to take note and digest slowly overtime:- There are 2 compelling properties of human brain : richness (remember many things) and associative access (your memory can be accessed by semantic or perceptual association, memory can be triggered by a smell, song, word, photograph or random firing neuron...). Individually or collectively, human has always been using ways to improve memorycapacity and indexing system. It is the language and writing system and now data storage online. It is nesscessary to externalize your thoughts by writing note and review later from an observer's perspective. (Using 3x5 cards is a powerful tool to prioritize, reorganize tasks)- Four components of human attentional systems: mind wandering mode, central executive mode, the attention filter, the attentional switch. We often are not aware of what we filter or when 2 modes switch to one or another. Daydream and mind wandering mode can have postive effect on creative tasks and problem solving. Day dream: is marked by a flow of a connection between disparate ideas and thoughts and relative lack of barriers between senses and concepts. It makes solutions for difficult problems which seems impossible before for us. Mind wandering mode: Our thoughts are mostly directed inward towards goal, desires, feelings, plans, relationship with other people, when ppl feel empathy towards one another. In central executive mode: both inward and outward. -Flow state is great! Fear center and self-criticism part of the brain are turned off, Flow creates higher form of efficiency and art, normally happens for experts or what you do best. (Read the book for more specific description). - Sleep: Experiments from US National Institute of Mental Health suggests that human at night sleeps 4 hours, wakes up for 1-2 hour (to ward off nocturnal animals) and back to sleep for more 4 hours. Naps during day less than 40 mins are beneficial. Naps right after the alarm goes off often interfere with brainwave patterns. So, the advice is to wake up consistently the same time everyday despite there are some nights with less sleep. - The author also included numberous aspects of organized thinking: skepticism, cognitive biases, organizational structures (compare advs/disadvs). Still my favorite part although i have somewhat earlier read on these topic. - And spirit of cleaning up your mind, your life: ""Every so often, the universe has a way of cleaning up for us. We unexpectedly lose a friend, a beloved pet, a business deal, or an entire global economy collapses. The best way to improve upon the brains that nature gave us is to learn to adjust agreeably to new circumstances. My own experience is that when I've lost something I thought was irreplaceable, it's usually replaced with something much better. The key to change is having faith that when we get rid of the old, something or someone even more magnificent will take its place."" I have been having a similar feeling: if i do not learn more and grow faster, sooner or later, terrible things will catch me off guard. Terrible mistakes should be avoided since who knows how bad things can go. "
28,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7166646-vinod-peris,3,"The title of this book is an overload in itself, but the premise is solid. We are faced with too many choices today and these choices make us less happy, not more. And the trend is getting worse. Daniel makes his point by highlighting how the average grocery store now has over 40,000 unique products as opposed to less than 10,000 in 1975. Most of our needs revolve around 150 products and so we spend a huge amount of cognitive effort ignoring the thousands of items in the grocery store.Decisions like this are lurking at every corner of our lives. The online shopping marketplace has made it infinitely worse. I recall, going through the entire catalog (tens of thousands) of light fixtures in several online stores when I was remodeling my house a few years ago. While driving, I often feel the need to consider alternate routes and optimize for traffic. Many people I know, watch a show on TV while checking their mobile phones for updates on Facebook, Twitter, Email, etc. Daniel underscores the point that all this context-switching consumes energy and prevents us from making good decisions. The book starts out with lots of promise, but Daniel strays in his thoughts. Halfway through the book, Daniel decides to focus on Bayesian statistics and goes off into a detailed description of how to calculate the odds that your test was a false positive. He then veers off into leadership and the US Army’s Mission Command manual. While most of the information resonated well with my view of cognitive behaviors, the book meandered about and made for a rather slow read."

I for one appreciated some of his references and personal stories. What’s more, Levitin has done his homework. I’m all for citing the works of others, and Levitin extensively references the work of plenty of prominent researches writers. (More on that below.)At times, though, the book tends to wander. The Organized Mind doesn’t read like a single text. It is part business book, part decision making book à la Thinking, Fast and Slow, part science/neurology book, and part self-help book. Sure, it’s well written, but I would read twenty interesting pages on how the brain works only to get back to where he left off before. I was left wondering if less would have been more. That is, would a shorter but more focused book worked better? I suspect that the answer is yes.There’s nothing wrong with The Organized Mind. It’s enjoyable enough. I’d stop short of calling it a must-read, though. This goes double if you’re caught up on Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Daniel Kahneman, Daniel Gilbert, and Dan Ariely."

For example, the author claims that in 2011, Americans took in five times as much information every day as they did in 1986---the equivalent of 175 newspapers. During our leisure time (just leisure!) we each process 100,000 words every day. The world has 21,274 television stations which produce 85,000 hours of original programming every day and we watch an average of 5 hours of t.v. each day. It's too much to manage, and we all know there is more coming every day. So his message is a good one, which is essentially to prioritize and learn to ignore a lot.

Around 4 hours in, I was listening to stories and statistics about online dating, which somehow segued into ""why people lie and how bad we are at detecting it,"" and then into a segment on difficulty in perception of indirect communication (for example, sarcasm) in people on the autism spectrum. Parts were interesting, but overall, nearly 10 hours of this was at least 7 too many. Not quite what I'd expect from a book with ""The Organized Mind"" in the title."

Levitan is a smart guy and a good writer, but this book is a hodgepodge of brain science and psychology mixed up with tips about getting organized. The science is interesting but there didn’t seem much new or different - of course I read a lot about brain/mind stuff. And the getting-things-organized tips were mostly fairly obvious, to my mind."

Its a waste of time, that could be spent reading books that are actually interesting, useful or at least entertaining.Instead, I would suggest looking up a video or a few articles about Bayesian probability/theorem or picking up one of the following books: Thinking Fast and Slow, Deep Work or 59 Seconds.I did like the book at the start and I think it might be worth reading at least up to half. Seems like this author likes 'Thinking Fast and Slow' and the authors. Presents and explains some concepts about organizing and it does sound exactly what I've expected and I did like the first 200ish pages.But this is where the book should have ended.Now a bit more than halfway through the thing, I was forced to spend over an hour reading about how paper files were being organized during nobody fucking cares era in the most boring way I've ever experienced anything. I think waiting in line at the hospital would bring more value to your life than reading this, since then you'd at least have some time to reflect on your life. And all this history about sorting paper in the past was followed by the sudden hate on technology and a massive bash on Wikipedia and its free model.Now if I understand correctly, the idea behind all this, was to promote fact-checking and fight the fake-news propaganda, but it was presented in such a stupid, repulsive and triggering way I've started double-checking if I'm still reading the same book. Because on the title it says ""The organised mind"" rather than ""Things were better back in the 90's"".This is probably 2nd negative review I've ever written, but the author will not mind it, because I'm not a fucking librarian, because apparently the only information that matters is provided by librarians and encyclopedias, well I'm no librarian, but this book does not look like an encyclopedia to me, so, Daniel, excuse me, but what the fuck?Thank you for bearing through this rant-review with me, which fortunately for both of us, did not last HALF OF THE FUCKING BOOK (looking at you here, Daniel)."

41,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5575980-leticia-supple,2,"This book came to be in my possession as it had been recommended, or referred to, by a series of authors whose books I'd read in the past six months. It's also one of the lowest ratings I've given in a while. If you've read any of my critique (in any art form), you'll know how much I despise ratings, because of the false impressions they can create.But that is an aside. Let not the rating determine whether or not you should read this. First, ask yourself whether learning the functions of an organised (or disorganised, or distracted) mind are important to you. Secondly, ask yourself whether or not you are interested in multiple psychological studies. And thirdly, ask yourself whether you like a theoretical, discursive, and studious book.If you replied yes, yes, yes, then you will love this work.Levitin's book is a very interesting read. It covers a lot of ground: From neuroscience to mathematical probability; from behaviours, attitudes, and effects of online and fast-paced information acquisition, to important skills required to raise children. And it includes some fantastic work on how we actually do organise information: Like with like, purpose with purpose, accessible and visible versus hidden and filed.This is not a fast read, and nor is is one that will allow you to acquire information without also asking you to read a high number of examples and cases that illustrate a given point. These examples and cases are simultaneously worthwhile and boring. For this particular reader, there are only so many times you need to iterate a point.And the iteration became a problem as the book went on. Points were repeated many times; this is likely for two reasons: The first, to refresh your memory as to the information you've read through; the second, because it's written by an academic no doubt used to the particularly reiterative style common to the academy. Yet the reiteration seemed to demonstrate the author wavering. Levitson would drive in hard to make a point, and then lose it (and himself) in the process of providing a vast number of examples, fully and beautifully explained, but at the cost of the point of the section, or the momentum of the narrative, or even - perhaps sinfully! - to the detriment of the overall point of the book.The result is that I actually did skip a large number of examples. Bored, tired of reading the same point over and over again, and trying to rediscover the thread of the narrative.Perhaps because the field of study is so large, this author could have benefited significantly from a far more comprehensive use of notes (foot- and end-notes) by which to illustrate the argument. It would have served to better connect the narrative, drive the book forwards, and still allow the reader the choice of reading the additional information.As Levitin himself points out in this work, the best way for someone to access, recall and assess information is to give them less of it, and in a way in which they are in control. The time-honoured use of end- and foot-notes does precisely that. However, it could also be a problem not with the author, but with an inexperienced or young editor, who has never had to really consider the reader at hand.It's a shame, because there's a lot of value here. I fear that the style may put a lot of people off. And if you read this book, you might think instead that it says far more about me as a reader, and my own knowledge of a topic (or ability to acquire information), than it does about the work in hand. I shall leave that for you to decide.Daniel Levitin's The Organized Mind: Thinking straight in the age of information overload has a lot of potential for being an important and necessary work. Whether it reaches that standing remains to be seen; and given its present construction (in this edition), I doubt very much that it will."

43,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2536510-maureen,5,"Finished! not really though...still thinking about the book. Glad I read it.. very interesting and things from the book crop up for me quite frequently. The only problematic part for me was chapter six which was about decision making using hard medical decisions as the main example. The advice given seemed good to me, but the whole thing was, if possible, too logical. Not sure I would recommend this chapter to doctors!!The book has three parts: understanding information overload, learning what cognitive science knows about how to handle it, the future (hard to say what this is until I read it).Why I am so excited about the book... since I retired the fact that my mind is jumping all over the place bothers me more than it used to. My mind has always been speeding around, at least as far as I remember. I continue to work with meditation (at the moment, loosely based in Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction) for relief of this situation as well as many other benefits. The Organized Mind holds out the promise of bringing new-to-me ideas and solutions to what is a widespread social problem. To me personally, it looks as it it will support my commitment as a lifelong learner and dovetail well with my interest in neuroscience which developed throughout my formal teaching career. The fact that the books is so compellingly interesting written will make the reading a pleasure! On the downside, I may have to invest in a new highlighter. Friends, I hope you will join me in this reading. Wouldn't it be wonderful to have an online community of co-readers?"
44,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7916772-silent-count,4,"Do you ever wish your brain came with a manual? Well this is about as good as it gets. This book falls at an interesting crossroad between neuroscience and psychology, with little splashes of logic, personal organisation and statistical analysis thrown in for good measure.While Mr Levitin does occasionally stray a little too far into the biological chemistry of how our brains work (who really cares which chemical is responsible for various receptors firing?) he does do a wonderful job of explaining how we function at a macro level.- How we store and categorise information.- The relationship between 'paying attention' and daydreaming. And when and how they're both beneficial.- Why we suck at certain kinds of statistical analysis.Rather importantly, it contains some suggestions on how to arrange our personal world to align with how our brain works well, and how to mitigate against it's weaknesses. For example, do you ever lose your keys? Most of us do. If you put a key holder next to your front door and get in the habit of putting your keys on it every time you arrive home, you'll find they won't get lost anymore.It's sad that the one glaring weakness of this book written to address ""information overload"" is that it could have done with a serious editorial pruning. There is plenty of worthwhile information but it should have been more consise with it's presentaion of ideas."
45,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50092114-melchor-moro-oliveros,5,"To a big extent, this book is a masterpiece. Extremely complete with very solid scientific fundamentals. It is not the typical “How to” recipe kind of. In fact, I am happy that the selected title was “Thinking straight...” and not “How to think straight ...” :-). It is not an easy-to-read book, though. It contains large amounts of know-how from areas that go from neuroscience through cognitive psicology up to sociological behavior. You will need time to digest the concepts as you read through them. Do not expect a list of advices to become a well organized person. Again, it is not a cheap “how-to” recipe book. The advices are in there, but often they are embedded in the thorough and dense explanations. You will find the fully sense of the book only once you have completed the read. It is a book of study more than a easy read to enjoy during your vacation laying down at the beach. However, please, don’t get discouraged by me. You will learn a lot about the brain from a neurological point of view. You don’t need any specific knowledge on the areas treated in the book nor to be expert in anything. You just need not to suffer from “cerebral fatigue” :-), as I will explain later on in this review.Here is my summary:First of all, why information overload?: All is due to digitalization. The author points out 2 main aspects. He called one of them “Shadow work”: Many of the services provided in the past (pre-digitalization era) by companies have now been transferred to the consumer of the service (us). Think about the simpliest things: we bag our own things at the check-out of a supermarket, we even scan ourselves our own purchases and execute the payment using the remote payment machine or a screen terminal. Companies do not send bills anymore. We must log-in into their home page, remembering password and username, and we must download ourselves the document. If problems occur during the process, then we must read through the online FAQ or the wizzard assistant and figure out ourselves what the problem is. As a last step, we can call the hotline service, which, if lucky, will respond after long instructions of choices and actions. We pump our own fuel at the gas station. We do flight reservations and check-in ourselves. All this occurs at a neuronal cost in our brain. And it occurs to us every day in hundred of things.The other aspect is “choices”: One example: It was found that the maximun number of parameters that our brain can process when purchasing a house is ten, this includes attributes of a house but also alternatives. That means, if you are deciding between two houses you will not keep track of more than 10 pieces of Information about them combined (5 attributes each). Think if you had three, four or more house alternatives to decide upon. Also here we make decissions between different alternatives more and more often.What are the consequences of this information overload?: Cerebral Fatigue. The author describes the terms “cognitive overload” and “decision fatigue”. Consider that neurons are living cells with a metabolism; they need oxygen and glucose and when they are working hard, we experience fatigue. Additionally, we are not multi-task, so the author. The human brain has not developed over thousands of years to be multi task. Switching from one task to another also occurs at a neuronal cost.Finally, attention. We stay too long in the “central execute mode”, responsible for making decisions than we stay in the “daydreaming mode” (mind wandering mode), which is in fact the default, inward less energy consuming mode. When we are in daydreaming mode our attentional system swiches off. For instance, we are driving our car and all of a sudden we arrive to destination without having been conscious of the road we have travelled. Does it sound familiar to you? :-) Our brain changed to the inward vision. We might have planned the summer vacation during the journey or envisioned our dream house, etc.Before I move over to the conclusions, i.e., to the advices :-), let me share some interesting metrics in the book that reinforce what I have summarized so far:1) [...] “while 300 years ago someone with a college degree in Science knew as much as any expert on earth, today someone with a PhD in biology can’t even know all what is known about the nervous system of the squid”. Google only reports 30,000 articles on this topic. [...]2) The amount of information we take in each day is equivalent to the one contained in 175 newspapers. We process 34 Gb or 100,000 words a day. Youtube only uploads 6,000 hours of audio-video every hour. An average US citized has, stored in their PC, the equivalent to half a million books.3) The processing capacity of our conscious mind has been estimated to be 120 bit/s. When two persons talk to us at the same time, we already saturate our bandwith, so we can barely keep a conscious conversation with two persons who speak at the same time.4) The human brain is about 2% of a total adult body weight but it consumes 20% of all the energy the body uses. Thinking consumes a lot of calories.Ok, now, what to do for your health to think straight?:1) Engage more in the daydreaming mode. This is very healthy. It is neurologically proven. Internet does not help. Internet requires your attentional mode to be On.2) Read fiction books. It increases empathy, it increases also creativity and efficiency in all aspects of life.3) Be agreeable (cooperative, friendly, considerate and helpful. Put yourself in the place of others).4) Take naps. Even 5 - 10 min naps can turn around negative emotions and increase happiness. Three important processes occur during sleep: unitization, assimilation and abstraction, which help settle experiences gathered during the awake time as well as doubles the likelihood of solving problems.5) Value the long term goal rather than the short term “googlization”. That means, learn the old fashion way, write down things on paper, speak them outloud.6) Do your social networking at a designated time of the day, not as a constant interruption of other things. Awareness of an unread email or whatsapp can decrease IQ by 10 points.7) Categorize things. It reduces mental effort. Our brain has a strong propensity toward categories and order. The term is “cognitive economy”.8) Enjoy knowlege. Be a lifelong learner. Be curious and inquisitive.9) Practice serendipity. Today we enter usually the web browser and type in what we are looking for. Moreover, web searching machines filter out access to information based on our recent searches and other factors related to our profile. Escape from this. Reading things randomly impulses creativeness and facilitates engagement in the daydreaming mode.10) Externalize (outsource things to external means: calendar appointments, birthdays, all you can which can be outsourced).Long review and, believe me, it is not all. A book worth reading it."
46,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69056-ada,3,"Having read Kahneman's 'Thinking Fast and Slow', my expectations were perhaps too high. Daniel Levitin's book is a misnamed miscellany of thoughts about the human mind. It does contain valuable information, but it is definitely scattered rather than organized. Unlike Kahneman, Levitin does not provide quick summaries of his chapters- it is quite difficult to flip through this book and find the information you need. In his defence, his work reads well, and can certainly be read in a linear manner. The book's target audience seem to be middle-aged CEOs. A great deal of the solutions Levitin suggests are simply ridiculous to anyone with a budget restriction. I can't afford to have 3 pairs of eyeglasses in my home, nor can I delegate the tasks that need doing. I don't have a secretary. 'The Organized Mind' does contain valuable insights, particularly about daydreaming and multitasking, but most of them would be better contained in a series of articles than in this slightly erratic work."
47,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10266236-paul-gibson,5,"First, a quote from the final paragraph of last chapter:	""The best way to improve upon the brains that nature gave us is to learn to adjust agreeably to new circumstances.""	The book is positive and optimistic. 	My favorite tidbit was in his notes about critical thinking. He writes of the value of approximating any unknown value from the extremes, just close enough so as to become plausible by setting ""boundary conditions"". 	The author writes about the ""cookies"" (although I don't think he used the term) that are placed on your computer while you surf and search the Internet. He wrote of how these cookies narrow your searches to the things you have shown the most interest in. Although this can be helpful for your interests, it also makes a good metaphor for how the mind works. 	Most of us are born into a family, a religion, locale, and political beliefs that stay with most of us to some degree. In life, many of our searches are absorbed implicitly while our explicit searches restrict our thinking further. It is a fine book. It's an easy read and well worth it."
48,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/722092-j,3,"An interesting read that helped me understand more about the ways we process information. This is ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" by Kahneman- lite. This book is very clear with a lot of examples. The ""four-fold"" tables in the back are really helpful in applying the main concept of the book: properly calculating risk to make better decisions. This is extremely important with medical decision making. The later chapters discuss things we all should have learned in college. That is, understanding the reliability of information. In my opinion, college professors should guide students through difficult reading and also help them interpret the reliability of sources. There are all kinds of ways our thinking is biased and applying these methods helps us sort that out. I think most students see college as some kind of fact assembly or skills training. These are things we can learn on our own, if needed. Or skills we can obtain at technical colleges. The real value of a college education is that we become independent thinkers with the ability to assess and challenge information sources. "

This book really is a great resource in understanding why things are organized the way they are, even though the first half was a little more tedious to get through. The last half way great though, about organization and time management. And the last 20% of the book really made an argument for my profession, teaching your children information literacy!

64,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56799698-ville-salmensuu,5,"Plenty of neuroscience-based tips and insights for the information overload of our times. Much of the information I have come across from elsewhere. The book is at points repetitive but generally is a good overview and reminder to declutter your mind and life. Multitasking and interruptions are exhausting for your brain, memory and productivity. Single-tasking and flow is good for getting things done. You should also allow yourself to daydream, for creativity, a necessity for world- and life-changing insights. The world and business leaders, with their schedule and day-to-day priority management externalised to aides, can afford to be “happily lost”, with a Zen-like focus to the moment. A brain dump system like Getting Things Done (even on simple index cards) with regular review helps your brain not worry about undone tasks.Retrieving memories alters them - nothing is “read-only”. Human attentional systems are 1. mind-wandering mode (daydreaming) 2. central executive mode: prefrontal cortex, task-focused 3. attentional filter: noticing life-threatening events when driving on “autopilot”, 4. attentional switch: the ability to switch between 1 and 2. The classic Milner & Olds experiment on rats choosing to activate their reward center in the nucleus accumbens. They would continue doing so to exhaustion and starvation. Similar activation with humans and social media feeds. Reminds of the video game-induced deaths in China and South Korea. Agreeableness trait - cooperative, friendly, considerate and helpful, associated with frontal lobes, governing impulse control and ability to regulate negative emotions - with frontal damage agreeableness is often among the first to go. Even an agreeable friend protects against social problems. Why are people indirect with us? Serves a societal need. Context often more important than character to explain behaviour. In the “good samaritan” experiment theology students were less likely to help when in a hurry. The “fundamental attribution error” makes us attribute more context-dependence and diversity for in-group persons as opposed to out-group persons. As in xenophobia, their actions are seen more determined by their inborn characteristics. During the Cuban missile crisis Khruschev enabled a compromise solution by having Kennedy realise they were both in the same in-group - leaders of major world powers. Military action can often be counterproductive: we mistakenly think coercion will be more effective with our enemies than ourselves. Former US secretary of state George Schultz: “When I think about all the money we spent on bombs and munitions, and our failures in Viet Nam, Iraq, Afghanistan and other places around the world… Instead of advancing our agenda with force, we should have built schools and hospitals in these countries, improving the lives of their children. By now, those children would have grown into positions of influence, and they would be grateful to us instead of hating us.”Stay focused through your chores, maintain a single attentional set through to completion - don’t sidestop to other tasks triggered by your planned task. We tend to trust a 3rd party - experts and professionals who give you a diet, exercise program, etc - the brain has bias against our self-generated motivational systems - we are painfully aware of our own fretting and internal indecision.Low dopamine in the brain (and COMT mutation Val158Met) is related to creativity, cognitive flexibility, ease in task switching, poor focus. Enhancing our focus with dopamine-enhancing drugs such as methylphenidate (or modafinil) may inhibit our creativity: making connections, associations, expansive thinking. Sting the artist dedicates hours of non-distraction time daily for creative pursuits in the flow state - helps it with a “virtual room” set up in the concert venue, with same interior every time, reminding him of his home. Decision making triage: 1. decision can be made now as the answer is obvious 2. delegate to someone else who has more time or expertise 3. you have all the relevant information but need some time to process or digest the information. E.g. judges. Good to attach a deadline. 4. Need more information. Get a helper to get that information or make a note to obtain it yourself. Attach a deadline. Decision making in organisations. US president gets no easy problems to decide on - those would have been solved already. Usually both options have negative outcomes. Corporate leader tip: back up and find one truth that is indisputable “the most important thing at our hotel is the guest experience”, “no matter what, we cannot serve food that is not 100% fresh” - after core truth discovered, slowly creep forward through the problem and a solution will emerge. Subordinates need to come to the decision themselves and be comfortable with it. US Army effective leadership principles: 1. build cohesive teams through mutual trust 2. create shared understanding 3. provide a clear and concise set of expectations and goals 4. allow workers at all levels to exercise disciplined initiative 5. accept prudent risks. McGill Uni successfully motivated non-research staff by giving lunchtime talks about the research. Internal vs external locus of control - as a supervisor you would like to know your subordinate’s style. Experiment on how much information is optimal for decision making: optimum performance with ten to twelve pieces of information, but subjects at every level (of amount of information given) requested more information, even though this caused information overload and decline in performance. Consumers similarly make poor choices given more information. ""People or situations that appear to be representative of one thing effectively overpower the brain’s ability to reason, and cause us to ignore the statistical or base rate information.""On medical treatment decisions: doctors may have their biases too (wanting to offer a curative treatment for cancer, when number-needed-to-treat is high and side-effects very significant), may not be informed on statistics, potentially skewing fully informed consent. Patients are not better - ""I would feel like a fool if I didn’t take that extra treatment and the cancer came back”, however poor the expected utility of the treatment. Four types of patients (per Groopman and Hartzband): minimalist, maximalist, naturalist, technologist. Which one (ones) are you? Your doctor may like to know. What to teach children in this post-Wikipedia, post-Google world: be conscientious, agreeable, tolerant of others, help those less fortunate, take naps. Critical thinking/evaluation of sources. Lillard and Peterson experiment: SpongeBob, Fast-paced cartoon with “onslaught of fantastical events” had an immediate negative impact on four-year-olds’ executive function, including goal-directed behaviour, attentional focus, working memory, problem solving, impulse control, self-regulation, delay of gratification. When you make a mistake say to yourself: “how interesting! A mistake is an opportunity to learn!"

Still a good read, if a bit slow. Notes:(offloading by organizing things into categories so you don't have to remember individual items)Multi tasking exhausts you and leads to bad decision making.. Decision making network in your head doesn't prioritize, meaning decision overload can lead to unproductivity.Pause your inbox, hide or leave your phone somewhere else, reduce notificationsWriting things down and re sortingAll memory is in your brain its just filed and retrieved poorly. Can recolor memories like in Inside Out. Easier to remember unique or distinctive memories rather than routine. Memory also combines similar events like eating breakfast. Emotional memories are also easier to remember.Writing something down conserves the mental energy expended trying to remember itUse spatial memory*: letters with keys, clothes by the door, etc.Scan all receipts, make searchable, Adobe scan?Temporal sense, analysts, problem solving, planning, decision making all live in the prefrontal cortex.

Also, disconnect your self worth from the outcome of the task*People ignore the base rates especially for mildly likely events when explaining things in favor of unique or interesting or conspiratorial explanationsOptimal levels of information: 10 to 12 over 25 pieces of info but people always want more despite effectiveness declining. More can lead to overload. Research shows people are unable to ignore information that is irrelevant to them.Ad hoc arrangements outside company structures can allow for flexibility and being nimble and opportunistic. However under stress more structure within orgs is better (if people leave you know what they are responsible for and a replacement can step into a well defined role).

66,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531009-mikayla,2,"Ironically, this book suffers from information overload. If this overload were comprised primarily of ideas that would be fine, but the problem is that this book has roughly one idea per chapter (nine chapters), and the remainder of the 400 pages are examples illustrating his point -- over and over again. Levitin does a refreshingly good job of defining terms, but the information he presents is far from new. In fact, much of the book seems to be recycled from David Allen's 'Getting Things Done' and a few other books on memory and cognitive bias. I would recommend instead that someone read the following books, which cut to the chase more succinctly and offer better advice on how to apply these mnemonic and organizational concepts to your own life: Getting Things Done by David AllenOrganizing from the Inside Out by Julie MorgensternLevitin's presentation of how memories are made was good. I found Mary Carruthers' and Frances Yeats' work on memory more entertaining and thorough, but Levitin does a decent job of boiling down their research to fit into chapter two."
67,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64425508-jan-sp-rer,4,"Here are my key take-aways from the book:-Attentional memory: Possible to induce memory in many different ways. (p. xii)-Categories of human character: extroversion, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness to new experience, conscientiousness. Conscientiousness is highly associated with being organized. It comprises industriousness, self-control, stick-to-itiveness, and a desire for order. It is predictive of mortality, longevity, educational attainment, career success, and recovery from surgery. (p. xxi)-Processing capacity of conscious mind is 120 bits per second. (p. 7)-As humans got access to a wider range of food and exposure to more diverse dangers after leaving the life in trees behind, they opened their attentional filter to a broader range of stimuli. (p. 8)-Personal assistants serve as attentional filters. They determine what is the best use of the executive’s time. (p. 9)-Attentional filters are especially sensitive to change and importance. (p. 10)-The appearance of writing was met with fear for a loss of accountability and information overflow. The printing press caused similar reactions. (p. 14)-Experienced experts can direct their attention and focus on what is important by utilizing superior attentional filtering. (p. 18)-Shadow work: Many companies cause more inconvenience to their customers than before. (p. 19)-There is a relationship between categorization, attention, and memory. (p. 22)-Gibsonian affordances: Shift burden of organizing to the external world. (p. 35)-Daydreaming is the default brain state. (p. 38)-Daydreaming, central executive, attentional filter, the switching system (for switching tasks or between daydreaming and central executive) are four key parts of the brain. (p. 41)-Attention is continuous, neural areas with the highest activities are put into consciousness. (p. 44)-The daydreaming mode requires a balance between excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Dopamine and serotonine are also relevant. (p. 46)-Parts of the brain can be asleep while others are awake. (p. 48)-Categorize to do lists into: “Do,” “Delegate,” “Defer,” “Drop.”-Use a maximum of 4 types of things per storage unit. (p. 87)-Mislabeling is worse than not labeling. (p. 90)-Multitasking increases output of cortisol and adrenaline. Brings brain in a state of search for new stimuli. (p. 96)-Just having the opportunity to multitask may decrease IQ by 10 points. (p. 97)-Multitasking burns glucose. This glucose is also needeed to stay on task. (p. 98)-Up until the appearance of email, the mode of communication signaled its relevante and intent. Every email could be importants and requires a decision. Completing an email (sending or deleting/moving) causes a feeling of accomplishment. This is some form of neural addiction. (pp. 100-102)-Agreeableness is the most important trait for getting along with others. It comprises cooperativeness, friendliness, considerateness and helpfulness. (p. 129)-When doctors disclose and explain their mistakes openly, malpractice lawsuits are significantly reduced. (p. 134)-Gricean maxims for communication: Quantity of information, quality, manner (appropriate words and sentences), relation/relevance. (p. 139)-Oxytocin is the love hormone, lower in people with autism, increases trust, reduces cortisol. (p. 142)-We believe that our own lives are filled with more diversity than other people's’ lives. Fundamental attribution error means that we explain other people's’ behavior with their character and not with the situation. The in-group out-group bias works similarly and even in groups where participants are randomly assigned and do not know each other. Racism is a combination of belief perseverance, out-group bias, categorization error, and faulty inductive reasoning. (pp. 144-146, 152-153)-Study participants chose pictures of potential sexual partners when they were deceived into thinking that they had an increased heart rate when looking at them. (pp. 150-151)-Natural selection has limited influence on the aging process. Hayflick limit restricts the number of times a cell can split and further restricts age. (p. 164)-Most of the prefrontal cortex’s connections to other brain regions are inhibitory. This leads to impulse control. (p. 166)-An overgrowth of dopaminergic neurons in the frontal lobes leads to autism, a reduction leads to Parkinson’s and ADD. (p. 167)-Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, cover windows, keep room cold. (p. 192)-Procrastination helps to delay the risk of failure and damage to our self-worth. Dopamine in the prefrontal cortex helps to stay on task, dopamine in the limbic system causes pleasure. Procrastination is a function of (time to complete task + distractibility + delay of positive feedback) / (self-confidence + task value). (pp. 198-199)-Do not neglect little tasks when working on a big project. Set aside a time each day to deal with these tasks. (pp. 211-212)-The feeling of time running out makes people behave like older people. They tend to favor familiar experiences. Young people focus on negative memories and learn from them. (pp. 216-217)-Bayes’s rule helps to refine estimates. (p. 231)-We function best if we are under some constraints and are allowed to exercise individual creativity within those constraints. (p. 287)-Being an early riser makes people happier, more conscientious, and productive. (p. 292)-Studies show that people ask for too much information and make their decisions worse. (p. 310)-In general, a business that is highly structured and has less ad-hoc reporting arrangements is more resilient under stress. (pp. 318-319)-Alexa.com helps to validate the trustworthiness of a website. (p. 342)"

The title also failed to describe it. I ended up skipping the last chapters for how dull and unrelated they are. But, aside to all that, I have learned some valuable things that are worth the three stars:1. How our minds are addicted to categorization.2. The two cognitive modes: Focus and Wandering.3. Cognitive Overload happens when we fail to deal with issues at hand. They become stuck in our brain. We must deal with them immediately or externalize them.4. Physical Note Cards as a productivity hack is pretty cool and intuitive (I tried it!).If you have the power to withstand a lot of scientific words and divergences, and the above lessons seems interesting for you, then go ahead and read it.

As a mathematician, I was particularly taken by Levitin's clear and practical examples of the application of Bayesian probabilities, and how using a clever four-fold table heuristic he makes it accessible to all and convincingly exemplifies the logical fallacies we can fall prey to if we do not employ such rational analysis. Some of his recommendations for organising our lives can seem like overkill, but he gently convinced me that the benefit that externalising provides to our mental wellbeing, and in turn to our energy, creativity and joy, is well worth the initial investment in learning and instilling new habits and routines.

I could have ""really liked"" this book if it were a bit more concise but it seemed disorganized, occasionally. There is some great information shared here but the writer goes off on too many long-winded tangents to support his points. I kept thinking how ironic it was that a book about ""thinking straight in the age of information overload"" overloaded me with so much information that, at times, I couldn't think straight and/or even remember what the writer was originally writing about.Again, 3 1/2 stars but I'm rounding up because 3 would be too low."
71,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2743707-thiruppathi-muthukumar,3,"I've taken almost a year to complete this book. A good read; felt bit dense at the end due to overwhelming info on probability & statistics.- 35% of the book has decent insights and pointers to have organised mind; - 35% has boring stuff such a history, studies, surveys, researches, medical facts; - 30% of the book is just footnotes & appendix section. If you don't like to read facts, statistics, surveys & studies you may find it boring; some of the points are well understood without redundant examples; IMHO Levitin should have avoided such examples; Few of the take aways worth mentioning:- A little bit of inaccuracy saves a great deal of explanation.- Our trouble is not the overall absence of smartness but the intractable power of pure stupidity.- We remember things better, and longer, if we discover them ourselves rather than being told them explicitly.- AVE. Authenticate, Validate, and Evaluate.- it’s not having the information that’s important, it’s what you do with it.- Faster is not always desirable, and going straight to what you want is not always better.- Man with one watch always knows what time it is; a man with two watches is never sure."

I had to put the book down every now and then to share something I read with another person...it's just that kind of book. I should be really popular at the next dinner party I attend.

He dissects each mode in details with well versed and in-depth model.

This book really takes some focused study and for a busy overloaded person, I was hoping to avoid the information overload that was the first part of this book. There are some very practical tools, but they are trenched in the WHY and so you have to keep going back to remember them. A great resource if you're doing a paper or need to know the psychological/physiological issues of information overload, but way too much for the layman. "

I liked part one, which was more of the neuroscience, but in part two the author really started to lose me. Especially the chapter on medicine—it began to feel like I was reading an entirely different book, one about statistics that was vaguely connected to neuroscience with a few throwaway comments about how our brains are bad at probability analysis. It felt as though Levitin wanted this to be both a neuroscience book and a self-help book, when he should really just stick to the former. "

There must be a repository of productivity book examples out there, because they seem to be recycled time and time again. For instance the Fermi question mentioned in the last chapter (‘How many piano tuners are there in Chicago?’) also appears in Epstein’s Range that I finished a couple of weeks ago, only there the question was about New York. The audiobook version is not great.

I lost interest when the author went into extreme detail many times on how to organize with examples of different methods. An alright one time read but you can skip this one if you are already organized.
102,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8062319-kalyn,2,"For a book claiming to reduce information overload, the author should have written this in a more concise way. There were a lot of great points about reducing decision fatigue, prioritizing, and multi-tasking, but where the book went from interesting to painstakingly dry were in the over-abundance of examples. Extremely detailed examples. In other words, I did a lot of skipping around. My biggest takeaway was this: Rely on external factors (and not yourself) to remember and organize ALL the things. Now, you don't have to spend four months slogging through the 400+ pages like I did."

105,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55040155-adam-smith,5,"The media bombardment of the 21st century takes a toll on our minds. The line between what we own and what we do not has blurred to gray. Not only that, but attainment of knowledge is more accessible than ever. With everything at the touch of our fingertips, there is increasingly more pressure to keep up with the news, politics, newest innovations, local current events, global happenings, newest lifestyle “hacks”, and our increasingly consuming agenda. However, amongst this chaos, the “HSP’s”, or “Highly Successful Persons”, as referenced by Daniel J. Levitin, seem to float down this turbulent stream of media with ease and precision. How? That is the crux of the issue in Levitin’s book, The Organized Mind.Levitin does an effective job at addressing strategies to combat information overload in all areas of our lives. He does this with a conversational tone that isn't condescending or overly casual. One insight that can succinctly sum the most important principle from the book is this, “the one that is most critical to keeping us from forgetting or losing things, is this: Shift the burden of organizing from our brains to the external world.” Despite the readability and simplicity of focus, it is still dense with insights and information to keep even the most knowledgeable reader interested.  The book itself is well written and extremely organized; it is very reader-friendly as he breaks down some difficult topics for the reader that require extensive knowledge and years of schooling in order to understand. A similar book to The Organized Mind would be Being Wrong, by Kathryn Schulz. In her book, Schulz discusses the processes and results of error and mistakes. Schulz’s writing style is similar to that of Levitin’s, as she also gives varieties of examples, from everyday experiences to historical or scientific references. Daniel Levitin’s, The Organized Mind, is separated into three parts and nine chapters. Part one contains chapters one and two. It tackles the overwhelming amount of data we as humans are subjected to and how we face difficulty processing and managing it all. Furthermore, it explains how attention and memory work through a complex system of processing, filtering, and categorization of stimuli from the environment, which is vital to the basis of human nature. Part two contains chapters three to seven. Chapter three deals with organizing our home’s infrastructure to become more organized. Chapter four argues that as humans we organize our social lives through reasoning, understanding, and experiences of our social environment and society as a collective whole. In chapter five Levitin specifically analyzes how we organize our time, our attention span (or the lack thereof), and why we procrastinate. He then explains how these variables can be vastly different for many activities we participate in and how they are dynamic throughout everyone's life. Chapter six talks about how we organize information in order to make the hardest decisions in life, especially medical ones. He mentions how a lot of people are misinformed about procedures and surgeries, specifically because this data is improperly reported and skewed. Levitin discusses how this leads to poor decision making on extremely important events in our lives. Chapter seven elaborates on the organization of businesses. He admires them as extremely efficient systems and delves into the importance of utilizing and fulfilling specific roles within the corporation in order to be successful. Part three contains the last two chapters. Chapter eight gives useful tips on what to teach our children in order for them to be productive citizens in society, because they are the ones obligated to organize the world in the future. Chapter nine talks about the power of our junk drawer and how it is important that we don't categorize all the information we take in, only to put it in a single folder in our mind. By doing this, Levitin argues, we are actually more organized and efficient in some cases.A factor that makes this book more interesting is its dual perspective. Not only does Levitin talk about the importance of organizing one’s mind, but he also states the advantages that come when the brain can escape into “wandering” mode and creativity can flow freely. Therefore, the advice in this book is not only applicative to the Type A, left-brained individuals out there, but rather anyone looking to be more efficient with their time. As a result, The Organized Mind is for anyone looking to be released from the confinement and pressure of weight of the world’s knowledge, and instead, make the knowledge work for them."

107,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11215896-nina,5,"You will learn so much from this book, not just how to organize things, but also about interesting people who manage to do what we all long for: Leading a meaningful and creative life without being haltered by day-to-day stresses that comes from busy calendars and our own forgetfulness. I absolutely loved this book, even if I knew much of the research from studying psychology. But the research was tied to concrete examples, making the book more interesting. "
108,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2601228-nicolas-levy,4,"The Organized Mind provides a helpful overview of recent research in behavioural psychology that has implications for our everyday lives. Similar to Daniel Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow, this book develops a framework in which there are two states for our attention system: the central executive, in which we are intentional and focused, and the mind-wanderer, in which we are creative and associative. Most of the book is organized along this spectrum, and Levitin reviews when and how to make the most of each frame of mind in our professional, social, and personal lives. I find that he is particularly strong in describing how to make tough health-related decisions, such as whether to opt for a surgery that has a chance of improving a health condition, but also carries the risk of side effects. His chapter on how our work organizations are structured also provides some food for thought in terms of striking the right balance between efficient hierarchies vs. creative, nimble structures for different types of work projects. In general, there isn't much new insight in this book, and there is a lot of overlap with other popular psychology books, e.g. Thinking, Fast and Slow. Nevertheless, The Organized Mind is a useful, thorough compilation of how to think intentionally about when, to what extent, and how we want to organize the various aspects of our lives."
109,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26539847-kristen,1,"This book has an interesting topic, but was very poorly written, and could have used a good and proper editor. The main issue being over writing and profuse examples and repetition. Perhaps this is because I've studied cognitive science in university, but I suspect not. Saying the same thing a hundred times doesn't help solidify your proof - it makes for a boring read. Looping back around after a point has been made, again and again. Things were said in the most superfluous way, and I couldn't help but think of someone trying to hit a word counter for their professor. In the end, after giving this book several good attempts, after 2 years on my side table and being just over half way through...speed reading and skiping vast portions of the last bit.... C'est la vie: I give up!"
110,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1300121-trisha,5,"In 1970 Alvin Toffler published his bestselling book Future Shock in which he coined the term “information overload” warning that technological changes were occurring faster than people could keep up with them. If that was true before the internet arrived on the scene, it’s even more of an issue now according to neurological psychologist Daniel Levitin, author of this fascinating overview of how our fast-pasted, technologically driven culture effects our brains and what we can do about it. In addition to exploring recent neuroscientific research to explain how our amazingly complex brains process and retrieve information, Levitin provides practical tips about how to more efficiently manage just about every aspect of our busy lives at home, at work and everywhere in between. Some of what he says is just plain common sense: write things down, categorize and compartmentalize, put things away in the same place, cut down on distractions, get plenty of rest, etc. But much of what he advocates goes against the grain of popular culture with its emphasis on instant gratification, its obsession with gadgetry, and its addiction to texting, tweeting and other forms of social media. For example, Levitin points to research that indicates the myth of multi-tasking is just that (a myth) because while it tempts us to believe we’re efficiently doing several things at the same time, all we’re doing is switching quickly back and forth between tasks without giving our full attention to any of them. Efficient maybe, but not very focused. He says the most important thing to teach children is how to be curious, and inquisitive lifelong learners, and that doesn’t happen because they know how to manipulate the keyboards on their cute little electronic devices. What children- and all of us – really need to learn is how to think clearly and intelligently, completely, critically and creatively in order to sort through the massive amount of information at our fingertips and figure out what to do with it . It reminds me of what John Naisbitt said in 1980: “We are drowning in information but starved for wisdom.” That was before the advent of Wikipedia and if ever we need proof that information alone isn’t the most reliable route to wisdom, Wikipedia is it! On the Web, anything goes which is why Levitin says “more so than at any other time in history, it is crucial that each of us takes responsibility for verifying the information we encounter, testing it and evaluating it.” This is a book that takes time to read – and the fact that some people criticize it for that reason is an indication of how important it is for them to slow down and start paying attention."

112,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9038650-akrabar,4,"A good book although I could have done without the diatribe on pseudo-science and alternative medicine. Here is my summary - Management1) take ""hard copy"" to do lists (pen and paper/notebook).

So group similar tasks together; email, chores, pay bills, etc.3) Set aside time for ""unitasking""; no distractions, just one task (writing, creative process, etc)4) sleep is important for “assimilation”; do not neglect5) Procrastinating: do it now; do the most unpleasant tasks first thing in the morning to get it out of the way6) Creative work: flow state: no fear; healthy medium between boredom and anxiety7) Creative work: when you get an idea/brainstorm drop whatever you are doing and write it down immediately, carry a notebook with you always.8) “mind clearing exercise”: if there are any things which are bothering you, you thin you may forget, write it down immediately. It lets you focus.9) “five minute rule”; if there is something I can do in 5 minutes now, do it right now. Else prioritize and do later. Set aside time each day for dealing with these things.Organizing information for hard decisions1) decisions you can make right now2) decisions you can delegate (someone else has more time/expertise) 3) decisions for which you have all information but need time to digest4) decisions for which you need more informationMiscellaneous1) One can be creative even while working under constraints.

113,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/183661-nikos,4,"I have long despised books with practical recipes, the kind of 'how to get rich', 'lose weight' or 'find the perfect partner' books. The reason being that they were( most of them still are) largely unscientific, based on anecdotal evidence and appealing mainly to our hunger for quick fixes. This one is a book aiming to get us organised, so it is a recipe book. But it comes with a twist. There is a scientific basis. The author is a psychologist himself and also has had some experience from the business world working as an assistant to a big company CEO. Levitin lays down the basic principles early on in the book,relates them to neuro/psychological research, and then sets out to apply them in the various aspects of our lives, like home organisation, health issues, business etc. He has assembled a lot of corroborating evidence which can also be read as trivia. Most of it is interesting but some is boring. The book is well written and does not require linear reading: once you finish the basics then you can jump to the chapter that mostly interests you without difficulty.Since this is not a book of fiction, neither a pure scientific book, the real question about it is: ""do the advices given work?"" As a testimony to this I have to say that I started reading it last summer and then stopped halfway for irrelevant reasons. Then I caught it up again a few days ago and, upon remembering gradually the whole thing, to my astonishment, found that I had already implemented some of the basic recipes and had already yielded results. Practical advises are always tricky. You can underestimate them easily. True appreciation comes with experience. Considering that humans are prone to resist change, I find the so-far outcome in myself, rather impressive. But I am pretty sure, that there are people who have done most of the things recommended by the book, unknowingly and naturally. To them the book will appear trivial. So, before starting it, make an honest appraisal of how much organised you are and by what means, preferably write it down and then use these notes to compare to what the book suggests, and draw your conclusions. As far as I am concerned, I think it paid off."
114,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44046934-archyz,4,"Overall a good book, gives some good insights about productivity, mind organization issues and memory. This book strongly makes the case against multitasking. The author emphasizes (sometimes, even a bit too much) about a place called prefrontal cortex in our brains that is very vital to everyday functioning. To illustrate how important it is, Daniel Levitin says that one reversible way to show how life is with prefrontal cortex damage, is to get really drunk. Now imagine being all the time in this state without being able to go to a normal state, this is how people are when this area is damaged, and it's kind of scary to a point.One thing that I didn't like not as a content issue, but more of a writing style issue - that the author tends to normally explain things in simple terms, but then suddenly rambles for one paragraph in scientific terms, and then goes back to again simple explanations as if nothing happened earlier.As said earlier, a very good book. If you are interested in reading about some insights how our brain works, this probably is a good starter."
115,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1541562-diane,3,"I wanted to like this book more than I did. It also took me a really long time to read because of the way the author chose to do huge information dumps about specific topics.The information was good, but I found it to be too much to parse altogether. His points about being organized, both in the external world and the internal world, have been better explained elsewhere. I've been investigating how to be the best organized me for a while and I really hoped this book would shed some light on things I hadn't considered.Key Take-Aways:* Use the external world to hold more of the information in your head. Keeping it in your head means you will lose it or forget it, so set up systems that work for you to store, access, and retrieve information.* We as humans are terrible when it comes to percentages, and especially terrible when it comes to making decisions about medical procedures (10% of failure vs. 90% chance of success - not as good as you think!). Re-read the section on the medical information processing so you can make better decisions about health stuff.* Have a junk drawer, both for physical and mental stuff. It's actually more useful than you think.* Daydream. Make time for NOT being organized, because this state is where we get our great ideas, and the organized part of our minds is where we make the ideas come to life.I'll probably refer back to this book for the medical section, but other parts were truly a rehash of information I already knew. Your mileage may vary."
116,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9533949-kimball,5,"5.5 maybe even 6 stars. This book was awesome. I loved all the detailed examples he gives. And it goes into a wide variety of topics, too.The best part was that he quoted The Glass Castle! My favorite.Let's dive into the notes:Memory is fallible, not so much because of storage limitations but because of retrieval limitations. Every conscious experience is stored in the mind. It's just hard to get it out.The five characteristics of human differences can be organized into, 1) extroversion 2) agreeableness 3) neuroticism 4) openness to new experiences 5) conscientiousness. Of these five the conscientiousness trait comprises industriousness, self control, stick-to-it-iveness, and a desire for order. It is the best predictor of many important human outcomes. Satisficing is one of the foundations of productive human behavior. We shouldn't waste time trying to find improvements that won't make a significant difference in our happiness or satisfaction. A good example of everyone being a satisficer is cleaning the house. It's ""good enough"". The cost benefit analysis of satisficing is an equilibrium between effort and benefit. Happy people engage in satisficing. They are happy with what they already have not happy if they have more.Americans take in 5 times as much information than we did in the 80's. Attention is the most essential mental resource for any organism.The attention filter detects change not constancy.Literature came because of business and writing receipts. Not from arts. (The book I read after this disagreed with this statement.)Language helps us make distinctions.A lot of companies do shadow work. They transfer the work the company should do to the consumer for free labor instead. Examples, bagging/scanning your own groceries, paying bills through a company's website. I hate this. Because prices aren't getting discounted. Attention has a cost and is a zero sum game. You pay attention to something else and it costs you to not pay attention to another thing.Memory retrieval requires our brains to sift through multiple competing instances to pick out just the ones we're trying to recollect. Sometimes the mind will combine all the events in one if nothing stood out. The unusual events are the ones that easily stand out. The second principle of memory concerns emotions. If something made us frightened, elated, sad, or angry (four of the primary human emotions), we're more likely to remember it. The brain creates neurochemical tags and highlights it for us. I do the same with geographic events. Since I love geography. The hippocampus helps us know the spatial location of things.4 rules for tasks: Do it, delegate it, defer it, or drop it. Always do the two minute tasks right away.The problem with making decisions is we are often making them with uncertainty. You're uncertain of the outcome, you feel regret if you make the wrong decision. If more information will remove that uncertainty then figure out what that information is and how to obtain it. Lobster was fed to prisoners in the 1800's because they were so plentiful and no one wanted to eat them. Now look what the marketers have done to us. We're such suckers and we don't realize it. We give everything value of what we're willing to pay for it.Use the environment to remind you of things to do. I always do this by putting something by the door so I don't forget it the next day. We should be offloading memories onto the physical world rather than your crowded mental world.Something you use two weeks out of the year, shouldn't be in the way 50 weeks of the year. Put that crap into storage. Lots of multi-tasking requires decision-making. So it's a double whamming. The reason why our memories are good as kids is because we had a childlike sense of wonder and we had a sense of adventure more often. For example, taking a pill as a kid is so novel, they're worried about chocking on it, but adults take pills all the time, and think of 12 things while taking the pill so that experience is too common to remember. But living in the moment and having that Zen like being present experience helps us remember things more. We should reclaim that sense of newness.We expect our partners to help us achieve our full potential in life, and increasingly they do. Our increased desire for our partners to do all these things is rooted in a biological need to connect deeply to with at least one other person. When it is missing, making such a connection becomes a high priority. And that need is fulfilled by a satisfying intimate relationship and the benefits are both psychology and physiological. Couples in such a relationship have better health, are happier, and live longer. The most important trait for getting along with others is agreeableness. To be agreeable is to be cooperative, friendly, considerate, and helpful. These are stable across the lifetime and develop in childhood.Online dating people are more likely to admit they're fat than they're Republican.Social rejection causes the same kind of reaction in the brain as physical pain does.Our ancient ancestors had a bimodal sleep. They slept for 4 hours then were awake for an hour or two then went back to bed for another 4 hours. Our body clock prefers a 25 hour day. We can easily stay awake an extra hour a day than give up an hour. Women are less likely to procrastinate.A year goes by twice as fast to a 40 year old than a 10 year old.I liked his friend's thoughts on insurance. I need to be his friend.Supposedly the POTUS is supposed to write letters for people who have accomplished life events such as Eagle Scout, turning 100 years old, being married for 50 years and so forth. I've done all of these and haven't gotten a single letter, dang it. A 60 hour work week, although 50% longer than a 40 hour work week, reduces productivity by 25%. So it takes two hours of overtime to accomplish one hour of work. A ten minute nap can be equivalent to an hour and a half of sleep at night.Probabilities that a hard drive will fail after 5 years is 50% or greater. I need to replace mine, it's almost 10 years old.I like how he talks about the Penske file.I loved the last sentence: ""the key to change is having faith that when we get rid of the old, something or someone even more magnificent will take its place."""
117,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30840530-marc,2,"This was a frustrating book to read. I'm familiar with many of the topics in this book and I was hoping to get some practical advice and maybe learn a few new things. My frustration came from the fact those nuggets of insight are there, but are buried in a disorganized mess of non sequiturs. Oh, the irony of reading a book called the ""The Organized Mind"" and feeling that an editor should have had a come to Jesus meeting with the author. Sections are poorly titled and the chapters run far too long across various topics, straying far and wide from their stated purpose. For instance, a chapter on ""What to teach our children"" goes on at great length on the pros and cons of crowdsourcing information from sites such as Wikipedia. Is it relevant to the topic? Perhaps, indirectly. However, the writing seems more intent on dumping out lots of random information than on sticking to a concise narrative. I couldn't help but take a big sigh each time the author took yet another detour from the main themes.This book really should be maybe 50-70% shorter than it currently is. Instead, it feels like the author emptied his junk drawer onto the written page. While he is no doubt an expert in his field, unfortunately he failed to transform his insights into compelling prose. Ultimately this book tried to appeal to both generalists and specialists and be all things to all people and it just couldn't do it."
118,052595418X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18840302-adelyne,4,"(+) This is a well-researched and well-presented book, with many specific references quoted for those interested to read up more on the topic. Levitin writes well, however for reasons that I can’t quite put my finger on, the book doesn’t flow as well as it could have and (perhaps this is on purpose!) I found myself daydreaming from time to time while reading. (+/-) The book is presented in multiple contexts, and with the same points essentially being repeated over and over. After a while, you sort of get that multitasking is a bad idea be it when trying to work or trying to pay the bills at home. For a book of its length (just over 400 pages) there are relatively few key take-home messages, I think I could pretty much condense down the material to 10 or so sentences, 3 of which are already on the back of the book. Overall: A good read overall, one that I would recommend to others but not necessarily one that I would re-read as conceptually I don’t think there’s much more I could take away from it, there isn’t much to ponder over. Could be less repetitive, but as I liked the use of different examples, would require some restructuring of the content. The summary on the back could have been less of a spoiler though, having read the entire book I somehow feel like I got half the message just reading the blurb! 3.5 stars, probably good enough for 4 on Goodreads, now I’m off to zone out for a bit.

I gradually went from 1.0x up to 2.5x over maybe three days. I tried 3.0x but it was too fast. I could follow, but not for very long, I was just getting tired. 2.5x was fine though.'The Organized Mind' doesn't present new, original ideas. It is a compilation of what we know about the human mind, and how to best harness it. This includes tricks that we can employ to make our mind do what we want it to.It isn't a self-help book promoting one concrete idea, or trying to bind everything by one simple rule. If there is a rule, it's ""this is what we know about how human mind works"". I imagine that depending on reader's current needs, different chapters would be relevant at different times. For me, the most relevant ones, at this point, were about procrastination, and categorization. It inspired me to take a new approach to organizing my papers at home.I feel that if I read it again, I would take another portion of inspiration, from other chapters. The nice thing about the book is that it isn't necessary to read it front to back. Each chapter is a separate entity."
