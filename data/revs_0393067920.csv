0,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,3,"This is a book that is trying to be two very different things at the same time, which I suppose, given the subject, is apt. But that doesn't necessarily make it a good idea. On the one hand we find a really quite in-depth exploration of the development of quantum theory. There are some genuinely valuable insights and explanations, with significantly more use of equations than is common in popular science book, but rarely in a way that is scary. On the other hand, it churns out all the hackneyed attempts to base art on science that inevitably are either amateurish or cringemaking - plus presenting some of the more outrageous history of science ideas that emerged from the 1960s when everything had to break the mould and be provocative, however far fetched their ideas seemed.I can imagine this was done to try to broaden the audience of the book. I can just see the marketing people thinking 'Popular science readers will love it, and so will arty types, so we'll sell lots more copies.' In practice, I think the reverse will happen, because a fair number of popular science enthusiasts will be put off by the wishy-washy science-as-metaphor stuff, while the arts types will find the hard core popular science tedious. I'm not quite sure how in touch the academic authors are with the real world either. At one point we are told that Planck's equation E=hν is 'one of the few equations recognizable by the public.' Really? They've clearly been on campus for too long and need to get out more.There is so much good material in the science parts that it's a real shame that the reader has to plough through pages of the hand waving to get to it. We are told at one point, with enthusiasm and no sense of criticism, about the work of Valerie Laws, who in 2002 spray painted words onto sheep, enabling the flock to spell out randomly(ish) generated phrases. Apparently a spokesperson for Northern Arts, which funded this venture, said the result was 'an exciting fusion of poetry and quantum physics.' And the artist commented 'I decided to explore randomness and some of the principles of quantum mechanics, through poetry, using the medium of sheep.' You couldn't parody this as a worse example of old-fashioned flaky linking of science and art. It's a ready-made Monty Python sketch. This had nothing to do with quantum physics.There is plenty of great material in here if you want to expand a basic popular science understanding of quantum physics with a bit more depth, but you will have to wade through a lot of unnecessary material to get to it. Mostly the content seems spot on, though I was slightly concerned about a certain flexibility in the history of science presented when we hear, for instance, that returning from the 1911 Solvay conference 'British scientist Ernest Rutherford brought word back to England, where he shared his excitement with an entranced young Danish visitor, Niels Bohr.' Apart from Rutherford being a New Zealander, Bohr didn't meet Rutherford until the end of 1911 and I've never seen any suggestion that Rutherford was the first to bring the early quantum theory to Bohr's attention. So, approach with caution - but if you are tolerant (possibly more tolerant than me), you might enjoy it."
1,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,4,"This is an interesting book coming out of a course taught in Stony Brook on the cultural impact made by discoveries in quantum mechanics (QM). If you are interested in QM, this is a fairly light-hearted good read, full of historical accounts, jokes, and stories about arts inspired/helped/influenced by QM lingo. This is not a book to explain QM to you. Crease may be versed in the math and physical concepts through teaching the course, but he's professor in Philosophy, not physics. It's one of those books that are good, even gripping, but ultimately you don't go through a ""paradigm shift"" after reading it. And many of the historical accounts are encountered in other general books about physics, I'm not sure there is a lot of new materials in that department. Nevertheless, since QM is a subject close to my heart, to me, this is a 3.5 star rounded up. YMMV."
2,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/310403-kyle,4,"Taking a familiar route from Newtonian physics into the ""now for something completely different"" variations of reality brought to science through quantum physics, the author breakdown the philosophical and artistic response to the fledgling theory that bolted into quantum mechanics and rewrote the rest of the twentieth century. Some intriguing diversions into the writing of innovators, skeptics and supporters, mostly presented in between-chapter interludes that never really get bogged down by formulae. The authors have a heavy hand for ""fruitloopery"" when mystics or quacks grab hold of a quantum concept, yet they prop up their own brand of marginalia like Quantum of Solace, Will Grayson, Will Grayson and Bull Durham as questionable literary sources. The final chapter and conclusion stand as a rallying call for an integration of science and humanities that on one hand could simply be marketing material for their course, but on the other hand (anything quantum seems to have an equally likely scenario) could be just the thing to lead into publishing interdisciplinary entanglement. Exciting times, this century-plus long moment!"
3,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,4,"The authors, one a philosopher the other a physicist draw on their training and six years of co-teaching to dramatize the quantum’s rocky path from scientific theory to public understanding. The book explores the quantum’s manifestation in everything from art and sculpture to the prose of John Updike. Understanding and appreciation the quantum language and imagery, and recognizing its misuse, is part of what is means to be an educated person today according to the authors.The authors recount a series of historical moments that occurred during the development of quantum mechanics in order to demonstrate how quickly scientific language worked its way into the artistic world. The author’s vivid storytelling of Einstein’s theories of relativity to Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle to modern conception of causality. Crease and Goldhaber keep the discussion of these complex topics clear and fun to read. Pop culture took to the quantum cause with far more gusto than most physicists. Experimentalist Robert Milliken tried to kill the idea, but his lab results kept confirming it. It is fascinating that concepts imagined 100 years ago will influence the physical and intellectual spaces we inhabit in the future. I read this as an audio book downloaded from Audible. Sean Runnette narrated the book."
4,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9892457-lisa,4,"This book is set up with the scientific explanations of the discussed concepts as ""Interludes"" at the end of each chapter. I did not understand most of the Interludes, but that's my own fault for never making it to the calculus math level. One of the main points in this book is the concept of what the authors call ""fruitloopery,"" or the hi-jacking of the language of quantum mechanics, to explain human phenomena, when the speaker does not understand the term. They say ""...popular discourse...does not necessarily respect technical explanations, [or understand them!] and often adopts and transforms scientific terms for its own purposes"" (222). They concentrate on the use of the phrase ""quantum leap"" (which does not mean a large step, quite the opposite) and the Schrodinger's cat example. They say it's fine to use these terms in non-scientific settings as long as you know that they mean. And ""...talking about...quantum mechanics...only becomes fruitloopery - wacky and pretentious - when its metaphorical origin is forgotten and its meaning is considered to come from its origin rather than how it's used, as if its scientific origin gave it special, magical powers"" (227). An interesting, if complicated, read."
5,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2428551-mark,3,"While this book held some promise, I abandoned it by page 44 due to time constraints and so many others to read. I think the authors style was approachable but I was deterred by their frequent use of formulae and terminology that were a little beyond me. If I had the time to explore, with other sources, that terminology and the concepts they were discussing in a little more detail I might have enjoyed the book more by being able to follow it better, but of course that would have entailed a lot of work. They would colloquially set the stage by introducing the characters and the history and then throw in scientific detail that would lose me. I'm too rusty on calculus and math to easily follow the discussion. I understand that math and formulas are fundamental to the detailed exploration of physics and quantum mechanics, but I guess I'm not that interested in exploring the topic at that detail. I feel like, to enjoy this book, I would need to brush up on my calculus and my physics terminology."
6,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7487616-peter-aronson,4,"I like this book's focus both on quantum mechanics itself and on its impact on society. I suspect its a good thing that one of the writers was an actual physicist, since left to themselves, philosophers tend to wander off into philosophy, which is of little use to anyone. "
7,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4,a little bit different book on Quantum mechanics. It explores more of its effects on culture both high and pop while exploring what QM means. Should appeal to many a humanities major. Fun stuff.
8,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1986795-grazyna-nawrocka,4,"Even although the book is considered ""popular science,"" I had problems understanding some of the concepts, that's why I gave it 4 stars. I still find it a good read. Some of information provided made me questioning if this is even science. Using in Planck formula ""some integer,"" (like it doesn't matter if it is 1 or 500,000?), or applying ""imaginary object,"" (not specifying details; what, we do not have enough of real ones?). No wonder Einstein suggested that we might not have enough variables to connect the dots in quantum theory.Interesting statement by J.W.N. Sullivan about uncertainty's principle: ""Science has become aware that its knowledge is a particularly restricted kind of knowledge. Also, it has no exclusive claim to truth. It is admitted that there may be kinds of knowledge which are valid, even though they have not been, and cannot be reached by scientific methods.""In the other place Einstein says: ""It is only in quantum theory that Newton's differential method becomes inadequate, and indeed strict causality fails us."" [i. e. - some experiments are not driven by cause and effect, and probably cannot be replicated exactly].What I can relate to, is that if wave moves, than we cannot establish exact position, because it continuously changes, and if we decide to find out position, than it cannot be wave, but can be a particle. When it comes to something at the same time dead and alive, only compelling example I found is of a star, whose light we still see, but it has been dead for many million years.The fact that one electron can pass through two different slots simultaneously makes me question if maybe there is even more microscopic division inside the electron, that we cannot see yet (I'm closer here to Einstein's hope, that we just lack of knowledge to interpret the situation properly)."
9,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8940799-liuhh,3,"3.5/5Although draggy at the start, this book does offer interesting perspectives that other books on Quantum Mechanics do not, that is the philosophical view, for example analysing the impact the Pauli exclusion principle has on human identity. It clarifies misconceptions like how the Schrödinger’s equation as a calculation tool does not mean the system really is in all those states, but only the probability that each one will become real. This has helped me realise the Schrödinger's Cat thought experiment is in fact not an accurate representation of what Quantum Mechanics entails and in fact, is a criticism of the Copenhagen interpretation. Recommended for anyone interested not only in the math and physics concepts of Quantum Mechanics but also the impacts on popular culture. And a quote referenced in the book that I found very enlightening:“Does the moon exist at a time for which no objective physical events whatsoever — photographic images, tides, or anything of the kind — can be interpreted as allowing us to conclude the presence of this allegedly massive, reflective object relatively near the Earth? No, under such circumstances it does not! And what a shock this would indeed be! But note that this is rather a far cry from the apparent claim that if we humans all chose to avert our eyes the moon would go out of existence, and is recreated by us (each of us) at the instant we choose to look up again. Mind has not created matter.” — Marshall Spector"
10,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,2,"Not very good. I don’t think the book lived up to it’s promises. It tried to be both a science explainer and a cultural history book and fails at both. The science is not explained well, in fact, it seems as though you have to know the science before reading the book. The cultural history seems to be statements and lists without any real context as to how they came to be. The result is an indigestible muddle. It doesn’t help that the writing is dry and overly lyrical at times. Upshot is that I just didn’t learn anything and that I would not recommend to others. Might be worth a look if it’s free, but I wouldn’t spend any money on it.  "
11,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51530871-johns,3,"This work is a pastiche amalgam of two intense authors. It is sometime hard to follow the logical procession of their narrative since the reader is unsure who is speaking. I found myself longing for a clear biographical record of the amazing development of the Quantum Theory in the 20th century. I suggest an interested reader find and consume Louisa Gilder's seminal book, IMHO a better review of the same topic."
12,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29153826-micah-grant,5,"Very interesting stories about the fathers of quantum mechanics, and how they came to their conclusions. Also great insights into why ""quantum"" is used so much in popular culture and why it is mostly used incorrectly, even Heisenberg's famous cat is almost always used incorrectly. There was a lot of the math I didn't understand, but the theory and the interactions between the physicists and others were fascinating. It sounds like a fun experience to take their class."
13,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106754080-john-gates,5,"What a fantastic journey through the history of physics up to this title's printing!A lot of this is over my head, due to not studying physics formally and therefore 'getting the math' , but a need to understand such things in order to follow along isn't necessary. The ability to bend one's mind might be limiting, if open-mindedness is not your gig. Physics will do that on occasion.Thank goodness string theory was not a major topic.This might be worth a reread in the future."
14,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9944562-pooja-kashyap,4,"The Quantum Moment by Robert P. Crease and Alfred Scharff Goldhaber is one of the most fascinatingly informative books I have read so far. I have recently developed interest in the world of quantum and I find this book fully satiated my curiosity. It is beautifully written for a beginner like me.Chronologically the book starts with the beginning of quantum theory and takes the reader to the pinnacle of its major philosophical implications - an awesome flight with an amazing view.(Spoiler alert!)Until 1927, one ‘fact’ that ruled among thinkers was the predictability of reality and that everything about the external world was homogeneity and continuity, an idea that enveloped the Newtonian world. An arena where everything moved about in harmony with each other, even the transition from past to future was perfectly laid down under the governance of the universal mathematical laws.However, in September 1927, the ‘One’ rule changed and thus altered the entire perception. According to their respective sizes, objects started following different rules. Things turned out to be unpredictable and one became doubtful about the presence of objects and their aims. The observation became dislodged, as there raised gaps and inconsistencies in reality.This book is a brainchild of a philosopher, Dr. Crease and a physicist, Dr. Goldhaber at Stony Brook University. As per them, no sooner, Max Planck surfaced “black box” radiation the conformity of Newtonian world begins to disintegrate. The finding revealed that light radiation does not flow in a continuous flux rather moves in a discrete manner in form of standard sized packets called the quantum.Conventional physicists did not give enough weightage to the quantum theory. They nearly nullified it by classifying it as only computational trick. However, Albert Einstein in 1905 proved that photoelectric effect is the outcome of light energy being transported separately in quantized packets. And random movements as depicted by Brownian motion too stressed to the same phenomenon. In 1913, Niels Bohr proposed that atom is the smallest element with a nucleus, which is positively charged and is surrounded by electrons that have circular orbit hence travel around the nucleus or in a specific orbit depending upon the rate of absorbing or releasing the quanta of energy. The structure resembles solar system except the fact that in place of gravity there is electrostatic forces within the atomic structure.During the late 1920s, Newtonian physics received a huge jolt with the creation of quantum mechanics by Werner Karl Heisenberg. His proposed uncertainty principle suggested that both location and momentum of a particle at any given time could never be determined. During the same time, around 1926, Erwin Schrödinger came up with his psi function or wave mechanics as per which, there is a probability of a particle to be discovered in a location in terms of a wave. This idea led to the formulation of Bohr’s principle, which was, an object or a particle could be in a wave or a particle format depending upon the way it is measured. The proposal suggested that that location and momentum of a particle couldn’t be determined by nature rather it is depended on the act of observation.In a plausible manner, Dr. Crease and Dr. Goldhaber presented these ideas sequentially and then moved onto the cultural implications of the quantum revolution. A place where there is randomness among particles, particles that follow a wave motion and observation affects its position and momentum. How does these subtle changes, effects the way we see the world? Authors have attempted in answering questions like these. After all, with the emergence of new science, methods too have been revamped in experiencing the world.The authors reconstructed John F. Kennedy’s assassination to the indeterminacy of subatomic particles. Critic and novelist John Updike jotted down a few reflections on photographs that were taken after President Kennedy was shot by assassin’s bullets. More closely the pictures were scrutinized, the more sense the previously held unwanted or ignored background objects made. For instance, ‘the umbrella man’, ‘tan-coated man’, ‘a gray Rambler driven by a Negro’, all who were previously thought to be random people/objects were actually part of the whole conspiracy.Thus, the authors postulated that randomness prevailed not only at the subatomic level but at the social level as well. Some of the researchers like British astronomer Arthur Eddington suggested that quantum world is the door that leads to the world of spirituality. Thinking on the same line of thought, American physicist Arthur H. Compton asserted that the quantum universe indicates the existence of God. The Fundamental Fysiks Group made a connection between quantum mechanics to New Age Eastern mysticism.Nevertheless, Dr. Crease and Dr. Goldhaber were pointing out towards the other direction. For them, quantum mechanics acted like a wake-up call that took humanity form the illusion of perfect determinism and mathematical predictability that shaped Newtonian universe to all pervasive randomness.Source: http://www.techietonics.com/thinking-..."

16,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/724958,2,I'm not sure who this is really for. The concept is interesting but in execution it just isn't that compelling. It wasn't for me.

18,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15454070-jaclyn-ann,3,Interesting read. Was expecting a little less technical talk for what was recommended.

20,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14234350-darren,5,"A great book on the history of Quantum physics... listening to the audiobook version I had to slow down playback to normal speed a few times (I typically playback at 1.5x - 2.0x, depending on the readers presentation style), particularly when equations were cited and their variables explained... it's difficult to visualize these while driving, but simply understanding the fundamentals behind the equations (and not the mathematics) is more than sufficient to get plenty of benefit from this retelling of Quantum history. This book introduced me to the term ""fruitloopery"": The use of scientific language inappropriately and without comprehension in order to increase believability of a concept. This is all-too prevalent in pseudo-scientific discourse, and I love the fact that there is a term for this! About the bookThe discovery of the quantum — the idea, born in the early 1900s in a remote corner of physics, that energy comes in finite packets instead of infinitely divisible quantities — planted a rich set of metaphors in the popular imagination.Quantum imagery and language now bombard us like an endless stream of photons. Phrases such as multiverses, quantum leaps, alternate universes, the uncertainty principle, and Schrödinger's cat get reinvented continually in cartoons and movies, coffee mugs and T-shirts, and fiction and philosophy, reinterpreted by each new generation of artists and writers.Is a ""quantum leap"" big or small? How uncertain is the uncertainty principle? Is this barrage of quantum vocabulary pretentious and wacky, or a fundamental shift in the way we think?All the above, say Robert P. Crease and Alfred Scharff Goldhaber in this pathbreaking book. The authors — one a philosopher, the other a physicist — draw on their training and six years of co-teaching to dramatize the quantum’s rocky path from scientific theory to public understanding. Together, they and their students explored missteps and mistranslations, jokes and gibberish, of public discussion about the quantum. Their book explores the quantum’s manifestations in everything from art and sculpture to the prose of John Updike and David Foster Wallace. The authors reveal the quantum’s implications for knowledge, metaphor, intellectual exchange, and the contemporary world. Understanding and appreciating quantum language and imagery, and recognizing its misuse, is part of what it means to be an educated person today.The result is a celebration of language at the interface of physics and culture, perfect for anyone drawn to the infinite variety of ideas."
21,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43477226-todd-stockslager,3,"Review title: Is light a wave or a particle?The formulas and theories of quantum mechanics explain how light in fact acts like both a wave and a particle, and this book documents how the bizarre side effects of the explanation have unsettled the world. As physicists looked closer at atomic structure early in the 20th century they found that describing atoms revealed very specific constants controlling rotation and location of electrons in orbit around the atomic nucleus. These quanta introduced a new discontinuity at very microscopic levels that broke Newtonian laws of motion, force, and momentum. This discontinuity opened a Pandora's box of conclusions and corollaries that shattered our assumptions about reality. Such earth shattering ideas were bound to have impacts on language, culture, and art beyond the strictly scientific realm, and The Quantum Moment examines these impacts from the perspectives of a physicist (Goldhaber) and a philosopher (Crease).As the book focuses on the intersection of science and culture, the scientific ideas are explained at a high level. Perhaps these definitions are too simple and superficial to explain such obscure concepts, or perhaps quantum mechanics is just too dense and bizarre to be concretely understandable to average non-scientist readers. Either way I feel like I have a very tenuous grasp of the concepts in play. So I was a bit disappointed in this aspect of the book.But the authors were trying to describe the concepts just well enough to establish a foundation against which to examine their cultural impacts, which is the meat of the book (and the undergraduate course the authors co-teach). Here I felt that the authors introduced and surveyed the impacts without being as exhaustive and systematic as they might have been. They basically look at examples of novels, movies, cartoons, and art to show how they incorporate the bizarre concepts of quantum mechanics like uncertainty, complementarity, and Schrodinger's cat, the scientists' own metaphorical attempt to explain how scientific observation and instrumentation may in fact change the system and materials they are measuring at the quantum level. An expanded or more exhaustive study of the cultural impacts would have bumped my rating higher."
22,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3246379-j-d,4,"This is a different kind of book about the recent history of Physics. Here, the quantum ‘moment’ signifies the era succeeding the ‘classic moment’ of Newton and the Enlightenment, with its ‘the-universe-is-a-machine’ cosmic view. Quantum Mechanics is behind a great deal of our world’s economy and, whether we understand the science or not, it pervades so many areas of our thinking, even art—Cubism is in debt to Einstein’s four-dimensional view of reality.Since the book stems from a series of courses about the impact of Quantum Mechanics in culture and thinking in general, there are all kinds of materials included in the mix. From sculptures to paintings, movies and TV shows, it’s a great learning experience on this time when we are reappraising science and scientists. Just look at the new movies… the life of Stephen Hawkings? Of Alan Turing? A TV show about the Manhattan Project? A long-running comic TV show about geeky physicists? What happened to Doctor Frankenstein?I thought that the setup of this book was bound to make the entire project a big mess. But the whole of it works, and I’m glad about it. It was an entrancing read. Hidden in a relatively short text that goes from historical background to cultural analysis, there’s a surprising amount of Physics. The discussion of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is particularly deep, and it doesn’t stay away from tricky matrix Algebra. A few bits of well-selected personal history of the physicists involved, and lots of cartoons and photos, make for an altogether lively journey. But I can’t say it was all entertainment, and that’s great.In lieu of taking what would be a broad course on the effect of modern Physics in our culture, ‘The Quantum Moment’ is an enjoyable equivalent. And it does succeed on humanizing the usually lonely quest of scientists."
23,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17429758-richard,4,"This book results from the authors' (Crease and Goldhaber) team-teaching a course in quantum theory and its cultural significance. As such, it is both thorough and informative.Repetition is a key when teaching difficult material, and there is enough of that along with a clarity of style to help the reader grasp the concepts, conflicts, and conclusions of the ""quantum moment,"" including Heisenberg's ""uncertainty principle,"" well explained, and Schrodinger's cat. also well explained. The difficulty of realizing AND accepting the complex unfixedness of the basic elements of matter reflects the opposite of this work's subtitle; human beings have great difficulty accepting uncertainty and do not love it. If an effect cannot be pinned to a cause, many humans are driven to seek solace in religion or some kind of ""-mancy,"" a hopeless hopeful endeavor. One of the greatest fears of those involved with quantum theory was that it would make room for such speculation.Now, perhaps, the popular reaction has become the madness of the denial of science because it reveals that uncomfortable basis of existence of the universe and of its animal population, including humankind. The authors are unsympathetic to any stance outside of the honest attempt to grasp the ideas and significance of the theory, rejecting its misuse in the popular media and culture.I would recommend the book to anyone honestly interested in the science and understanding both the development of the ideas and their application though I did read excerpts of another work, Halpern's EINSTEIN'S DICE AND SCHRODINGER'S CAT, which seemed more focused and concretely scientific, and I may return to that work later."
24,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23551069-patrick-sullivan,3,"I am about halfway through this book but I have what I need to make a review. First of all, before you open this book know that it is based on a class that is taught by the professors who wrote the book which is part history, part science, and part cultural impact that quantum mechanics had on culture. Let me illustrate; at some point they mention that Schrodinger's cat has become a cultural meme. I didn't think so, right after I read that I was watching the ""Rick and Morty"" episode where Rick fractures time and they end up in a void full of cats, presumably Schrodinger's cats. See what they did there? For those who complain that it has liberal arts ""fluff"", you clearly didn't read the intro where they explain the books was going to be partly liberal arts ""fluff"" and partly science, if you are irritated about it then it is your own darn fault. On that note, the explanation of quantum phenomena [something I was previously familiar with] is extremely succinct. If you want to know about this topic, this is a good book for it. The reason it doesn't make 4 stars in my review [and it easily could have] was that some of the language used to describe geniuses such as Borh, Planck, and Newton; is overly flowery to the point of being nauseating. Tighten up the prose a little and it is a 4-5 start book. "
25,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16827924-jason-makansi,4,"Crease does a really good job of explaining some difficult scientific concepts for the layperson (and for lapsed technical types like myself), but the brilliance of the book is how he shows how phrases from quantum physics have infiltrated academic and normal discourse and popular culture, including novels and movies. For example, the title of James Bond movie, Quantum of Solace (the title of Ian Fleming's short story was lifted but nothing else), actually means, in the context of the story, that a relationship between two people is dead when the ability of each person to comfort the other is reduced to zero. Crease points out that this is actually close to Max Planck's meaning of the world quantum, an amount that can make a significant difference. Anyway, the author clearly likes John Updike and refers to his work several times. It's an interesting, and quite unique, read if you're the type that regularly shuttles between technical and non-technical worlds."
26,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,5,"This is a very good book, and explains both the basics of quantum theory at a mid-level layperson's point of view AND its major philosophical implications.That's half the point of the book, and one of the reasons one of the coauthors is a philosopher. I respectfully suggest discounting any low-rating reviewers who react negatively to ""philosophy"" for that reason; if you don't want to read a common-sense review of the philosophical implications of QM, then don't pick the book up in the first place.I found this half very good. I actually found the layperson's physics half very good as well. I had a few things explained better here than I've read before, especially issues on statistical approaches to QM and the fuzziness of the classical-quantum ""border."""

Written by a professor of physics and a professor of philosophy, the text is easy to read and the science is adequately rehearsed, as the non-weird parts of quantum science spawned a technological revolution during the last century. But the weird aspects of modern science, such as uncertainty, entanglement, and quantum leaps, have also pervaded culture in many guises from novels to comics, and have been misapplied in the arts and humanities both as metaphors and as philosophical subsystems. The authors urge better education in quantum science to avoid crackpot follies such as parallel worlds, alternate universes, or quantum mysticism."

There was a period in the 70s and 80s where philosophers sought to use their various tenets to explain the science.This book covers the history of quantum physics from 1900 to roughly 1927, when the major discoveries were made. It was a slow read for me, because it's a tough subject for me to comprehend. One of the authors is a philosopher and one a physicist. They teach a course together on the topic. The book's chapters are separated by ""interludes"" that provide more technical coverage.All in all, a noble effort. I hope they write a sequel covering quarks and Higgs boson particles."
29,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22805082-bruce,3,"The authors observe in their final chapter that ""[U]nderstanding and appreciating quantum language and imagery - along with the abiliity to recognize its misuse in fruit-loopery - is part of what it means to be an educated person today."" I read the book twice, and concluded that I had not yet reached that goal. The problem may be that (as the authors acknowledge in the introduction) : ""... it may be imposssible to instruct nonscientists in the physics and math of quantum mechanics without extended training....""

Has this area become bloated by other books? For instance, I rate Manjit Kumar's book very high. My pet peeve is that the contributions of scientists that laid the foundation seems emphasized less in this book. Other authors take note: I have become sensitized in a Pavlov's dog sort of way to react negatively to any book title containing ""Einstein."" Such titles are usually an ultimate let down. I do not recommend it."
31,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1076961-scotchneat,4,"Okay, so you probably have to be a bit of a geek (science or lit or both) to get a lot out of this one. Definitely in my wheelhouse. I liked that the authors took quantum passed the science that discovered it as a concept into how that concept has had a deep and lasting influence on culture, art and critical thinking. All the way over to pop culture and public imagination. Not enough Quantum Leap jokes."
32,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27678334-eric,4,"I could easily see enjoying this one a second time in the near future. The idea of the impact of sciences on current culture without a clear understanding of how that came to pass is truly enlightening. The author has woven together a number of curiously humorous vignettes about quanta that often go right past even the more astute among us. He does cement Newtonian thinking into the first pages, but starts tearing it down early on - a delightful read."

34,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15225496-ravi-singh,4,"A look at how the Quantum Theory changed science and society forever and how the concepts crept into mainstream life, albeit with some changed meanings and usage.A good read for both the science buffs and the not so scientifically inclined."
35,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43252174-bhushan-mudbhary,4,I liked this book for several reasons. Firstly it is a history of science book that delves into the discovery and debate around the birth and development of the quantum theory. It also then looks at how popular culture borrows language and uses metaphors from science. 
36,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11999667-jeremy-jetzon,4,A gripping tale! Planck's constant leaps off the page!

40,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9851778-heide,5,Anyone interested in or studying philosophy should read this book. Actually everyone in any field. It's very well written and easy to understand.

42,0393067920,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13510151-bill-zarges,4,"a good book to catch up on quantum theory especially, if like me, most of your physics classes were largely newtonian based..........."
