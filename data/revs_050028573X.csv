0,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,2,"For all that this purports to be about the end-Permian extinction — the greatest of the extinction events, where maybe 90% of living organisms were wiped out — this actually contains a lot more information about the end-Cretaceous. This makes some sense, because we have a much better understanding of what caused the end-Cretaceous extinction, and it helps that it’s also the most widely known and understood. People don’t really want to hear about the extinctions in the Permian, however much more disastrous, because the image of the extinction of the dinosaurs is so entrenched in our minds.But I kind of did want to know about the end-Permian extinction, and I wasn’t so interested in chapters and chapters of set up, particularly when it came to the history of catastrophism. It’s enough that I grasp the concepts, and that they haven’t always been agreed upon or understood the way they are now — I don’t really want to know the personal details of loads of scientists’ lives. (Some are interesting characters in themselves. Some are not. Either way, I’m actually here for the end-Permian, not upheavals in Earth sciences.)I was a bit staggered by a couple of assertions — “all organisms have DNA”, for example, including “the simplest virus”. But no: a virus contains RNA. It’s quite an important distinction, and shouldn’t have slipped past editors, particularly when the book does touch on heredity and descent. And then there was the rather bizarre idea that the Marie Celeste’s crew were struck by a burp of gas which killed them, made their bodies disappear, and left the ship itself untouched. Hm.Mostly it seems reasonably solid, but bits like that made me raise my eyebrows a bit."
1,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2970379-manybooks,4,"While Michael J. Benton does indeed sometimes tend to repeat himself a bit in his When Life Nearly Died: The Greatest Mass Extinction of All Time, I have both personally and academically, intellectually found those very same repetitions in fact often quite necessary and required for understanding the presented, the featured concepts and for focussing (or sometimes refocusing) my attention on the essentials (like the main geologic, atmospheric phenomena and conditions which likely were the main reasons for the Late Permian mass extinction event, and yes, on how immensely devastating this all was, that indeed, at the boundary of the Permian and the Triassic eras, life itself was very nearly completely, utterly wiped out both on land and in the oceans). And albeit that I was prior to my perusal of When Life Nearly Died: The Greatest Mass Extinction of All Time already well aware that the Late Permian extinctions do actually make the so-called K-T boundary event that wiped out the dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous era seem pretty well like small potatoes in comparison, I have absolutely both appreciated and enjoyed my reading time, I have most definitely learned very much from When Life Nearly Died: The Greatest Mass Extinction of All Time and indeed all in a manner that is readable and easy to understand even for someone like me without college or university degrees in the life sciences. Furthermore and fortunately, appreciatively, I also have been rather ecstatic that unlike Donald J. Prothero who tends in his books on fossils and evolution to often present just a trifle too much authorial arrogance with occasional even outbursts of anger, as well as frustrating name dropping of one palaeontologist of the past after another (which I for one find rather tedious and monotonous as it kind of tends to read like a laundry list), Michael J. Benton has instead penned with When Life Nearly Died: The Greatest Mass Extinction of All Time an enlightening, humble, readable, and straight forward account of the greatest mass extinction event thus far and what might have caused this, an absolute and enlightening personal reading joy (light but very much educational, enlightening hard core science and palaeontology fare that is readily and easily digestible and made even more so with the inclusion of a detailed explanatory glossary at the back, endnotes and of course also a very thorough and up-to date bibliography)."
2,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672661-lois-bujold,3,"Pretty good, but suffered from being read right on the heels of the weightier and somewhat more literary Annals of the Former World. 12 chapters, of which 10 were history of the development of palaeontology as a science and other peripheral or contextual matters, and about 2 on the Permian and its end. I did not wish for less of the other material, but I would have liked more about the Permian-etc. The whole Life Before Dinosaurs scene is worth something large with color illustrations, although this tried its best to convey the deep weirdness of the fauna with nicely clear line drawings. The illos and charts included were well designed and very useful."
3,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4867502-jennifer,5,"I love it when I find out a great mystery is solved, especially something that is near and dear to my heart. I am a geologist which means I live and breathe rocks for a living, and yet this was a topic I virtually knew nothing about.  One of the things that irked me during University was that it was recognized that the Permian extinction was the greatest ever the Earth had ever seen, but the reasons why and what caused it were never mentioned. The cause of the dinosaur extinction, on the other hand was well known and we covered it in detail. I wondered why so little was known for an event that was so earthshattering.  Simply put, the biggest reason that I knew nothing about the cause was that intensive research was going on regarding the Permian - Triassic event while I was still in University. This blew me away. Here we have one of the most shocking events in the Earth's history (the Cambrian explosion of life comes first for me) and it is only in the past couple of decades that earth scientists have really began to tackle in detail. Secondly, catastrophic events in the geological record became more accepted once it was recognized that a meteorite impact had a significant effect on life such as the extinction of dinosaurs. The author carefully puts together all the known facts and comes up with the most plausible cause of this massive extinction that wiped out 90% of all life on land and sea. Basically, it was a combination of very intensive volcanism and liberation of deep sea gas hydrates. Together, that caused a runaway greenhouse gas effect (temperatures rose 6 degrees!), massive amounts of acid rain which lowered the worldwide oxygen levels in a very short time span.Here are some facts that I didn't know before:No reefs or coal seams were evident for 10 million years after the Permian -Triassic event which means plant life and marine ecosystems were STILL struggling to re establish themselves.It took 100 million years for the marine life to be as diverse and populated as the late Permian times. This is astonishing given how life in general is resilient to catastrophes in the past.The reptiles that would eventually give rise to mammals were dominant in the Permian, only to barely squeak through. They did survive but never dominated during the Mesozoic Era (Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous). The other group of reptiles that survived and would eventually give rise to dinosaurs flourished after the extinction and dominated the Mesozoic era only to barely make it through the next big extinction event. The descendants of the once dominant Permian reptiles, mammals are now the dominant species. The cycle has come a full circle.It is rare for a geology book to be so insightful, focused and yet written in a way that a person with little knowledge of geology could understand it. Highly recommended for those who want to know more about extinctions, palaeontology and evolution."
4,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7408040-mark-hartzer,5,"I enjoyed this a lot the 1st time I read it back in around 2002, so going back again was a pleasure. While the KT extinction event (the end of the dinosaurs) is now well known, the much larger extinction event of 251 million years ago is not nearly as well known. Benton covers a lot of ground, and I think persuasively points out the likely causes of when ""life nearly died"". This is pretty technical sometimes, but not overwhelmingly so. Highly readable, yet not patronizing to the casual lay scientist. I think more time could have been spent discussing the causes of the Siberian Traps and traps in general. This is not common knowledge and it would have been helpful to get a better understanding. But all in all, a good overview. "
5,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324264-john,5,"A great long overdue book on the Permian mass extinctionDistinguished vertebrate paleontologist Michael J. Benton's latest book, ""When Life Nearly Died: The Greatest Mass Extinction Of All Time"", is a long overdue popular account of the worst mass extinction in Earth's history, the end Permian extinction of approximately 251 million years ago. Other customers have complained that this book only devotes less than a quarter of its text to the Permian extinction. However, Benton does an elegant job describing the rise of a uniformitarian view of geology in the 19th Century (One major omission is not citing Scottish geologist James Hutton, who can be regarded correctly as Charles Lyell's intellectual precursor with respect to uniformitarianism.) which was eloquent expressed and defended by Charles Lyell in ""Principles of Geology"", his influential text on geology which helped shaped the careers of other distinguished scientists, most notably Charles Darwin. Next Benton gives a mesmerizing account of the career of Scottish geologist Roderick Murchison, who coined the name Permian for a suite of rocks found in the Ural Mountains of Russia. These lengthy digressions are important - and will become apparent to the astute reader - once Benton describes the Permian mass extinction.The second third of the book discusses the nature of mass extinctions, describing why paleontologists were inclined originally to think of mass extinctions as the result of apparent bias in sampling of the fossil record, not as real events denoting substantial loss of the Earth's biodiversity. Benton devotes much space to discussing possible scenarios for the end Cretaceous mass extinction, noting that that the asteroid impact theory proposed by Luis Alvarez, his son Walter, and their colleagues at Berkeley is the one accepted now by scientists. And he notes how ecosystems recover following a mass extinction, noting some of the important work done by ecologists and paleontologists in their analyses of recent ecological data as well as the fossil record.In the final chapters Benton describes what he thinks did happen at the end Permian mass extinction, offering a plausible scenario for this event (However, he dismisses a probable impact scenario which may be more likely in light of current understanding of planetary impacts, most notably the work done by the Alvarez team and others for the terminal Cretaceous impact.). And he gives a thorough overview of man's negative impact on current biodiversity, noting that this could be yet another important extinction in Earth's history. Students of paleontology, historians of science and the general public will find this fine book a splendid overview of mass extinctions, especially the Permian extinction. It is one of the best recent books on the history of geology and paleontology that I have come across lately. (Reposted from my 2004 Amazon review)"
6,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5175645-kate,5,"Wow, what a read. It's a little slow and dithering to start off, but once it gets rolling it's a fantastic read - almost a page turner. I do think it spends a little too long on the Cretaceous/Tertiary extinction event, but then I guess that is the most popular, so a good place to start for a non-scientific audience. The theories and data surrounding the End Permian extinction event are thoroughly covered, with no agenda behind any one of them. The discussion is fantastic, and the final descriptions of the mass extinction event are stunning. Highly recommended and becoming increasingly relevant for our current biodiversity crisis."
7,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9692659-rita,4,"250 million years ago the world was inconceivably different, life was still in it’s infancy and diversification was in it’s earliest stages but everything was abruptly cut short by a series of events that almost ended all life on the planet. This event is now known as the End-Permian mass extinction event or “The Great Dying” and it saw the end of 96% of all marine life and 90% of all terrestrial life, food chains broke down, evolution was suspended and life would take more than 100 million years to recover. Every living creature today descends from the mere 10% of species that survived the End-Permian and the new harsh conditions of competition and predation that became the every day struggle all throughout the early and mid Triassic. This book covers this subject as much as it is possible given how little is actually known about it compared to what is known about the End-Cretaceous event that wiped out the dinosaurs. The first seven chapters were a detailed exploration of how palaeontology evolved and how scientists were able to paint ancient landscapes from fragments of fossils and sediment; the author also very interestingly describes the reluctance of scientists to accept concepts such as catastrophism as the causes for mass extinction events and how views evolved and changed as new discoveries were being made. I struggled through the second part mainly because it seemed like the author wasn’t sure if he is writing for a general audience or to an audience who has good knowledge in the earth sciences: he explained and simplified geological concepts in the first part either in brackets or in footnotes, but the second part seemed much more rushed and a lot is unexplained. And there are not enough illustrations or graphs to further illustrate some of the claims he makes. The End-Permian was the biggest but not the only mass extinction event, the earth has seen 4 other crisis episodes where an unimaginable number of animals and plants perished but life survived and biodiversity flourished and that is proof that nature is not as fragile as we believe. But it is delicate and humans are currently doing in mere decades what it took millennias in geological time to happen. Is this the natural progression of life? Would nature be better off if humans went back to pre-industrial ways of living? We are agents of mass extinction and our relationship to nature should be revised. "
8,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2993027-dougal,3,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book but it does have some quite severe limitations. Firstly, although it is clearly pitched at the general reader, unless he has a background knowledge of Earth Sciences he would often be left scratching his head. In the first chapters, possibly up to about half way, the book explains basic geological and evolutionary concepts in simple terms and then, as the book progresses, it skips through more complicated areas with little or no explanation at all. Secondly, the book is very light on diagrams that would help explain things. For example, there is a basic geological time chart early in the book that only shows Eras and Periods, but different Eons, Epochs and Stages are frequently referred to later in the text. Similarly, the changes in the cyconodonts, synapsids, dicynodonts etc across the Permian/Triassic boundary, as well as changes in many other taxa, are discussed in detail, but there are no cladograms to help get a handle on the interrelationship between them. For any reader, that would have been helpful. Thirdly, the book does rather give the impression of having been started carefully and then rushed through in the last third, with rather a lot of repetition.Benton is a prolific author. Perhaps the drawbacks to the book are a reflection of the fact that it's unlikely he has much time to spend going back over his text to polish and improve. He is too busy with his next project!Overall, the book is a very easy and enjoyable read for the Earth scientist and I would heartily recommend it. For the more general reader I would recommend the first half for the introduction to the subject of extinction, mass extinction in particular, and for the fascinating history of the subject from the early nineteenth century to the present."
9,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2557252-tanya,5,Surprisingly accessible and does a great job of laying the historical groundwork of the science itself before launhing into a fascinating and frightening discussion of a mass extinction event. HIGHLY recommended.
10,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13773191-jonas-gehrlein,5,A historically based book about mass extinctions with quite compelling arguments for a perm-trias extinction based on gas hydrates and on how looking at extinctions in the past you can find out what will happen with the current extinction.A bit tough to read but well worth it.
11,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6291038-chris,2,"I was very excited to read about the infamous end-Permian extinction. Less excited when I found it was about some British geologists more than the actual science.Pro tip for science writers- science is interesting, scientists are boring."

13,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14139887-david-buccola,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's a bit dry at times, but I really enjoyed the way Benton pulls back the curtain on Paleontology to explain how they come to these conclusions. As usual in science what is revealed is not quite the standard story we are told about how science is always pushing for the unvarnished truth. As in just about any scientific endeavor dogma is created and defended, much like in religion. Powerful, vested interests have jobs and reputations to defend and could care less about what the evidence shows. The big split here being between the Uniformists and the Catastrophists. Today we all know that the Catastrophists have won, but it's a recent victory. What's most interesting about that is that the evidence was always there. Paleontologists in the 19th Century who tried arguing that major catastrophes had happened in the past were dismissed as crazy. Benton sees this all as a natural progression of science. I'm not so convinced. If anything it seems that scientists often do see what they want to see. I'm not arguing that science is devoid of value, but this book should stand as a cautionary tale for anyone that believes the now popular aphorism, ""Science doesn't care what you believe."" Science--instituional science--very much cares what certain people believe. If you have money, power, access to technology science is very much interested in what you believe. And this isn't just paleontology it can be found throughout the physical sciences; one can only imagine it's even worse in the softer sciences. For this reader Benton's approach probably backfired. It's not that I don't believe dinosaurs were wiped out by a giant asteroid, but I do have to wonder if that's the whole story. Like many paleontologists today are arguing they were already on their way out for various reasons. Given the imperfect nature of the fossil record and the various methodologies employed across the globe, it seems far fetched to say we will ever know these things with any great certainty. This is actually illustrated late in the book by Benton when he briefly discusses the Sixth Great Extinction. Like all scientists he's overly conservative. How can we know, he asks, exactly how many species really even exist right now? Which is weird given his much more confident pronouncement of how many species died during, say, the Extinction events 65 MYO and 252 MYO to just name two. All of this is not to say this is a bad book. It's actually quite fascinating. And I think it should be read by anyone interested in science. But ultimately we need to be aware of the forces that shape scientific opinion and how those forces often suppress the quest for truth."
14,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46092811-jennifer,4,"Overall this was a very good read and an enjoyable introduction to paleontology to the casually interested non-specialist. I am a biologist, but you don’t have to be a scientist to enjoy this book about the end-Permian mass extinction event.The end-Permian mass extinction event occurred about 250 million years ago, and while it’s not nearly as well known as the end-Cretaceous (which did in the dinosaurs), it was far worse, with a loss of 90% of all extant species. For a book about the end-Permian, it contained a great deal about the end-Cretaceous, but I think this can be justified. The end-Cretaceous is so well-known and has so captured the popular imagination that linking a lesser-known but still catastrophic extinction event to it will automatically make the lesser-known event more relatable. Because some paleontologists have suggested the end-Permian extinction was caused by an asteroid, the end-Cretaceous also provides a good point of comparison. Benton explores not only the consequences of the end-Permian extinction as shown in the continental and marine fossil records but also two possible causes. The book was well-written and managed to strike a balance between being accessible to non-specialists and satisfying specialists, who can consult the notes for references to the appropriate scientific papers. However, there is still quite a bit of speculation, especially because Benton’s favored hypothesis involves a series of catastrophic volcanic eruptions that would have triggered the release of massive quantities of methane from (as yet unproven) oceanic reservoirs. The catastrophic series of volcanic eruptions during the appropriate time frame has been established and would have been enough to suppress most photosynthetic activity for years. However, what was never mentioned in the book was how badly this would affect the carbon cycle, and therefore life (all known life is carbon-based). Because this has serious implications for today, I’d like to elaborate. Photosynthesis removes CO2 from the atmosphere, so any serious decrease in photosynthetic capacity (or an increase in CO2 levels that overwhelms current photosynthetic capacity), would allow carbon dioxide to start accumulating in the atmosphere. The more CO2 in the atmosphere, the more there is to interact with the water in the clouds to make acid rain and to interact with the water in the ocean to feed the reactions that increase ocean acidity (thus knocking out even more photosynthetic capacity). Worse yet, the more acidic the oceans become, the less capable they become of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and incorporating it into the oceanic sediments that ultimately become limestone. The result is that atmospheric CO2 levels go up, and one hell of a vicious cycle is created. It doesn't even stop there, because photosynthesis also fixes carbon dioxide. So as increasingly acidic water continues knocking out photosynthetic capacity, less and less biologically useful carbon will be available to most other organisms, even as the atmosphere is flooded with carbon dioxide. The problems are so great that I would go so far as to say that the underlying cause of the end-Permian mass extinction event was actually a deranged carbon cycle. This does relate to the book, because in the last chapter, Benton discusses “current events” (the book was published in 2003), and whether we are at risk of causing a sixth mass extinction event. His primary focus is on how humans are destroying entire habitats as opposed to a few species, and an ecosystem can cope a lot better with the loss of a few species than the loss of entire habitats. While this is true, I think we would do far better to think in terms of a gravely disrupted carbon cycle. Given the human talent for mass deforestation and enthusiasm for releasing large quantities of carbon dioxide into the air, the carbon cycle is already well on its way to becoming deranged again – and a severely disrupted carbon cycle may well take tens of millions of years to recover.Benton also does a good job showing the rehabilitation of catastrophism in geology. Unfortunately, he also describes young-earth creationists as a “fringe group” without acknowledging that in some ways they are the ultimate catastrophists (e.g., believing the Grand Canyon was formed in a matter of months by the same catastrophic global flood that caused Pangea to break up). Arguing against Lyell’s concept of the uniformity of rates also is something that regularly occurs in that community, because any arguments against it can then be used to call into question all radiometric dating techniques (by saying decay rates have changed over time and are not constant). It was very bothersome to me to keep reading arguments for catastrophism and complaints about young-earth creationists without any effort to address the overlap in beliefs. There were a few other minor irritants, including that an estimate of the total number of species on earth did not include the mention of any members of the plant kingdom. Despite these issues, I very much enjoyed this book, at least partly because of the writing style. One of my favorite quotes: ""Life can best be thought of as a great tree…During a mass extinction, vast swathes of the tree are cut short, as if attacked by crazed, axe-wielding madmen.”"
15,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6830314-mark-foskey,4,"Interesting and erudite, in discussing the greatest mass extinction of all time this book reminds the reader how long interesting life was around before there were dinosaurs. With considerable grace the author weaves together the human history of this research (going back to the beginnings of geology), what it is like to be a researcher now, and the discoveries that are being made. The big five mass extinctions are all touched on, with special attention paid to the end of the dinosaurs. The book lays out the cases that the impact at Chicxulub ended the dinosaurs, and the Siberian Traps (a massive, sustained volcanic eruption) caused the Permian extinction. Skeptics will raise the point that similar disasters happened at other times without corresponding mass extinctions. Benton does not hide from this, but all he can do is note that this is a mystery at present.Recommended."
16,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42042537-scot-fagerland,3,"I do about half of my research online, buying books when I want a more complete or detailed account than what is freely available. The Permian-Triassic (P-T) extinction was one of the most significant events in Earth's natural history, yet it is surprisingly difficult to find books on the subject. Benton is recognized as an authority on the P-T extinction, and this book is widely cited. I found the book to be heavily ""padded"", and felt that it was baiting me as a reader. After introducing the P-T extinction in the prologue, Benton then essentially wrote an introduction that spanned 3/4 of the book. He discussed extinctions in general, devoting more time to the well-known K-Pg extinction than to the P-T. The main subject was really the history of catastrophism, the question of whether short-term events can have long-term impact. That discussion was more relevant to the K-Pg event, which was at least exacerbated by asteroid impacts. The P-T transition was a period of climate change that lasted millions or even tens of millions of years. I was already familiar with the topics through most of this book, so for me this material would have been more appropriate as a one-chapter introduction. Chapter 11 finally got to the heart of the matter, ""What happened?!"" The most complete answer, a complex series of causes, effects, and feedback loops, was based on a model that had been published years earlier by a different scientist. However, Benton did a good job of funneling the academic literature into concise and readable language. He also resists the temptation to give an overly simplified answer, which impatient laymen so often expect. Compared to other accounts, I did feel that his discussion of methane hydrates was more conclusive than justified by current research. Benton concluded with a timely epilogue, a comparison to current global warming.In all fairness, the book's sales blurb does indicate, ""'When Life Nearly Died' documents not only what happened during this gigantic mass extinction but also the recent renewal of the idea of catastrophism ... Benton gives his verdict at the end of the volume."" I was expecting a book that was mostly about the Permian and Triassic periods, their flora and fauna, and the incredible evolutionary bottleneck between them. I would have been more satisfied if the book had been 75% P-T event and 25% backdrop, rather than the other way around. On the other hand, I would highly recommend this book as an introduction to mass extinctions in general, or even the P-T and K-Pg together, which were arguably the two largest. It is not a monograph, but it does discuss solid evidence and does not just reach conclusions for the reader as some popular science books are wont to do.  "
17,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/811366-esmeralda-rupp-spangle,4,"Since I went into this book already knowing that it was largely about the history of paleontology, rather than the Permian Extinction as the title implies, I was not disappointed by the content of the book when I read it. The science has aged somewhat since this was written and more is known now than was at the time of publication, but it's still a fascinating historical overview, and the conclusions he draws are largely, though not entirely, correct. He leaves himself open for amendment though, and clearly knows that the full story had not emerged when he wrote this. It was engaging, even funny at times to get a feel for how much petty sniping and dueling theories there are in geology and paleontology, and it's a good reminder that we don't always know what we think we know, and it's always best to be willing to adjust your perspective based on the availability of new evidence. It's easy to become set and stagnant in your views, immovable and stubborn even given compelling evidence that refuted your beliefs. Scientific minds are not immune to this, as much as they would like to believe they are, and it's interesting to see the full scope of how minds and attitudes about mass extinctions, catastrophism, and other concepts have altered over time. I especially enjoyed the latter portion of the book that covered the Permian extinction properly; the creatures that lived, those that did not, the environmental changes that may have occurred- I learned much more about geology than I thought I would as well!Overall an excellent read. Only docked a star for the ""false advertising"" of the title (because although I knew a lot of it was a historical overview, I didn't learn that until after I bought it- and that's not what it appears to be!), and for some very minor quibbles. "
18,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15841576-stephen-dedman,5,"A welcome reminder that there is more to paleontology than dinosaurs (though they haven't been forgotten), this excellent book focuses on the importance of geology in establishing the dates for the beginnings and ends of eras - and thus the 'time of death' in the biggest murder mysteries ever, the Great Extinctions that followed the Permian and Cretaceous. Partly a history of paleontology (with its fashions, politics and personalities), partly a primary on how geology and geochemistry teach us about the environmental conditions in any age, with some travelogue thrown in for good measure, the book looks at how the end-Cretaceous event was attributed to an asteroid impact before moving on to the question of what caused an even more catastrophic dying at the end of the Permian (an estimated 90% of both terrestrial and marine species, compared to 50%). Finally, Benton crunches the numbers to examine the probable sixth great extinction event happening now.Benton is a very readable writer and an excellent explainer, able to define concepts as cladistics in one memorable line. Even more remarkably, he has not only helped me understand more about stratigraphy and something about geochemistry, he has made them fascinating."
19,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,3,"Very interesting coverage of the mass extinction of life on land and in the sea that took place 251 million years ago. While the book is written for a general audience, I think it will only appeal to readers with a very substantial interest in the history of life on our little planet. The book documents the fact that nearly all life was snuffed out, but maddeningly admits that we don't know what the cause(s) was. The various possible causes are discussed and what the evidence is that has been discovered so far. My personal opinion is that it was triggered by an asteroid collision even much larger than the one that caused the later extinction of the dinosaurs, resulting in the rise of the mammals and us.The book concludes with a discussion of the global warming now taking place which could lead to the next great mass extinction if Homo sapiens doesn't learn quickly how we must take better care of our little planet."
20,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30195102-richard-lawrence,5,"One would think that ""page turner"" and ""Permian mass extinction"" are mutually exclusive but one would be wrong. This is a fascinating book which, at the very least, will get you to schedule a trip to the nearest museum to view the fossils they have on display. What you will learn about fossils and the history of paleontology will make those ""dead bones"" come to life. The story of how paleontologists and other scientists who study the past came to understand the extinction events that have shaped life on this planet is told by someone who participated in many of the discoveries and debates and it is told well. The discussion and tying together of the different themes which led up to and caused the Permian extinction is a rather sobering one given the changes we are seeing around the world today. This book will inform your thinking long after you finish it."

The author also takes a look at the Cretaceous mass extinction which killed the dinosaurs. This is an up-to-date (2015) edition of the book that includes new information on what caused the Permian mass extinction and how life recovered afterwards.

Paralleling the extinction event that kiĺled off the dinosaurs with the far more mysterious and remote Permian extinction and, ultimately the current extinction event being triggered by human activities. Well researched and well written. A good read for the paleo-biologist and geology buff alike. "

Benton does a great job of explaining how science works. How our biases (the egos of men), the incomplete nature of the fossil record and therefore our understanding of the evidence changed with time. Benton spends at least as much time on that as the actual ""event"" of the Permian extinction. It's written for and should be easily understandable to the lay reader."

The other 80% is a telling of last 150 years of geologic thought, based on what was known at various points in time. I tried to plow through all that but eventually it wore me down and it just wasn't worth it. Perhaps I was just being lazy.

29,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8464281-darnell,3,"Fascinating when the book is talking about the end-Permian extinction, but a surprisingly large majority of the book is history, context, and other extinction events."
30,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40939701-mari,5,"I had this on my shelf to read for a year and finally had the time to pull it out! (thanks, COVID)Definitely more geological history-intensive than I realized it would be, but I can see the logic of needing a lot of that framework to fully explain how they got to their conclusions of the end-Permian extinction event. I guess when I picked out the book I was hoping to have a really deep dive into what the event itself was like, but now I realize that was sort of silly because there's only so much you can cover. The history part ended up being quite interesting though, and I found myself googling some of the geologists named in the book to find out more about them. There were some real characters in the field back when.If anything the book made me realize how much I didn't know. I came to the book thinking ""oh, I really don't know much about the details of this extinction event, it might be good to know,"" and then I started reading and realized I had NO idea why it actually happened and actually needed to read the book to find out - almost like the book said of geologists many years ago, I accepted that there *were* these events without having absorbed or wondered at the specifics of ""why."" (I took a geology course in college so it's possible I just forgot!) And like I was telling my grandma, once you read about it fully you realize what an extraordinary event it was in the history of the entire planet, and it's amazing we're not talking about it more. But the dinosaur extinction gets all the limelight... Is there anything else I would have included? Not really. I think there is some interesting data around extinctions that could have complemented the book - Benton touched on this with the possibility that Pangaea heightened the impact of the Siberian basalts, etc - I read another book just on the data of extinction that explains how there is a predictable loss of biodiversity every time land masses unite. I read it so long ago that I can't remember much other than there is interesting data backing these events... so may need to go back to that one! Overall, a great read for a strange time (now) in human ecological history.Edit to add after being reminded:There were a few strange bits in the book. I only picked up on the oddness of including the Marie Celeste ship because I had listened to a podcast about it in the same week. The podcast didn't even mention the idea of gasses being the culprit, and really, it's far more outlandish than what they think actually happened (and with less evidence). I had a feeling of ""stay in your lane, bud"" toward the author - no need to try and solve centuries-old ship mysteries "
31,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21358043-yasmin-foster,4,"As far as I know, this is the most up-to-date book concerning the Permian Extinction. Also known as ‘The Great Dying’. And, no, that honorific is not melodramatic. It’s an event where 90 – 95% of life went extinct. Contrast with that of the more famous K-Pg Extinction (the Cretaceous Event that destroyed the non-avian dinosaurs) that killed off about 50%, the Permian E.Event is the ‘Terminator’ of disasters. And Michael J.Benton does a very good job of explaining it in terms that anyone can understand. He doesn’t write too seriously either. Similar to Steve Brusatte’s “The Rise and Fall of Dinosaurs” we get some anecdotes among all the science-y stuff (though not as much) and I loved coming across those nerdy-jokes that pop up now and again. “Geochemists said the ‘shocked quartz’ was not really shocked at all – not even mildly surprised.”… *hears the crickets*… well… I chuckled, at least. However, if you, like me, you came to this book specifically because you wanted to learn about the Permian Extinction Event (as opposed to general interest) the book doesn’t get to it until literally half-way through the book. The first 180ish pages are dedicated to the history of scientists/palaeontologists/geologist and their theories of extinction events, the reactions, and the history of the discoveries relating to Permian and Triassic fossils. There is also good amount of time spent on discussing the K-Pg Extinction and its relevance to getting minds thinking about other Extinction Events. Don’t get me wrong, I found them interesting and I didn’t get bored while reading about them and I understand why this perhaps needed to be padded out to make it a book of reasonable length. Just be aware of this going in."
32,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25857873-daniel-martins,4,"I've read this book during the current Covid-19 pandemic, and this conjunction of events certainly gave me a new perspective on the frailty of the human condition. Professor Benton is an engaging writer, and his long career gives this book a somewhat personal account aspect which is fascinating. Palaeontology has changed a lot in the last 25-30 years ! We now realize that major perturbations to the Earth system have occurred in the past, and these rapid climatic shifts were devastating for life. The book successfully portrays the complexity and intricacy of the processes involved in the end-Permian mass extinction and, of course, the scientific journey behind it all. If you are expecting a straight, simplified answer regarding the main cause, then you are setting yourself up for some disappointment. Instead what you get is a competent and accurate account of the steady, and often slow progress towards building the most widely accept model for this extinction.Although rich in detail and fascinating, the historical background is lengthy and takes a significant part of the book. In my view, the main idea behind it could have been driven home with fewer pages. The final takeaway for me was clear: we have not tamed nature. These past mass extinctions have a lot to teach us about current climate change and biodiversity loss. As a civilization, we need to face the consequences of our acts and use the power of knowledge to avoid our own demise. - D"

I am glad to have been exposed to it, but I took the whole thing with a grain of salt. Scientists change their positions too often, and geology is prone to circular proof and circular thinking: these fossils are this old because of how old the rock is in which they are found; and at the same time, this rock is this old because of the fossils that are found in them."

42,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15651131-last-ranger,5,"Red Sandstone and Black Mudstone:The most well known, and well studied, mass extinction is, of course, the KT event of 65 million years ago that saw the end of many kinds of organisms, including the dinosaurs. But in terms of lives lost it's the Permian-Triassic (P-Tr) event that holds the record for the largest extinction in history. In ""When Life Nearly Died"" paleontologists Michael J Benton provides us with an in-depth study of, not only the the P-Tr event itself but a detailed review of how scientist first came to realize that there was in fact an mass extinction about 250 million years ago. The Permian itself was first studied and named in the mid 1800's by a Sir Roderick Murchison and ever since that time it has remained controversial. When did it start and when did it end? Was there really an extinction event at the P-Tr boundary or was that concept just caused by gaps in the fossil record? The study of fossils and fossil-bearing strata becomes increasingly difficult as you move back in time but by using what we've learned with our research on more recent events we can extrapolate a great deal. To that end Benton spends some time explaining what we know about the KT extinction and applying that knowledge to the much older P-Tr extinction. While Benton writes in a layperson friendly way he does assume some prior knowledge on the part of the reader. Out of necessity the text is heavy with Latin names and geological terms. But anyone who has some experience in reading paleontology or geological books shouldn't really have a problem. Following the Permian strata around the world you'll make stops in North America, Greenland, China, Russia and the Karoo formations in South Africa. By studying sedimentary deposits at these wide spread locations scientist hoped to nail down when, in fact, the Permian ended and whether or not there was a mega die off of animals and plants that had been, up to that point, successful. No matter which extinction event you'r talking about there seems to be a vast difference of opinion on what caused them; climate change, plate tectonics, volcanoes and even extraterrestrial disruptions like asteroids, super novas or gamma rays. Each theory has its pros and cons and in some cases it appears that a combination of elements may be the answer. Benton gives you a brief overview of each, explaining why some scientist think their pet theory is a good idea while others take the opposite viewpoint. For me the massive flood basalts of the Siberian Traps are a good bet with eruptions that went on for thousands of years (maybe even a million) and had a major impact on the environment. From reading this book it also seems to me that any number of the ""random"" elements that continually disrupt our planet could, simply by chance, occur at the same time with devastating results. Whether it's the Siberian Traps, Methane Sinks or even an asteroid strike, the P-Tr extinction event has more question than it has answers. If you're looking for a quick, easy answer as to what caused this extinction you won't find it in this book, nor any other for that matter. But the study of past extinctions is an active, fast changing field and theories on how they happened can change at the drop of a hat, a quick look at its turbulent history tells it all. For years no one was sure exactly how long the Permian lasted and it took decades of intense study to finally confirm when it came to an end and we are now pretty sure there was indeed a massive extinction event about 250m years BC (*). But research goes on and new findings will certainly shed new light into the dark recesses of time and possibly change everything we know. Only time will tell. I had no technical or formatting problems with this Kindle edition.(*) for a slightly different take on the P-Tr extinction and the state of current research see Douglas Erwin's ""Extinction"", published in 2006 and recently updated in the 2015 edition.Last Ranger"
43,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27865152-rob,4,"Firstly, Mike Benton is an incredibly active palaeontologist. He's written endless books and scientific papers, and he's even had a genus of rhynchosaur named after him. This guy knows his stuff, and he knows how to pitch his work at lay-people.One problem with this book is that it begins quite slowly, and there are a few other chapters in the middle which begin slowly as well. Benton also goes a bit off-topic in parts, and the book could be arranged a little bit better.When you put the minor negatives aside, the book is fantastically good, and you can quickly learn a lot of basic science from it. It focusses on extinction events, mainly on the end-Permian extinction event (251 million years ago), and dabbles a little bit on the KT event (65 million years ago, when the dinosaurs died out). Some readers have criticised that he goes into detail on the KT event, but the book is about extinction events in general (despite the title). In order to make statements like ""Whilst the KT extinction was caused by a sudden impact by a single massive asteroid, the end-Permian extinction event was NOT"", we need to know the differences between evidence of catastrophic impact and evidence of catastrophic volcanic activity. Benton explains how palaeontologists have come to their conclusions, and like all good scientists admits that ""we don't know"" a few details.The physical book itself is really good quality. The paperback pages are very thick and the diagrams are high quality. The book has plenty of illustrations and figures, and there's lots of data to accompany his arguments. More detailed time-lines and maps from different periods would be nice, but they are on the web anyway. References to original papers are also really useful if you want more detail!The topic is SO interesting, and I cry inside to think that people wander through their lives never wondering about what's been going on at planet Earth for the last 4.58 billion years. This book has left we with a real interest in geology and Earth science (I already had an interest in biology and evolution), and I think the next book I buy will be an undergraduate Palaeontology text book."
44,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2221534-brie,3,"Overall this was a fairly good book, though I did find myself skipping through paragraphs every once in awhile during the second half. I find the history of life fascinating, but unfortunately this book didn't grab me the way I had hoped.Benton starts by touching on the history of geology and paleontology, with descriptions of the scientists and leading figures of the day. He then goes into the extinction everyone knows about, the dinosaurs. Once through with that he continues on to the end Permian mass extinction, which wiped out between 90%-95% off all species at the time. His conclusion is that the cause was a combination of the Siberian traps and gas hydrates. The eruptions of the Siberian traps put too many gases into the atmosphere over and over again, and the Earth's natural systems couldn't cope. This led to rising global temperatures, acid rain, and huge amounts of erosion due to a huge decrease in plant life. The rising temperatures melted some of the gas hydrates, which released more methane into the atmosphere, ending in a runaway greenhouse effect as more and more gas hydrates theoretically melted adding to the problem. Once plant life was decimated, animal life dependent upon it for food followed.The last chapter is a bit depressing, as it shows once again how little humanity cares about anything other than themselves. Some scientists have predicted that at the current rate of extinction, all life will be gone in 800 or so years. That's a scary thought."
45,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3295842-becky-herrera,4,"This is a very fascinating book on the biggest mass extinction of all time, the Permian mass extinction. 95% of all life in the oceans and on land were wiped out. This is the closest that life has ever been to being totally wiped out. Pretty scary! The beginnings of the book was a little drawn out and basically talked about the different scientists and their discoveries. It talked a lot about the Cretaceous or KT mass extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs. That extinction is the most well known and researched. But all this lead to explaining the Permian and how the discoveries were made and how there are similar parallels to what our planet is going through today. While most think of asteroids and major natural disasters as the cause of extinctions, the Permian was caused by something a little closer to home. Climate change or global warming. The volcanic activity from the basalt volcanoes, the Siberian traps released so much carbon dioxide combined with methane from methane bubbles in the ocean overwhelmed the feedback system of our planet causing a rise of over 6 degrees in planetary climate. This in turn caused plants and animals to slowly die as their habitats were destroyed. Very frightening prospect since it is well known that we are currently in a sixth mass extinction today, caused by human activity that is increasing co2 in the atmosphere. In essence we are the Siberian Traps."

Recommended for anyone with an interest in the greatest mass extinction in history. There are many illustrations.Science magazine has a more recent article on the Permian extinction in their December 9, 2011, issue. It is free to the public by free registration. It is called ""Calibrating the End-Permian Mass Extinction."" The authors, Shu-zhong Shen and others, reach a date of 252.28 million years ago within about 80,000 years, and an extinction period lasting less than around 200,000 years. They found that the Siberian flood basalts and the land and sea extinctions coincided and were consistent with greenhouse heating and its cascade of environmental consequences which Benton addresses.

47,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4725027-les,3,"First of all, I wish I could have given this book a better rating. It was absolutely fascinating and read somewhat like a detective story. What did wipe out an estimated 90% of all life on Earth 250 million years ago? And how do we know that any such thing actually happened?This is not a casual read (unless, perhaps, you happen to be a paleontologist). It took me well over a month to read, with frequent breaks and frequent re-reading of some fairly technical topics to make sure I understood what I'd just read. This was unavoidable; the topic is technical and specialized. The author did a great job explaining the nuances.I cannot give the book more stars because the author diverged at the end into contemporary politics. Not that I disagree with what he had to say! Just that I don't believe it should have been part of what otherwise was a scholarly, educational and somewhat entertaining read.Without the last 15% of the book, it would have earned 4 stars with ease.

I've only recently taken an amateur interest in geology but I've really spread my wings with this book that straddles geology and paleontology. Benton is an excellent writer (or at a minimum a really good writer with an exceptional editor) so he gives full measure in teaching his subject. I learned a boatload from this. The organization of the book is appropriately progressive, laying groundwork that supports all that's yet to come. It's not a rigorous science text, rather it's science presented for intelligent, curious readers. Jargon is used where jargon is the best way to tell the story but it's never gratuitous jargon. In other words he's not holding your hand; if you missed something take the initiative to reread that chapter or section! I have no sympathy for those who insist on being spoonfed technical and scientific information. It's been awhile since I was so wholly impressed by a book. "

My major complaint with the book is the writing style. Far to much repetitiveness in the name of either book length or artificial excitement made it a trial of a read. The page count could easily have been 40 pages less without the artistic license. As a geologist myself, I appreciated the inclusion of the historical background of research in mass extinctions and the manner in which progress has been held back by men in high positions (read: Lyell). After all, Geology is essentially history."

Discusses the history of scientific debates over catastrophism versus uniformitarianism, the birth and growth of palaeontology (it's British, spell checker. Leave the 'a'), the apparently grudging acceptance of massive impact craters and the 65-my old K-T extinction event, and then ties it all back to the much more severe Permo-Triassic extinction 251 my ago. Spoiler: it wasn't an asteroid. Probably. "

Even so, I learned a lot. It gets increasingly technical until about 2/3rds through, describing the reasoning of why we know there was a huge extinction ~250 million years ago. Then a few chapters are like a personal journal which I didn't think added much to the book. The final chapter discusses whether or not we are in the middle of the sixth major extinction with all of the species dying off so much more rapidly than before. "

Not a casual light right, but thoroughly sets the stage and educates on so much incredibly paleogeology and paleo-atmospherics to lead up to his theory of what caused the Permian End Extinction when 96% of all species on Earth became extinct. Parts of it are extremely relevant since we are now in midst [RIGHT NOW] of the sixth largest extinction event on Earth, largely caused by humans, but - in my opinion - also partly caused by climate and ecosystem changes from the ending of the ice age and initiation of the Holocene.

255,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1598384-jim,0,I saw this at the Bear Pond Book Store in Stowe VT. It looks like a good book. 
256,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29609954-james,3,"Nice general layman's overview of paleontology and mass extinctions, though a bit long winded in spots. The Victorians were interesting types but the bios got to be a bit much."

259,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5404622-levent-kurnaz,5,"Thriller style science book, definitely fun to read..."
260,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5721649-beth-quijano,4,Very well-written in that it makes science comprehensible to lay people like me. 
261,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7807708-dave-malone,4,"I enjoyed this book thoroughly. I wanted to learn more about early Earth, and this was a great read (about the mass extinction 252 million years ago) and made for a nice followup to my reading of Andrew Knoll's book about life on earth (543 million years ago)."
262,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52422444-charliesz,0,"Wow! A great read. Loved it. So much geology & paleontology in one place, it appealed to my inner geek."
263,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5826059-michel,4,"So comprehensive book that covers the end of permian mass extinction, the author did a great job in collecting everyy detail about the topic. I loved the the first chapters about catastrophism vs gradualism in geology,, the book is not for normal readers it requires very good knowledge of paleontology and geology, i suffered following many chapters."
264,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26741438-paul-locke,2,"Lots of interesting information interspersed in a great quantity of wordsThis book covers the history of paleontology in order to discuss the Premium extinction. I found it interesting but, in the whole, very wordy. If I were a student of paleontology I would have found the book much more engrossing."
265,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1387036-bill,3,The first half of book is about scientists fighting as to what theory about the Permian extinction is correct. The second have is a rather scientific analysis of the currently accepted theory and why it is the accepted theory. The book might be a little dry for some but is very detailed and well researched.
266,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5464134-phil,4,"Dense material and well put together. I enjoyed reading about the late Permian mass extinction which very nearly rendered life as we know it void on this planet. Thank goodness Mother Nature has her sly ways and we are here to study, excavate and discover the reasons behind such a sad tale.Totally worth reading."
267,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16089612-emmy,3,"This book was well written and it was obvious that the author has a passion for the subject. That said, it was still boring. If I'd known before I'd started that so much of the book would be dedicated to talking about geology, I wouldn't have started. On the bright side, the book had some nice illustrations and I came away feeling like I'd learnt something."
268,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62408454-francis-kilkenny,5,"I loved this book. It was written by a scientist who clearly loves his field of study. It's a little bit quirky, but it gives a wonderful sense of how paleontology works. I'm fascinated by the subject of mass extinctions and how understanding them can be relevant today. This is an excellent and detailed overview of the greatest mass extinction of all."
269,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/746637-sally,4,"Good popular presentation by a non-dogmatic scientist. It gives an understanding of how paleontologists work, the evidence, and how interpretive frameworks (such as catastrophism and uniformatarianism)effect hypotheses. Well written."
270,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2271207-davido,2,"Most of this is the history or paleontology. (borrring, not what I paid for) At the end he gets to the point, but there really isn't that much to talk about, so there's a lot of filler where he talks about who believed what and when."
271,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30132229-lolo-kramer,4,"If you are interested in deep time, this is a great read on the Permian mass extinction. I skipped around as I don't really care much about the author's graduate studies or who thought what when. I enjoyed more the narrative of the extinction. "
272,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22060306-jaap-hoogenboezem,5,"It takes a while before the book gets to the end-Permian mass extinction, which is supposed to be the topic of the book, but what comes before, an overview of the history of thinking about extinctions and catastrophism in geology, is fascinating because of the wild characters and ideas. "
273,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112460747-homer,5,"Mindboggling! If you are interested in knowing more about the origins of life on earth and the precarious process that led to us, humans, you should find this fascinating. Well-written, instructive, not too academic and full of deeply intriguing facts and theories."
274,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/188169-namrirru,5,"Great book. Interesting, funny, and horrifying at the same time. "
275,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/954613-roger,4,"Excellent broad introduction to paleontology. And a great explanation as to the cycle of mass extinctions that earth has experienced. Climate change! Pah, nothing."
276,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3653823-larry-wilson,5,It could happen again.
277,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2442614-jeff,4,Learned a lot about brachiopods and bivalves.
278,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3598079-tom-griffith,3,Don't read this unless you're into palaeontology or evolution or climate science. If you are: a (sometimes) fascinating read.
279,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7737059-thelaurakremer,3,Starts off strong but rushed ending...little no time actually dedicated to the actual theorized causes of the extinction. And the trip to Russia stuff completely unnecessary.
280,050028573X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8656190-fresno-bob,5,"excellent coverage of the Permian extinction, it is crazy to think that the KT event was only figured out in the 80's."
