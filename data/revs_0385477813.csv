0,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,3,"For me this book gave me the feeling of learning something without me really learning anything.Do you remember in maybe junior high when a science teacher taught you that if there were twins, and one of them went on a spaceship going real fast for a long trip, when they came back the twin left on Earth would be much older than the twin that went on the trip? And that that was relativity? And then some kids would think they understood relativity because they had been told that factoid?That's what I feel like having read this. Kaku hits all the big points pretty well, without any involved math, but I don't feel like he really took me along for the ride. I learned that Maxwell realized magnetism and electricity were the same force, and that he realized that disturbances between magnetic fields and electrical fields perfectly predicted and described the path and speed of light, but not how/why. And so on with the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, and now gravity joining up with string theory.Kaku's at a disadvantage, admittedly, because Brian Greene's books are the yardstick against which I measure explanations of relativistic/quantum/string theory discussions of physics, and they may be the best in the world.Also, this book was written in 1987, updated in 1995. A lot of stuff has changed, I'm pretty sure. OK - one thing I learned. The weak nuclear force only works on very short distances - the thickness of a few protons and neutrons. That's why higher-number elements are unstable, and don't occur in nature. Up after about uranium or plutonium, there are too many protons and neutrons in the nucleus for the nucleus to hold on to them all - they're too far away from the 'center of the force' - like moons that are too distant from the center of gravity of a planet to be kept in orbit."
1,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10812329-hershel-shipman,5,Another good overview of theoretical physics. Michio Kaku explains it a bit more simply than Brian Greene though it ends up with a shorter overview book that doesn't have as much detail. The most interesting parts are the history and its players. Kudos to him for mentioning an important female physicist.
2,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17209090-richard-jr,4,"For years I have followed the Cosmic Quest to unite the physical laws of the universe. In many ways, the story is as strange as Science Fiction for those scientists exploring the realms of electromagnetic, gravitational, the strong nuclear and the weak nuclear forces.  The difficulty for mathematicians and physics in trying to explain and unite these four forces to us lay-folk arises because there seem to be two separate universes. One governed by Newton and Einstein's familiar laws, and another universe which is weirdly strange and unpredictable and which is explained by quantum mechanics. Because we humans like predictability, we are often baffled when our cozy world has something that doesn't fit our experiential knowledge base. That's what this book is all about.  Newtonian Physics and Einstein's work explain are a predictable universe. We have mathematics describing how bodies in our predictable world are affected by gravitation and electromagnetic forces. They move, fall and exist in a macroscopic universe which we mostly see and deal with on a daily basis.  On the other hand, the more we studied the muinute particles making up the nucleus of atoms, the more evidence we found that some non-predictable forces and particles govern our universe at that sub-atomic level which we cannot see and thus must infer by rather exotic experiments. Then we have to give a pictorial explanation of what we saw to think we saw to our general public. Thus it needs to be explained how a particle can appear out of seemingly nowhere travelling at the speed of light, disappear into an invisible hole and reappear in a totally new location or two different locations at the same time. It's not neat and tidy and disturbed Einstein for the last years of his life.  We could write all of this off as 'poppycock' except that is is the science that allows us to solve real-world problems and develop new technology which was previously undreamed of. We know quantum mechanics works and explains something going on in the universe because it allows us to develop atomic level machines, computers, memory chips, touch screens .... and a technology that will hopefully take us to other stars or even other universes.  Kaku and Thompson's explanation of the flavors of string theory and dimensions beyond the four with which we daily associate allows us to begin dreaming the dreams of multi-universes that reach beyond our own with sizes that can be both immense or microscopic at the same time and may be unified through 12 dimensions in the same manner that a Mobius Strip is unified in two dimensions and a Klein Bottle is unified in three dimensions. It truly boggles the mind!  The book ends on a positive note that Super-string Theory will ultimately lead us to the Theory of Everything. Of course, when we get there, will we be prepared and able to make that jump from being upright apes to being a Class I civilization controlling the earth, and then make the jump to a Class II civilization controlling our solar system and finally make that jump pre-saged by Isaac Asimov of becoming the Class III civilization that can harness the galaxy and beyond. Will we do it in biological form or will our dreams have to enter the thinking realms of the computers we are now developing? Who will be lifted up and who will be left behind?"
3,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102283649-gabes,3,"Beyond Einstein is a true effort of summarizing our scientific knowledge and conveying it in layman's terms, in order to provide a simple yet powerful understanding of our achievements throughout the last few centuries. In that sense, Michio Kaku is very successful. He has a very friendly approach to complicated topics like quantum mechanics and superstring theory. Given that I know nothing about this, I found his writing comprehensible and easy to follow (most of the time, at least).My problem with this book, however, is in the interchange between two points of focus. Dr. Kaku wants to present us the wonders of physics and mathematics, but also simultaneoulsy shares the stories of the people behind them, like Albert Einstein and Richard Feynman. I do not dislike the interchange itself. In fact, I appreciate it - I am very interested in knowing the backstory of the most brilliant minds of our times, and how they got to the position they are now. That being said, I believe the author didn't know how to arrange the two themes properly. At times, the ""physics part"" felt entangled with the ""biography part"", and as a result it got hard to concentrate in either of them. If they were more conveniently separated, I think my reading experience would have been a lot better.Overall, Beyond Einstein is a great introductory piece of literature for those who want to dive into physics and science. It gives the reader insights on the most important theories and accomplishments of humanity, and sets the scene for the quest for unification. It really can inspire people to go out of their way to explore the ends of the universe, and, considering it was first published in 1995, I hope it did. I'm sure I will read more about the subject and probably some other works of Dr. Kaku as well."

An excellent but somewhat outdated introduction to the concepts of the String Theory. Written in a simple language, you do not need to possess a degree in physics to understand it. A high school level understanding of science is enough to understand the matter presented in the book. "
5,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6093437-joseph-siry,5,An exceptionally fine book that I have used for students to read to better understand the several turning points of unification in science from Sir Isaac Newton to just before the Higgs boson's discovery. The four or three fundamental universes are examined and clearly delineated in this historical sweep of what Einstein's and other physicist's discoveries have meant from Hubbles discovery of the expanding universe to the findings of fission and later fusion.
6,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24802680-felipe,4,I really wish Michio was my physics teacher. He has a refreshing style to explain complex topics that combines the background of the authors mentioned and pragmatic examples which makes the book very understandable. I hope one day in this century they will discover the real truth of our universe. Superstrings theory sounds fascinating but still is hard to imagine without a deep level insights. Thanks To Mr. Kaku for such a enjoyable book!

9,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5488851-james,4,"Rating: 4.12 starsOne begins to see things more clearly the more one ventures into the world of physics. At least that's what I tell myself. In reality (or outside of it), it's impossible for an idiot like myself to determine even the most remote notions of truth or understanding from any of the physics books my eyes have glazed over. And yet, having read Einstein's Relatively and then Walter Isaacson's Einstein biography, this book by Michio Kaku is a breath of fresh air. In Isaacson's book, Einstein essentially wastes the last 30 or 40 years of his life chasing the {impossible} idea of a unified theory of the universe. Here, Kaku lays out a convincing story, explaining how Einstein's wildest dreams have come to fruition through Superstrings, or the Theory of Everything. If nothing else, this story helps me to understand the Marvel Universe, as well as the universe I came across while playing No Man's Sky. Beyond seeing the inspiration for various pop culture references, is this anything other than a simple story one human tells to the next so that we both feel better at the end of the day? At least two of us would like to hope so. Michio's obvious enthusiasm for the history of physics, as well as the science presented in this book, is the most compelling aspect of the text. This, along with the remarkably clarifying thought experiments that the best writers of science are able to provide this novice, presents an often thrilling portrayal of where science rests at today, along with where science rockets off into the future. Oh, plus some good pictures for the truly moronic amongst us (me). Imagine our universe as one electron. No really. One electron. Now imagine this one electron is propelled from the Big Bang, through space-time, until it hits Doomsday, at which point it bounces back towards the Big Bang - like the largest cosmic game of ping pong. That's but one idea this book will lay out in front of you, in ways that are completely insane, and entirely mesmerizing. One love."
10,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30579636-godo-stoyke,2,"The title was intriguing: who doesn't want to know physics that goes BEYOND Einstein. I remember (after reading this book two decades ago) that I somehow did not find the superstring theory very convincing. That doesn't mean much, as I am not a physicist. But, it turns out that, according to eminent astrophysicist's Lawrence Krauss 2012 book ""A Universe from Nothing"" (which I DID like), so far apparently no evidence has been found to support string theory. String theory hasn't been disproven, however, if after quite a while a theory is unable to create testable predictions, that's usually not a good sign for the applicability of the theory. I've since been a little less fond of Kaku's books."

This book by Michio Kaku on String theory was an enjoyable and quick read. The author goes into the basic details of string theory and provides a history of the theory.

24,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32717494-venky,3,"The Holy Grail for every Theoretical Physicist is undoubtedly a Grand Unified Theory. A theory that coalesces all the four primary forces of Gravity, Electromagnetism, Weak Nuclear Force and the Strong Nuclear Force into one coherent, concise and clear theory. This endeavour has repeatedly eluded some of the most brilliant and mercurial geniuses who have made an indelible mark in the realm of Physics. Even a mighty stalwart like Einstein was left to rue the last years of his life disputing his own findings in the quixotic domain of Quantum Physics. ""God does not play dice"" said this lambent persona before completely abdicating his faith in unification.However, decades after Einstein shed his mortal coils, two intrepid Professors, John Schwarz of the California Institute of Technology and Michael Green of Queen Mary College in London pioneered a path breaking and earth shattering theory termed the ""Super String Theory"" which turned historically accepted conventions on its head. This Theory popularly known as Theory Of Everything (""TOE"") professed to explain all known physical phenomena in an inclusive manner. One of the leading exponents of Superstrings, Michio Kaku, in this fascinating books takes it upon himself to inform and animate the lay reader, the basics of this riveting theory that has the world sitting up in exclamation, enthusiasm and exhilaration! From Black body radiation to Kerr Black Holes; Schrodinger's infernal cat to the inspired Feynman diagrams, Michio Kaku fulfills his self established test in a manner that is able and commendable. Not only do we get a flavour of the infinitesimal value of our existence, we are also allowed the luxury of basking in the brilliance of a breathtakingly humongous cosmos which while lending itself to scientific examination, also leads us towards the harsh realisation that the Universe is way beyond what we arrogantly perceive it to me. In 1600 the amateur astronomer Giordano Bruno was burnt at the stake by the Church for propounding his theory (which was proved to be perfectly valid many years later) that the Sun was a mere star and that there were an infinite number of Earths revolving/orbiting around it. It is heroes like Bruno who spur scientists such as Michio Kaku to unrelentingly work towards unearthing the mysteries of the unknown and unveiling the fabric of mystique spread by the cosmos over our imagination. And it is scientists like Michio Kaku who inspire an entire generation of minds thirsty for knowledge and restless for results.""Beyond Einstein"" - A marvelous unification of research, reflection and reason!"
25,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35306337-harikleia,5,"	In the non-fiction book of “Beyond Einstein”, the author, Michio Kaku, a Professor of Theoretical Physics at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, explains the workings and the possible origins of the universe we know today. From Superstring Theory and Quantum Puzzles, to Dark Matter and planets or universes that have more dimensions or are composed of antimatter, this book has all of the answers to the questions that come with reading it.	Unlike all of the novels I have read, this book makes sure that there are no questions as to what is being explained would be true in the real world (novels do not because they are not in the real world)--mostly because this is about the real world. And there should not be a doubt. It explains the theories that top scientists from the past, came up with and proved. However, this is not just about things that Einstein could not come up with. Instead, I would say that it is about the theories that have either affected Einstein’s work, or that his work affected in some way. Einstein may have been a genius, but a theory that a genius would come up with is not achieved by sitting around and only thinking. All geniuses have to learn the subject before they go and do something great with it. Even Einstein had to study very hard to even come up with his first or his most simple concept. A lot of these theories have been around for decades, just not as many people have heard of them.The Theory of the Universe. It is a fascinating thing when we come to think of how we might only exist by chance. This book helps with the understanding of all of this, but not just the planet we live on, but entire galaxies that make up our universe.With all of the near-unbelieveable concepts being mentioned, “Beyond Einstein” is almost like a science-fiction book (except that is is not fiction at all), that describes the real world. "
26,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11712114-daniel,4,"Qualitative description of Einstein discoveries in relativity ( general or specific ) are described avoiding complicate math or any math at all. The author makes very good analogies with physical processes we know ( like when you drop a heavy weight over a bed sheet and let a small ball run over this surface ). The author debunks general assumptions that we take for granted like for example Einstein's dislike of quantum theory, because after all he has fomented its development and never was ""truly against it"". As an Electrical Engineer ( who no longer does engineering for quite a while ) I miss some math, but tensor theory is today away from my knowledge. It shows us a lot of theories and concepts in 200 pages, being cautious to describe the practical proves to each of them.As either quantum theory and relativity emerged as the most important theories of the 20th century the author needs to discuss both of them in the context of early 20s and today. Although not compatible, today yet, these theories gave birth and made evolve cosmology, particle physics, astronomy, etc.The author discuss briefly the theories of multiverses and parallel universes, time travels and let alone these would make this book a great read.

27,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6584617-david,4,"This is my second book read by Michio Kaku, and I intend to read all of his public divulgation books. So far I have thoroughly enjoyed what I have read, even though I'm a little bit behind schedule, having read this book 19 years late. Anyway, the only part where this book feels outdated it's when it talks about the late Superconducting Supercollider (SSC) project, and which had already been cancelled by the time the book was written and published. Still, it already talks about the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) as an ongoing project, which I found kind of amusing. I can't seem to read enough about strings, superstrings and quantum theory stuff. It's like the real magic out there, so outlandish the concepts and knowledge involved. That's why I keep returning to these books. I hope major advances will be made during my lifetime, and in the meantime I'll keep on reading about this subject matter.I highly recommend this book if you haven't read it yet. You will enjoy it if you already love the subject. Go on, give it a try!"

Kaku believes that the superstring theory is the only theory that can unite quantum mechanics and general relativity. This is a good book for someone who is interested in physics, but maybe isn't very good at physics. Don't get me wrong, it's still confusing as hell. I'm terrible at math - I found myself having to read portions of this book out loud to try and help me understand it better - but, like I said, I'm not good at these things, I'm just an interested bystander.Although if you're interested in theories like this, use this book as a stepping stone, it was published in the 1980s, so there's TONS of new information (some even in Kaku's later works), so don't take what is written here as gospel, because it might not be anymore."

In a very short book, the authors have covered this vast and complex topic- including related trivia- and tried to make it comprehensible to a layman. That is where the problem lies. While reading this book, I was reminded of a particular tradition in Hindu religion- Stayanarayana Katha. The priest visits home of devotee and is supposed to recite glory of Lord Satyanarayana. However, the recital mostly consists of merits of the recital itself, not the original story! It is same with this book. Right from page one, the authors sing praises for Super-string Theory, without telling much as to what that the theory is! same goes for Symmetry, Duality, S-matrix and so on. May be I do not have the required background, may be second reading after some homework will help and I plan to do that. "
30,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55651694-mars-smith,5,"Pro: Readers can learn about different types of elementary particles such as the different types of quarks and leptons. In this book, I learned that there were up, down, strange, charm, top, and bottom quarks that were not all part of the same family. Page 110 shows a chart with up and down quarks in the electron family, the strange and charm quarks in the muon family, and the top and bottom quarks in the tau family. Michio's book talks about supersymmetry, string theory, and the grand unified theory or GUT.Con: Some readers familiar with particle physics may find that this book is unsatisfying. Others may note that this book is one of Michio's earlier efforts in writing. Meaning his writing skills may not be as great as they are today. Personally, I really enjoyed the book, especially since I learned from it."
31,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23855655-adam,5,"In Beyond Einstein, Michio Kaku gives the reader an overveiw of the history of modern physics. Beginning with Newton Beyond Einstein describes with intricacy, the theories that later began to form superstring theory. First, the idea that the four forces of the universe could be one and the same is expressed along with the detailed description of the forces. As the book progresses, it explains the idea of a multiverse, dark matter, anti-matter, and much more.I would most addimently recomend this book to anyone who finds physics interesting but does not understand complex mathematics. Beyond Einstein clearly portrays modern physics, without going into most of such mathematics. This allows any reader to fully comprehend the information."
32,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62759575-terence-kong,5,"This book provides readers an insight into the evolution of modern physics over the past several decades. Describing various scientific laws ranging from Newton's laws of motion to Einstein's idea of general relativity, Michio Kaku perfectly explains them in a understandable manner for the general audience and how in some ways those principles are affecting our daily lives. I've heard that this book exhibits the same materials and themes as his other book Hyperspace. I'm not sure whether this is true but if it is, then I wouldn't suggest buying and reading this book.Michio Kaku is one of my all-time favourite celebrities in the world of science and physics. This is the first book of his that I've read and I'm looking forward to read the rest of his books. Highly recommended."
33,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/855517-greg-pretti,3,"While I really like Kaku, this book jumped around just a little in parts, and that did take away some of the potential impact. It's also a little bizarre to read today, in a world where string theory is unproven, and mostly determined to be a nice, concise answer, but not THE answer. It transforms every reference Kaku makes about string theory's ability to solve everything into justification for a generalization so large that it can't entirely be proven wrong - or right.All the same, the book is well-written in general, and some of the specific ideas it mentions create some great food for thought."
34,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4002235-rodney,3,"Overall, not bad. I like Kaku...have watched him on various shows on television. There, everything is simplified for people like me! In this book, he does a so-so job of bringing theoretical physics down to the layperson level; however, theoretical physics is so high above the layperson to begin with that you have to bring it down much further! There were parts I understood and parts I didn't, but I wasn't going for a degree, I was just trying to learn something. And I did. If you want a basic background in string theory and other aspects of theoretical physics, this isn't a bad start. It is a little outdated, though, so finding one published after the mid-90s might help!"
35,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2887019-matthew-estrada,4,With this book and all his others Machio Kaku proves to be an amazing writer who is able to capture his readers with intriguing information. I think that this book was really good because if your someone like me you’d want to understand how our universe works. The key question on every physicists mind is how everything works together. You see right now the key theories are quantum and the theory of relativity but they don’t work together to form an understanding of gravity. In the end I give this book a four out of five because although very interesting and descriptive it does tend to get slightly repetitive.
36,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19994325-john-godier,4,"Kaku always delivers brainfood in an easily readable manner. I absolutely love his books, they're like adventures in themselves that have you page turning regardless of the advanced subject matter of theoretical physics. You move forward chapter after chapter eager to see what science you never thought you'd understand will be laid plain next. In this early book he explores the concept of the grand unified theory that science still searches for today that thwarted Einstein himself. By the end of the book, you're left with an understanding of the various contending possibilities and a ton of things to ponder. A great read. "
37,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5909475-maggy,2,"I feel bad for leaving a book unfinished, but this is not my slice of pie. I was only decent at physics, but never interested enough as to actually read and enjoy this book. Einsteins theory or relativity, the quantum theory, linked together by the theory of the superstrings. It had my mind reeling for hours, trying to comprehend every word. But, since this was a book I had to read for academic purposes, I gave it a try. Thankfully, I do not have to read it anymore so I must put it down. I don't know; maybe I shall pick it up later on by chance and try to finish it. Unlikely. "
38,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/660903-art,2,"More of an overview than an in-depth discussion of theoretical physics and string theory. This book endeavors to pave a way towards the thought that string theory is the culmination of hundreds of years of scientific exploration but it reads more like a history lesson. It suffers from a lack of a binding principle or a strong thesis. It is useful as an introductory read, but it suffers from a lack of punch. "
39,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6179713-tommy,4,"  I liked it. My opinion of it is rather skewed in that I bought several of Kaku's books and then brilliantly read them in reverse chronology, so I read this earlier work after I had read his more recent stuff. The book gives a good introduction into string theory and basic physics but it does have nearly two decades of scientific discoveries and refinements in theory between when it was written and now.

There were parts I understood and parts I didn't, but I wasn't going for a degree, I was just trying to learn something. And I did.

As the book progresses, it explains the idea of a multiverse, dark matter, anti-matter, and much more.I would most addimently recomend this book to anyone who finds physics interesting but does not understand complex mathematics.

Describing various scientific laws ranging from Newton's laws of motion to Einstein's idea of general relativity, Michio Kaku perfectly explains them in a understandable manner for the general audience and how in some ways those principles are affecting our daily lives. I've heard that this book exhibits the same materials and themes as his other book Hyperspace. I'm not sure whether this is true but if it is, then I wouldn't suggest buying and reading this book.Michio Kaku is one of my all-time favourite celebrities in the world of science and physics.

It's also a little bizarre to read today, in a world where string theory is unproven, and mostly determined to be a nice, concise answer, but not THE answer. It transforms every reference Kaku makes about string theory's ability to solve everything into justification for a generalization so large that it can't entirely be proven wrong - or right.All the same, the book is well-written in general, and some of the specific ideas it mentions create some great food for thought."
124,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4002235-rodney,3,"Overall, not bad. I like Kaku...have watched him on various shows on television. There, everything is simplified for people like me! In this book, he does a so-so job of bringing theoretical physics down to the layperson level; however, theoretical physics is so high above the layperson to begin with that you have to bring it down much further! There were parts I understood and parts I didn't, but I wasn't going for a degree, I was just trying to learn something. And I did. If you want a basic background in string theory and other aspects of theoretical physics, this isn't a bad start. It is a little outdated, though, so finding one published after the mid-90s might help!"
125,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2887019-matthew-estrada,4,With this book and all his others Machio Kaku proves to be an amazing writer who is able to capture his readers with intriguing information. I think that this book was really good because if your someone like me you’d want to understand how our universe works. The key question on every physicists mind is how everything works together. You see right now the key theories are quantum and the theory of relativity but they don’t work together to form an understanding of gravity. In the end I give this book a four out of five because although very interesting and descriptive it does tend to get slightly repetitive.
126,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19994325-john-godier,4,"Kaku always delivers brainfood in an easily readable manner. I absolutely love his books, they're like adventures in themselves that have you page turning regardless of the advanced subject matter of theoretical physics. You move forward chapter after chapter eager to see what science you never thought you'd understand will be laid plain next. In this early book he explores the concept of the grand unified theory that science still searches for today that thwarted Einstein himself. By the end of the book, you're left with an understanding of the various contending possibilities and a ton of things to ponder. A great read. "

128,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/660903-art,2,"More of an overview than an in-depth discussion of theoretical physics and string theory. This book endeavors to pave a way towards the thought that string theory is the culmination of hundreds of years of scientific exploration but it reads more like a history lesson.

My opinion of it is rather skewed in that I bought several of Kaku's books and then brilliantly read them in reverse chronology, so I read this earlier work after I had read his more recent stuff.

Beginning with Newton Beyond Einstein describes with intricacy, the theories that later began to form superstring theory. First, the idea that the four forces of the universe could be one and the same is expressed along with the detailed description of the forces. As the book progresses, it explains the idea of a multiverse, dark matter, anti-matter, and much more.I would most addimently recomend this book to anyone who finds physics interesting but does not understand complex mathematics. Beyond Einstein clearly portrays modern physics, without going into most of such mathematics. This allows any reader to fully comprehend the information."

Describing various scientific laws ranging from Newton's laws of motion to Einstein's idea of general relativity, Michio Kaku perfectly explains them in a understandable manner for the general audience and how in some ways those principles are affecting our daily lives. I've heard that this book exhibits the same materials and themes as his other book Hyperspace. I'm not sure whether this is true but if it is, then I wouldn't suggest buying and reading this book.Michio Kaku is one of my all-time favourite celebrities in the world of science and physics.

183,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/855517-greg-pretti,3,"While I really like Kaku, this book jumped around just a little in parts, and that did take away some of the potential impact. It's also a little bizarre to read today, in a world where string theory is unproven, and mostly determined to be a nice, concise answer, but not THE answer. It transforms every reference Kaku makes about string theory's ability to solve everything into justification for a generalization so large that it can't entirely be proven wrong - or right.All the same, the book is well-written in general, and some of the specific ideas it mentions create some great food for thought."
184,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4002235-rodney,3,"Overall, not bad. I like Kaku...have watched him on various shows on television. There, everything is simplified for people like me! In this book, he does a so-so job of bringing theoretical physics down to the layperson level; however, theoretical physics is so high above the layperson to begin with that you have to bring it down much further! There were parts I understood and parts I didn't, but I wasn't going for a degree, I was just trying to learn something. And I did. If you want a basic background in string theory and other aspects of theoretical physics, this isn't a bad start. It is a little outdated, though, so finding one published after the mid-90s might help!"
185,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2887019-matthew-estrada,4,With this book and all his others Machio Kaku proves to be an amazing writer who is able to capture his readers with intriguing information. I think that this book was really good because if your someone like me you’d want to understand how our universe works. The key question on every physicists mind is how everything works together. You see right now the key theories are quantum and the theory of relativity but they don’t work together to form an understanding of gravity. In the end I give this book a four out of five because although very interesting and descriptive it does tend to get slightly repetitive.
186,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19994325-john-godier,4,"Kaku always delivers brainfood in an easily readable manner. I absolutely love his books, they're like adventures in themselves that have you page turning regardless of the advanced subject matter of theoretical physics. You move forward chapter after chapter eager to see what science you never thought you'd understand will be laid plain next. In this early book he explores the concept of the grand unified theory that science still searches for today that thwarted Einstein himself. By the end of the book, you're left with an understanding of the various contending possibilities and a ton of things to ponder. A great read. "

But, since this was a book I had to read for academic purposes, I gave it a try. Thankfully, I do not have to read it anymore so I must put it down.

188,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/660903-art,2,"More of an overview than an in-depth discussion of theoretical physics and string theory. This book endeavors to pave a way towards the thought that string theory is the culmination of hundreds of years of scientific exploration but it reads more like a history lesson. It suffers from a lack of a binding principle or a strong thesis. It is useful as an introductory read, but it suffers from a lack of punch. "

My opinion of it is rather skewed in that I bought several of Kaku's books and then brilliantly read them in reverse chronology, so I read this earlier work after I had read his more recent stuff.

I'd still recommend it. "

As the book progresses, it explains the idea of a multiverse, dark matter, anti-matter, and much more.I would most addimently recomend this book to anyone who finds physics interesting but does not understand complex mathematics.

Describing various scientific laws ranging from Newton's laws of motion to Einstein's idea of general relativity, Michio Kaku perfectly explains them in a understandable manner for the general audience and how in some ways those principles are affecting our daily lives. I've heard that this book exhibits the same materials and themes as his other book Hyperspace. I'm not sure whether this is true but if it is, then I wouldn't suggest buying and reading this book.Michio Kaku is one of my all-time favourite celebrities in the world of science and physics.

It's also a little bizarre to read today, in a world where string theory is unproven, and mostly determined to be a nice, concise answer, but not THE answer. It transforms every reference Kaku makes about string theory's ability to solve everything into justification for a generalization so large that it can't entirely be proven wrong - or right.All the same, the book is well-written in general, and some of the specific ideas it mentions create some great food for thought."
244,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4002235-rodney,3,"Overall, not bad. I like Kaku...have watched him on various shows on television. There, everything is simplified for people like me! In this book, he does a so-so job of bringing theoretical physics down to the layperson level; however, theoretical physics is so high above the layperson to begin with that you have to bring it down much further! There were parts I understood and parts I didn't, but I wasn't going for a degree, I was just trying to learn something. And I did. If you want a basic background in string theory and other aspects of theoretical physics, this isn't a bad start. It is a little outdated, though, so finding one published after the mid-90s might help!"
245,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2887019-matthew-estrada,4,With this book and all his others Machio Kaku proves to be an amazing writer who is able to capture his readers with intriguing information. I think that this book was really good because if your someone like me you’d want to understand how our universe works. The key question on every physicists mind is how everything works together. You see right now the key theories are quantum and the theory of relativity but they don’t work together to form an understanding of gravity. In the end I give this book a four out of five because although very interesting and descriptive it does tend to get slightly repetitive.
246,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19994325-john-godier,4,"Kaku always delivers brainfood in an easily readable manner. I absolutely love his books, they're like adventures in themselves that have you page turning regardless of the advanced subject matter of theoretical physics. You move forward chapter after chapter eager to see what science you never thought you'd understand will be laid plain next. In this early book he explores the concept of the grand unified theory that science still searches for today that thwarted Einstein himself. By the end of the book, you're left with an understanding of the various contending possibilities and a ton of things to ponder. A great read. "

Einsteins theory or relativity, the quantum theory, linked together by the theory of the superstrings. It had my mind reeling for hours, trying to comprehend every word. But, since this was a book I had to read for academic purposes, I gave it a try. Thankfully, I do not have to read it anymore so I must put it down.

248,0385477813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/660903-art,2,"More of an overview than an in-depth discussion of theoretical physics and string theory. This book endeavors to pave a way towards the thought that string theory is the culmination of hundreds of years of scientific exploration but it reads more like a history lesson. It suffers from a lack of a binding principle or a strong thesis. It is useful as an introductory read, but it suffers from a lack of punch. "

My opinion of it is rather skewed in that I bought several of Kaku's books and then brilliantly read them in reverse chronology, so I read this earlier work after I had read his more recent stuff. The book gives a good introduction into string theory and basic physics but it does have nearly two decades of scientific discoveries and refinements in theory between when it was written and now. I'd still recommend it. "
