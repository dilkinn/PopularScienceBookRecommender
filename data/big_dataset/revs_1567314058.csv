The most interesting thing was the fact that we could see how the great scientists came to existence, how they were some people like us, but with their great curiosity, they invented the most important equations and laws. The writing style was smooth and poetry-like. But sometimes it also dragged and became boring. But overall, this book is solid non-fiction book that everyone could enjoy. 4 ☆"
1,1567314058,http://goodreads.com/user/show/790095-tifnie,5,"This book took a little while to get into. By that I mean, I had to completely change gears in reading style, topic, and expectations while reading this book. I will admit, however, that I didn't think I would enjoy this book. I was wrong.Five Equations...is about 5 mathematical scientists; Isaac Newton, Daniel Bernoulli, Michael Faraday, Rudolf Clausius, and Albert Einstein (law of gravity, hydrodynamic pressure, electromagnetic induction, thermodynamics, and theory of relatively - respectively) who basically change the world, as the title suggests. However, instead of the ""dry"" text that I was expecting, this book talked about each life, their trial and tribulations, and how each man came to not only mathematics but how each discovered their equations.One of things I enjoyed about this book is that each man was very relatable in the beginning. Not all genius came from means, some were illiterate with less than desirable futures who rose above their station and made a difference. I also liked the fact that I was reminded about how things began. For example, with todays technology it's easy to forget that at one point, scientist or doctors didn't know how the body worked, or how water flowed, our universe, heat, light, etc... That at one point it all began with curiousity, an experiment, failures, discoveries, and then hopefully success."

I was given this book and I was torn between reading it, I have never read something like this and it was surprisingly easy to keep up with. An although non fiction there were parts which I found hard to believe them to be so, the familiarity with each scientists are impossible, but it brings sympathy toward them.Overall, the book is an easy start toward science and math and the life of each of the scientists, who could have known Newton, Einstein and the others had fears like us? That they were too human beings and they felt lonely or sad? I recommend it to anyone who struggles/hates math or science so they get a piece of hte story behind."
3,1567314058,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"Guillen provides lay-friendly descriptions of five mathematical formulas that describe nature: Newton’s law of gravity, Bernoulli’s law of hydrodynamic pressure, Faraday’s law of electromagnetism, Clausius’s second law of thermodynamics, and Einstein’s theory of special relativity.The discussion of Clausius’s theory of heat and energy was especially good. Heat moves things (”does work”). Heat is the cosmic motive force (he wrote a paper, titled “On the Motive Power of Heat”). Heat and its work effects are “two variations of a single phenomenon that came to be called energy: “heat and work were fundamentally the same thing, in that a unit of heat could be exchanged for a unit of work, without affecting the total energy of the universe.” This led to the law of energy conservation where energy moves from one form to another but the net change is always zero and the “total energy of the universe is an eternal constant.” Under Clausius’s law of entropy, heat moves from hot to cold. Everything in the universe in time loses heat (balances out) and this leads to the end of cosmic motion: “the universe would shut down forever when all its natural changes had ceased to exist—that is, when all its naturally irreversible phenomena had spent themselves completely.” In short, Guillen writes of Clausius, his theory “portrayed a universe where mortal violence inevitably gave way to eternal quiescence.” After reading this, the number zero and the idea of cosmic balance seem central. It also prompts the question that lingers even today: whether cosmic movement now is cosmic movement forever. Guillen helps out on Einstein. ""Because of the spatial and temporal relativity in Einstein's universe, science no longer would need to distinguish between A moving with respect to B and B moving with respect to A; now only relative speeds mattered."" I understand this to mean, simply, that there is no absolute, fixed point and everything in the cosmos is moving. Guillen also clearly states the special nature of light in the cosmos: ""In short, Einstein concluded, electromagnetic-cum-light waves were unique in the whole of the universe because they alone represented waves of pure, massless energy!” The author states that Plato is the father of astronomical science because he urged that people cast aside their preoccupations with divine gods and devote their attention to the scientific knowledge of heavenly bodies – the moon, sun, stars and planets. But for Plato this is another version of the divine as Guillen quotes Plato's reference (without citation) to ""new gods” and comprehension of “godly behavior.” In referring to Plato this way, Guillen is stating that the presumed perfection of heavens reflects God’s creation (God as a causal factor) and that mathematics describes that perfection mathematically. A contrasting view is that the cosmic world operates in a certain way that can be described mathematically. In this view, divinity is not necessary and Plato’s philosophy can no longer be described as a science.** The author states that a separation between science-mathematics and religion came after Newton. "
4,1567314058,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5163221-michael-foley,4,"Guillen's book is a fascinating overview of the five minds and mathematical equations that have changed the world. Each chapter is dedicated to a scientist and his equation, such as Newton's Universal Law Of Gravity or Clausius' Second Law of Thermodynamics. Guillen uses a Veni, Vidi, Vici approach to explain how the scientist arrived at his subject, how the subject area became enigmatic, and how the scientist overcame the problem. This work is not bogged down in complex equations and it is not written for the advanced physics student. Instead, it is a popular guide to monumental moments in mathematical history. (That's a lot of M's.) Guillen paints a human picture of his subjects and the world in which they lived. We see them overcome issues not just with mathematical mysteries, but with faith, family, politics, and themselves. When equations are provided, the author is sure to explain them in detail so that the layman can understand the language of the mathematics. Importantly, Guillen leaves the reader with a deeper understanding of his subjects and how these revolutionary paradigm shifts have molded our modern world. "
5,1567314058,http://goodreads.com/user/show/900863-angela,5,"Fascinating, very readable, and intelligent!11/3/2010-Just finished this book again. A few of my thoughts this go-around...1. I am so unsmart. :) What am I doing with my brain cells? :)2. These men gave up a lot personally to make their scientific contributions.3. For the five men profiled here, how many more brilliant scientists just weren't lucky enough to get quite the right experiment? Or weren't lucky enough to get noticed by the scientific establishment? Or who didn't have the right connections to have the right equipment?4. After reading some other reviews of this book, I grant that Guillen did assign various characteristics to the scientists, but it's completely worth it to read a readable book on how all this complication/simplicity fits together."
6,1567314058,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115626-nadine-jones,2,"Mostly I just want to know what the five equations are, so I got this from the library. First of all, the cover on my library copy is NOT the cool looking cover that Goodreads features! This looks like a comedy book, with the odd smile on this guy's face!! First thing that popped into my head: Bob Ross. Second thing: Richard Simmons. Third? Will Ferrell. That's what this guy looks like.

Also, the equations are right there on the cover! I didn't need to get this book to learn what the five equations are! I guess he was (or is?) on Good Morning America. I wouldn't know, I don't watch much TV. He doesn't get off to a good start with me in this book, because the first thing he references is The Bible. [eyeroll]. This is the first sentence of the book:
Mathematics is a language whose importance I can best explain by starting with a familiar story from the Bible.
I mean, seriously? Some people have to drag religion into everything, even math. (The story he tells is the one about the Tower of Babel. yadda yadda yadda math is a successful global language blah blah blah.) Equation #1 Newton's law of universal gravitation. No, no, not F=ma, the other one. F=G*(m1*m2/r^2). Although he writes it weird in the book, he writes: F=G*M*m/d^2. ""d""??? WTF is with this ""d""?? In what world is ""d"" used to stand for RADIUS???? See, now right here, his language is not my language. What happened to the successful global language??? Only a yahoo would write ""d"" when they mean ""r."" (I read enough to figure out that he is thinking ""distance,"" so, d for distance.) Also, I'd like to note that Guillen makes sure to talk about God in his chapter on Newton, too. ALSO also, I'd like to note that Guillen goes on (and on and on) about Isaac Newton's father and ""King William I"" in 1642 - he repeats ""William"" quite a few times, and each time a helpful previous reader crossed it out and wrote ""Charles"" in my copy. I looked it up. King William I became King of England in 1066. So this is a pretty big mistake in this book; hopefully it was corrected in later editions. By the end of the chapter, Guillen is still talking about God and the Creator and holy cow! So far, I'm not really impressed, book! What else have you got?Equation #2Bernoulli's Law and the Bernoulli equation!! P + (rho)*V^2 = constant. (He leaves out the ""+rho-g-h"" part of this equation. I don't know why.) I'm an engineer and I actually use this equation A LOT. I read on with excitement! Sadly, Guillen starts hammering home the message about God's plan and I kind of can't believe how many times he is managing to bring up God and Bible stories in this book about equations. There's some background information about Bernoulli's family, a shout-out to Archimedes, among others. Equation #3Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction: emf = -N*d(phi)/dt (This involves vectors & vector notation, but I can't write fancy mathematical stuff like that here on Goodreads, so use your imagination. Also, he writes it completely different in the book than what I'm used to, but I can't reproduce those symbols. He writes: (NABLA*)xE=-dB/dt.) This is the equation that tells you how to turn a nail and a wire into a magnet, as well as other, more useful, things. I don't ""do"" electrical stuff, so that's all I really know about it. I don't think Guillen mentions the nail. Maxwell gets a shout-out, as is proper, because this is actually one of his equations. Yes, God and Jesus Christ are mentioned in this chapter. Proverbs are quoted. I can't even.Equation #4The Second Law of Thermodynamics! delta s > 0 (the entropy of the universe is always increasing) In plain English, this means that nothing will ever be perfectly efficient, there are always losses, and that's why incandescent bulbs got so hot, and why window air conditioners would actually heat up your room if they didn't vent outside, and that sort of thing. That's me talking, that's not from this book. Apparently Rudolf Clausius came up with this law, and I had to take several Thermodynamics classes in my time but I don't recognize that name, so that's a nice tidbit of info for me that I'd forgotten along the way. Yes, the Creator is mentioned in this chapter multiple times. You knew He would be. The text practically gasps when it acknowledges that there were secular geologists. (The nerve!) There are also shout-outs to Aristotle, Carnot, Galileo, Fahrenheit, and Lavoisier, among others.Equation #5The equation in the header is ""E=mc^2"" but the chapter title is ""Einstein and the Theory of Special Relativity."" Those two things are definitely linked, but they are not synonymous. No wonder why people get confused about science! Yes, OF COURSE God is mentioned in this chapter. Duh. I don't know if he explains the E=mc^2 part well, or not, I couldn't stand to make a close reading of it.If you read this book, you'll think women were just busy having babies and men were the scientists. I'm not certain that Guillen really makes a good case for THESE five equations being the things that changed the world. Why these equations but not others? Does no one care about F=ma? a^2 + b^2 = c^2? the area of a circle=pi*r^2? sqrt(-1)=i? the wave equation? (which I was actually so sure would be one of these five) Navier-Stokes? (which is JUST as useful as Bernoulli when dealing with fluid flow). All of Maxwell's other equations? Statistics, geometry, basic physics, economics ... ?? Guillen states: ""I selected five equations from among dozens of serious contenders, solely for the degree to which they ultimately changed our world."" Okay.In sum, if you don't know much about science and you want a chatty type of book to learn a little bit of history and science and history of science, and you enjoy books that never forget to mention God and each scientist's relationship to his Creator, this is a good book for you. If you want a more secular chatty book about science, I highly recommend Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything. It doesn't go into as much depth, but it also covers A LOT more. And it's funny. For a history of science that reminds you of how much the Christian church IMPEDED scientific discovery, read Sagan's Cosmos.* Yes, NABLA. (No M.) That's what the upside-down-capital-delta is called. I looked it up. It's vector notation."
7,1567314058,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98205986-naomi-szabo,4,"SPOILER ALERT:A New Perspective on Mathematics...Although the title of Dr. Michael Guillen’s piece, Five Equations that Changed the World: The Power and Poetry of Mathematics, may make the book seem like any typical textbook, that is most definitely not the case. This book tells the story behind five equations that have shaped the world as we know it; it also details the lives of the scientists behind them, and how they came to their discovery of these truly crucial equations. Read as a collection of short stories that ultimately contain an underlying connection, each chapter explores the life, both scientific and personal, of a famous scientist whose findings ultimately shaped the course of history. First is Isaac Newton, whose childhood was far from desirable; having been abandoned by his widowed mother at a young age and bullied by his classmates, Newton was left feeling alone for most of his childhood. As an escape from his unrelenting circumstances, Newton often observed the quirks of the world around him, drowning himself in his ponderations of the natural world. Ultimately, these periods of solitude led Newton to express his observations in mathematical form, thus bringing the universal law of gravity into existence. This law essentially states that gravity exists between all things, and at varying degrees, depending on the mass and distance between the objects in question. This relationship, and associated equation, proved essential when trying to make the moon landing happen, as hundreds of American scientists and engineers relied on it to get Neil Armstrong to the moon in July of 1969. Without this vital truism, the moon landing would’ve never become a reality; the same goes for the sophisticated space technology of today, which was built upon this initial milestone. The remaining four chapters of the book explain, in similar detail, the equations these scientists developed and how they shaped history as we know it; not only that, but in these chapters, the author goes to great lengths in order to convey the scientist as a relatable character, one whose experiences and emotions connect with readers in a way a general textbook description never has. For example, the next chapter delves into the story of Daniel Bernoulli, whose jealous father stole credit for his development of the law of hydrodynamic pressure, an equation that led to the first airplane. The book goes on to tell about Michael Faraday’s illiterate upbringing, which never stopped him from achieving his dreams of scientific glory through his law of electromagnetic induction, a discovery ultimately leading to the use of electricity and the light bulb. Guillen then recounts to readers how the death of Rudolf Clausius’s beloved wife made his life’s work all the more personal to him. This work was characterized by his inequality known as the second law of thermodynamics, an entropy law that prompted the realization that being alive, an ordered state, is unnatural; rather, the universe is forever progressing towards a more disordered state, making death inevitable. Finally, the author tells the tale of a more well-known scientist, Albert Einstein. Despite being a less than stellar student whose teachers claimed that he’d “never amount to anything,” Einstein became a world-renowned genius whose theory of special relativity brought the atomic bomb into use in World War II. Though these storylines may seem worlds apart, Guillen writes in such a way that they all come together to form a cohesive book, rather than a mere set of novellas. The only way to truly comprehend the author’s work, from the connections he draws to the themes he establishes, is to read his book Five Equations that Changed the World: The Power and Poetry of Mathematics. You’ll never see math the same way again. Personally, I’d give this book a 4.5/5. Although I wasn’t expecting it, this book turned out to be a real page-turner. The author takes a topic that seems so mundane (the history of math) and manages to make it into something worth reading, which is really admirable from a writing perspective. Another thing I personally enjoyed about this novel was the organization of it. It wasn’t set up like a typical book with one plot followed throughout the course of the story, but rather as five shorter stories, each with individual plots and characters. Somehow though, Guillen managed to weave them together to make one cohesive piece with a recurring theme: don’t let your current circumstances define your future. This theme definitely speaks true to me, as it proves that as long as you have the right attitude and determination, you can make your dreams, no matter how elusive they may seem, a reality. This motif especially shows through in Michael Faraday’s journey from an illiterate upbringing with little schooling to an established member of the Royal Society of London (a well-respected scientific institution both then and now). Many thought his goals were too distant for a man of his background, but Faraday didn’t let that stop him, and he ultimately accomplished his goal of being remembered in the world of science. This truly inspired me to chase my own dreams and not let the size of my goals scare me away from working towards them. Yet another aspect of this book that I appreciated was the context the author gave in each chapter regarding the scientific setting of the time; giving the reader a feel for what was going on in the world of science at the time of each breakthrough is immensely helpful, as it puts the storyline into place and effectively sets the stage for what each scientist concluded. It essentially allowed the reader to enter the time of each scientist and realize the true gravity of each discovery. However, in giving that context, the author continuously harped on the division between religion and science, which was something I wasn’t too fond of. In my opinion, the author seemed to be making science a superior to religion, which is something I don’t agree with. I personally think the author could’ve made his references to this age-old debate a bit more subtle, which would’ve improved his book immensely (in my opinion). But, I do understand the prevalence the author gave to this topic, as it was, and is, a central area of discussion in society. All in all though, I found this to be a great read and I would definitely recommend it!"

It gives a great history and background into the lives of these great minds, then an explanation of how they came to their equation and finally how that equation changed the world. If you have actually heard of Bernoulli, Newton, Faraday, Clausius & Einstein, you'll appreciate it that much more!"

I've read it twice and recommend it to everyone! It is so well-written, and the prose is captivating. For example, when it explains the law of energy conservation (there is nothing new in the universe--it's all recycled) it uses the sun, who makes a carrot grow. We eat it and it gives us energy to create something fabulous! I was delighted!"

12,1567314058,http://goodreads.com/user/show/984663-lori,2,It was supposed to be about the power and poetry of mathematics but it was actually about a bunch of unsubstantiated and rather immature emotions attributed to dead guys.

18,1567314058,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98228971-kyle-socha,4,"Kyle SochaFive Equations That Changed the World	In Michael Guillen's Five Equations That Changed the World, readers are introduced to, as the title clearly states, the five most influential equations in science. Starting with Isaac Newton's Law of Gravity, and ending with Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity, the book brings readers into the lives of the scientists and mathematicians who created the theories and facts that we take for granted today. The book is formatted into five sections, each representing an equation. Each section is then divided into five more sub sections. These subsections include the Prologue, Veni, Vidi, Vici, and Epilogue. In the Prologue, Guillen describes in vivid detail an event in the equation creator’s life that helps set the tone for the next few parts. The Veni, Vidi, and Vici sections stand for, in Latin, “I came, I saw, I conquered.” Veni explains how the scientist came to discover the phenomena that his equation describes, Vidi gives light into how the subject of the equation was grown and developed throughout history, and Vici tells how the scientist overcomes adversity to create an equation that will affect mankind for the rest of history. The Epilogue of each of the five main sections goes on to tell readers how the equation shaped future history, and how it is relevant to our lives. These five subsections of each main Equation topic help to instill a deeper meaning into the reader’s mind. The five equations that are covered in the book are Isaac Newton’s Law of Gravity, Daniel Bernoulli’s Law of Hydrodynamic Pressure, Michael Faraday’s Law of Electromagnetic Induction, Rudolf Clausius’ Second Law of Thermodynamics, and Albert Einstein’s Theory of Special Relativity. These equations and words may seem complicated in the list above, but Michael Guillen writes in such a way that one only needs an open mind and a little bit of time to understand the context behind every scientists ideas. When talking about Isaac Newton, Guillen starts off talking of Newton’s childhood and how he was bullied a kid. He then transitions into Newton under the famous apple tree, then to his thoughts about why that apple fell to Earth, but the moon didn’t. The author weaves the underlying theme of Newton wanting to prove bullies wrong into the story of how the Laws of Gravity came to be. With each section in Five Equations That Changed the World, Guillen develops a narrative and a motive for each scientist and their equation, helping the reader to understand why and how these normal people grew into the immortal figures of science that we know today.  	In terms of scoring this text, I would probably give it an 8/10. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, although there were a few things that prevent it from achieving a perfect score. To start with the good, I really enjoyed the stories presented by the author that helped give context to the scientists lives. It was really interesting to learn the backgrounds and true motivations of each genius talked about in the book. I feel that these background pieces helped me to not just read the equations, but to understand how much work effort and time went into creating the science we know and use today. My favorite background piece was that of Michael Faraday, who’s father died at a young age. Faraday worked hard as a clerk and then as a bookbinder until he experimented his way into the upper echelons of Britsh science. The origin stories of each scientist, and the science and ideas behind each equation, really shed light onto how each equation was created. Another reason that I enjoyed the book is that, as mentioned in the summary, it is not a cut and dry math book that is impossible to understand. Michael Guillen describes each equation in terms that one has a better chance at understanding it. He provides examples for which the equation could be used to help the reader visualize what each mathematical idea is trying to explain. My favorite part of the book, though, was the epilogue of each of the five main sections. The epilogue helped to understand why I should even care about each equation. It helped me understand why these five equations are the most groundbreaking and important in all of human history. The only gripe I have for this book, which is what the 8/10 is for, is that the book is takes a lot of effort to read to its fullest potential. What I mean by this is that with all of the themes, scientific ideas, and narrative intertwined into one story, the reader has to be very focused to get a lot out of the book. This may be a testament to how well-written the book is, but it just seemed to me that I had to put a little too much effort into reading this book. With that being said, the strain of reading the book shouldn’t put other readers off, as it is only a minor gripe. Michael Guillen’s Five Equations That Changed the World is a book that all scientific minded people should read, as it truly is a great insight into how science changed the human race and the planet we live on. "
19,1567314058,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90336640-john-tierney,4,"This book is a bridge between mathematics and the humanities. Dr. Guillen not only presents the Universal Law of Gravity, The Second Law of Thermodynamics, and the Theory of Special Relativity as paradigm changing beacons of science but, also as products of a specific person in a specific place at a specific time. In doing this, he showed how important the historic setting was in developing these theories that dramatically changed how humanity viewed the world.The Author makes effective use of drama to pull the reader into what has been treated very dry in textbooks in the past. The first equation opens with Sir Isaac Newton beating up his bully in the local churchyard; Michael Faraday has to maneuver around his treacherous patron to publish his law of Electromagnetic Induction; even the inevitable heat death of the universe is woven around the story of Rudolf Clausius' struggle to cope with the death of his wife. This was a very accessible read I was not overwhelmed by either the mathematics of the historic content of the book; while I still came away with a better understanding of both the science and the history that was covered."
20,1567314058,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38010332-greta,3,"You may think before reading the book which are the equations it refers to, but you'll surprise yourself to know some others not as famous that became more important for humanity. It ended up being a motivational book, and all kinds of people should read it, even if they do not have a scientific background, since the author makes science sound easy. I like divulgation science books that focus on both science and their historical context and this one of those. For example, did you know that Michael Faraday, a working-class young bookbinder, will become one of the most outstanding members of the Royal Society? This and more stories you'll find in this little book. "
21,1567314058,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9545517-mar,4," 4/5 stars  I really, really like this book. It consists of the stories of five scientists, how they came to discover their famous equations, and how those equations have changed the world. From Newton to Einstein, this book is not only rich in history so that the reader can understand the context of the scientists; but also contains really simple and mundane explanations so that, without being a specialist, the reader can understand the science behind their discoveries. The storytelling is interesting and while I personally adored it, I see how it can be a little boring at times. Nonetheless, if you like science, this is a perfect non-fiction read for you. "
22,1567314058,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21058491-susan-duncan,3,"Overall, this is a great read if you are curious about the life circumstances and personalities of individuals with once-in-a-generation scientific insights... but it made me a little uncomfortable. Much of the ""narrative"" of these five equations hinged upon the author's psychological speculations about each man."
23,1567314058,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90167229-eduardo,5,"A beautiful book about the history of 5 scientists and their contributions.For ""non-math"" people, this is a book that gives a window to peek into the world of science and have a new understanding of the concepts around commonly ""arid"" topics. For math people, a nice opportunity to relax and learn about the lives of the men behind the theories that changed the world."
24,1567314058,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68366621-jason-jones,5,I absolutely love this book and read it once a year. The stories are easy to read and understand. Puts a human face on the abstract mathematical concepts we learn. Learn about the foundational principles in math. Should be required reading in early math courses.

33,1567314058,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64956141-jason,3,"Interesting short biographies of the people behind some of the most influential equations in history. This book illuminates the transformation of science/math from a curious pastime of the wealthy, to an integral part of public education. In reading each of the biographies, I was struck by the importance of applied determination, documentation, and public opinion in making and codifying scientific progress and discoveries, as well as the hard times often experienced along the way. The key motivator for this progress seemed to be unfettered personal curiosity that came from within the individual. It made me ponder how different my and others' approach to math and science might have been, if the topics had been experienced and explored in the more whimsical esoteric manner described in the book, instead of being crammed into the heads of all public school students. Stumbling upon a book of geometry in a bookshop, during a time with few books and no internet--the somewhat secretive nature of this experience, as well as the expense, and thus difficulty, in accessing the knowledge, would likely have many consuming the material with much more enthusiasm and meticulousness, as compared to a class with many students openly ""hating math"" and a teacher trying to teach it to both the ""haters and lovers"" at the same time. If I had encountered geometry or ""the calculus"" in the same way as some of these natural philosophers, I would likely have approached the subjects not as bars to be jumped over or as means to becoming a productive citizen, but as nature-probing skills to be mastered, as ends in and of themselves."
34,1567314058,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56600207-jake-richardson,4,"Five equations that Changed the World:	In Michael Guillen’s Five Equations that Changed the World, Guillen gives great insight into the lives of five brilliant scientists and how they came to their equations that ended up, as the title suggests, changing the world. For each discovery, Guillen organizes his book by talking about the five different people in almost the same way each time. He divides each person and their discovery into four topics. The first of such topics is Veni, where he discusses how each scientist came to his subject of study. Next is Vidi, which is the section that explains the historical aspect that made the equations so mysterious. Vici explains how each scientist manages to conquer each mystery. Lastly, the epilogue to each section explains how the equation and its applications have truly changed the world. Together, these Latin words mean “I came, I saw, I conquered”, which is exactly what each scientist did during their life to find each equation. Beginning with Sir Isaac Newton, Guillen discusses how Newton was always bullied in his early years in school. This in turn, leads him to focus on his studies and to outperform everyone in his school, and eventually come to understand gravity and its effects on objects. Bernoulli, on the other hand, nearly quit mathematics when his envious father tried to steal his own son’s idea. The next scientist discussed was Michael Faraday. He was most interesting because of his poorer background and the addition obstacles he had to overcome to even become a scientist. Rudolf Clausius also had an interesting beginning. His wife had died giving birth to their daughter, and this makes him see the world as a place where death always prevails over life, which influences his law of thermodynamics. Lastly, Albert Einstein is of course discussed because of his famous equation E = mc², which led to the development of the first atomic bomb.	In terms of an overall rating for the book, I would reward it a 4 out of 5 stars. For the positives, I thought that the book went into great depth on to how and more importantly, why each scientist came up with his own discovery and equation. I am not normally one for history, but Guillen made the historical context of each scientist and surrounding time frame very interesting, and I even looked forward to reading that section about each scientist. Additionally, I liked how the book was organized. I thought that the different scientists listed in chronological order made the most sense, but I also liked that Guillen put each scientist and his discovery onto its own smaller, more specific timeline. Each sub-section, Veni, Vidi, and Vici, was a great way to portray the life of each scientist. It also made it much easier to follow what was happening when Guillen would include a flashback or story into the scientists’ past. The sections made sense as to when and why each story was placed where it was. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the book, there were some aspects of it that I would have changed. Guillen went into extensive detail about each scientist’s past, which I appreciated, but he didn’t expand on the later applications of the newly found equations. He would tell the reader what each equation was used for, but Guillen never really showed us why each equation was arguably one of the best scientific finds of all time. Also, I do not think that Guillen accomplished his biggest goal of the book. In the introduction, he went out and told the reader that the purpose of his book was to show and demonstrate the beauty of mathematics. I think that he did explain how mathematics influenced all of the scientists and their ways of thinking, but he did not convince me that mathematics has changed the entire world’s way of thinking about problems. Other than those few things that I would have changed, I enjoyed the book and thought it was a great balance of education and entertainment."
35,1567314058,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6922605-greg,3,"Guillen’s book is interesting, as it provides a brief biographical sketch of five brilliant mathematicians and their extraordinary contributions to the world’s intellectual heritage. His purpose is a survey – the sketches do not claim to be a full representation, and they aren’t. On the whole, the book is equal parts math and gossip. Guillen feels compelled to spice the story up for the reader, and while some of these anecdotes are true (especially interesting in the case of the Bernoulli’s), much is unnecessary. I was especially disappointed by Guillen’s treatment of the conflict between science and religion. Following a brief analysis of Galileo’s career, Guillen represents Newton’s gravitational equations as a death blow to faith. I’ll quote two examples:“In the years ahead, Newton would learn about the growing estrangement between science and religion and, in the end, bring about their permanent divorce.” (39) “Consequently, there was no place left uncorrupted in the universe for God to dwell. He had been crowded out of our picture of the universe by gravity’s infinite reach. For the first time in Western history, the heavens had been completely despoiled; God’s perfect existence had been purged ignominiously from our scientific theories.” (55)Unfortunately, this is not a logical conclusion. That there has frequently been a conflict between scientists and those of faith, sometimes with tragic consequences, is not new news. Certainly the conception of God has changed as a result of mathematical and scientific discoveries. Where Guillen misses the point, however, is that in the eyes of some of these scientists (Newton foremost among them), remained committed to their faiths, choosing to see no conflict between their discoveries and the clarified image of the workings of God. Guillen is inventing here for a good story something which I’m sure he personally believed, but is not logically required in the narrative.Read the book, as it is interesting and these scientists deserve our awe. Take some of Guillen’s opinions for exactly what they are."

My other favorite is a short history of nearly everything by Bill Bryson. I would highly recommend this book to all students of physics. The author gives a narrative account of the events that led up to the discovery of 5 important concepts in physics. His style of writing is poetic, accessible, and engaging. Instead of a factual account of each character, he weaved in bits of his interpretation of their personalities to make the book more interesting. I enjoyed reading about how the inquiry of science evolved from ancient philosophers, and the historical events which led to the famous equations. "
38,1567314058,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5415983-jason,4,"The stories don't always flow well, but it has to be hard to make a book about mathematicians and mathematical equations readable. And this book reads easy. Guillen explores Newton, Bernoulli, Faraday, Clausius and Einstein as he highlights a world-changing equation for which each is responsible. The author wrote this book because ""It is impossible to understand the true meaning of an equation, or to appreciate its beauty, unless it is read in the delightfully quirky language in which it was penned."" In my opinion, he succeeds in capturing the power of the equations alongside the historical contexts of their inventors (discoverers?).Good solid book."
39,1567314058,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1195067-natasha,4,"As you might expect from the title, this book tells the story of five scientists who developed equations that influenced our understanding of physics--all with real world applications. The five equations are Newton's Law of Gravity, Bernouill's Law of Hydrodynamic pressure, Faraday's Law (electro-magnetism), Clausius' Second Law of Thermodynamics, and Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity.I enjoyed Guillen's writing approach.

Features Newton, Faraday, Rudolf Clausius, Daniel Bernoulli, and Einstein. The only thing that would make this book better for me, with 5 stars, is if he could have added a lady mathematician/scientist somehow, even if her equation didn't change the world.
