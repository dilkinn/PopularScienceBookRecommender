There's magic in these pages. Gamow, one of the greatest physicists of 20th century, whose passion for the maths and science is communicated in this book, whether explaining the wonders of infinite series, or how to locate a hidden pirate's treasure chest using imaginary numbers. The book explains how mathematics and science really work, in a language that a layman can understand. Some chapters of the book are simple enough to be understood by a child, whereas others require some concentration and study to be completely understood. And he doesn't shy away from hardcore mathematics, if needed.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
1,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"Having just read this fine book, closely preceded by the equally excellent 
Frontiers of Astronomy
, I'm beginning to feel that the 40s and 50s were not just the Golden Age of science-fiction; they may also have been the Golden Age of popular science writing, a genre which certainly is not unconnected to SF. I have read a fair number of pop science books over the last year, and most of the modern ones are miserably unsatisfying. They are stylistically weak, the authors alternate between patronising you and boring you with anecdotes from their dull lives, and above all the science isn't well done: they can't find good ways to explain abstract concepts in familiar terms, and they fail to distinguish between fact and speculation. A particularly egregious offender is Susskind's 
The Cosmic Landscape
, which I read a couple of weeks ago; other typical examples are Hawking (
The Grand Design
), Guth (
The Inflationary Universe
) and Krauss (
A Universe from Nothing
).Compared with these dull, pompous fantasists, George Gamow is a breath of fresh air. Despite not even being a native speaker of English, he writes better than any of them. He doesn't clutter up the narrative with stories about his personal life, and it's not exactly because he's short of material: he lived through the Russian Revolution and once tried to escape from the Soviet Union in a small boat. And I was impressed to see how many things he got right. He was one of the first people to see that the Big Bang made sense (he made large contributions to the theory), and he explains it well in the final chapter. He comes close to predicting DNA. He does a nice job of covering Relativity in semi-technical terms. And he's got lots of really pretty, original angles on all sorts of scientific and mathematical problems: visualizing the strength of the strong force, seeing the role neutrinos play in causing supernovae, getting an intuitive understanding of what a hypersphere is like. More than 60 years after its initial publication, this is still a fun read, even if some parts have inevitably been overtaken by more recent discoveries. Check it out and see what pop science ought to be like!"
2,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1103368-ben-haley,5,"I love laymen science and this is the best I've read. Gamow presents complex subjects with simple analogies and clever cartoons. His science, rivets like a jackhammer, pounding out universal revelations with each new page.One, Two, Three...Infinity walks us through the worlds of nuclear physics, cosmology, biology, relativity, quantum theory, and astrophysics without skipping a beat. We learn how to measure the height of an oil molecule in a bathtub, the rotation of our milky way with a red shift, and why everything wishes it were silver. Too often, the presentation of real science turns into an imagination's death march into a bleak world of facts and foreign vocabulary. But Gamow keeps it light and by transcending the minutia, makes a reader that floats above it and keeps its value even now, half a decade after its first publication."
3,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16730283-ondrej-urban,4,"It is kind of hard to ""take a step back"" from this book and try to approach it form the point of view of the ""general reader"" instead of a scientist who already has a lot of background in the things discussed here. Let's therefore not do that and see where we get.One, Two, Three... Infinity is something like the Brief History of Time before it was cool - with a different theme and slightly less focus. Its aim is to present the reader with a quick overview of the cutting-edge science at the time it was published. Now, since that happened decades ago - depending on when your edition comes from - you encounter:- the most of the things being correct, exciting and insightful. The author is a great popularizer - as his breed of scientist tends to be somehow - and takes one through both the macro- (astronomy) and the micro-world (quantum mechanics but also bits of biology)- some things being, expectedly, not quite as cutting-edge. The claim that the Universe is older than 3B years is correct, but now we know much better. Similarly with the nature of supernovae. DNA is never once mentioned.- some things are even wrong but that's science for youAt this time, there are probably two main types of audience for this book:- layperson reader that reads this early and later moves on to more recent bits that update them on what's happened since- a scientist reader, who will most probably ending treating this book a lot as a historical curiosity, while feeling smug at certain passages where they'll know better than the big-shot author."
4,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31060683-j-boo,4,"I am almost certain I read this when I was a kid, because I'm pretty sure I remember the bit about Hilbert's hotel."
5,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,5,"A fascinating book written in the 1940s that is surprisingly modern sounding. It has nice explanations of some math, physics, and biology knowledge. For instance, stellar nuclear fusion was explained more clearly than any other pop-sci book I have read. It does show its age by mentioning that 4-color problem hasn't been proven and no rocket can escape from earth's gravity. But still, very clearly written and a pleasure to read."
6,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42902277-eric-s,4,"This book is a great read for anyone wanting a ""popular"" book on science. I would rate this a 5 but it is quite dated and so a number of the subjects have moved on since the original writing. With that caveat in mind the reader will find that this is still a fascinating, fast, and factual read. The parts on numbers, basic physics, and other elementary sciences have lost nothing. The author is EXCELLENT at presenting his subject matter. Though he's not as exuberant as Richard Feynman he's still very captivating. I also very much enjoyed how the author would make even dry subjects interesting. A lot of very worthwhile stuff and definitely worth the time."
7,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27131192-arko,5,"A spectacular book on Science written in the 1960s but much ahead of its time, delving into the basics of numbers to fundamental physics , genetics and cosmology( in which the author is a pioneer). Very lucidly explained and quite captivating & it is a treat for an inquisitive reader."
8,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66626170-sairica,5,"George Gamow is the man who predicted that there should be Cosmic Background Radiation (CMB – an afterglow of The Big Bang which would have after billions of years cooled down to about five degrees above absolute zero – noticeable as the sizeable amount of static on your television set before we were blessed with cable), which is one of the major proofs of the Big Bang Theory and which elevated him to the status of one of the greatest Scientists of the 20th Century. (Unfortunately, the man never won a noble price because I believe he wasn’t taken as seriously as he should have been taken, but after his death his prediction was tested as correct!) It is an honour to hear his words through this book and to get a glimpse into his imagination. This reminds me of a quote by Carl Sagan where he calls Books, the shackles of time. Indeed!This is one of those books that you wish you had read when you were a kid. At least I do! The book makes me yearn for more and more. Every topic is a new subject and there is always something interesting to look forward to, from riddles and relativity to cool topology tricks (which btw are great ice-breakers!) Never did I feel that Physics could be as wonderful as after reading this marvelous book. He has explained the different kinds of infinities that we are familiar with in each field of study and has done so, beautifully. There aren’t enough adjectives to sing in praise of this book.If you have ever wondered about physical phenomena, then, this is a book for you. However, the book does require a fair bit of an inquisitive attitude towards physical phenomena but the great fact about Gamow is that while he doesn’t literally spoon feed you; he makes the concept so simple that with a little bit of effort, you won’t have any trouble in reaching the answers, and oh boy, are you going to have some fun while you’re at it!I am forever indebted to Gamow for explaining to me different types of infinities and how to compare them in a way that I shall find difficult to forget even if someone were to hit me on the head with a hammer (in all seriousness that experiment is out of bounds and quite frankly illegal.) The book led me to one of my favourite limericks, one that is on the Fitz Gerald Contraction. (There was a young fellow named, Fisk; Whose fencing was exceedingly brisk; So fast was his action; The Fitz-Gerald contraction; Reduced his rapier to a disk. ~Unknown) It is like an all-in-one drama only here Gamow gives you a glimpse of all the sexy little bits of the different fields of science. There are illustrations for many topics and Gamow is a master at creating wonder and awe for all the different fields.One thing I will say, though, is that it covered a fair bit of elementary chemistry, something that is hard for me to gulp to this very day. It isn’t that I didn’t understand the chemistry part but just that I prefer the physics of it all except for possibly the part where he refers you to “Explaining the Atom” (1947) by Selig Hecht –A simple book as far as what one amazon reviewer claims, while explaining the only natural fissionable substance – Uranium 235 found in nature diluted with U-238. Seems interesting, well, as interesting as chemistry will get for me!Apart from that, the book kept me cooing till the end. The last chapter is absolutely perfect. He ends with who knows what the universe was like before the beginning of the universe as we know it and narrates the reversal of events from possibly death to life. The man’s brilliant sense of humour and wit kept me giggling throughout the funny bits. A must read for any nosy parker with an interest in Science."

Dover sure has put out a lot of books recently!This was better for the insight into Gamow as a scientific author than any of the actual details; anyone who's going to reach for a mid-century perspective on last century's physics from an eccentric Soviet, complete with hand-drawn comic-like illustrations and puns heavily weighted by innuendo, via the Dover Mathematics line -- known best for its republishing of opaque Eastern European textbooks having questionable heritage of copyright and symbolisms/terminologies/semantics whose correlations with modern standards are dicey at best -- is likely looking for the first time into neither quantum mysteries nor relativities. For that purpose, it served moderately well, although I intend to read  My World Line sometime here and expect that to do better..."
10,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1677868-steven-peterson,5,"I happened to look at a book shelf at home, and this cool book from high school and college years caught my eye. It represents one of the classic volumes that made science accessible to lots of people. It also has humor! In discussing relativity theory, George Gamow uses some limericks:""There was a young fellow named FiskWhose fencing was exceedingly brisk. So fast was his action, The Fitzgerald contractionReduced his rapier to a disk.""Or, my personal favorite:""There was a young girl named Miss Bright,Who could travel much faster than light. She departed one day, In an Einsteinian way,She came back on the previous night.""Anyhow, the book discusses atoms in a readable manner, the various elements, numbers, Einstein's work, ther world of the small (bacteria, light) and the world of the large (the universe and galaxies).Readable, accessible, with humor injected. "
11,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4060448-sundarraj-kaushik,4,Slightly dated book but very well written. I do not have a deep background in physics and so take my review with a little caution.Covers a variety of topics from simple to complex. Anyone with some background in physics should be able to appreciate the simpler topics. The more complex topics related to relativity and time-space paradigms will need a more erudite reader to understand and appreciate. Having said that some illustrations in the book (the angular shifting of the coordinate system) is the closest I have come to understanding the space-time conundrum.A good read for students of physics.
12,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94348630-kent-sibilev,5,"This book is almost 80 years old, but it still a fascinating read. One of the best popular science books."
13,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2875383-xavier-shay,2,"I'm usually right into this sort of book, but I ended up abandoning ~80% of way through. It's very wide in scope, trying to cover maths, micro- and macro- science. That's admirable, but I think I prefer to go deep on a single thing. I also didn't realise it was published in 1947, which combined with breadth and resulting shallowness meant I was already familiar with most of the material.Feels harsh to give this two stars, since I was sincerely impressed at the scope, but I didn't finish it so them the breaks."
14,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/271503-jacob,4,"Written in 1947 and last updated in 1961, Gamow's overview of the postwar state of the art in mathematics, physics, biology, and astronomy is lucid, if occasionally challenging, with 128 charming illustrations by the author scattered through the text. I picked this up for its discussions of number theory and topology for the nonspecialist, though if I had checked the table of contents, I would have seen that the discussion of math per se takes up only about a tenth of the book's length. Still, this is the sort of book that I wish had been on my parents' bookshelf when I was a bored kid reading every book I could get my hands on."
15,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5968450-jenna,4,"Expounding facts and theories of modern science that as a reader it gives you a vivid image of the universe as it shows the scientist of today. It introduces you some interesting history of big numbers and how it started. Likewise, the differences between natural and artificial numbers. The book was fantastically witty!"
16,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1688795-gaurav-hirlekar,5,"Extremely well written book. The author explains his thoughts very concisely and in a very easily understandable manner. If we had books like this for textbooks, every young student would dream of becoming a scientist."

19,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76946755-volo-bonetskyy,5,"1947 book. Explanations and examples are engaging and practical. Science progressed of course since 1947, but this book still feels fresh. Masterpiece of popular physics literature."
20,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19718416-matt,2,"[about 2/3 of the way through; not sure whether I'll finish]There's some interesting stuff in here, but it's marred by too many flaws.On topics too complicated to explain fully, Gamow presents chains of reasoning that don't make sense in the absence of whatever additional evidence is left unspoken. (There's probably no perfect way of handling this, but in my opinion it's much better to acknowledge the gaps than to pretend you're walking the reader through a series of logical deductions.)On topics that I'm unfamiliar with but capable of understanding (random thermal motion, diffusion) I find his explanations unnecessarily confusing.And on a topic that I do understand (basic probability) he gets at least one thing badly wrong.As for the style, it's fairly readable, but not to my taste. Perhaps it's standard mid-20th century American prose (it does feel somewhat familiar) but to me it reads like an awkward compromise between stuffy 19th-century English and patronisingly folksy children's edu-tainment. (That makes it sound worse than it is; it's really not terrible.) I was also frustrated by the use of imperial units, and more importantly the absence of scientific notation for very large or small numbers. (Writing out numbers like ""one hundred millionths of an inch"" is a bad idea, especially when it turns out to be a typo for ""one hundred-millionth of an inch"".)Obviously some of these gripes are subjective, but not all. So I don't understand why this book has such a good reputation, not just as a nostalgic favourite but as a classic worth reading today. I don't recommend it."
21,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82398182-rishabh-jain,4,"This book was written in 1960, and for its time, the author did a commendable job in explaining all the phenomenon that he managed to explain. He has given a detailed overview of multiple different phenomenon from mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and astronomy. Some of his thoughts and predictions about then yet ambiguous ideas were also close to what we know today, such as the big bang and spatial inflation. In that respect, the author probably managed to accomplish more than what he might have set out to do in writing this book. It is simple enough for people to follow, and yet detailed enough to cover the latest expansions of science at that time. The only slight issue I felt in reading it was that, at times, I felt the author would get a bit too rigid in his approach. Even so, he had a radical and positive vision regarding the progress of science from his time, and it's fair to say that scientific progress managed to do justice to his visions. Apart from getting a refresher at some of the fundamental ideas of the universe and it's intricacies, I also enjoyed reading a bit into the scientific perspective of the 60s through the medium of this book. I feel that anyone who takes this book and goes through it with patience, will definitely find it worth their time."
22,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62144030-kristen,0,"Originally published in 1947, despite all advances in science, this book teaches basically as much as I learned of pure science in high school science classes in short form. Of course other topics were covered in depth, but unfortunately did not require one to think and some were not covered at all. Written for the layman, Gamow should be required reading considering the simplicity of high school science and mathematics, and the goal stated on almost every syllabus concerning critical thinking skills. A very enjoyable read that I almost hate to pass along to the next great thinker hiding behind a minimum wage job, even if the information is a little dated. Bringing me to another often ignored point, the poor state of the US education system. Every high school graduate should have the understanding needed to follow each synopsis and the logical reasoning necessary to follow each explanation, however strange, assuming each student is responsible enough to handle the information presented appropriately. (Ooooops! I just committed suicide again!)"
23,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19938181-ananta-ambar,4,"Personally, it was a long read. I had to reread some parts of the book to actually understand the content. You had to follow the details closely, because in a way or another they build the whole idea. If you are lost, chances are the idea won't make any sense. It took me some time to understand certain parts of the book, (e.g. relativity)where the idea is abstract.In my opinion, the reader must have a better than average science knowledge, and good logic. There are some topics that wouldn't make sense if the reader never came across the basic ideas that build it. The explanations on the other hand, were presented in layman terms but still retain the message that it wants to deliver. In conclusion, if you are not familiar with some basic science term, maybe you ought to go back and read it again before reading this book. It was a great read nonetheless."
24,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28050512-juan-ruiz,5,"I really liked this book. It is a little bit like those educational books by Isaac Asimov, but maybe a little bit harder in the examples and explanations he makes. The author explains different aspects of physics such as relativity, entropy, or supernovas, using very concrete examples, trying to to be very logical in his mental process. He delves a little bit into some areas which you can tell are not his dominant subjects, such as biology. He merely mentions evolution, though when he does he seems to be very accurate in all his assertions. He is never speculative, only in the very last pages when he talks about the future of the universe. I really dig the illustrations on this book, which now I find out, were made by the author himself! Apparently this author was very influential in the forming years of Carl Sagan, which is interesting to know. "
25,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12848897-vipin-agrawal,5,"A great science book. The writer starts from very basic about everything and goes deep into the subject starting from cells to body and what not. Well, I should not say that the book is as easy to understand for non-science as brief history of time but the writer has done pretty awesome job in tackling tough things pretty nicely. The book starts from end of the world problem / tower of hanoi and ends with the inflation in the universe. This is the best science book I have read till now.One very underrated things of the book is it connects every single area of science in very smooth manner. Many a times, you are reading some topic, it is interesting and you won't even notice that you are reading about totally different field of science after a while. "
26,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42177264-lu-sun,5,"I have a ""collection"" of this book in Chinese and in English, in both printed version and Kindle version. My first time reading this book was back when I was a junior middle school student. It was an excellent book, and it still is now as I recently re-read it from cover to end.It is suitable for 12 years old and above, who are interested in science. The book covers a variety of content from maths (numerics), physics (special relativity and atom), chemistry (periodic table), biology (genetics), and many more interesting topics. Given that the book is written 50+ years before, it is still not out-dated.If you are a fan of books such as time theory, etc., I think you would also enjoy this one."
27,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3321431-kadri,4,"This book was interesting for several reasons. First Gamow tackled topics from various fields of science such as genetics, particle physics and astronomy in a quite entertaining way. Secondly it was interesting because of the level of scientific knowledge at the time when Gamow was writing this book. Yes, there are bits that are very inaccurate because of it, but it reminds you that scientific theories are born and they die, some sooner than others. Some of the theories that were presented as most likely scenarios, by now are considered or proven wrong, which makes it a great book to read if you know where scientists are with their theories now."
28,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54726049-thayumanavar,5,"Very lucid presentation of ideas and concepts of Physics, Chemistry and Biology interspersed with Mathematics. Among many concepts illustrated by way of math, there is a thing that relates Pi and Probability , that is , one should be able to calculate the value of Pi by dropping match sticks (of shorter length) over a paper marked with equidistant parallel lines and finding the probability of the match sticks that crosses the line - this is Buffon's needle problem and a well written proof of it - pretty impressive. Likewise there are several nifty maths problems in relation to the physical concepts (which makes reading this book quite entertaining.)"

Get ready to have some fun because the whole thing is palatable to any curious person. For example, he starts asking ""How to count infinities?"" matching the book title. This is just the warm-up wrestling with number theory the purest branch of mathematics. Of course he closes the book discussing the ""laws of disorder"" like brownian motion and the second law of thermodynamics making this book a huge and mysterious mess, just like the universe."
30,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83744770-weiyong-xu,5,"This is a very interesting book which covers many important areas in science. Although some parts are a little out-dated now (e.g. Genetics), but we need to consider that at the time when the book was written, physics was the most exciting subject of science and the structrue of DNA had not be discovered yet. It makes me think how small and short our human life is, compared to the history and size of the Universe. Yet, it was definitely a miracle that we were able to read this book and understand so much about ourselves and the world. Science is so fascinating!"
31,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20733235-hassan-rezaee,4,"This is a very good book, and is definitely worth reading, especially the chapter on dimensions, and the space-time is very well explained with easy to understand examples of real life. The book being written in 1988 has not been updated for some rather radical discoveries. For example, the Fermat’s Last Theorem was yet to be proved with Andrew Wiles, or at the time the life of sun was estimated 50 billion years!"
32,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64423543-juan-meurrens,5,"Excellent read for anyone interested in physics, maths and philosophy.A comprehensible description of topics that are so counter-intuitive that they become almost impossible to talk about, mainly as a consequence of the inability of language as it currently is, to properly classify them.Luckily the book has lots of drawings and schema's to accompany those interesting concepts.It well shed a light on things you thought you understood, but turn out you don't.Would highly recommend!"

35,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90667692-albert,2,"This is an emotional review and not a rational one. The book uses the ridiculously archaic imperial system of measurements, so feet and miles etc. instead of the beauty of SI units based on meters. I got so sick of this imperial system of units that I stopped reading. This is supposed to be a book about science! "
36,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35461072-rayfes-mondal,4,You wouldn't think a book from 1947 on physics would be interesting today but he covers much more than just physics and cosmology. I knew plants take in CO2 and produce oxygen but I didn't think about how most of the plant itself is actually produced from the carbon in that CO2 so it's literally making itself out of air. Neat!
37,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7390635-serdar,4,"Fun science primer, a little dated in some respects, but some of the most enjoyable parts (like the discussion of mathematical infinities, plural) are timeless. Gamow has many other books in this vein. all enjoyable. Could be considered a predecessor of Carl Sagan's ""Cosmos""."
38,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2232682-stephen,4,"Good book though a bit dated. The sections on genetics and subatomic physics have clearly seen developments that this book, printed in 1974, did not cover. The author's style is good and pedagogical; however, I enjoyed his book 'Gravity' more than this one."
39,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45669105-toby,5," This is quite possibly the greatest popular science book ever written. The author, George Gamow, must have been an incredibly knowledgeable scientist, as well as an excellent teacher and communicator. Certainly its one of my personal favourites.  The book's whimsical writing is engaging, as you're taken on explorations into the 4th dimension, into the atomic realm, into the world of genetics, and even back to the days of creation. The topics covered are impressive for such a small book, and they were chosen it seems because they deal with a few of the most profound questions a scientist can ask. What is most important, is that the author does not list off facts or expound theory like many science books do, he takes readers on a journey to investigate these questions, which is what science is really about: observing what you can't normally observe and piecing together a puzzle. It encourages actively and attentively thinking in joining him on his journey, rather than passively reading descriptions. While the facts presented are totally intriguing anyway, its the way that they are explored that the book handles best as it guides you through various steps in understanding our natural world through science. The reader can take away from this book how scientific questions are generated, how hypotheses are created and evaluated, how analysis of observations are done and how conclusions are drawn, even though this book never really explains a scientific method. The book masterfully presents the world through the lens of science and encourages readers to gain this new perspective. You end the book not having absorbed pointless information, but equipped with a new outlook on nature and the encouragement and means to apply it. The way this is written is such an effective way to communicate and to learn science, as Gamow firmly places imagination at the center of this journey. I certainly appreciated this as a young reader learning these interesting concepts for the first time. He puts forth some of the most interesting questions, explores the most perplexing territories, elucidates the facts, thoroughly explain concepts to the lay-person and speculates on what they mean in the grand scheme of things. He anticipates the wondering of the reader and will go on funny yet totally meaningful and relevant tangents to further enhance the reader's understanding of new ideas. He guides you through wonderful examples and ingenious thought experiments to reinforce the learning you do. For example, I particularly loved his comparison of the atomic nucleus to fluid, and nuclear forces to surface tension. He used a hilarious thought experiment to demonstrate the strength of ""nuclear fluid"" forces, saying that it could support the mass of Jupiter's satellite ""Demeter"" under the gravitational field of earth before its surface tension would give in and let go of a surface. That to me is both ingenious and hilarious. Who would think of such wild experiments? How fantastic this book is for someone learning the language and the facts of science. It teaches them not only the facts, but encourages creative and critical thinking. The book is now quite old, which may lead many to assume it is out-dated. I would argue that this book is actually pretty timeless. Everything written in it is still true, but with how far science has come, you are not getting the full picture any longer. There have been new subatomic particles discovered like the Higgs Boson, gravitational waves detected, advances in genetics and new developments to the theory of the big bang. Not to mention science faces new conundrums, like what dark matter is made of, what caused cosmic inflation, and how cancer can be cured. The author would have been delighted to include these new facts and questions, that would only further support the ideas he originally expressed. But unfortunately this is the only thing that might be a tiny bit of a drag for the reader. That being said, this book is meant to be a starting point for scientific thinking, meant for adults not equipped in the literacy of science but starting to wonder about what it has to say, teenagers just developing an interest, even kids starting to ask the bigger questions... Because it is meant to be a launching point into the world of science, it is still highly readable and relevant, and it achieves this goal with great success, despite not engaging with the newest of breakthroughs. It works a lot like a science class, though lacking in environment and inquiry experiences, and maybe covering more advanced topics than your high school classes, it can still be great in preparing the reader for encounters with further scientific studies. Once read, the reader is equipped with scientific knowledge to move on to the more cutting-edge stuff. What is most important about the book is not simply the facts however, but the emphasis on creative and critical thinking in investigating scientific concepts. I love the book for this reason. I have recently re-read it now that I have started to teach grade 9-12 science and physics in schools and have found it inspiring once again. "

54,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10361209-dan-downing,5,"We who find gratification in the written word usually have a few books which repay re-reading every decade or two. Maybe Homer, or Greene, or Hegel or Flemming; perhaps Joyce or Fitzgerald or Melville or Bronte. Certainly scads of poets, a scattering of playwrights and for some readers those who wrote in technical fields: Carson or Darwin or Hawking or the present author, George Gamow.My copy of this title dates from 1959. I probably worked through it in 1960, maybe '61. It was in 1961 that a revised edition was published. Apparently, it is still in print and perhaps another revision has been made. In any event, the first time it was published was 1949: some things have changed since them.But some things have not changed. For a reader unfamiliar with today's basic concepts in math, genetics, cosmology and relativity, Gamow's work may be enjoyed and will yield great dividends so long as its limits are kept in mind. For the seeker who is cognizant of today's science, Gamow's occasionally whimsical and always understandable work may well re-root today's' savant in the uncertainties which still exist, even though we often fool ourselves into believing we know all the answers.His adventures in arithmetic and mathematics and probability still amuse and still hold up; the sections on cosmology and physics reveal the enormous amount of work done in the 70 or so years since the writing. Indeed, some reflection may lead one to realize we have learned more since the book was written than in all of history leading up to it. But that means that the hardcore fundamentals are discussed here. Georg Mendel's work was lost until about 1900; what was learned between then and 1946 astounded the world. But what came after the developments of the 1950s makes everything before pale. We can get a feel for that here in the pleasant company of George Gamow.With the caveats mentioned,Highly Recommended.Highly Recommended "
55,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22844409-bishop,4,"Late 1940s layperson-targeted survey of the (1940s) scientific frontier, especially atomic physics, astrophysics, and chemistry, and starts with some awesome topics in set theory and number theory.I always remembered this book for its fantastic introduction to how there are differently sized infinities (Cantor's diagonal counting thing) but never got much beyond that I think because I first tried to read it in elementary school and it was too dense for me. But now I finally read the rest and found it pretty good too, and still worth reading as a general science refresher despite being 70-year old science. The cosmology stuff seems to be the most dated as far as I could tell, but even there it's become dated in an interesting way. Apparently in the 40s the big bang was thought to have started about 10 billion years ago and in the earliest known moments of the universe it was thought to have been a few sun-diameters across. It's interesting how more study has gradually deepened time (it's 13.8 billion years now) and shrunk the initial state down smaller and smaller (it's like an infinitesimal point, or possibly an infinitely large but infinitely dense expanse now) over the decades.I would love to find a present-day equivalent of this book, but I'm not sure there is one this good. I've got Penrose's titanic Road to Reality waiting in the wings but I don't know if I'll ever find the hundreds of hours necessary to tackle that beast until maybe after I retire."
56,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10557154-tommy-carlson,4,"The Curve of Binding Energy makes many a reference to Gamow, including this non-fiction gem from 1947. It's a look at science covering a wide range from numbers themselves, hence the title, to the physical world from micro to macro scales. It's enhanced by illustrative drawings by Gamow himself, which are delightful.What I really loved about the book is that it's from an era far removed from my childhood. If you read enough science non-fiction, you get used to certain analogies being used to describe various things. This book far pre-dates anything I've read before on the subject. So the descriptions are new and novel to my eyes.It's also entertaining to see where future developments show him to be wrong. Some are technical, for example, the wrong hydrogen to helium fusion reaction for the sun. Some are more, well, almost philosophical. Gamow argues that protons and neutrons may well be the indivisible building blocks of nature. (Quarks don't show up until the 60s.)This probably isn't the book for a layperson looking to learn about science stuff. Rather, it's a book for the casual science fan who wants to see how science looked from the viewpoint of an earlier era."
57,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30566360-aparajita-raychaudhury,4,"I would rate this book at 4.5.I love the idea of this book. Every popular science book I've ever read has usually been on a particular topic (like String Theory) or theme (like Cosmology). This is a book that picks 'The most interesting areas of current Science' and then goes ahead and explains it in a beautiful manner. It encompasses Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geology and even some parts History. It's the best gift to encourage a curious child to explore more.Though some of the information is painfully dated, that itself makes the book interesting. I've always been fascinated about how Science changes it's mind (based on evidence), so it's immensely enjoyable to look up the latest information on topics I read here.The language is pretty accessible and the author's sense of humor is awesome. I chuckled out loud a few times even while reading on organic chemistry, and that's saying something given it my least favorite topic in high school.However the book's not perfect. Especially the last 'unit' (Macrocosm) felt hurried and curtailed, with too many 'read my other books' footnotes. So while I won't give this five stars, I would heartily recommend everyone to read it. Preferably in middle school. You would be hard pressed to find a better introduction to Science."
58,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10329028-gary,4,"Great book. To be completely honest, I haven't read the whole thing. I pick it up and put it down again, depending on my mood. The first chapters about numbers and how we learned to count were GREAT. Especially the section on the different sizes of infinity. Clearly explained and fun to think about. Some of it seems a bit dated, and that is perfectly ok. For a science book to be this old and still in print is a testament to how good it is. It is a fun book, and it has pictures. I like books with pictures.The only reason I haven't finished it yet is I'll get caught up reading another book- or actually a couple different books at the same time, and I've managed to finish a few others before finishing this one. I have a goal of finishing all the books I currently own before buying a new one, but I've recently discovered Richard Feynman so those plans might fall apart."

And I can see why, it's well written, nicely organized and very informative.Science books get old fast, yet I read this sixty years after its first publication, and I find it better than other more modern books in similar topics.The style may be a bit dated, and some theories have been proven wrong (for example, the shape of the universe) but topics on relativity, quantum physics, non-Euclidean geometry, apparatus and major physics experiments are explained in a simple manner, yet without insulting the intelligence of the reader.The basic mathematics/calculus/geometry/statistics in the book always tie with issues in physics and how the universe works.

It makes me think how small and short our human life is, compared to the history and size of the Universe. Yet, it was definitely a miracle that we were able to read this book and understand so much about ourselves and the world. Science is so fascinating!"

69,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45669105-toby,5," This is quite possibly the greatest popular science book ever written. The author, George Gamow, must have been an incredibly knowledgeable scientist, as well as an excellent teacher and communicator. Certainly its one of my personal favourites.  The book's whimsical writing is engaging, as you're taken on explorations into the 4th dimension, into the atomic realm, into the world of genetics, and even back to the days of creation. The topics covered are impressive for such a small book, and they were chosen it seems because they deal with a few of the most profound questions a scientist can ask. What is most important, is that the author does not list off facts or expound theory like many science books do, he takes readers on a journey to investigate these questions, which is what science is really about: observing what you can't normally observe and piecing together a puzzle. It encourages actively and attentively thinking in joining him on his journey, rather than passively reading descriptions. While the facts presented are totally intriguing anyway, its the way that they are explored that the book handles best as it guides you through various steps in understanding our natural world through science. The reader can take away from this book how scientific questions are generated, how hypotheses are created and evaluated, how analysis of observations are done and how conclusions are drawn, even though this book never really explains a scientific method. The book masterfully presents the world through the lens of science and encourages readers to gain this new perspective. You end the book not having absorbed pointless information, but equipped with a new outlook on nature and the encouragement and means to apply it. The way this is written is such an effective way to communicate and to learn science, as Gamow firmly places imagination at the center of this journey. I certainly appreciated this as a young reader learning these interesting concepts for the first time. He puts forth some of the most interesting questions, explores the most perplexing territories, elucidates the facts, thoroughly explain concepts to the lay-person and speculates on what they mean in the grand scheme of things.

99,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45669105-toby,5," This is quite possibly the greatest popular science book ever written. The author, George Gamow, must have been an incredibly knowledgeable scientist, as well as an excellent teacher and communicator. Certainly its one of my personal favourites.  The book's whimsical writing is engaging, as you're taken on explorations into the 4th dimension, into the atomic realm, into the world of genetics, and even back to the days of creation. The topics covered are impressive for such a small book, and they were chosen it seems because they deal with a few of the most profound questions a scientist can ask. What is most important, is that the author does not list off facts or expound theory like many science books do, he takes readers on a journey to investigate these questions, which is what science is really about: observing what you can't normally observe and piecing together a puzzle. It encourages actively and attentively thinking in joining him on his journey, rather than passively reading descriptions. While the facts presented are totally intriguing anyway, its the way that they are explored that the book handles best as it guides you through various steps in understanding our natural world through science. The reader can take away from this book how scientific questions are generated, how hypotheses are created and evaluated, how analysis of observations are done and how conclusions are drawn, even though this book never really explains a scientific method. The book masterfully presents the world through the lens of science and encourages readers to gain this new perspective. You end the book not having absorbed pointless information, but equipped with a new outlook on nature and the encouragement and means to apply it. The way this is written is such an effective way to communicate and to learn science, as Gamow firmly places imagination at the center of this journey. I certainly appreciated this as a young reader learning these interesting concepts for the first time. He puts forth some of the most interesting questions, explores the most perplexing territories, elucidates the facts, thoroughly explain concepts to the lay-person and speculates on what they mean in the grand scheme of things. He anticipates the wondering of the reader and will go on funny yet totally meaningful and relevant tangents to further enhance the reader's understanding of new ideas. He guides you through wonderful examples and ingenious thought experiments to reinforce the learning you do. For example, I particularly loved his comparison of the atomic nucleus to fluid, and nuclear forces to surface tension. He used a hilarious thought experiment to demonstrate the strength of ""nuclear fluid"" forces, saying that it could support the mass of Jupiter's satellite ""Demeter"" under the gravitational field of earth before its surface tension would give in and let go of a surface. That to me is both ingenious and hilarious. Who would think of such wild experiments? How fantastic this book is for someone learning the language and the facts of science. It teaches them not only the facts, but encourages creative and critical thinking. The book is now quite old, which may lead many to assume it is out-dated. I would argue that this book is actually pretty timeless. Everything written in it is still true, but with how far science has come, you are not getting the full picture any longer. There have been new subatomic particles discovered like the Higgs Boson, gravitational waves detected, advances in genetics and new developments to the theory of the big bang. Not to mention science faces new conundrums, like what dark matter is made of, what caused cosmic inflation, and how cancer can be cured. The author would have been delighted to include these new facts and questions, that would only further support the ideas he originally expressed. But unfortunately this is the only thing that might be a tiny bit of a drag for the reader. That being said, this book is meant to be a starting point for scientific thinking, meant for adults not equipped in the literacy of science but starting to wonder about what it has to say, teenagers just developing an interest, even kids starting to ask the bigger questions... Because it is meant to be a launching point into the world of science, it is still highly readable and relevant, and it achieves this goal with great success, despite not engaging with the newest of breakthroughs. It works a lot like a science class, though lacking in environment and inquiry experiences, and maybe covering more advanced topics than your high school classes, it can still be great in preparing the reader for encounters with further scientific studies. Once read, the reader is equipped with scientific knowledge to move on to the more cutting-edge stuff. What is most important about the book is not simply the facts however, but the emphasis on creative and critical thinking in investigating scientific concepts. I love the book for this reason. I have recently re-read it now that I have started to teach grade 9-12 science and physics in schools and have found it inspiring once again. "

It's an amazing tour of some interesting bits of physics, mathematics , biology and about birth of planets, in under 350 pages.I read and re-read several times the chapters on mathematics and physics and marked the particularly interesting sections. The book opens with a discussion of mathematics, specifically very large numbers, with two examples of the power of exponential growth, Gamow mentions that arithmetic made easy ‘was not known in ancient times. In fact it was invented less than two thousand years ago by an Indian Mathematician. The book opens with a discussion of mathematics, specifically very large numbers, with two examples of the power of exponential growth The first is about a vizier who (in legend) invented the game of chess. When told by a king that he could have any reward he wished, he asked for one grain of wheat for the first square of a chessboard, two for the second, four for the third, and so forth. The king happily agreed, only to discover that the total amount of wheat would be more than the entire world's wheat production for two thousand years. The second is a legend of a temple in Varanasi containing a game of with 64 disks which, when complete, will mean the end of the world. At a move per second, this would take significantly longer than the estimated age of the universe Gamow mentions that ’arithmetic made easy ‘was not known in ancient times. In fact it was invented less than two thousand years ago by an Indian Mathematician.One Two Three...

129,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45669105-toby,5," This is quite possibly the greatest popular science book ever written. The author, George Gamow, must have been an incredibly knowledgeable scientist, as well as an excellent teacher and communicator. Certainly its one of my personal favourites.  The book's whimsical writing is engaging, as you're taken on explorations into the 4th dimension, into the atomic realm, into the world of genetics, and even back to the days of creation. The topics covered are impressive for such a small book, and they were chosen it seems because they deal with a few of the most profound questions a scientist can ask. What is most important, is that the author does not list off facts or expound theory like many science books do, he takes readers on a journey to investigate these questions, which is what science is really about: observing what you can't normally observe and piecing together a puzzle. It encourages actively and attentively thinking in joining him on his journey, rather than passively reading descriptions. While the facts presented are totally intriguing anyway, its the way that they are explored that the book handles best as it guides you through various steps in understanding our natural world through science. The reader can take away from this book how scientific questions are generated, how hypotheses are created and evaluated, how analysis of observations are done and how conclusions are drawn, even though this book never really explains a scientific method. The book masterfully presents the world through the lens of science and encourages readers to gain this new perspective. You end the book not having absorbed pointless information, but equipped with a new outlook on nature and the encouragement and means to apply it. The way this is written is such an effective way to communicate and to learn science, as Gamow firmly places imagination at the center of this journey. I certainly appreciated this as a young reader learning these interesting concepts for the first time. He puts forth some of the most interesting questions, explores the most perplexing territories, elucidates the facts, thoroughly explain concepts to the lay-person and speculates on what they mean in the grand scheme of things. He anticipates the wondering of the reader and will go on funny yet totally meaningful and relevant tangents to further enhance the reader's understanding of new ideas. He guides you through wonderful examples and ingenious thought experiments to reinforce the learning you do. For example, I particularly loved his comparison of the atomic nucleus to fluid, and nuclear forces to surface tension. He used a hilarious thought experiment to demonstrate the strength of ""nuclear fluid"" forces, saying that it could support the mass of Jupiter's satellite ""Demeter"" under the gravitational field of earth before its surface tension would give in and let go of a surface. That to me is both ingenious and hilarious. Who would think of such wild experiments? How fantastic this book is for someone learning the language and the facts of science. It teaches them not only the facts, but encourages creative and critical thinking. The book is now quite old, which may lead many to assume it is out-dated. I would argue that this book is actually pretty timeless. Everything written in it is still true, but with how far science has come, you are not getting the full picture any longer. There have been new subatomic particles discovered like the Higgs Boson, gravitational waves detected, advances in genetics and new developments to the theory of the big bang. Not to mention science faces new conundrums, like what dark matter is made of, what caused cosmic inflation, and how cancer can be cured. The author would have been delighted to include these new facts and questions, that would only further support the ideas he originally expressed. But unfortunately this is the only thing that might be a tiny bit of a drag for the reader. That being said, this book is meant to be a starting point for scientific thinking, meant for adults not equipped in the literacy of science but starting to wonder about what it has to say, teenagers just developing an interest, even kids starting to ask the bigger questions... Because it is meant to be a launching point into the world of science, it is still highly readable and relevant, and it achieves this goal with great success, despite not engaging with the newest of breakthroughs. It works a lot like a science class, though lacking in environment and inquiry experiences, and maybe covering more advanced topics than your high school classes, it can still be great in preparing the reader for encounters with further scientific studies. Once read, the reader is equipped with scientific knowledge to move on to the more cutting-edge stuff. What is most important about the book is not simply the facts however, but the emphasis on creative and critical thinking in investigating scientific concepts. I love the book for this reason. I have recently re-read it now that I have started to teach grade 9-12 science and physics in schools and have found it inspiring once again. "

143,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4983189-priyadarshini-sur,0,"Though mathematics is not my cup of tea, I picked a book on mathematics’ ‘One two three.Infinity,’subtitled Facts and speculations of science by George Gamow .The book was originally written in 1947 and then revised in 1961. It's an amazing tour of some interesting bits of physics, mathematics , biology and about birth of planets, in under 350 pages.I read and re-read several times the chapters on mathematics and physics and marked the particularly interesting sections. The book opens with a discussion of mathematics, specifically very large numbers, with two examples of the power of exponential growth, Gamow mentions that arithmetic made easy ‘was not known in ancient times. In fact it was invented less than two thousand years ago by an Indian Mathematician. The book opens with a discussion of mathematics, specifically very large numbers, with two examples of the power of exponential growth The first is about a vizier who (in legend) invented the game of chess. When told by a king that he could have any reward he wished, he asked for one grain of wheat for the first square of a chessboard, two for the second, four for the third, and so forth. The king happily agreed, only to discover that the total amount of wheat would be more than the entire world's wheat production for two thousand years. The second is a legend of a temple in Varanasi containing a game of with 64 disks which, when complete, will mean the end of the world. At a move per second, this would take significantly longer than the estimated age of the universe Gamow mentions that ’arithmetic made easy ‘was not known in ancient times. In fact it was invented less than two thousand years ago by an Indian Mathematician.One Two Three... Infinity is full of stories like that, and charming examples of whatever point Gamow is discussing, all illustrated with wonderful and often whimsical line drawings by the author .I liked he chapters on ‘Dimensions and Co-ordinates ‘and ‘Time is the fourth dimension .As the book was last revised in !961 and Gamow died in 1968,the book is not updated as far as physics and biology are concerned. However the sections on mathematics hold up the best, and I will recommend Gamow's explanations of imaginary numbers and infinities to anyone."
144,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10361209-dan-downing,5,"We who find gratification in the written word usually have a few books which repay re-reading every decade or two. Maybe Homer, or Greene, or Hegel or Flemming; perhaps Joyce or Fitzgerald or Melville or Bronte. Certainly scads of poets, a scattering of playwrights and for some readers those who wrote in technical fields: Carson or Darwin or Hawking or the present author, George Gamow.My copy of this title dates from 1959. I probably worked through it in 1960, maybe '61. It was in 1961 that a revised edition was published. Apparently, it is still in print and perhaps another revision has been made. In any event, the first time it was published was 1949: some things have changed since them.But some things have not changed. For a reader unfamiliar with today's basic concepts in math, genetics, cosmology and relativity, Gamow's work may be enjoyed and will yield great dividends so long as its limits are kept in mind. For the seeker who is cognizant of today's science, Gamow's occasionally whimsical and always understandable work may well re-root today's' savant in the uncertainties which still exist, even though we often fool ourselves into believing we know all the answers.His adventures in arithmetic and mathematics and probability still amuse and still hold up; the sections on cosmology and physics reveal the enormous amount of work done in the 70 or so years since the writing. Indeed, some reflection may lead one to realize we have learned more since the book was written than in all of history leading up to it. But that means that the hardcore fundamentals are discussed here. Georg Mendel's work was lost until about 1900; what was learned between then and 1946 astounded the world. But what came after the developments of the 1950s makes everything before pale. We can get a feel for that here in the pleasant company of George Gamow.With the caveats mentioned,Highly Recommended.Highly Recommended "
145,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22844409-bishop,4,"Late 1940s layperson-targeted survey of the (1940s) scientific frontier, especially atomic physics, astrophysics, and chemistry, and starts with some awesome topics in set theory and number theory.I always remembered this book for its fantastic introduction to how there are differently sized infinities (Cantor's diagonal counting thing) but never got much beyond that I think because I first tried to read it in elementary school and it was too dense for me. But now I finally read the rest and found it pretty good too, and still worth reading as a general science refresher despite being 70-year old science. The cosmology stuff seems to be the most dated as far as I could tell, but even there it's become dated in an interesting way. Apparently in the 40s the big bang was thought to have started about 10 billion years ago and in the earliest known moments of the universe it was thought to have been a few sun-diameters across. It's interesting how more study has gradually deepened time (it's 13.8 billion years now) and shrunk the initial state down smaller and smaller (it's like an infinitesimal point, or possibly an infinitely large but infinitely dense expanse now) over the decades.I would love to find a present-day equivalent of this book, but I'm not sure there is one this good. I've got Penrose's titanic Road to Reality waiting in the wings but I don't know if I'll ever find the hundreds of hours necessary to tackle that beast until maybe after I retire."
146,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10557154-tommy-carlson,4,"The Curve of Binding Energy makes many a reference to Gamow, including this non-fiction gem from 1947. It's a look at science covering a wide range from numbers themselves, hence the title, to the physical world from micro to macro scales. It's enhanced by illustrative drawings by Gamow himself, which are delightful.What I really loved about the book is that it's from an era far removed from my childhood. If you read enough science non-fiction, you get used to certain analogies being used to describe various things. This book far pre-dates anything I've read before on the subject. So the descriptions are new and novel to my eyes.It's also entertaining to see where future developments show him to be wrong. Some are technical, for example, the wrong hydrogen to helium fusion reaction for the sun. Some are more, well, almost philosophical. Gamow argues that protons and neutrons may well be the indivisible building blocks of nature. (Quarks don't show up until the 60s.)This probably isn't the book for a layperson looking to learn about science stuff. Rather, it's a book for the casual science fan who wants to see how science looked from the viewpoint of an earlier era."
147,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30566360-aparajita-raychaudhury,4,"I would rate this book at 4.5.I love the idea of this book. Every popular science book I've ever read has usually been on a particular topic (like String Theory) or theme (like Cosmology). This is a book that picks 'The most interesting areas of current Science' and then goes ahead and explains it in a beautiful manner. It encompasses Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geology and even some parts History. It's the best gift to encourage a curious child to explore more.Though some of the information is painfully dated, that itself makes the book interesting. I've always been fascinated about how Science changes it's mind (based on evidence), so it's immensely enjoyable to look up the latest information on topics I read here.The language is pretty accessible and the author's sense of humor is awesome. I chuckled out loud a few times even while reading on organic chemistry, and that's saying something given it my least favorite topic in high school.However the book's not perfect. Especially the last 'unit' (Macrocosm) felt hurried and curtailed, with too many 'read my other books' footnotes. So while I won't give this five stars, I would heartily recommend everyone to read it. Preferably in middle school. You would be hard pressed to find a better introduction to Science."
148,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10329028-gary,4,"Great book. To be completely honest, I haven't read the whole thing. I pick it up and put it down again, depending on my mood. The first chapters about numbers and how we learned to count were GREAT. Especially the section on the different sizes of infinity. Clearly explained and fun to think about. Some of it seems a bit dated, and that is perfectly ok. For a science book to be this old and still in print is a testament to how good it is. It is a fun book, and it has pictures. I like books with pictures.The only reason I haven't finished it yet is I'll get caught up reading another book- or actually a couple different books at the same time, and I've managed to finish a few others before finishing this one. I have a goal of finishing all the books I currently own before buying a new one, but I've recently discovered Richard Feynman so those plans might fall apart."

And I can see why, it's well written, nicely organized and very informative.Science books get old fast, yet I read this sixty years after its first publication, and I find it better than other more modern books in similar topics.The style may be a bit dated, and some theories have been proven wrong (for example, the shape of the universe) but topics on relativity, quantum physics, non-Euclidean geometry, apparatus and major physics experiments are explained in a simple manner, yet without insulting the intelligence of the reader.The basic mathematics/calculus/geometry/statistics in the book always tie with issues in physics and how the universe works.

It makes me think how small and short our human life is, compared to the history and size of the Universe. Yet, it was definitely a miracle that we were able to read this book and understand so much about ourselves and the world. Science is so fascinating!"

The first chapters about numbers and how we learned to count were GREAT. Especially the section on the different sizes of infinity. Clearly explained and fun to think about. Some of it seems a bit dated, and that is perfectly ok. For a science book to be this old and still in print is a testament to how good it is. It is a fun book, and it has pictures. I like books with pictures.The only reason I haven't finished it yet is I'll get caught up reading another book- or actually a couple different books at the same time, and I've managed to finish a few others before finishing this one.

And I can see why, it's well written, nicely organized and very informative.Science books get old fast, yet I read this sixty years after its first publication, and I find it better than other more modern books in similar topics.The style may be a bit dated, and some theories have been proven wrong (for example, the shape of the universe) but topics on relativity, quantum physics, non-Euclidean geometry, apparatus and major physics experiments are explained in a simple manner, yet without insulting the intelligence of the reader.The basic mathematics/calculus/geometry/statistics in the book always tie with issues in physics and how the universe works.

189,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45669105-toby,5," This is quite possibly the greatest popular science book ever written. The author, George Gamow, must have been an incredibly knowledgeable scientist, as well as an excellent teacher and communicator. Certainly its one of my personal favourites.  The book's whimsical writing is engaging, as you're taken on explorations into the 4th dimension, into the atomic realm, into the world of genetics, and even back to the days of creation. The topics covered are impressive for such a small book, and they were chosen it seems because they deal with a few of the most profound questions a scientist can ask. What is most important, is that the author does not list off facts or expound theory like many science books do, he takes readers on a journey to investigate these questions, which is what science is really about: observing what you can't normally observe and piecing together a puzzle. It encourages actively and attentively thinking in joining him on his journey, rather than passively reading descriptions. While the facts presented are totally intriguing anyway, its the way that they are explored that the book handles best as it guides you through various steps in understanding our natural world through science. The reader can take away from this book how scientific questions are generated, how hypotheses are created and evaluated, how analysis of observations are done and how conclusions are drawn, even though this book never really explains a scientific method. The book masterfully presents the world through the lens of science and encourages readers to gain this new perspective. You end the book not having absorbed pointless information, but equipped with a new outlook on nature and the encouragement and means to apply it. The way this is written is such an effective way to communicate and to learn science, as Gamow firmly places imagination at the center of this journey. I certainly appreciated this as a young reader learning these interesting concepts for the first time. He puts forth some of the most interesting questions, explores the most perplexing territories, elucidates the facts, thoroughly explain concepts to the lay-person and speculates on what they mean in the grand scheme of things. He anticipates the wondering of the reader and will go on funny yet totally meaningful and relevant tangents to further enhance the reader's understanding of new ideas. He guides you through wonderful examples and ingenious thought experiments to reinforce the learning you do. For example, I particularly loved his comparison of the atomic nucleus to fluid, and nuclear forces to surface tension. He used a hilarious thought experiment to demonstrate the strength of ""nuclear fluid"" forces, saying that it could support the mass of Jupiter's satellite ""Demeter"" under the gravitational field of earth before its surface tension would give in and let go of a surface. That to me is both ingenious and hilarious. Who would think of such wild experiments? How fantastic this book is for someone learning the language and the facts of science. It teaches them not only the facts, but encourages creative and critical thinking. The book is now quite old, which may lead many to assume it is out-dated. I would argue that this book is actually pretty timeless. Everything written in it is still true, but with how far science has come, you are not getting the full picture any longer. There have been new subatomic particles discovered like the Higgs Boson, gravitational waves detected, advances in genetics and new developments to the theory of the big bang. Not to mention science faces new conundrums, like what dark matter is made of, what caused cosmic inflation, and how cancer can be cured. The author would have been delighted to include these new facts and questions, that would only further support the ideas he originally expressed. But unfortunately this is the only thing that might be a tiny bit of a drag for the reader. That being said, this book is meant to be a starting point for scientific thinking, meant for adults not equipped in the literacy of science but starting to wonder about what it has to say, teenagers just developing an interest, even kids starting to ask the bigger questions... Because it is meant to be a launching point into the world of science, it is still highly readable and relevant, and it achieves this goal with great success, despite not engaging with the newest of breakthroughs. It works a lot like a science class, though lacking in environment and inquiry experiences, and maybe covering more advanced topics than your high school classes, it can still be great in preparing the reader for encounters with further scientific studies. Once read, the reader is equipped with scientific knowledge to move on to the more cutting-edge stuff. What is most important about the book is not simply the facts however, but the emphasis on creative and critical thinking in investigating scientific concepts. I love the book for this reason. I have recently re-read it now that I have started to teach grade 9-12 science and physics in schools and have found it inspiring once again. "

219,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45669105-toby,5," This is quite possibly the greatest popular science book ever written. The author, George Gamow, must have been an incredibly knowledgeable scientist, as well as an excellent teacher and communicator. Certainly its one of my personal favourites.  The book's whimsical writing is engaging, as you're taken on explorations into the 4th dimension, into the atomic realm, into the world of genetics, and even back to the days of creation. The topics covered are impressive for such a small book, and they were chosen it seems because they deal with a few of the most profound questions a scientist can ask. What is most important, is that the author does not list off facts or expound theory like many science books do, he takes readers on a journey to investigate these questions, which is what science is really about: observing what you can't normally observe and piecing together a puzzle. It encourages actively and attentively thinking in joining him on his journey, rather than passively reading descriptions. While the facts presented are totally intriguing anyway, its the way that they are explored that the book handles best as it guides you through various steps in understanding our natural world through science. The reader can take away from this book how scientific questions are generated, how hypotheses are created and evaluated, how analysis of observations are done and how conclusions are drawn, even though this book never really explains a scientific method. The book masterfully presents the world through the lens of science and encourages readers to gain this new perspective. You end the book not having absorbed pointless information, but equipped with a new outlook on nature and the encouragement and means to apply it. The way this is written is such an effective way to communicate and to learn science, as Gamow firmly places imagination at the center of this journey. I certainly appreciated this as a young reader learning these interesting concepts for the first time. He puts forth some of the most interesting questions, explores the most perplexing territories, elucidates the facts, thoroughly explain concepts to the lay-person and speculates on what they mean in the grand scheme of things. He anticipates the wondering of the reader and will go on funny yet totally meaningful and relevant tangents to further enhance the reader's understanding of new ideas. He guides you through wonderful examples and ingenious thought experiments to reinforce the learning you do. For example, I particularly loved his comparison of the atomic nucleus to fluid, and nuclear forces to surface tension. He used a hilarious thought experiment to demonstrate the strength of ""nuclear fluid"" forces, saying that it could support the mass of Jupiter's satellite ""Demeter"" under the gravitational field of earth before its surface tension would give in and let go of a surface. That to me is both ingenious and hilarious. Who would think of such wild experiments? How fantastic this book is for someone learning the language and the facts of science. It teaches them not only the facts, but encourages creative and critical thinking. The book is now quite old, which may lead many to assume it is out-dated. I would argue that this book is actually pretty timeless. Everything written in it is still true, but with how far science has come, you are not getting the full picture any longer. There have been new subatomic particles discovered like the Higgs Boson, gravitational waves detected, advances in genetics and new developments to the theory of the big bang. Not to mention science faces new conundrums, like what dark matter is made of, what caused cosmic inflation, and how cancer can be cured. The author would have been delighted to include these new facts and questions, that would only further support the ideas he originally expressed. But unfortunately this is the only thing that might be a tiny bit of a drag for the reader. That being said, this book is meant to be a starting point for scientific thinking, meant for adults not equipped in the literacy of science but starting to wonder about what it has to say, teenagers just developing an interest, even kids starting to ask the bigger questions... Because it is meant to be a launching point into the world of science, it is still highly readable and relevant, and it achieves this goal with great success, despite not engaging with the newest of breakthroughs. It works a lot like a science class, though lacking in environment and inquiry experiences, and maybe covering more advanced topics than your high school classes, it can still be great in preparing the reader for encounters with further scientific studies. Once read, the reader is equipped with scientific knowledge to move on to the more cutting-edge stuff. What is most important about the book is not simply the facts however, but the emphasis on creative and critical thinking in investigating scientific concepts. I love the book for this reason. I have recently re-read it now that I have started to teach grade 9-12 science and physics in schools and have found it inspiring once again. "

233,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4983189-priyadarshini-sur,0,"Though mathematics is not my cup of tea, I picked a book on mathematics’ ‘One two three.Infinity,’subtitled Facts and speculations of science by George Gamow .The book was originally written in 1947 and then revised in 1961. It's an amazing tour of some interesting bits of physics, mathematics , biology and about birth of planets, in under 350 pages.I read and re-read several times the chapters on mathematics and physics and marked the particularly interesting sections. The book opens with a discussion of mathematics, specifically very large numbers, with two examples of the power of exponential growth, Gamow mentions that arithmetic made easy ‘was not known in ancient times. In fact it was invented less than two thousand years ago by an Indian Mathematician. The book opens with a discussion of mathematics, specifically very large numbers, with two examples of the power of exponential growth The first is about a vizier who (in legend) invented the game of chess. When told by a king that he could have any reward he wished, he asked for one grain of wheat for the first square of a chessboard, two for the second, four for the third, and so forth. The king happily agreed, only to discover that the total amount of wheat would be more than the entire world's wheat production for two thousand years. The second is a legend of a temple in Varanasi containing a game of with 64 disks which, when complete, will mean the end of the world. At a move per second, this would take significantly longer than the estimated age of the universe Gamow mentions that ’arithmetic made easy ‘was not known in ancient times. In fact it was invented less than two thousand years ago by an Indian Mathematician.One Two Three... Infinity is full of stories like that, and charming examples of whatever point Gamow is discussing, all illustrated with wonderful and often whimsical line drawings by the author .I liked he chapters on ‘Dimensions and Co-ordinates ‘and ‘Time is the fourth dimension .As the book was last revised in !961 and Gamow died in 1968,the book is not updated as far as physics and biology are concerned. However the sections on mathematics hold up the best, and I will recommend Gamow's explanations of imaginary numbers and infinities to anyone."
234,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10361209-dan-downing,5,"We who find gratification in the written word usually have a few books which repay re-reading every decade or two. Maybe Homer, or Greene, or Hegel or Flemming; perhaps Joyce or Fitzgerald or Melville or Bronte. Certainly scads of poets, a scattering of playwrights and for some readers those who wrote in technical fields: Carson or Darwin or Hawking or the present author, George Gamow.My copy of this title dates from 1959. I probably worked through it in 1960, maybe '61. It was in 1961 that a revised edition was published. Apparently, it is still in print and perhaps another revision has been made. In any event, the first time it was published was 1949: some things have changed since them.But some things have not changed. For a reader unfamiliar with today's basic concepts in math, genetics, cosmology and relativity, Gamow's work may be enjoyed and will yield great dividends so long as its limits are kept in mind. For the seeker who is cognizant of today's science, Gamow's occasionally whimsical and always understandable work may well re-root today's' savant in the uncertainties which still exist, even though we often fool ourselves into believing we know all the answers.His adventures in arithmetic and mathematics and probability still amuse and still hold up; the sections on cosmology and physics reveal the enormous amount of work done in the 70 or so years since the writing. Indeed, some reflection may lead one to realize we have learned more since the book was written than in all of history leading up to it. But that means that the hardcore fundamentals are discussed here. Georg Mendel's work was lost until about 1900; what was learned between then and 1946 astounded the world. But what came after the developments of the 1950s makes everything before pale. We can get a feel for that here in the pleasant company of George Gamow.With the caveats mentioned,Highly Recommended.Highly Recommended "
235,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22844409-bishop,4,"Late 1940s layperson-targeted survey of the (1940s) scientific frontier, especially atomic physics, astrophysics, and chemistry, and starts with some awesome topics in set theory and number theory.I always remembered this book for its fantastic introduction to how there are differently sized infinities (Cantor's diagonal counting thing) but never got much beyond that I think because I first tried to read it in elementary school and it was too dense for me. But now I finally read the rest and found it pretty good too, and still worth reading as a general science refresher despite being 70-year old science. The cosmology stuff seems to be the most dated as far as I could tell, but even there it's become dated in an interesting way. Apparently in the 40s the big bang was thought to have started about 10 billion years ago and in the earliest known moments of the universe it was thought to have been a few sun-diameters across. It's interesting how more study has gradually deepened time (it's 13.8 billion years now) and shrunk the initial state down smaller and smaller (it's like an infinitesimal point, or possibly an infinitely large but infinitely dense expanse now) over the decades.I would love to find a present-day equivalent of this book, but I'm not sure there is one this good. I've got Penrose's titanic Road to Reality waiting in the wings but I don't know if I'll ever find the hundreds of hours necessary to tackle that beast until maybe after I retire."

It's a look at science covering a wide range from numbers themselves, hence the title, to the physical world from micro to macro scales. It's enhanced by illustrative drawings by Gamow himself, which are delightful.What I really loved about the book is that it's from an era far removed from my childhood. If you read enough science non-fiction, you get used to certain analogies being used to describe various things. This book far pre-dates anything I've read before on the subject. So the descriptions are new and novel to my eyes.It's also entertaining to see where future developments show him to be wrong. Some are technical, for example, the wrong hydrogen to helium fusion reaction for the sun. Some are more, well, almost philosophical. Gamow argues that protons and neutrons may well be the indivisible building blocks of nature. (Quarks don't show up until the 60s.)This probably isn't the book for a layperson looking to learn about science stuff. Rather, it's a book for the casual science fan who wants to see how science looked from the viewpoint of an earlier era."

That to me is both ingenious and hilarious. Who would think of such wild experiments? How fantastic this book is for someone learning the language and the facts of science. It teaches them not only the facts, but encourages creative and critical thinking. The book is now quite old, which may lead many to assume it is out-dated. I would argue that this book is actually pretty timeless. Everything written in it is still true, but with how far science has come, you are not getting the full picture any longer. There have been new subatomic particles discovered like the Higgs Boson, gravitational waves detected, advances in genetics and new developments to the theory of the big bang. Not to mention science faces new conundrums, like what dark matter is made of, what caused cosmic inflation, and how cancer can be cured. The author would have been delighted to include these new facts and questions, that would only further support the ideas he originally expressed. But unfortunately this is the only thing that might be a tiny bit of a drag for the reader. That being said, this book is meant to be a starting point for scientific thinking, meant for adults not equipped in the literacy of science but starting to wonder about what it has to say, teenagers just developing an interest, even kids starting to ask the bigger questions... Because it is meant to be a launching point into the world of science, it is still highly readable and relevant, and it achieves this goal with great success, despite not engaging with the newest of breakthroughs. It works a lot like a science class, though lacking in environment and inquiry experiences, and maybe covering more advanced topics than your high school classes, it can still be great in preparing the reader for encounters with further scientific studies. Once read, the reader is equipped with scientific knowledge to move on to the more cutting-edge stuff. What is most important about the book is not simply the facts however, but the emphasis on creative and critical thinking in investigating scientific concepts. I love the book for this reason. I have recently re-read it now that I have started to teach grade 9-12 science and physics in schools and have found it inspiring once again. "

264,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10361209-dan-downing,5,"We who find gratification in the written word usually have a few books which repay re-reading every decade or two. Maybe Homer, or Greene, or Hegel or Flemming; perhaps Joyce or Fitzgerald or Melville or Bronte. Certainly scads of poets, a scattering of playwrights and for some readers those who wrote in technical fields: Carson or Darwin or Hawking or the present author, George Gamow.My copy of this title dates from 1959. I probably worked through it in 1960, maybe '61. It was in 1961 that a revised edition was published. Apparently, it is still in print and perhaps another revision has been made. In any event, the first time it was published was 1949: some things have changed since them.But some things have not changed. For a reader unfamiliar with today's basic concepts in math, genetics, cosmology and relativity, Gamow's work may be enjoyed and will yield great dividends so long as its limits are kept in mind. For the seeker who is cognizant of today's science, Gamow's occasionally whimsical and always understandable work may well re-root today's' savant in the uncertainties which still exist, even though we often fool ourselves into believing we know all the answers.His adventures in arithmetic and mathematics and probability still amuse and still hold up; the sections on cosmology and physics reveal the enormous amount of work done in the 70 or so years since the writing. Indeed, some reflection may lead one to realize we have learned more since the book was written than in all of history leading up to it. But that means that the hardcore fundamentals are discussed here. Georg Mendel's work was lost until about 1900; what was learned between then and 1946 astounded the world. But what came after the developments of the 1950s makes everything before pale. We can get a feel for that here in the pleasant company of George Gamow.With the caveats mentioned,Highly Recommended.Highly Recommended "
265,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22844409-bishop,4,"Late 1940s layperson-targeted survey of the (1940s) scientific frontier, especially atomic physics, astrophysics, and chemistry, and starts with some awesome topics in set theory and number theory.I always remembered this book for its fantastic introduction to how there are differently sized infinities (Cantor's diagonal counting thing) but never got much beyond that I think because I first tried to read it in elementary school and it was too dense for me. But now I finally read the rest and found it pretty good too, and still worth reading as a general science refresher despite being 70-year old science. The cosmology stuff seems to be the most dated as far as I could tell, but even there it's become dated in an interesting way. Apparently in the 40s the big bang was thought to have started about 10 billion years ago and in the earliest known moments of the universe it was thought to have been a few sun-diameters across. It's interesting how more study has gradually deepened time (it's 13.8 billion years now) and shrunk the initial state down smaller and smaller (it's like an infinitesimal point, or possibly an infinitely large but infinitely dense expanse now) over the decades.I would love to find a present-day equivalent of this book, but I'm not sure there is one this good. I've got Penrose's titanic Road to Reality waiting in the wings but I don't know if I'll ever find the hundreds of hours necessary to tackle that beast until maybe after I retire."
266,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10557154-tommy-carlson,4,"The Curve of Binding Energy makes many a reference to Gamow, including this non-fiction gem from 1947. It's a look at science covering a wide range from numbers themselves, hence the title, to the physical world from micro to macro scales. It's enhanced by illustrative drawings by Gamow himself, which are delightful.What I really loved about the book is that it's from an era far removed from my childhood. If you read enough science non-fiction, you get used to certain analogies being used to describe various things. This book far pre-dates anything I've read before on the subject. So the descriptions are new and novel to my eyes.It's also entertaining to see where future developments show him to be wrong. Some are technical, for example, the wrong hydrogen to helium fusion reaction for the sun. Some are more, well, almost philosophical. Gamow argues that protons and neutrons may well be the indivisible building blocks of nature. (Quarks don't show up until the 60s.)This probably isn't the book for a layperson looking to learn about science stuff. Rather, it's a book for the casual science fan who wants to see how science looked from the viewpoint of an earlier era."
267,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30566360-aparajita-raychaudhury,4,"I would rate this book at 4.5.I love the idea of this book. Every popular science book I've ever read has usually been on a particular topic (like String Theory) or theme (like Cosmology). This is a book that picks 'The most interesting areas of current Science' and then goes ahead and explains it in a beautiful manner. It encompasses Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geology and even some parts History. It's the best gift to encourage a curious child to explore more.Though some of the information is painfully dated, that itself makes the book interesting. I've always been fascinated about how Science changes it's mind (based on evidence), so it's immensely enjoyable to look up the latest information on topics I read here.The language is pretty accessible and the author's sense of humor is awesome. I chuckled out loud a few times even while reading on organic chemistry, and that's saying something given it my least favorite topic in high school.However the book's not perfect. Especially the last 'unit' (Macrocosm) felt hurried and curtailed, with too many 'read my other books' footnotes. So while I won't give this five stars, I would heartily recommend everyone to read it. Preferably in middle school. You would be hard pressed to find a better introduction to Science."
268,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10329028-gary,4,"Great book. To be completely honest, I haven't read the whole thing. I pick it up and put it down again, depending on my mood. The first chapters about numbers and how we learned to count were GREAT. Especially the section on the different sizes of infinity. Clearly explained and fun to think about. Some of it seems a bit dated, and that is perfectly ok. For a science book to be this old and still in print is a testament to how good it is. It is a fun book, and it has pictures. I like books with pictures.The only reason I haven't finished it yet is I'll get caught up reading another book- or actually a couple different books at the same time, and I've managed to finish a few others before finishing this one. I have a goal of finishing all the books I currently own before buying a new one, but I've recently discovered Richard Feynman so those plans might fall apart."

And I can see why, it's well written, nicely organized and very informative.Science books get old fast, yet I read this sixty years after its first publication, and I find it better than other more modern books in similar topics.The style may be a bit dated, and some theories have been proven wrong (for example, the shape of the universe) but topics on relativity, quantum physics, non-Euclidean geometry, apparatus and major physics experiments are explained in a simple manner, yet without insulting the intelligence of the reader.The basic mathematics/calculus/geometry/statistics in the book always tie with issues in physics and how the universe works.

It makes me think how small and short our human life is, compared to the history and size of the Universe. Yet, it was definitely a miracle that we were able to read this book and understand so much about ourselves and the world. Science is so fascinating!"

279,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45669105-toby,5," This is quite possibly the greatest popular science book ever written. The author, George Gamow, must have been an incredibly knowledgeable scientist, as well as an excellent teacher and communicator. Certainly its one of my personal favourites.  The book's whimsical writing is engaging, as you're taken on explorations into the 4th dimension, into the atomic realm, into the world of genetics, and even back to the days of creation. The topics covered are impressive for such a small book, and they were chosen it seems because they deal with a few of the most profound questions a scientist can ask. What is most important, is that the author does not list off facts or expound theory like many science books do, he takes readers on a journey to investigate these questions, which is what science is really about: observing what you can't normally observe and piecing together a puzzle. It encourages actively and attentively thinking in joining him on his journey, rather than passively reading descriptions. While the facts presented are totally intriguing anyway, its the way that they are explored that the book handles best as it guides you through various steps in understanding our natural world through science. The reader can take away from this book how scientific questions are generated, how hypotheses are created and evaluated, how analysis of observations are done and how conclusions are drawn, even though this book never really explains a scientific method. The book masterfully presents the world through the lens of science and encourages readers to gain this new perspective. You end the book not having absorbed pointless information, but equipped with a new outlook on nature and the encouragement and means to apply it. The way this is written is such an effective way to communicate and to learn science, as Gamow firmly places imagination at the center of this journey. I certainly appreciated this as a young reader learning these interesting concepts for the first time. He puts forth some of the most interesting questions, explores the most perplexing territories, elucidates the facts, thoroughly explain concepts to the lay-person and speculates on what they mean in the grand scheme of things. He anticipates the wondering of the reader and will go on funny yet totally meaningful and relevant tangents to further enhance the reader's understanding of new ideas. He guides you through wonderful examples and ingenious thought experiments to reinforce the learning you do. For example, I particularly loved his comparison of the atomic nucleus to fluid, and nuclear forces to surface tension. He used a hilarious thought experiment to demonstrate the strength of ""nuclear fluid"" forces, saying that it could support the mass of Jupiter's satellite ""Demeter"" under the gravitational field of earth before its surface tension would give in and let go of a surface.

For the seeker who is cognizant of today's science, Gamow's occasionally whimsical and always understandable work may well re-root today's' savant in the uncertainties which still exist, even though we often fool ourselves into believing we know all the answers.His adventures in arithmetic and mathematics and probability still amuse and still hold up; the sections on cosmology and physics reveal the enormous amount of work done in the 70 or so years since the writing. Indeed, some reflection may lead one to realize we have learned more since the book was written than in all of history leading up to it. But that means that the hardcore fundamentals are discussed here. Georg Mendel's work was lost until about 1900; what was learned between then and 1946 astounded the world. But what came after the developments of the 1950s makes everything before pale. We can get a feel for that here in the pleasant company of George Gamow.With the caveats mentioned,Highly Recommended.Highly Recommended "

But now I finally read the rest and found it pretty good too, and still worth reading as a general science refresher despite being 70-year old science. The cosmology stuff seems to be the most dated as far as I could tell, but even there it's become dated in an interesting way. Apparently in the 40s the big bang was thought to have started about 10 billion years ago and in the earliest known moments of the universe it was thought to have been a few sun-diameters across. It's interesting how more study has gradually deepened time (it's 13.8 billion years now) and shrunk the initial state down smaller and smaller (it's like an infinitesimal point, or possibly an infinitely large but infinitely dense expanse now) over the decades.I would love to find a present-day equivalent of this book, but I'm not sure there is one this good. I've got Penrose's titanic Road to Reality waiting in the wings but I don't know if I'll ever find the hundreds of hours necessary to tackle that beast until maybe after I retire."

It's a look at science covering a wide range from numbers themselves, hence the title, to the physical world from micro to macro scales. It's enhanced by illustrative drawings by Gamow himself, which are delightful.What I really loved about the book is that it's from an era far removed from my childhood. If you read enough science non-fiction, you get used to certain analogies being used to describe various things. This book far pre-dates anything I've read before on the subject. So the descriptions are new and novel to my eyes.It's also entertaining to see where future developments show him to be wrong. Some are technical, for example, the wrong hydrogen to helium fusion reaction for the sun. Some are more, well, almost philosophical. Gamow argues that protons and neutrons may well be the indivisible building blocks of nature. (Quarks don't show up until the 60s.)This probably isn't the book for a layperson looking to learn about science stuff. Rather, it's a book for the casual science fan who wants to see how science looked from the viewpoint of an earlier era."

Every popular science book I've ever read has usually been on a particular topic (like String Theory) or theme (like Cosmology). This is a book that picks 'The most interesting areas of current Science' and then goes ahead and explains it in a beautiful manner. It encompasses Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geology and even some parts History. It's the best gift to encourage a curious child to explore more.Though some of the information is painfully dated, that itself makes the book interesting. I've always been fascinated about how Science changes it's mind (based on evidence), so it's immensely enjoyable to look up the latest information on topics I read here.The language is pretty accessible and the author's sense of humor is awesome. I chuckled out loud a few times even while reading on organic chemistry, and that's saying something given it my least favorite topic in high school.However the book's not perfect. Especially the last 'unit' (Macrocosm) felt hurried and curtailed, with too many 'read my other books' footnotes. So while I won't give this five stars, I would heartily recommend everyone to read it. Preferably in middle school. You would be hard pressed to find a better introduction to Science."
298,0486256642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10329028-gary,4,"Great book. To be completely honest, I haven't read the whole thing. I pick it up and put it down again, depending on my mood. The first chapters about numbers and how we learned to count were GREAT. Especially the section on the different sizes of infinity. Clearly explained and fun to think about. Some of it seems a bit dated, and that is perfectly ok. For a science book to be this old and still in print is a testament to how good it is. It is a fun book, and it has pictures. I like books with pictures.The only reason I haven't finished it yet is I'll get caught up reading another book- or actually a couple different books at the same time, and I've managed to finish a few others before finishing this one. I have a goal of finishing all the books I currently own before buying a new one, but I've recently discovered Richard Feynman so those plans might fall apart."

And I can see why, it's well written, nicely organized and very informative.Science books get old fast, yet I read this sixty years after its first publication, and I find it better than other more modern books in similar topics.The style may be a bit dated, and some theories have been proven wrong (for example, the shape of the universe) but topics on relativity, quantum physics, non-Euclidean geometry, apparatus and major physics experiments are explained in a simple manner, yet without insulting the intelligence of the reader.The basic mathematics/calculus/geometry/statistics in the book always tie with issues in physics and how the universe works. Some parts may need a bit of concentration and rereading but no previous knowledge is assumed."
