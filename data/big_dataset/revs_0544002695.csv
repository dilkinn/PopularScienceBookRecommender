0,0544002695,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54,3,"I chose to read this book because it is one of the more visible examples of a trade business/ technology book about some recent changes in the data/information business. The key intuition that this book is highlighting is a shift towards greatly increased production of data and greatly increased use of large nearly complete population levels data sets in the management and control of a range of industries. This change is fueled by the wide adoption of broadband internet services and significant increases in data processing capacities in pcs, laptops, and tablets. The key point of distinction is that when you can access nearly all of the data in a situation in real time, analysis approaches and techniques change and the uses of data analysis greatly increase. This moves situations away from traditional sample-based statistics and into much greater depth analyses and descriptions of entire populations (or as the authors say: n=all). The authors are from Oxford and ""The Economist"" magazine and appear to be experts, even though they claim in the book that experts will decline in importance in the big data sector. The book is not without interesting sections, in particular the sections on Google's use of data for multiple purposes and the discussion of the value chain for the ""big data"" industry. This really is a change that is being discussed and business and engineering schools across the US are hurrying to catch up with and capitalize on it.Having said that .... this book was a huge disappointment. Why?To start with, the clear development that is the focus of the book about ""big data"" is blown way out of proportion and elevated to a near world historical event. I don't buy it for a second. The rise of data driven approaches to research and control is worth taking note of but claims similar to those made here have been made virtually nonstop for technological gains from Bell Labs through the Internet boom of the 1990s up to the present. It is as if each new fad needs its own slogan and fight song. Go big data, rah! To put it more simply, the hype levels are way over the top.Second, even if I could put up with the hype, the book is not that informative beyond a very general level. Little depth is provided about firms like Google or Facebook. The most detailed examples are culled from other pop books with similar themes, including Freakonomics and Thinking Slow/Thinking Fast. A little more original contribution would have been appreciated.Third, the book is rambling, repetitive, and poorly edited. I get it -- big data is awesome and will change everything! We have to work with correlations and not old fashioned ideas of causality! Once we reach n=all, our petty disputes will end and the facts will speak for themselves. The first four times these points were raised were sufficient for me.Pay no attention to the fact that the bulk of examples provided are well understood examples of large technology firms, data intensive supply chain dominant firms (Wal-Mart), and internet start-ups. Pay no attention to the fact that many of these critical issues have been around for a while in various forms. Pay no attention to a historical record that shows that programming and data will not solve our problems, that technology company executives do not have all the answers, and that the facts do not speak for themselves.The final chapters raise the obligatory issues of privacy, civil liberties, and controls, but it is hard to take such discussion seriously in a book that spent the initial chapters discussing what a cool development big data was.The subject matter of the book is important and the changes discussed will contribute to changing our society. OK, but why not at least try to put things in a broader context? I really cannot recommend the book, but for interested readers there is an abriged version of the basic points in the May-June issue of Foreign Affairs."
1,0544002695,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3653009-jimboninja,3,"This book was interesting initially but became a bit repetitive overall. It has three major points in it;1. Sampling was important when collecting data was expensive and difficult, but we now we have access by one means or another to all data. 2. Since we have so much data, the quality of individual data points is not important and we can allow inexactness in measurement processes as long as there isn't a systematic bias. 3. Causality and understanding why things happen is no longer as important as correlation and discovering the correct strategies or course of action based upon large bodies of data. All of these points could have been made in a hundred pages I think, and reading just the first half of the book would give a reader the basic ideas intended by the author. While there may be areas in which data analysis can point out solutions to problems, I'm not convinced by the author's assertion that Big Data will make experts in various fields obsolete. I would guess that Big Data will be a tool in the hands of experts, but I don't think we'll find data analysts replacing doctors and subject matter experts on a large scale. "
2,0544002695,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4579658-rob-kitchin,2,"In 2008 the term ‘big data’ was barely in use. Five years later and it has become latest ICT-related buzzword, used to refer to the recent surge in the generation of huge quantities of diverse and dynamic data produced by social media, transactions and interactions across the internet, sensor and camera networks, a myriad software-enabled devices, scientific equipment, etc. Mayer-Schonberger and Cukier’s book aims to provide an initial survey and analysis of the big data phenomena and what they call datafication; the process of transforming all things under the sun into data from which value can be extracted. They argue that a data revolution is underway, with the nature of data production and analysis undergoing a paradigm shift in three ways. First, the volume of data being produced is being radically transformed, with a move away from sampling to try and capture entire populations (n=all). Second, by being exhaustive in scope, it is possible to embrace the messiness of data rather than seeking exactitude (as required, along with randomness, in sampling); as they put it “more trumps better”. Third, that the types of questions asked changes from why (causation) to what (correlation): “We don’t always need to know the cause of a phenomena; rather, we can let the data speak for itself.” In other words, the traditional deductive, hypothesis-led mode of analysis is replaced by an inductive approach wherein analytics examine the data for all meaningful patterns, rather than testing for particular relationships. This third shift, they argue, also means that there is no longer the need for domain-specific expertise. As such, the era of big data is producing massive, exhaustive, messy datasets that can be mined for insightful information that can be used to identify relationships within the data that can be capitalised upon, such as using the vast quantities of data produced by a supermarket chain about consumers and their transactions to identify patterns of purchases which can then be used to tailor marketing strategies and increase turn-over. Mayer-Schonberger and Cukier are right that there is a data revolution underway and they provide an initial overview of the big data phenomena. However, their analysis is weak in a number of respects. First, it ignores completely emerging debates about the kind of empiricism and data dredging they describe, which are deeply problematic in all kinds of ways, and the data-driven science being advocated by scientists. No scientist or analyst worth their salt believes that data simply speak for themselves free of theory. Second, the account is quite sketchy as to how analysts can make sense of big data and the new analytical techniques that are being developed. There is a science to big data in terms of devising the algorithms employed within machine learning and other big data analytics, yet the reader gets no real insight into how these work. Third, the book avoids tackling the deep and difficult epistemological questions that arise when a paradigm shift occurs. The book is clearly targeted at a non-academic audience, but nevertheless a grounded discussion of the philosophy of data and science in the era of big data is merited when such grandiose claims are being made. Fourth, they rightly acknowledge that big data raises all kinds of ethical issues, but their analysis lacks depth and critique and pushes a business-friendly, market-orientated line about self-regulation without adequately setting out the pros and cons of such a strategy. Finally, the text suffers from being overly repetitious and the referencing is dreadful: it would be possible to condense the entire book into just a couple of chapters and not lose any of the argument, and whilst there are notes in back of book there are no numbers in the text to link to them. Overall then, whilst the book provides an initial text about big data and does include some interesting and useful nuggets, the analysis in general is narrow and weak, and it seems more about championing an emerging ICT market than providing a thorough, critical overview of the nature of big data and its implications and consequences."
3,0544002695,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"Chapter two of this book starts by telling us the three things the book will be about:“The first is the ability to analyse vast amounts of data about a topic rather than be forced to settle for smaller sets. The second is a willingness to embrace data’s real-world messiness rather than privilege exactitude. The third is the growing respect for correlations rather than a continuing quest for elusive causality.”And that is exactly what this book does – it discusses each of these points more or less in turn.I hadn’t really thought about the relationship between statistics and big data before reading this book. Statistics is essentially a way of learning things about large populations by giving you an insight into how confidently you can make extrapolations from small samples of that larger population. So, you can ask a thousand odd people how they are likely to vote in the coming election, and if you have randomised the people you are asking properly you are likely to get a pretty good idea of how the entire country will vote. This is a remarkable thing, when you think about it, and something very few of us (I include myself in this group) have ever really understood. Also remarkable is that asking another two or three thousand people the same question doesn’t really make your prediction any more accurate, something else that is counter-intuitive with statistics that never made them feel all that comfortable. The word ‘statistics’ starts with the word ‘state’ for a very good reason – statistics have always been about finding ways to define and understand populations so as to control those populations.But big data doesn’t work in the same way that statistics generally works – big data isn’t about asking a small group of people what their preferences are, big data asks everyone in the sample population what their preference is, in fact, big data doesn’t even bother to ask, it just sees what we all do and goes from there. Rather than having to listen to our self-serving lies about ourselves, big data crunches how many times we actually eat at McDonalds, how many times we actually go to the gym, and draws conclusions from those facts, rather than our own wishful thinking. So, we have supermarkets now that are able to link you (via your using their loyalty card) to everything you purchase in their store. You might also have told them other interesting bits of information: how much you earn, your address, your age, your marriage status, how many children you have, whether you own or rent your house – but then, I guess you were promised a Mars Bar at the end of each year, so why wouldn’t you pass on this information? With the ever-increasing improvement in computer processing power this means that supermarkets are able to learn things about you that you probably don’t know about yourself. All books on this subject (and this book is no exception) tell the Target story – where a father opens his daughter’s junk mail from Target to find they are suggesting she buy various baby products. The father gets upset and calls Target to complain, only to later learn that his daughter actually is pregnant. How did Target know? They ran the girl’s purchases through their computer and they matched those purchases with those that correlate to that of a pregnant women. It gets better, they don’t even need you to buy ‘What to Expect When You’re Expecting’ (book or DVD) – they can tell you are pregnant by correlations that we would not immediately associate with being pregnant – like buying scentless cosmetics. Tick off a couple of purchases in the right boxes, be from the right demographic and bam - they can even tell you when you are likely to be due…And that is the other big theme in this book – bizarre correlations. Richard Feynman said somewhere that he is a Babylonian, rather than a Greek. By that he meant that the Greeks were always after ‘proof’, whereas the Babylonians were much more interested in mathematics that worked, whether they could prove why it worked or not. Proof is another word for ‘cause’ and this book is, in some ways, an extended mediation on that greatest of all First Year undergraduate lines ‘correlation does not equal causation’ – except this book shows that often understanding that two things are correlated, without having a clue as to why they might be, is actually enough. It doesn’t equal causation, but it does mean a certain percentage of men on their way home are likely to buy a six pack of beer and nappies so the supermarket isn’t going to have these items beside each other in the store or on special at the same time. You are being manipulated, but in ways you can never guess.Now, there are incredible dangers to all of this big data stuff. Not the least that we now live in what is a total surveillance society. I read recently that a woman’s Fitbit data was used against her in a court case. She was suing her employer for additional compensation for a workplace accident she was involved in because she had been highly active before an injury – but the insurance company was able to show, from her Fitbit data, that she hadn’t been nearly as active as she had said she had been. The new Apple Watch will constantly measure and record your heart beat. The iPhone already records everything you do, the number of steps you take, where you are at any given time. It is actually also easy to also link that to who is near you at that time. The next time your insurance premium goes up is it because they have guessed you fit within a certain demographic, or is it because they have access to more health information about you than your family doctor?Eventually someone is going to be asked, “So, what were you doing at 12.37pm on 23 March 2016?” “And what about at 3.17pm on 9 June 2016?” And there will be an entire other list of dates and times. The punch-line being that you won’t have a clue what you were doing on those dates and times, but the person asking the questions will. They will know you were having coffee in various cafes about town and they will also know that Jack (aka The Butcher) Badass was in those cafes at those same times – how do you explain that, you international terrorist in waiting?Sound far-fetched? Tell that to some of the poor bastards locked up and tortured in Guantanamo Bay for over a decade.As is repeatedly said in this book, the Stasi were bad, but they didn’t have half the information we gather on people now as a matter of course. I attended a lecture once on Bourdieu. Bourdieu was particularly interested in using data to understand how groups of people within society differentiated themselves from other groups of people. The person giving the lecture mentioned big data and how sociologists would give their eyeteeth to get their hands on some of it. Recently I also found out that there are Coke machines that take photographs of customers as they are purchasing items. The photograph can tell not only the time and date of purchase, but also the gender and race of the customer, not by someone in HQ having to look, but via an algorithm. Like I said, this data is a sociologist dream, but it is also mostly inaccessible – locked away as ‘commercial in confidence’. And in part, this is fair enough, there is an interesting discussion in this book on how data that might otherwise look like it has been de-identified can still be used to identify people. Again, this is based on unexpected correlations – you know, who’d have thought that there could be only one teacher in Milwaukie married to a Cuban-Chinese who likes Thai food and sings opera… If there was one thing I didn’t like about this book it was its habit of making annoying puns, for example, “When the floor is datafied, there is no ceiling to its possible uses”. Hmm. And there are quite a few of these. I will spare you the others.Years ago I read Predictably Irrational and thought after I’d finished, ‘God, advertisers must use these ideas all the time to get us to buy crap we don’t need’. This book shows how they actually do go about doing exactly that. I don’t for a minute believe there is any way we can go back to a small data world, and no technology is all good or all bad – but every technology changes the world, each has unintended consequences. We need to be aware of the fact, because some of the unintended consequences of big data are terrifying. We will be told there is nothing we can do about these consequences, that the benefits far outweigh the dangers – but the ironic consequence of this stuff is that it allows corporations to atomise us more than we have been already, it encourages us to think of ourselves as even more distinct and separate – as customers rather than citizens. There is a real price to be paid when we forsake our group rights – we will inevitably learn that price as time goes by and as big data becomes ever more invasive, ever more predictive and ever more manipulative."

5,0544002695,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,4,"Shocked by the NSA revelations? You don't know the whole storyWhile Edward Snowden bounces from one temporary refuge to another in search of safe harbor from the long arms of the U.S. government, the American public is starting to wake up to the reality of Big Data. The National Security Agency, long one of the pioneers in this burgeoning but little-appreciated field, has been teaching us -- or, rather, Snowden, The Guardian, and the Washington Post have been teaching us -- about the power that resides in gargantuan masses of data. Now here come Viktor Mayer-Schoeneberger and Kenneth Cukier with a new book that goes far beyond the headlines about espionage and invasion of privacy to give us an eminently readable, well-organized overview of Big Data's origins, its characteristics, and its potential for both good and evil.When we think of Big Data, we, or at least most of us, think of computers. However, the authors persuade us that the fundamentals of Big Data were laid down more than a century before the invention of the microprocessor. They point to a legendary American seaman named Matthew Maury. In the middle of the 19th Century, after 16 years of effort, Maury published a book based on 1.2 billion data points gleaned from old ships' logs stored by the Navy that dramatically reduced the distances (and, hence, the time elapsed) in ocean voyages by both military and commercial ships. Maury used facts derived from decades of mariners' observations to dispel the myths, legends, superstitions, and rumors that had long caused ocean-voyaging ships to pursue roundabout courses. Not so incidentally, Maury's work also facilitated the laying of the first transatlantic telegraph cable.If not the first, this was certainly an early application of Big Data, which the authors describe as follows: ""big data refers to things one can do at a large scale that cannot be done at a smaller one, to extract new insights or create new forms of value, in ways that change markets, organizations, the relationship between citizens and governments, and more."" For example, if Maury had had available only a fraction of the old ships' logs he found in the naval archives, his task would have been impractical, since each individual log doubtless included small errors (and an occasional big one). Only by amassing a huge store of data did those errors cancel out one another.Now, in the Digital Age, the volumes of data that can be harnessed are, at times, literally astronomical. ""Google processes more than 24 petabytes of data per day, a volume that is thousands of times the quantity of all printed material in the U.S. Library of Congress."" AT&T transfers about 30 petabytes of data through its networks each day. Twenty-four or 30 of something doesn't sound like much, unless you understand that a megabyte is a million bytes, a gigabyte is a billion bytes, a terabyte is 1,000 times the size of a gigabyte, and a petabyte is 1,000 times the size of a terabyte. That's 1,000,000,000,000,000 bytes. That's a lot of data! But even that's only a tiny slice of all the data now stored in the world, ""estimated to be around 1,200 exabytes."" And an exabyte (I'm sure you're dying to know) is the equivalent of 1,000 petabytes. So, 1,200 petabytes could also be stated as 1.2 zettabytes, with a zettabyte equal to 1,000 petabytes, and I'll bet that not one person in a million has ever heard of a zettabyte before. Had you?All of which should make clear that when we talk about Big Data today, we're talking about really, really big numbers -- so big, in fact, that almost no matter how messy or inaccurate the data might be, it's usually possible to draw useful, on-target insights from analyzing it. That's what's different about Big Data -- and that's why the phenomenon is bound to change the way we think about the world.We live in a society obsessed with causality. We often care more about why something happened than about what it was that happened. And in a world where Big Data looms larger and larger all the time, we'll have to get used to not knowing -- or even caring much -- why things happen.""At its core,"" write Mayer-Schoeneberger and Cukier, ""big data is about predictions. Though it is described as part of the branch of computer science called artificial intelligence, and more specifically, an area called machine learning, this characterization is misleading. Big data is not about trying to 'teach' a computer to 'think' like humans. Instead, it's about applying math to huge quantities of data in order to infer probabilities: the likelihood that an email message is spam; that the typed letters 'teh' are supposed to be 'the'; that the trajectory and velocity of a person jaywalking mean he'll make it across the street in time [so that] the self-driving car need only slow slightly.""The authors refer to data as ""the oil of the information economy,"" predicting that, as it flows into all the nooks and crannies of our society, it will bring about ""three major shifts of mindset that are interlinked and hence reinforce one another."" First among these is our ever-growing ability to analyze inconceivably large amounts of data and not have to settle for sampling. Second, we'll come to accept the inevitable messiness in huge stores of data and learn not to insist on precision in reporting. Third, and last, we'll get used to accepting correlations rather than causality. ""The ideal of identifying causal mechanisms is a self-congratulatory illusion; big data overturns this,"" the authors assert.If you want to understand this increasingly important aspect of contemporary life, I suggest you read Big Data.Viktor Mayer-Schoeneberger and Kenneth Cukier come to the task of writing this book with unbeatable credentials. Mayer-Schoeneberger is Professor of Internet Governance at Oxford University, and Kenneth Cukier is Data Editor at The Economist."
6,0544002695,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21516135-long-t-ng,1,Actually nothing is new in this book. Way too long and repetitive. The book should have been only 30 pages instead of 300.Sorry but it's a waste of time.
7,0544002695,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7607345-lars,2,"Having been on a big data/statistics binge recently, I can't help but be struck by the similarities in approach and execution between the major titles on the subject. Crack open any of these books and the authors are sure to regale you with the torrid tales of Billy Beane and his baseball Sabermetricians, Target's premature targeting of expectant mothers, and lest we forget - fawning references to the zany whizzes over at Google. Still, the subject is so intensely fascinating that it doesn't matter much. My fascination, in no small part, comes from my belief that the big data approaches made possible by machine learning and distributed processing are a key component of where we are headed as a society. Today, algorithms can be used to translate languages (albeit it imperfect) and predict everything from crime hotspots to default rates, using data that seems almost unrelated to the matter at hand. The ingenuity and mathematical sophistication of the people who create these algorithms is awe-inspiring. In covering them, ""Big Data"" does worse than most. It reads like a checklist of plane fodder tropes. Neologisms (""Algorithmists"") abound, as do catchphrases (""N = All"", ""Big Data mindset""). The book lacks the practitioner's viewpoint of The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail - But Some Don't. Unlike Automate This: How Algorithms Came to Rule Our World, it gently sidesteps the close but oh so uncomfortable issue of technological unemployment. Even more egregiously, it does this in favor of pages upon pages arguing against the distant straw man of Minority Report-style crime prediction. Throughout the book, one gets the sense that the authors and/or the editor had a vague desire of creating a manifesto for the new age of Big Data, but not the balls to go all out in the endeavour. Mashed together with the fluffy and excited tech journalism that takes up the majority of the book, the end result feels intellectually lazy and padded to the extreme.I would not recommend this book."

But according to the authors of this book, there is treasure to be mined in this trash. The premise is that previously inaccessible meta data sets can be put to beneficial uses in their imprecise form. Mapping flu outbreaks by triangulating google search for flu remedies for example.All fair and interesting but not exactly new ground. It could have been easily condensed into a magazine article, where I believe this book was initially conceived. A tad sharp practice to stretch it paper thin and sell it as a book, one which will age poorly I'm afraid."
9,0544002695,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8660033-aaron-thibeault,4,"*A full executive summary of this book is available here: http://newbooksinbrief.com/2013/03/21...The main argument: Statistical information, or data, has long been recognized to be a potentially rich and valuable source of knowledge. Until recently, however, our ability to render phenomena and events in a quantified format, store this information, and analyze it has been severely limited. With the rise of the digital age, though, these limitations are quickly being eroded. To begin with, digital devices that record our movements and communications, and digital sensors that record the behavior of inanimate objects and systems have become widespread and are proliferating wildly. What’s more, the cost of storing this information on computer servers is getting cheaper and cheaper, thus allowing us to keep much more of it than ever before. Finally, increasingly sophisticated computer algorithms are allowing us to analyze this information more deeply than ever, and are revealing interesting (and often counter-intuitive) relationships that would never have been possible previously. The increasing datification of the world, and the insights that this is bringing us, may be thought of as one grand phenomenon, and it has a name: Big Data.The insights that are emerging out of big data are spread out over many areas, and are already impacting several aspects of society. To begin with, big data is helping established businesses to run more efficiently and safely. For example, big data is being used to streamline assembly lines and also to catch quality control problems in the factory. But the benefits of big data go well beyond the factory. For example, the courier company UPS has used big data to help it map out more efficient trucking routes. The resulting improvements have allowed UPS to shave 30 million miles and 3 million gallons of fuel per year from their routes (loc. 1352). The more efficient trucking routes have also led to less traffic accidents. Meanwhile, car companies are beginning to use data from sensors in automobiles to understand which parts are causing problems, and also to understand where and why accidents are happening, so that they may be lessened.In addition to helping already established businesses, big data is also allowing for new business opportunities that were never possible before. For example, the business prodigy Oren Etzioni used big data to set up a business called Farecast that predicts the cost of airfare tickets. When his business was bought by Microsoft for $110 million, Etzioni used big data again to set up a related business that predicts the cost of all manner of consumer goods. His very profitable business, Decide.com, saves consumers on average $100 per product (loc. 1867).Outside of the business world, big data is also being used by governments to help reduce costs and make society safer. For example, in 2009 Google was able to apply big data to search terms to help identify how the H1N1 virus was spreading through communities in real time. This method of tracking disease pandemics holds great promise for allowing public health organizations to know when pandemics are beginning, and also to keep better track of how they are unfolding, in order that they may better contain them. In addition, big data is being used to help identify where potentially dangerous infrastructural problems are occurring, and also to identify trouble spots for fire hazards, in order that they may be addressed.Big data also has significant potential uses in health care. Indeed, our increasing ability to monitor and record everything from our vital signs to the health of our systems to our individual genomes promises to inaugurate an age of personalized medicine that will allow doctors to more easily diagnose our ailments and tailor treatments to our individual bodies.While big data may already be bringing us impressive benefits, Viktor Mayer-Schonberger and Kenneth Cukier argue that the bulk of the benefits are yet to come. Indeed, for the authors, businesses and governments are only just now waking up to the incredible potential of Big Data. And as they direct more attention to recording and analyzing data streams, the potential uses of the information will only multiply.On the negative side, big data also carries substantial potential dangers. Most notably, as more and more information about us is recorded, kept and used, our privacy is increasingly threatened. For the authors, a good deal of oversight will be needed in order to ensure that the potential abuses of big data are curbed.The book is well written and represents a fine overview of the present and future of big data. Also, the authors do well to raise important big-picture issues related to the phenomena, though the potential impacts of big data (both positive and negative) are occasionally overblown. All in all the book is a good introduction to an important and interesting topic. A full executive summary of the book is available here: http://newbooksinbrief.com/2013/03/21... A podcast discussion of the book will be available soon."

Primary reason, I read the book, is to find out examples that I would use in my presentations. And did I get those? In plenty. Without going even an inch into technicalities, this book talks about how 'Big Data' is fundamentally altering our lives - what we love, what we do, how we learn, etc etc. By gathering, processing and analysing information about us, our actions, our reactions, it enables us to improve techniques, that is tailored to our individual needs, making our lives better and simpler. This book extols the contribution of technologies using Big Data and paints an utopian picture of the future. We can improve our education, logistics, healthcare, et al, using those paradigm shifting concepts. As they say, 'Data is the new Oil.' The biggest companies in the world now doesn't have much physical assets, or raw materials or man power. They have data. Information is their assets. Using that they are changing the world. For better or worse. Yes, nothing in the world can have only positives. Concerns about privacy and illegitimate usage of big data are not unfounded. But, hopefully, the positives outweigh all those negatives. A very good primer. "

In the past predictive science looked for causes to explain phenomenon and their is a famous saying among early statisticians ""correlation is not causation"". In the era of big data companies like google and amazon no longer care about causation when making predictions about their users and customers but correlation of huge chunks of information received from users makes bankable predictions simply by statistical correlation no need to find causation for these player. Governments and Private firms comb through the information exhaust trails we leave on our web searches and cell phone use and blogs and any other activity we do on a network to find out things about us and to a remarkable degree predict our future behavior. Whether it be shopping interests of individuals or locating places where crimes a likely to occur in cities for policing (shades of minority report) and crime prevention. Big data will transform the way companies sell to us and governments spy on us. The first part of the book lays out the powers of big data in a deadpan style and while one reads someone like myself can't help thinking about Orwellian implications of such a lack of privacy and powers of prediction and surveillance available to some. The author addresses this issue in the last two chapters of the book. The penultimate chapter lays out the nightmare scenarios which probably registered with readers long before the author spells them out. The last chapter tries to tackle responses to safeguard our privacy and liberty in the last chapter which is inchoate and rather paltry to the size of the problem but the book does draw a picture of challenge that we will have to come to terms with if we wish to stay free.Update 2/7/2019The book which hinted at dystopian possibilities in 2013 has seen many of them fulfilled. Such is Late Capitalism and it will get worse under the likes of Trump."
12,0544002695,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4177031-troy-blackford,5,"This is a fascinating exploration of the topic of what happens when the sample size of a given field of study reaches the point where n=all. That is to say, what happens when we have data for all of a given variable, rather than just taking a sampling and extrapolating out findings. The authors compare the difference to what happened to visual representation when you could make a number of photographs in one second - it wasn't just a quality-based leap like that of the jump from realistic artwork to photography, but a leap into another realm - the ability to capture and display motion pictures.The same type of leap is happening with data - the preponderance of information is allowing our understanding if that data to become something else, something more than the sum of its parts. This book explores everything from Google tracking flu outbreaks via search terms to New York City officials determining which buildings have been illegally modified into being major fire risks - all using data collected for other means. Along the way you will be introduced to pioneers in the use of data, going all the way back to a 19th century naval desk clerk who used forgotten weather records to deduce the best trade routes, to modern experts who did everything from make the best possible spell checker algorithms out of peoples' mistakes to blowing the lid off the best machine translators of the day using piles and piles of scanned books.This was an awesome read and I recommend it to anyone interested in the topic of data and how it is used to enhance and define our modern lives."

That is how this book starts and this is the story it tells. Our every action of regular life creates a sort of data, which ultimately can be used to regulate, observe, predict and prepare a lot of things. From out air journeys to the bank transactions to the online searches, everything can be collected in the form of data, and can be used.The crux of this book is an important learning and the authors have put in a lot of research work to enlighten the readers. The book is informative as well as thought provoking, it may even give you an idea or two to start a new venture of your own. Though the book is quite redundant and almost every second page has the same message: Big data will change the world. It gets annoying some times when even words and sentences are bearing the same essence. The authors could have kept the length of book to 150 pages, making it an interesting and not a redundant read.A must read for those who handle data on regular basis, others may skip it after reading first two and last three chapters. They are most informative and important, though you will still find many redundancy in these chapters too, just like the word redundant getting redundant in this review. But I am doing this just to give you an idea how annoying this redundancy can be!"
14,0544002695,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,3,"Big Data takes on big ideas: how will the availability of huge data sets change the way we do research? Does it matter why something happens as much as what precisely is happening? Will correlation analysis of large data sets take the place of the painstaking theory-to-hypothesis-to-empirical-testing of traditional science?The author perhaps over promises the impact of Big Data and underestimates the associated privacy issues. Yet, there is much that is interesting and important in this book. When N=All, a new set of issues arises and this book explores them substantively.Big Data argues against many of Nate Silver's claims in The Signal and the Noise. Theory matters a good deal. Big Data points authoritatively and says Look Here. But it can't tell us what ""it"" means or why it matters.I'm not sold on all the claims made by this book. The section on accountability seems weak and misguided. But I'm glad I read it and would recommend it to anyone who is curious about the impact of Big Data on scientific methods.

17,0544002695,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14872654-liz,3,"Well-researched and well-written, this guidebook to the (dystopian?) future is intriguing, mind-bending, and alarming, all at the same time.The authors explain that our economy and society are undergoing a massive upheaval, akin to the industrial revolution. “Representative sampling” used to be the norm, and researchers tightly controlled variables to isolate why something was occurring. Thanks to the massive increase in computer processing power, very inexpensive storage, and diverse types of data already in digital form (internet search terms, GPS coordinates, Facebook’s “social graph” of relationships, among others), the focus has now shifted to “bottom-up” analysis: i.e. looking at datasets (N= all) to detect patterns and insights, and see what is happening.I kept coming back to 3 major concerns. First, we human beings are born asking “why?” If we substitute correlation (both A and B are occurring) for causation (A causes B), we end up with shortcut assumptions and abuses of existing data. (This is already happening, when employers use credit scores to evaluate job candidates, or health insurers review an applicant’s retail purchase history to determine underwriting risk.)Second, our privacy is becoming not only diminished, but compromised in ways we can’t even foresee. Because data never wears out, it can be reused and re-examined in multiple ways (not to mention being repackaged and resold). As the authors say, “the three core strategies long used to ensure privacy – individual notice and consent, opting out, and anonymization – have lost much of their effectiveness.” On this last point, they cite an incident when AOL publicly released a dataset of 20 million search queries from 657,000 different users conducted between 3/1/06 and 5/31/06. Within days, reporters from the New York Times re-assembled searches to successfully id a particular user (a 62-year-old widow from Lilburn, Georgia). Even mobile devices, which don’t use “cookies,” leave personal digital footprints. Tech companies (such as Drawbridge and Flurry) have sprung up expressly to track individuals, and can determine which devices (cellphone, work computer, home computer, tablet, laptop) belong to the same user.  The third concern (and here’s where the dystopia really kicks in): authors Mayer-Schonberger and Cukier herald “the demise of the expert.” They say: “many aspects of our world will be augmented or replaced by computer systems that today are the sole purview of human judgment.” In Chapter 4, they introduce Dr. Carolyn McGregor, a Ph.D. computer scientist in Ontario, Canada who is creating software that analyzes vital sign monitor data to help doctors “make better diagnostic decisions when caring for premature babies.” By Chapter 7, the authors are putting Dr. McGregor on equal footing with those experienced medical specialists: “[In a “small-data”] world, experience plays a critical role, since it is the long accumulation of latent knowledge – knowledge that one can’t transmit easily or learn from a book, or perhaps even be consciously aware of – that enables one to make smarter decisions. But when you are stuffed silly with data, you can tap that instead, and to greater effect.” Welcome to the “Moneyball” era of medicine.As with any new methodology, the consequences of Big Data can be positive or negative, but are often unintended. In 2008, Barrack Obama’s campaign manager used Big Data (from website visits) to mobilize grass-roots supporters and get his candidate elected. Two years later, republican-controlled state legislatures used Big Data (from the 2010 census) to redraw U.S. Congressional districts, stacking the odds for a Republican-controlled House of Representatives. In 2013, we end up with complete gridlock and a government shutdown.Big Data = big opportunties, but big problems too. Use with caution."
18,0544002695,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16077597-matt,4,"Before I had read this book, I had only a vague idea of what Big Data exactly means, even though I myself work in the IT-industry.Of course I knew that data leeches like Google, Facebook, Twitter & Co collect everything imaginable and store forever, what we disclose of us in our virtual existence, that Amazon and other online stores analyzes our behavior as consumers and develops more or less reasonable suggestions to encourage us to buy even more stuff, and that intelligence agencies in the world, led by the NSA, illegally collects myriads of private data. But I was not aware of the full extent of the existing possibilities and the numerous applications of the Big Data technology as of today (that is August 2012, when this book was written).I think the authors of this book provide a good overview of almost all aspects of the Big Data business. This is achieved without the enumeration of technical details, so that computer layman can read this book, and should(!), because Big Data affects us all and in no small way. The subtitle ""A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work and Think"" is not exaggerated.When considering the opportunities and risks of Big Data, the authors show a remarkably neutral stance. No description of a topic in this book sounds too optimistic or too pessimistic, and the reader is not foisted an opinion. Often times revealing examples of the real world illustrate the facts. What I also find worth mentioning are the historical outlines of mankind's endeavors in data gathering and storing. That would be a nice topic for another book.Only the measures to prevent misuse or abuse of the new technology in the chapter Control are shown too idealistic in my eyes. That might work in an ideal democracy, but I think when we have arrived at this point, ""democracy"" is only a word used in history books. I was also missing an idea of how, in the future, the falsification of data can be prevented or at least detected.After reading this book I now have a bleaker view of our ""bright"" future than I had before, but this, of course, is not a problem of the book or the authors. On the bright side I see quite a few potential dystopian novels with great stories dealing with Big Data and its consequences.

19,0544002695,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39342683-pradeep-nair,4,"The book tells you a lot about Big Data, the ubiquitous term nowadays. There is so much of data being generated in the form of text, photos, and videos. Add to that the tons of personal data relating to whenever we do on our phone, like our location, what and how we are reading, listening, surfing the net, using different apps, etc. Every minute detail of the way we use different apps are relayed back to the developers to get an understanding of the efficiency of the product. Everyone, not just Google, Amazon and the government are gathering data and analysing them, but everyone, including Goodreads. Big Data is replacing the old cause-and-effect theory of 'if something is done in a particular way, it will have a particular effect"", with correlation theory of ""if most people are doing a particular thing in a particular way, then most others, if not everyone, are also likely to do that in the same way.""In the earlier era of small data, there was lot of importance to accuracy, but today, in the era of big data, there are more chances of inaccuracies, but that is compensated or nullified by the huge wealth of information that Big Data analyses provide.The authors also rightly talk about the tyranny of data. Everything doesn't work according to numbers. There are many non-quantifiable and intangible, qualitative and contextual variables that affect analyses. A good book, written in an easily understandable manner, especially for anyone who wants to know what Big Data is all about and how it's changing our lives.On the flip side, the authors, in their attempt to explain different aspects of Big Data, tend to get too repetitive."

So far, I'm enjoying it.-------Finished it. I originally gave it four stars but now just three. I feel that the author would have been better served by a stronger editor. There is quite a bit of repetition in the book. For only 200+ pages, it could have been slimmed down by 10%. Of course, which 10% you might ask? Well, if he had run a N-gram search on his own text he would have found a lot of repetition. (http://guidetodatamining.com/ngramAna...)For example, I know that I used 'a lot of' twice (now three times).Personally, I found the stories of how big-data being used in the 'real world' a lot more interesting than the 'what-if' discussions that come at the end of the text. Unfortunately, the author doesn't provide a lot of guidance in terms of courses of study for big-data but Mr. Google is there for that, right? A good third of the book is bibliography so there's plenty more to follow up on for those who are curious to know more about big-data. "

Unlike other 'topical' books, it does give some debate on the downsides of the focus topic and predictions on how these may be overcome in the future.In particular, I liked the examples used, plain language and thoughts on where the field is going.Unfortunately, being somewhat of a nerd, I chased up several websites and companies referenced in the text to learn more and (perhaps being the nature of the beast) despite only being published in 2013, many companies have moved on. Some have closed down or been purchased by larger companies (very much like the situation predicted by the authors more generally). The technology industry moves rapidly so while I would have loved to delve more into the examples provided, I've had to take them more as a guide than case study material I could have researched.3.5 stars from me (rounded to 4)."

I think he minimizes causation and over states correlations. I don' understand a scientific method without hypotheses, ideas coming from the data like ooze and how data has improved decision making in N=All situations. Baseball using N=all hasn't done well and that's a small N. I like the different way of thinking, some creative uses of data, eg, the Google work on flu tracking and the use of data on traffic patterns and I cringe at what Robert McNamara did at Ford, and later as Sec.

I'd heard the term ""Big Data"", and knew approximately what it meant. This book was a surprize. It explained in lay terms what Big Data is, how it can be used, the implications for businesses and governments, and how it is different from the data bases that we have used for decades. It uses explicit and clear examples. It is a great read for anyone who wants to know what the Big Data fuss is about.It only gets three stars because it can be repetitious.

27,0544002695,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1362376-avolyn-fisher,4,"Really, quite a spectacular read on the world of big data. I think the biggest reason that this book gets 4 not 5 stars is simply due to the passage of time and that some of this information has already found itself outdated. But in its day it would have been cutting edge, no doubt. I was tickled to see the book mention 'differential privacy' although briefly, but a topic that was literally in its infancy (and still quite young today) when this book was published.I think this book does a nice job of covering different areas of data, for someone new or wanting to gain an understanding of data but doesn't work in data, such as a data consumer or an executive at a company who has the expectation of some data literacy and awareness. There were certain sections of the book that I found especially interesting that discussed privacy and the ramifications of the abuse of data that could have been much longer, but then again these topics are worthy of entire books of their own. I also really enjoyed the plug Mayer-Schonberger makes for having internal algorithmists who advocate for the rights, protection, and privacy for those impacted by a company's data and I agree with the need for these external and internal audit checks and balances.Mayer-Schonberger briefly touches on the nature of many data algorithms and data solutions being 'black boxes' in that they are hard to interpret for someone who is not highly skilled and that this is a drawback as one intends to describe why an action should be taken, it becomes even more difficult when you can't explain within a corporation, why decision makers should heed certain data points. But I think the risks go even further than just 'difficult to sell to upper management' in that we don't even know how to tweak them when our models prove to be ineffective or bias towards a certain protected class. And often these algorithms and data solutions are purposely kept as black boxes, not just black boxes in nature, but by design because their intelligent design is considered both proprietary but also something that should be kept secret so that those involved in the data are not able to game the system and figure out how they're being measured to benefit themselves (i.e. the teacher scoring systems through standardized testing, as well as the algorithms used to determine prison sentence).Since the publish of this book we have already seen developments that emphasize the concerns outlined including the 'social scoring system' being used in China which already prevented millions from traveling last year alone. This scoring system doesn't quite 'punish people for behavior they haven't yet done' as Mayer-Schonberger feared in his book, but rather they take actions but decide to score them such as buying diapers, playing video games for too long in a single day, or owing debts. It's a credit score on steroids. But already one can be alarmed by this because again, who decides what behaviors are good or bad? Who decides HOW many points or what value a certain behavior should carry, even if we all agree it is good or bad, how do we agree on an appropriate credit or debit to one's social score? And what if these scores expand to monitor government and leader loyalty? This system is largely tied to a person's face as that is the easiest way to ID people in a large public setting, and we are already seeing people get plastic surgery to change their 'identity' and avoid a poor social score that they've been given.We have also seen the adoption of GDPR and regulations in the US such as CA that are already going to challenge how long a company can utilize data, and the consumer's 'right to be forgotten' while this might come as very good news for some of the concerns that Mayer-Schonberger outlines, it does also raise questions against his argument that data above technology and skilled workers, carries the most value. If heavy regulation does indeed persist and win out, will the data still be as valuable as he predicts?Time will tell. But for anyone curious, I do recommend reading this book to understand a little more on what the future might have in store for us when data becomes the new competitive edge, and how companies can prepare for these changes, what that will mean for the rest of us, and the cautions around data-driven culture."
28,0544002695,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41396647-peter-corrigan,3,"This was a useful and quick summary (written 2013) of the Big Data challenge and conundrum. It cites some fairly benign example of where Big Data has helped society (tracking flu outbreaks, finding cheaper air fares, identifying dangerous housing units, spotting medical issues, etc.). There is a chapter or so on the possible misuses and dangers but they are more or less dismissed--'just hire some ombudsmans' like the WaPO (supposedly) has and all will be well; or hire some 'algorithmists' to explain it all to the peons. On page 183 they actually say 'we must prevent the rise of 21st century data barons' like they have never heard of Google and Facebook. The abuses of both companies are barely mentioned. These massive entities are all in on thought control and social engineering on a scale that cannot be understated. They routinely censor any thought that does not comport with their worldview and fire employees who question that. That they store data to use against their 'opponents' is more than highly likely. Speech is data too and their main goal is to control and shape it according to their beliefs in order to create a world they desire. This trend will only get worse but is nowhere mentioned that I saw. The book also ignores the pioneering efforts of the Chinese government to control thought and behavior which is one of the more disturbing trends of recent years, perhaps in 2013 (or 2011-12) less developed than now.

29,0544002695,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8884649-bev,4,"A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work, and ThinkWritten in 2013/4, this was the first major book about the topic, with two authors explaining what big data is, how it will change our lives, and what we can do to protect ourselves from its hazards. As is usual with predictions, some are eerie in their accuracy, others we laugh at for the ""obvious"" errors, but all were brave, and most were fascinating.The book posed questions about choices consumers make -relating to colours and preferences that didn't appeal to me that much. Also the fears and concerns around the 'Minority Report' methods of using data (i.e. predicting crimes that haven't yet occurred and making arrests based on that data) seem a bit silly and far-fetched now.Read my full review here."
30,0544002695,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,4,"The first time I came across the idea of quantity transforming into quality was when I read Friedrich Engels' 'Dialectics of Nature' a long while ago. This book on 'Big Data' elaborates on that principle by showing how 'gems of insight' emerge when you let computers crunch vast stores of information using its algorithmic power. By processing large volumes of data, we are now able to save money on airline tickets, predict flu outbreaks, enable health insurance firms to provide coverage without a physical exam or to know which manhole or overcrowded building in a resource-constrained New York City to inspect for fire hazards. This is a lively and entertaining book, taking us on a fascinating journey into the myriad possibilities - or should we say probabilities - of the future using this technology.The authors describe the technology of 'Big Data' simply as follows: 'It is about predictions and it is about applying math to huge quantities of data in order to infer probabilities'. The technology helps to unravel new patterns and relationships between entities by analyzing vast quantities of data - patterns which have hitherto been opaque to us in smaller volumes. The book describes in detail a number of very cool projects where Big Data has played a significant role in Walmart, Target and the Health Insurance industries. My own favorites are a couple of applications in the tech industry itself. Microsoft was using four common algorithms for grammar check in their MS-Word program. Keeping the algorithms unchanged, they just fed in three orders of magnitude more data, from 10 million to a billion words. As they reached a billion words, the simplest algorithm which was the worst performer before, ended up the best with 95% accuracy whereas the best performer before went up only to 94%. Google used this approach at an even more massive level. In their translation project, they picked a trillion words, consisting of 95 billion English sentences, albeit of dubious quality, from their Books project as well as from the internet itself and used it as their reference base for translation from one language to another. Despite the messy input, Google's service works best among all the available translation services.There are many more real-life instances of the technology in the book to keep the reader absorbed. The authors sum up the rise of Big Data as representing three shifts in the way we would analyze information in future and consequently organize society. The first shift is that we will simply process vast volumes of data instead of just looking at a representative sample and putting more store in devising smart algorithms to arrive at insights from such samples. The second shift is that we will loosen our focus on exactness and precision in data and live with more inaccuracies because the huge volume allows us to do so without any detriment to deriving insights. Finally, the third shift would be to free us from our search for causality in phenomenon and replace it with correlation. In other words, we won't be always looking for 'WHY' and instead be satisfied with 'WHAT' in phenomena, wherever it is appropriate.However, not everything is hunky-dory with this technology. The authors, though upbeat on the promise of Big Data, are quite clear about the 'dark side' of Big Data as well. We have all experienced it in 2013, in the exposes of Edward Snowden on how the NSA gathers information on the ordinary citizen as well as someone like Angela Merkel. An even more worrying scenario is the propensity in future, based on Big Data analysis, to condemn someone for having a high probability of committing a crime or offence even before the offence is committed. One may think it is straight out of Steven Spielberg's film 'Minority Report', but unfortunately it is happening already. In June 2013, Richard Engel and Robert Windrem reported as follows after studying CIA classified documents on drone strikes in Pakistan in 2010-11: ""...the C.I.A. doesn’t necessarily know who it is killing. In signature strikes, intelligence officers and drone operators kill suspects based on their patterns of behavior — but without positive identification.... 50% of all the drone strikes are such 'signature strikes'. "". This probably explains the recent drone killings in Yemen of a local group of residents heading for a wedding, killing 12 and injuring 14. Similar examples are found in some US states where parole boards deny parole to prisoners based on such predictive analysis of future behavior.The other related danger is to rely on vast quantities of data on a phenomenon which do not represent the phenomena properly but use it anyway to make crucial decisions. The authors give an example of how Sen.Robert McNamara, Secy of Defence in the Johnson administration, went about escalating the Vietnam war by relying on 'death count' as an indication of how the war was progressing. The data simply did not represent the will and determination of the Vietnamese communists to rid themselves of foreign occupation of their land.In the final chapters, the authors give some pointers as to how we can make changes to our laws in future in order to protect ourselves from the 'dictatorship of data' and still enjoy its fruits.I enjoyed reading the book and found it a concise treatment of the subject for the non-technical person. It is devoid of all the hype surrounding Big Data. Strongly recommended!"

Oren Etzioni at the University of Washington is on an airplane. He decides to ask other passengers how much they paid for the seats. And it turns out that one person paid one fare, and another person paid another fare. Of course, this made Oren really upset. And the reason why is that he took his time to book the air ticket long in advance, assuming he was going to pay the lowest price. And he started thinking – if only I knew what stays behind airfares. How would I know if a presented price at an online travel site is a good one or a bad one? And then he came up with the insight. Because he was a computer scientist, he realised this is just an information problem. Next, his decided to collect the flight price record of every single flight in commercial aviation in the United States for every single route and to identify how long in advance the ticket was bought for the departure, and what price was paid. Based on that, he created a system for which a major goal was making predictions on whether the price is likely to rise or fall. And eventually, it worked pretty well. Then decided to get more data. So he did and got more data until he had 20 billion flight-price records that fuelled his predictions. The system saved a lot of customer’s money, and then Microsoft came and bought his system for $100 million.This data of the airfares have become the raw material for a new business, and a new source of value, and a new form of economic activity. And right now many companies, Google, Amazon, Apple, eBay, IBM etc. are running a new economy with this data. It is a fuel of the information economy.Now a few things about more data. We’re going from an environment where we have always been information-starved. We have never had enough. And right now we live in the world where that is no longer the operative constraint. Although we never have all the information, the book gives a few great examples of why more data is better than clean data. Another striking example regarding the conflict between the quality and quantity of data related to Amazon. So when...

39,0544002695,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15860153-mike,3,"Good, if repetitive, introduction to big data. Humans have always searched for the causes behind events or phenomena, and have developed sampling and math techniques to determine cause. Big data upends all this, because computing power and storage are fast an cheap enough to enable us to use all of the dataset, not small samples (n=all). This uncovers correlations, not causes, but in more and more cases we will have to be satisfied with knowing ""what"", but not ""why"". Everything in the world is becoming datafied, and insights far beyond the original use of the data can be discovered by asking different questions or by combining databases. At the stock level, data is essentially valueless, even though a company's data may be the most valuable thing it has (Facebook). The ubiquity of big data has profound risks, the most obvious of which is privacy. Data collectors like Equifax, Experian and Acxiom know much more about us then our credit scores, to say nothing of the mobile phone co's, google, etc. The authors suggest that companies who use the data be held to more stringent standards. Other risks include profiling, even punishing individuals based in their propensities, which stands in stark contrast to our notion of free will. There is also the risk of relying only on the data - but the numbers are not god. Favorite anecdotes were about Navy officer Matthew Maury, who in the mid 1800s took crates full of old logbooks of Atlantic Ocean voyages and turned them into data, which revealed wind and wave patterns and led to more efficient routes. He created a standard form for logging ships' data, he devised a system of shipping lanes that is still used today, and his work was essential for the first transatlantic telegraph cable. All this from information regarded as rubbish!Also - Greg Linden, the Amazon.com engineer who developed the recommendation engine which crushed the sales driven by the editorial team. In this case, data > expertise. The credit card companies are truly at ground zero - I should like to have access to their data scientists for a few days to see what they know!"
40,0544002695,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63587845-pjbhaumik,5,"Kenneth Cukier and Viktor Mayer-Schonberger’s Big Data described the impact of new data analysis and management techniques for businesses and consumers. Cukier and Schonberger researched relationships among datasets, the value of data, and its social consequences. Popular perceptions and misconceptions of big data required Cukier and Schonberger’s investigation. Causality based on big data became one of the most debatable characteristics. Predictive outcomes of big data analyses lead to statistical discussions and clarifications respecting the causation vs correlation. Big data created two primary business markets: data analytics and data acquisition. Raw data’s value appreciated as a function of market segment activity, for example the housing market or consumer electronics market represented pertinent markets of interest. Companies applied statistics for customer and resource identification, so progressions of business met consumer demand based on aggregated data results. Preferences for features and user behavior emerged from innovative data collection techniques, and Cukier and Schonberger described several applications of these techniques in their book. A major consequence of these big data technologies came from privacy violations. Users, whose data divulged their identity without their knowledge, necessitated legal boundaries on public data transactions. New perceptions and standards for statistics, data, and their employment thus began development.Statistical models for big data reveal new trends based on Cukier and Schonberger’s book. Advanced modelling techniques and larger sample sets of data improve predictive accuracy. Expected behavior from data driven analyses applies to every decision making role. Cukier and Schonberger discuss the effects of a large datasets and required statistical complexity, and their conclusion exposes the attractive level of simplicity for a model with copious data. Less data requires more complex mathematics. A cost optimum for a given dataset exists for the determination of an affordable computational investment. Larger datasets offer an alternate to increased computational sophistication. Google and Amazon serve as Cukier and Schonberger’s examples for the success of big data models. Predictions based on these models do not imply causation although these businesses have earned billions of dollars for revenues from data driven products. Correlation becomes the correct term for the fidelity in big data models’ predictions because the association of one event and the occurrence of another event happens independent of cause. The absence of causal determination underlies the mathematical distinction between causation and correlation for events with apparent correspondence. Successful quants optimize big datasets and computational resources for discoveries of lucrative correlations amongst chosen events. The value of data changes as more lucrative information becomes attainable from data analyses. Cukier and Schonberger discuss the data business. Two primary markets appear from the emergence of big data: the data itself and data analysis. Data acts as a natural resource, so companies benefit from accumulation and storage of data. Companies are capable for either a profit from data sales or internal application of the data. Internal improvements based on proprietary data have freed Amazon from the manual recommendation process for a consumer’s next purchase, and the yields established big data’s role in the business. Book reviewers at Amazon have lost jobs since the advent of increased sales because of data driven recommendations. Case studies like Amazon’s computerized product recommendation algorithm pepper the content of Cukier and Schonberger’s work. External sales of data appear profitable based on case studies presented for businesses that sell data as their only product. Big data analysis and interpretation constitute the other benefactors of the big data industry: Google and IBM. One of the examples, Google’s pandemic H1N1 model, illustrates the usage of big data not only for sales but also for humanity’s sake. Start-ups in big data innovate storage or analytical methods.Society pays a price for improvements to big data models: privacy. Cukier and Schonberger discuss several case studies respecting privacy issues. The legal implications become influential for the future direction of big data. Development of data algorithms for search engines and internet point of sales has enabled accurate traceability of consumers, and the sales of this personal information or outright divulgence jeopardizes privacy. Sensitive information, such as purchase history or frequent searches, helps businesses better suit their customers, yet the same information if sold to another entity, then causes concern. Individuals search for personal items online and the use of this information for product placement begins a sort of Hawthorne effect. Observation changes the behavior of the observed, and Cukier and Schonberger document public disclosure incidences from anonymous internet activity for debatable abuse of power. Legal restrictions to the required circumstances for appropriate public disclosure of identities creates bounds, yet public disclosure encapsulates just that one segment of privacy breaches. Disclosure of personal identities for profits amongst businesses violates privacy in a similar fashion. A consequent development of access privileges for big data accumulators as well as analysts faces opposition and support from Cukier and Schonberger’s judicious yet technocratic perspective.Cukier and Schonberger’s work shall establish the crossroads of data and society. The snapshot of big data models will encapsulate the period of big data’s emergence and superiority. Other computational advancements such as quantum computing or nano-fabrication methods would help the application of increasingly sophisticated data accumulation and analyses. Big data models may increase in efficiency with faster hardware such as quantum computers. Implementation of nano-scale hardware should allow manageable footprints even for computers with many components. Raw data accumulation techniques may become more pervasive for increased leverage of the “Law of Large Numbers”. Every input into a computerized mechanism could serve as data. Applications of data may await the creativity of data scientists. Connections amongst data can appear elusive per Cukier and Schonberger’s case studies. A company might collect data for one purpose and later discover novel applications for other business purposes, and this mindset would encourage the accumulation of as much data as possible. Data can contain important personal information, so the bounds respecting data exchange may face strict legal scrutiny. Cases from Cukier and Schonberger’s book should demonstrate the susceptibility of shy consumers to data’s traceable nature. Society and science shall evolve the data driven future together."

The fact that I should think that, given that the book's title is Big Data, speaks for itself. It's a tedious read if you have ever attended classes in statistics or worked with data. It's still a tedious read if you haven't done either, because the author uses lots of flowery languages and allegories to bulk up paragraphs. Now that I have completed reading (or flipping) through the book I look up the bios of the two authors. ""Viktor Mayer-Schönberger (born 1966) is Professor of Internet Governance and Regulation at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford. He conducts research into the network economy.""So my suspicion is correct, this guy does not need to work with data.""Kenneth Cukier is the data editor, following a decade at the paper covering business and technology, and as a foreign correspondent (most recently in Japan from 2007-12). Previously he was the technology editor of the Wall Street Journal Asia in Hong Kong and worked at the International Herald Tribune in Paris. In 2002-04 he was a research fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.""And this one doesn't either, he would just write about them and I don't think his job involves reading in a dataset in, say, SPSS, R, Stata...These two guys have written a follow up to this title. My plan and my recommendation to anyone is to avoid it."

Data value can explain some of the difference in company valuations as for their physical assets and IPOs. They gave a compelling case with Facebook. — So indeed, data has value and should be priced accordingly.- The value of the data is indeed difficult to predict. And the same data may be untapped now, but used some years later. For that reason, they propose a possible model in which data holders license the use of the data and receive a % of the generated revenue in whatever activities is was used for.- Big-data-based decisions will increasingly ake bigger roles in companies and even individual matters.- Human expertise may become increasingly unimportant in many decisions. Just take the data and let it decide.- As they claim, data analytics can indeed be very accurate to model and predict the future based on past actions, but rather difficult to predict new innovations. Here, we would need human chaotic and imaginative insights.- The more data, sometimes, the less accurate we have to be. Discovering main trends may be enough.- A reminder for me, simple machine learning models and noisy data can trump over complex models and clean data when there is lots of data.- With data analysis in most cases (black box) we have correlations only, that is, we know the what but not the why (causality). And that may be good enough for most cases."

The signal-to-noise ratio for useful information vs. repetitive data and buzzwords is abysmal. Unfortunately I am a human and not a computer so feeding text to me like data fails to keep my interest. It is as if the author is attempting to sell to me that Big Data is the best thing for humanity since the invention of the wheel.I am a computer scientist by profession and Big Data is a topic that has both fascinated me and terrified me for years. It has become a useful tool that has both saved lives and has helped greedy people get more of my money to find its way into their pocket. Usually for some slight convenience, we happily exchange our soul, I mean our privacy. This data is then used to discover things about us that we ourselves might not know. Big Data is here to stay and privacy is earning its place in the museum next to the Dodo. We are learning more about society and our world than we had ever could have guessed before.There that about sums up Big Data, no real reason to read this book unless you are the sort of person who finds infomercials exciting."
46,0544002695,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8064693-erik-jan,4,"The authors have written an highly interesting book which is a good introduction to a topic I didn't know much about. For sure the book gives an accurate and complete introduction to the topic of big data. The book discusses not only the data but also the people handling the data and enterpreneurs building new business models. The book is filled with a lot of convincing examples of the use of big data within commercial, political and societal environments. I really liked the part in which they talked about the shift from causation to correlation. There are two things I didn't like about the book. First of all, the level of detail is quite high which makes the book pretty tough to read at some times. The second issue I didn't like that much is the chapter about the legal and privacy consequences of living in a world with huge amounts of data. The authors are right when they say that listing all the purposes of the data some company gathers cannot be done entirely because some of the uses of that data is not known yet. However, telling the specific company that they have a big responsibility when they use the data (don't be evil) may not be enough. "
47,0544002695,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58564-joshua,2,"This breathless look at Big Data was a fine survey of the concepts behind the buzzword of the day. But it failed to question the successes that it cites as evidence of the sheer amazingness of Big Data. (To be sure, these is plenty to be amazed with). The book awkwardly starts off with Google Flu Trends, an impressive example of how the company could predict where the flu was spreading based on what people were searching for on the Internet. I assume that the major failure of the system to accurately model this year's flu happened after this book went to print. Other successes, such as Zynga's ingenuity to use big data to design the world's most addictive video games, or Steve Jobs' use of genomic sequencing to fight off cancer, are even more dubious. Aside from these practical problems with the fetish of Big Data (which many people who write about it have discussed at length) the book makes only a token attempt to discuss ethical and economic problems surrounding the trend. Basically, this book was way too superficial. There's better stuff being written about the topic. "
48,0544002695,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22512224-aashish,3,"This is a book of contrasts. The first part of the book establishes the key principles behind big data and its use: not looking at sampling but using data in its entirety, focusing on correlation and not causation and that discarding sampling bias in statistical studies is critical going forward. While one can debate the merit of each individual assertion, this part of the book is well articulated. The author uses a mix of theory and practical situations to explain the points.The second part reads like a large collection of examples of how big data is changing the world. It is full of anecdotes and empirical observations, most of which are and were in the public domain already - the author puts them all together in one place to further elaborate on the basic premise of using big data.This is a good book to read if one is beginning to appreciate the subject matter. But this is not an ideal book to end one's quest of knowledge about this topic."

But if you are really interested in big data, you should put some effort and read it anyway. I wouldn't recommend it to people that are not that interested in the subject.I personally found the first chapter very exciting and enlightening. It explains clearly the difference between big data (n=all) and some data, and arguments with examples (for example: google flu trends) the innovative uses of big data. This chapter states clearly why it is that big data is a new technology revolution heading towards us as individuals and impacting massively on our lives."

You come away with a sense of how Big Data is changing business and society and of some of the issues. It is anecdotal in style; while easily read, it doesn't put things in perspective. How much economic impact is Big Data really having? I was disappointed that there was very little discussion of the methods of data analytics (excusable in a non-technical book), and no recommendations ""for further reading"".
