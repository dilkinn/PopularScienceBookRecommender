0,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,4,"A book that catalogues the movement and migration of human populations and the current work being done in sequencing and analyzing ancient DNA. Someone recommended this to me and I really enjoyed it. I think it was accessible but also rigorous. It mostly was an overview of the research literature in the domain which I really liked. I kind of felt ambivalent about the author's qualifications on genetic research and race however, even though I think he did a fair job explaining his position and his position is a reasonable one. I think most of it just has to do with my own skepticism about cognitive/behavioral ties being made to biology. Even though Reich himself acknowledges that they way genes work to influence cognition and behavior may be indirect or counterintuitive to us. I also think it was weird of him to talk about the genetic link to educational attainment being an explanation rooted in waiting to have kids but then not explaining how the genes that influence both go about causing people to delay having kids. Just because the genes that predict educational attainment more strongly predict people delaying having children doesn't mean the genes are influencing either directly. It mostly felt weird because later on he talks about the need to follow populations overtime because the increase in genetic variations associated with educational attainment being lower in populations over time as those people have less children because of the previously mentioned link. I think it's understandable for someone who comes out explicitly to say they're of the community that follows in the traditions of the Enlightenment (or something to that effect) to be concerned about educational attainment but it seems to me to be a narrow view of what is worthwhile and desirable in human beings to have these concerns with intelligence/education always brought up. Really good book overall though, would definitely recommend to others interested in the history of human evolution and migration."

Concentrates on the science, lucidly written, although probably best not read when one is too fatigued or sleepy. Its explanations seem as simple as possible but no simpler, which I appreciate. This is a round-up of the most recent (as of about the end of 2017) science of ancient DNA by one of the scientists working on the subject. It's such a fast-moving field right now (faster than print publishing, to be sure) even a year will make a difference, and as a sort of science camp-follower, I look forward to trying to keep up.I found the work reported on India and Asia to be especially interesting, as it was new to me. (I'd already read Paabo's book on the Neanderthal work, also highly recommended. https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1... )Highly recommended, although read it soon, rather like eating your ice cream before it melts.Ta, L."
2,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7701175-alison,3,"We geneticists may be the barbarians coming late to the study of the human past, but it is always a bad idea to ignore barbarians. We have access to a type of data that no one has had before, and we are wielding these data to address previously unapproachable questions about who ancient peoples were.. This book has many very, very good qualities. It is, without doubt, the best modern summary of ancient genome research and how it is transforming our understanding of the past available. However, it also carries some very deep, and dangerous, flaws. Reich is so keen to move us forward with new techniques that he tramples past cultural, sociological and anthropological scholarship that helps us to understand how we create narratives and guard against bias. In doing so, his book reinforces destructive ideas about race; human cognition and psychology and class and power. Perhaps ironically, in seeking to free us from antiquated scholarship, Reich plays straight back into dominant narratives that have explained - and justified - racial inequality for centuries.In many ways these are small flaws, affecting a few chapters at the end. But Reich has created a narrative around this in which he is a hero taking on the idiocy of political correctness, which makes it impossible not to treat this discussion as the center of the book. And as Reich says above, these newcomers to the field of human origins wield enormous influence, which brings with it responsibility for rounded scholarship.It has taken me a month to write this damn review (long time to have a tab open!) in part because Reich sets us such a trap for the critic: he consistently argues that those critiquing his view of race are motivated by trying to shut the discussion down. People like me are anti-evidence, and unless you are going to argue with him over the sequencing techniques, then the criticism is irrelevant. As it happens, I agree strongly, as do very many who think he is wrong, with the need to have evidence-based discussion about race, gender, intellect, cognition and human origins. Especially given the rise of overt racism, and the flock of racist men to blogs and discussion forums around genetic prehistory. So it has been important to me to ensure that it is clear that my objections are not to having a conversation, they are to his conclusions, and the way he has framed the debate, and most of all, what he overlooks.Now, Reich argues that he is countering racism: his book strips back the stupid claim that 'races' have existed for any significant fraction of human existence, and gives huge weight - as does all modern genetic work - to understanding that our ancestors mingled, migrated and procreated much more expansively than we had previously assumed. Our modern 'populations' have existed for not much more than 5000 years in most cases. (This itself shows what we mean - many populations actually have been relatively distinct for longer than that, the San, Australia's Aboriginal groups, Native Americans - but they don't correspond to our race ideas, which lump all Africans together, all Oceanic groups together etc - really, it is the inhabitants of Eurasia who have mingled incessantly, creating the populations who tend to hold social, economic and political power in our current world) Multiculturalism has been a consistent feature of human societies, and yes, conflict is as much a part of that condition as harmony: this is part of who we are, in all our glorious complexity. But the fact that Reich doesn't think he is making racist assumptions doesn't change two big errors: his argument that cognitive differences could exist between ""large population groups"" (i.e.: races) and his infuriating and frankly petulant dismissal of First Nations concerns around genetic research.On the first: to start, Reich is not in the majority in thinking that large populations are the most effective way to look at genetic difference - he himself outlines his differences with Svante Paabo in the book, although he talks down the support that remains for Paabo's view that clines is a more enlightening slice. He admirably starts by pointing out that race, as we think we understand, has been largely debunked. He attempts to distinguish himself from the rubbish spouted by journalist Nicholas Wade, and the prejudice of James Watson. But as the book progresses, he focuses increasingly on the possibility of differences which have evolved over the last 5000 years, providing markers between populations - despite the fact he presents no evidence for this. In the end, he seems to be warning that they might be right about some things, attacking his colleagues for using truisms like, there is more genetic variation within population groups than between them (this is, by the way, simply true) instead, presumably, of focusing on those differences which can be found. The fact that there is plenty of scholarship on those differences, such as skin colour, height and susceptibility to disease, doesn't count of course, because really what Reich is getting at is cognitive, personality and the ""real"" question of intelligence. Who is, after all, the most human? the fact we have little idea in any form of scholarship of what that actually means doesn't slow him down at all. And honestly, it should.On the IQ: look, there are many great articles on this already on the Interwebz. Start with Kevin Mitchell in the Guardian . The issue here isn't that genetics doesn't predict the possibility of natural selection causing complex differences between populations (the only argument that Reich addresses in the book, and one which he says comes from political correctness, adding insult to disagreement); the issue is that the main narrative of modern society is that these differences do exist, when there is no untainted evidence for it. Mitchell in this link accepts the IQ test as a measure of intelligence - but many, many scientists do not. We have much evidence, in fact, that economic inequality and  stereotype threat: much of this research is centered on gender difference in maths . This is why the one main significant study into IQ and genetics - which Reich makes much of - focused on a very uniform genetic population in a country with tiny economic and social inequality, and even then the implications of its results have been widely challenged.Reich's own research on earlier periods challenges the simple search genetics has for the unlocking nature of consciousness and humanity. He points out that despite large resources, there simply doesn't seem to be evidence that genetic adaptation closely precedes leaps in human development. This is not a surprise to evolutionary biologists, who have known for some time that our capacity to learn and create social structures which then shape our individual cognitive development is our strongest adaptation; that our closest primate relatives have genetic capacity for language and tool use, as well as often superior memory and recall. But the key lesson here: that we have an extreme ability to socially shape our children and hence create ourselves should also result in an understanding that we ourselves, us scientists, are also created and shaped by the societies that created us, is one Reich usually doesn't appreciate the impact of. In one rather infuriating section he comments that we should take the same approach to race as to gender, throwing out: Most people accept that the biological differences between males and females are profound, and that they contribute to average differences in size and physical strength as well as in temperament and behavior, even if there are questions about the extent to which particular differences are also influenced by social expectations and upbringing (for example, many of the jobs in industry and the professions that women fill in great numbers today had few women in them a century ago). Today we aspire both to recognize that biological differences exist and to accord everyone the same freedoms and opportunities regardless of them. It is clear from the abiding average inequities that persist between women and men that fulfilling these aspirations is a challenge, and yet it is important to accommodate and even embrace the real differences that exist, while at the same time struggling to get to a better place. This view, that gender inequality is just a bit of thorny issue society is working through, that most people accept that gendered differences in 'temperament' are 'profound' bears little resemblance to any serious scholarship on either gender, or neuroscience (which consistently finds less and less gendered differences), or for that matter the goddamn zeitgeist at the moment, and summarises Reich's dismissiveness.Reich at times shows flashes of insight into how social and biological factors interact: for example noting that genetic predictors in (again, uniform and highly equal society) educational rates may relate to differences in fertility, not cognition, or his wonderful aside that West Africans might not be faster, but just more genetically diverse than others, but when it hasn't been forcefully brought to his attention by a sociologist he met at a dinner party, he seems unaware that what he regards as common knowledge comes from a worldview based on relationships of power and social roles. In this context, his blithe assumption that we can find cognitive differences between populations - despite the complete lack of agreement into how to measure or understand cognition; and an awareness that our ""common sense"" assumptions are largely shaped by our social environment - is an infuriating result of isolating hard science from the social sciences and humanities.Nowhere is this lack of awareness that he has a worldview more evident than in his frustrated complaints about the role of First Nations peoples - particularly in the Americas - in refusing participation in genetic testing. Reich's bewilderment as to why this is even an issue is clear: Scientists interested in studying genetic variation in Native American populations feel frustrated with this situation. I understand something of the devastation that the coming of Europeans and Africans to the Americas wrought on Native American populations, and its effects are also evident everywhere in the data I and my colleagues analyze. But I am not aware of any cases in which research in molecular biology including genetics—a field that has arisen almost entirely since the end of the Second World War—has caused major harm to historically persecuted groups. and leads on to hints of wanting to disregard agreements with tribal councils not to proselytise around this research:  I wonder if the distrust that has emerged among some Native Americans might be, in the balance, doing Native Americans substantial harm. I wonder whether as a geneticist I have a responsibility to do more than just respect the wishes of those who do not wish to participate in genetic research, but instead should make a respectful but strong case for the value of such research.Reich's claim that his research field has not done harm is a little naive. For starters, it involves his version of harm, which excludes the exploitation of genetic material for the primary gain of other groups. It assumes that his post-Enlightenment worldview - in which the search for information is noble, and never dangerous, and in which experimentation is more worthy than spiritual contemplation, is more worthy than differing worldviews which view knowledge without protection, context and responsibility as dangerous. It also ignores the attempts to patent genomic material in the 1990s, and the thirst for profit that US biomedicine is embroiled in, rarely to the benefit of participants. He lauds the work of researchers working with Aboriginal groups in Australia, without realising apparently that this work rests upon recognising that work with genetic material of Aboriginal groups must meet needs the community has identified. That is, it is about listening, respecting and offering resources: none of which is evident in Reich's approach to any of this.So, the good bits? Reich loves the pursuit of knowledge and it shows. And while he struggles so much with not recognising he has biases, he is refreshingly free from attaching his ego to particularly theories. He cheerfully admits where genetic research has proven his assumptions wrong, and this makes most of the book a page-turner, able to draw a reader in to rapidly shifting worlds of difference.Reich tackles a range of topics here: including the sensitive issue that the genetic evidence indicates we have more female ancestors than male. This process results from bottlenecks, or times where men fathered children on a wide range of women. While Reich clearly fears this will upset modern scholars, it is hardly a surprise to anthropologists well aware that polygynous child rearing is more common than polyandry, and that war and conflict are largely driven male invading forces. His research into the Indian caste system is fascinating, indicating the long-term effectiveness of social separation within an existing community, and providing really interesting takes on the interaction between social structures and genetic ones. The Brahmin caste, he argues, is far from purely different genetic stock, but bears markers of centuries of incestuous procreation and social isolation. I wanted far more on the Southern Route theory, and the role of Austronesian analysis - particularly given a month before the book came out, cave art was dated to 60,000 years in Northern Australia, which, if accurate, comes down solidly in favour of an early Southern route expansion (and Denosovan contact after arrival on the continent - or errors in genetic dating). Reich is well aware that this book is written at a moment in time, and it takes a certain courage to do that, as no doubt many of his current theories will be debunked in coming years. In being that brave, he's given the layperson a fabulous chance to explore a field in flux. It is just such a shame that he chose to mar this with an unsubstantiated argument about possible things people may find into the future, in a way which feeds into racism and sexism."
3,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,4,"This book offers readers a description about the human past that has been made possible by recent technological advances in genome research. By comparing whole genomes' worth of DNA from ancient humans of various degrees of antiquity together with the data analysis power of modern computers, a picture of ancient human history has emerged that is filled with multiple migrations by varied branches of the human ancestral family. The picture that is emerging consists of so many past migrations and mixtures of past populations that it's difficult to know how to give a sense of its complexity in this review. This is compounded by the author's statement that there's an avalanche of new genome data pouring into the field faster than if can be assimilated. The author predicts that the complexity of past human history will become increasingly developed in detail and complexity. The following items highlighted by this review are simply those portions that impressed me as being particularly interesting.Variation in Human FormsThe variation in human forms varied much more widely 50,000 years ago than it does today. There were at that time alive on earth four major forms of humans. In addition to modern humans there were Neanderthal, Denisovan and Homo-floresiensis (a.k.a Hobbits). The Homo-floresiensis were isolated on the Island of Flores, Indonesia and may have been descendants of Homo-erectus and did not mix with modern humans. However, there was intermixing of Neanderthals and Denisovans with modern humans as late as 50,000± years ago. Almost all non-Sub-Saharan Africans alive today carry traces of this ancestry in their DNA.DNA Consequences of American SlaveryThe contribution of European American men to the average genetic makeup of present-day African Americans is about four times higher than that of European American women (38 percent versus 10 percent). This difference is determined by comparing the differences between Y-chromosone and mitochondrial DNA. This ""sex bias"" in some human ancestries is evidence of an imbalance in social power between human classes during past history. A similar difference is found in south Asian DNA which is indicative of a past migration or invasion from the Eurasian Steppes. It's interesting how past human sexual behavior, sometimes many years in the past, can be determined by this sort of analysis. (view spoiler)[A story I heard in my younger years was that all that racial mixing was caused by the Union troops during Sherman's March to the Sea. (hide spoiler)]Native Americans Closer to Europeans than AsiansNative Americans are more closely related to Europeans than to East Asians. How can this be if the ancestral native Americans came to North America via the Bering Strait crossing which is in northeast Asia? The answer lies in the past existence of a ""ghost population"" of ""ancient north Eurasians"" that contributed to the genome or both northern Europeans and Native Americans, but not present-day Han Chinese. Ghost PopulationsThe term ""ghost population"" is used to describe a population that can be inferred to have existed in the past using statistical reconstruction but that no longer exists in unmixed form. And indeed the bones found in a south-central Siberian grave dating from around 24,000 years ago match the predicted genome of ""ancient north Eurasians."" The following graphic illustrates the ""four population ancestral analysis"" that illustrates how the existence of ""ancient north Eurasians"" was determined.  Sardinians Are Remnant of Early EuropeansIt's interesting to note from the above illustration that today's Sardinians are the closest relatives to ancestral Europeans because the mixing with north Eurasians didn't reach them. Neanderthal Markers in European and Asian DNAAlso of interest from the above illustration is the fact that modern human/Neanderthal mixing occurred with the ""ancestral non-Africans"" but not with the ""predicted ghost population"" of ancient north Eurasia. Consequently, present day Han Chinese have a higher percentage of Neanderthal markers in their DNA than present day northern Europeans (4% vs. 2%). This is counter intuitive since the mixing between modern humans and Neanderthal occurred in Europe and the Middle East. ControversiesThe book contains a chapter which discusses some of the controversies caused by the recent advances in genome research. One subject discussed is the refusal of some Native American tribes to allow bones of their ancestors be analyzed. This has developed from a long history of scientists who have shown disrespect to this ethnic group. The author sees this as an unfortunate situation which he hopes can be resolved with time and improved trust between the two sides.Problems with RacistsAnother issue discussed is the problem with those who object to any analysis of differences between human groups because it gives fuel to racists. The author believes that enforcement of artificial political correctness on genome research would allow those of a paranoid disposition to claim that the scientfic community is hiding the ""truth."" He says it is best to have an open an transparent discussion of genome differences between racial groups. NYT Article of InterestThe following is a link (not from the book) to an article about an archeological excavation of a grave of a human who was a mixture of Neanderthal and Denisovan, but not modern human.https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/22/sc...Excerpt from Another BookThe following is not from this book. It's a link to an excerpt from Evolving Ourselves by Juan Enriquez and Steve Gullans. I found of particular interest the quote, ""There are almost no examples of Neanderthal cavities. Paleolithic and Mesolithic human skulls are almost devoid of cavities."" https://t.co/HfAjYUwDoh"
4,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"Reich, a Harvard genetics professor, is a leading scientist investigating ancient DNA. He brings us up to date on the significant progress that has been made in the extraction and analysis of DNA from ancient bones. These recent studies change what we know about the movements of prehistoric peoples and our relationships to archaic humans and each other. In 2010 the genomes of only five ancient people had been published. By 2017 over 700 ancient individual genomes had been published with Reich’s laboratory having produced 3,000 more that are unpublished. The success rates of DNA extraction from very old bones has increased dramatically and the cost has declined precipitously as ever more efficient methods have been devised. We are at the beginning of a new era in understanding our deep past.A traditional way to view human evolution is like the branches of a tree. One population buds off and separates into another but the branches don’t come back together. Reich’s analysis of the genomes of ancient populations shows that modern human prehistory wasn’t at all like that. Mass movement of people from one location to another was common displacing and mixing in varying degrees with the prior inhabitants creating a new genome. With few exceptions ancestors of people in any area came from somewhere else in a process that was repeated time and again. This undercuts simple notions of race as we are all the products of blends on top of blends of diverse peoples. Examining DNA and its mutations in ancient bones has clarified our relationships to archaic humans, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans. Neanderthals separated from modern human ancestors 550,000-770,000 years ago. Neanderthals dominated Europe 400,000 years ago. Modern humans migrated out of Africa to the Near East 100,000-130,000 years ago. Neanderthals expanded out of Europe westward across Asia and to the Near East after about 100,000 years ago and again 70,000 years ago forcing modern humans to retreat. Then after about 60,000 years ago modern humans predominated in the Near East. Throughout this period there was plenty of opportunity for interbreeding. Current analysis shows modern humans and Neanderthals interbred in the Near East 49,000-54,000 years ago and again later in Europe. Today non-Africans retain 1.5%-2.1% Neanderthal genes with the highest percentage in East and South Asians leading Reich to conclude that most Neanderthal DNA comes from interbreeding in the Near East.Denisovans were more closely related to Neanderthals than modern humans. Neanderthal and Denisovan populations separated 380,000-470,000 years ago. Migrations in Asia brought Denisovans and modern humans together and analysis shows they interbred about 44,000-49,000 years ago. Asians today have Denisovan genes. The highest percentage is found in the indigenous peoples of New Guinea, Australia and the Philippines. The people of New Guinea have 3%-6% Denisovan genes on top of their 2% Neanderthal genes for up to 8% archaic human genes. Reich goes on to examine the movement, mixing and replacement of many different populations of modern humans. A fascinating example is that of Native Americans whose DNA is closer to that of Europeans than Asians. How did this happen? Over 15,000 years ago an Ancient North Eurasian population split with one group heading east mixing with East Asians along the way and crossing the Bering Strait. The other group headed west mixing with another population that would many years later populate northern Europe. Today half the people in the world have between 5% and 40% of their genome inherited from these Ancient North Eurasians. Current native Siberians are not primarily related to the ancient group. Today we all are the result of the mixing and remixing of unique peoples that no longer exist.Since modern humans entered Europe there was continuous cycle of replacement and blending. Reich describes it all but I’ll just keep it to the recent past. Four major groups of people were present in western Eurasia 10,000 years ago: Fertile Crescent farmers, Iranian farmers, eastern European hunter gatherers and western-central European hunter gatherers. Each group was as different from the other as are Europeans and Asians today. Each would have looked like a different race. Then the farmers expanded their territories and blended with outlying populations: Iranian farmers to India, Israeli-Jordanian farmers to east Africa, Turkish farmers to Europe. European hunter gatherers around 8,000 years ago were dark skinned with dark hair and blue eyes. They were largely replaced by migrating Anatolian farmers with light skin, brown eyes and dark hair. Then 5,000 years ago the Yamnaya people of the eastern European steppes migrated across northern Europe. These violent people had mastered the horse, wheeled carts and a signature battle axe. The Yamnaya are the ancestors of modern day north Europeans. The Yamnaya brought with them blonde hair from a single mutation 17,000 years ago which they acquired from the Ancient North Eurasian population mentioned earlier. The Ancient North Eurasians had also supplied the Yamnaya with the same genes they had contributed to Native Americans. The Yamnaya were cattle herders who also brought with them a form of the plague which analysis indicates killed many of the Europeans they replaced. Also the Yamnaya spread Indo-European language across Europe. In movements similar to Europe’s around 9,000 years ago Iranian farmers migrated to India mixing with the resident hunter gatherers. Then 5,000 years ago another group of Yamnaya from the central Asian steppes migrated to northern India and blended with the existing inhabitants. They brought Indo-European language and their genes. Southern Indians and lower castes have more of the prior residents’ genome while northern Indians and higher castes, particularly the Brahmins have more from the invaders. Brahmins, the priestly caste, were responsible for the ancient texts written in Old Sanskrit, an Indo-European language. In the south the Dravidian languages continued to predominate. Mitochondrial (female) DNA of all Indians is almost completely from the prior inhabitants. Indians with Yamnaya DNA got it almost exclusively from males. It doesn’t take much to figure this out. European genes in African Americans came primarily from males. European genes in indigenous peoples in the Americas also came disproportionately from males.In Asia the original out-of-Africa modern humans split with some following the coastline east and island hopping down to Australia, some went to Southeast Asia, some to Mongolia, and some to eastern China with some of those continuing on to the north where they would eventually mix with the migrating Ancient North Eurasian population and cross the Bering Strait. Unfortunately China does not allow ancient remains out of the country. Reich and others in the West cannot perform their advanced techniques to retrieve and analyze the DNA. Thus his China analysis is limited as is that of Native Americans due to U.S. laws requiring tribal approval to test remains. Based on what he has Reich traces two population centers that arose with the advent of farming 9,000 years ago, one on the Yellow River and one to the south on the Yangtze. The Yellow River population expanded west to Tibet and the Yangtze River population spread to Southeast Asia and Taiwan mixing with prior residents. There was a second island hopping migration, this time from from Taiwan 5,000 years ago. They displaced residents of the Philippines and some went onto the Solomon Islands and Fiji, making them the first people on the Southwest Pacific Islands. Another migration by people of Papuan decent followed 2,400 years ago from the Bismarck Islands off New Guinea to the Southwest Islands. More migrations followed. Africa too experienced migrations and populations disappearing and contributing to new ones. Unfortunately DNA does not hold up as well in tropical climes, limiting how much has been discovered about older populations. However new approaches to DNA extraction are beginning to show results in Africa. With sparse results from the distant past Reich sees evidence of substantial mixing as occurred elsewhere but can’t define the groups with certainty. He is more specific beginning with the expansion of agriculturalists. Bantu speakers 4,000 years ago spread from their West African home on the border of present day Nigeria and Cameroon. They spread their language and culture east and south across sub-Saharan Africa. They developed crops supporting dense populations and began making iron tools 2,500 years ago. Another migration of Nilo-Saharan language speakers who were cattle herders spread their language and culture from Mali to Tanzania. They were likely driven by the expansion of the Saharan desert over the last 5,000 years. There was migration of Near East agriculture and language into North Africa. Khoe-Kwadi speakers in South Africa noted for the use of clicks in their language inherited genes and probably language from an East African herder population that no longer exists. Reich believes we are just at the beginning of understanding the prehistory of humans. But he is concerned about one difficult problem, that of race. Given the ugly history of the eugenics movement and the misuse of the findings of genetic science by extremists today, people are rightly afraid of how Reich’s work will be used. How do we balance this concern against the benefits of modern genetic analysis? Reich offers the example of being confronted with racial concerns when he proposed research identifying just which African Americans are more prone to prostate cancer. Today we know African Americans have a greater risk of prostate cancer, but Reich believes the risk is not evenly spread among them. Reich wanted to identify the specific African populations the problem genes came from and trace them to American populations, which meant testing many people. So the question becomes how we can talk about genetic differences without invoking race and all the baggage that term carries. As much as is covered here, it is still just a snapshot of what is in this book. Reich describes many more groups and migrations. Also not in this review are the details Reich supplies of the analytics supporting his assertions, another great reason to pick up this book. What we learn is groundbreaking but he identifies many gaps that need further research. The good news is that the application of these genomic techniques has just begun. It’s less than ten years since the first five ancient genomes were published. I suspect what we will find out in another ten years will be astounding."
5,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,"Such fascinating science and research on ancient DNA. I also really loved all the research about the Iranian Nomad populations that are basically the tribe that took over Europe because those are my people (kind of because there was a lot of mixing). It was also stunning to see how inequality and male domination affected genetics. Basically a few really powerful men who spread their DNA far and wide. Women obviously can't have too many children, but also history seems to be just conquering armies of men spreading their seeds over conquered populations of women. He also talks at the end about race differences and how we should be prepared to deal with what advanced DNA science will have to say about that. I think he's a bit more confident than his data can take him. I think the DNA stuff is obviously clear to him, but he's not an IQ scientist and I think most people who study cognitive testing believe that it is far from being scientifically rigorous or rooted in genetic differences. In other words, we haven't been able to separate genetics from environment when it comes to cognitive ability. Reich may be confident he can parse out modern races from their DNA, but I do worry about trying to plot races on cognitive factors. By all means, we should look at diseases and all sorts of stuff that have clear genetic variants, but before we start talking about intelligence, we better make sure the science on that is air tight. "
6,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7381993-katia-n,5,"‘The speed at which the ancient DNA revolution is moving is exhilarating. The technology is evolving so quickly that many papers being published right now use methods that will be obsolete within a few years.’ Without having any special knowledge of genomics, anthropology or archeology, I am not well placed to review this book. Therefore, what follows is just my impressions and main take from it. Admirably, Reich’s book is not Eurocentric, it covers all the regions to some extent. But mine notes focus more on Europe just because i live here.The book is about the breakthrough in a relatively new field - Ancient Genomics which analyses the ancient DNA in order to study how the genetic make up of modern people and their ancestors affected history. The potential investigative power of DNA for historic research was envisaged in the 60s of the last century. But only in the last 5 years or so this area has leaped forward dramatically. So, the book summarises the cutting age research, mainly derived from Reich’s lab and from his collaborations, the science in flux, not the result of the common consensus. This as well as Reich background as geneticist, needs to be taken into the account while reading it, but the book is well written, entertaining and revelatory. Moreover, in many ways it disrupts the consensus about the evolution of ancient human populations. The consensus, which existed in pre-history almost up until 2012. The research covers ancient populations and their movements around the globe since first humans and up to circa 4000 years ago (a bit later for Africa). So it does not go up to the modern time. But Reich states that for Eurasia for example, including India, the genetic make-up of people 4 thousands years ago is close to the modern make up across the high level population’s clusters such as the West and East Eurasians for example. It was certainly not the case for the earlier periods when the mixtures were very different. The book covers all significant regions such as Western and Eastern Eurasia, Australia, America, Africa and India.So what the analyses of the samples of ancient people’s genome tells us according to Reich?Main resultUntil 2012 it was generally accepted that the evolution of the ancient population could be modelled by a tree in which “today’s populations have remained unchanged and separate since branching from a central trunk” after migrating from Africa and, later, after the farmers from Anatolia and Middle East migrated our of their regions. But DNA research has revealed that “this model is dead and that instead the truth has involved great cycles of population separation and mixture"". So even 4 thousands years ago there were no such thing as a “purity” of blood or any populations which were not significantly mixed with the other.Very ancient daysThere is certainly genetic evidence that modern-humans and Neanderthals interbreed. But Neanderthals’ genetic inheritance has been decreased by natural selection as their genes seem to be toxic for many parts of modern human genome. It has got adverse affect on male’s fertility for Y-chromosome carrier. On another matter, it does not seem to be the evidence of a “switch gene” - the part of DNA sequence which while evolved in pre-history made people to obtain the language in a one-off development. EuropeSouth Europe seems to keep a lot of inheritance from the Middle Eastern and Anatolian farmers (the highest correlation is with the modern Sardinian population). But for the Northern Europe (France, Germany, Britain and alike) the story is more complicated:First, “Between six thousand and five thousand years ago, most of the northern gene pool was overtaken by farmer ancestry, and it was this mixture of a modest amount of hunter-gatherer-related ancestry and a large amount of Anatolian farmer–related ancestry—in a population that retained key elements of hunter-gatherer culture—that characterized the Funnel Beaker potters and many other contemporary Europeans. Europe had reached a new equilibrium. The people of the Funnel Beaker culture were among those who built megaliths, the collective burial tombs made of stones so large it would have taken dozens of people to move them. The archaeologist Colin Renfrew suggested that megalith building might be a direct reflection of this boundary between southern farmers and hunter-gatherers turned farmers—a way of laying claim to territory, of distinguishing one people and culture from others. The genetic data may bear witness to this interaction, as there was clearly a stream of new migrants into the mixed population. The unmixed hunter-gatherers were disappearing, persisting only in isolated pockets like the islands off southern Sweden. In remote Britain, the megalith builders were hard at work on what developed into the greatest man-made monument the world had seen: the standing stones of Stonehenge, which became a national place of pilgrimage as reflected by goods brought from the far corners of Britain. People like those at Stonehenge were building great temples to their gods, and tombs for their dead, and could not have known that within a few hundred years their descendants would be gone and their lands overrun.”Then, somewhere between 4.5 thousands years ago and 4 thousands years ago. The people from the steppe have migrated into Northern Europe in mass and within few hundreds years mixed and/or replaced the local populations to such an extent that they are now “primary ancestors of the modern population”. For example 90% Neolithic Britons (those ones who built Stonehenge) were replaced with this mixture. These steppe people were the Yamnaya, by itself the mixture of Iranian and Armenian populations spreading from the coast of the Black and Caspian sea. They were the first people in Eurasia using the wheel, the horse and wagon which made them very mobile. It is unclear how they were so effective in replacing the existent population. But the one theory is bubonic plague to which they were more immune. They brought it with them. Reich finds it ironic that the earlier Europeans might have been the victims of a similar fate the later Europeans inflicted on the Native Americans in the later history. The first evidence of Yamaya migration is found in the Corded Ware culture. It is notorious by the fact that it helped the Nazis with their theories. They thought the Germanic people went East with this culture and laid their territorial claim for the Eastern Europe on that basis. The DNA study revealed just the opposite, the Corded wire culture reflected a mass migration of Yamnaya people into the central Europe from the steppe:“But the genetics showed that the connection between the Corded Ware culture and the Yamnaya culture reflected major movements of people. The makers of the Corded Ware culture were, at least in a genetic sense, a westward extension of the Yamnaya. Our finding about the genetic link between the Yamnaya and the Corded Ware culture demonstrates the disruptive power of ancient DNA. It can prove past movements of people, and in this case has documented a magnitude of population replacement that no modern archaeologist, even the most ardent supporter of migrations, had dared to propose. The association between steppe genetic ancestry and people assigned to the Corded Ware archaeological culture through graves and artifacts is not simply a hypothesis. It is now a proven fact.”The famous Russian symbolist Alexander Blok in 1918 has written a poem in which he said: “We are all Scythians” (the later people of the same steppe). He might have been right at the end. There is also a hypothesis that Yamnaya people were the first who spoke Indo-European language which they spread with them both to the West and to India. IndiaThe population of India is in fact a set of numerous fairly genetically distinct small populations which do not mix with each other very much. Endogamy have been practised in South Asia for thousands years. And the theory that the British has substantially boosted the cast system by actively encouraging non-mixing between the casts during the colonisation has been disapproved by genetic evidence (as far as I understood the argument). But no-one in India could claim a genetic purity either. There is an evidence of substantial West Eurasian incursion, possibly through Yamnaya as well or the related people (the male line only). But when Reich tried to discuss it with his indian colleagues, “They did not want to be part of a study that suggested a major West Eurasian incursion into India without being absolutely certain as to how the whole-genome data could be reconciled with their mitochondrial DNA findings. They also implied that the suggestion of a migration from West Eurasia would be politically explosive. They did not explicitly say this, but it had obvious overtones of the idea that migration from outside India had a transformative effect on the subcontinent.We wrote that the people of India today are the outcome of mixtures between two highly differentiated populations, “Ancestral North Indians” (ANI) and “Ancestral South Indians” (ASI), who before their mixture were as different from each other as Europeans and East Asians are today. The ANI are related to Europeans, central Asians, Near Easterners, and people of the Caucasus, but we made no claim about the location of their homeland or any migrations. The ASI descend from a population not related to any present-day populations outside India. We showed that the ANI and ASI had mixed dramatically in India. The result is that everyone in mainland India today is a mix, albeit in different proportions, of ancestry related to West Eurasians, and ancestry more closely related to diverse East Asian and South Asian populations. No group in India can claim genetic purity.”ControversiesAs Reich has got the background in medical genetics, he might come across as not paying sufficient attention to certain ethnic and cultural sensitivities. I personally think that in some areas he is brave enough not to avoid those topics all together. But I could see that some people might find him too direct. And certainly he might cause a lot of disagreements if ethical applications of if his statements would be taken further. Two examples:- some Native American tribe councils do not allow the tribe members to provide DNA for scientific research even for medical reasons. This ban acts even in the cases if a person involved signs the individual consent form. Reich thinks it might be more harmful than good. - biological differences across the populations. Here it is getting quite complicated because people associate those high level populations like East Asians, Europeans, Africans etc with race. The race is very charged word for variety of reasons and more appropriate in the conversations about social constructs and their devastating consequences on the society. So Reich is careful showing the difference between the terms of “race” and “population”. However, Reich states that the biological differences across the populations do exist. And sooner or later some differences between the traits and cognitive capabilities might be found as well. Those differences might be smaller that the differences within populations, but still significant. His view that the society should be prepared to discuss this situation.“What real differences do we know about? We cannot deny the existence of substantial average genetic differences across populations, not just in traits such as skin colour, but also in bodily dimensions, the ability to efficiently digest starch or milk sugar, the ability to breathe easily at high altitudes, and susceptibility to particular diseases. These differences are just the beginning. I expect that the reason we don’t know about a much larger number of differences among human populations is that studies with adequate statistical power to detect them have not yet been carried out.If selection on height and infant head circumference (across the populations) can occur within a couple of thousand years, it seems a bad bet to argue that there cannot be similar average differences in cognitive or behavioural traits. Even if we do not yet know what the differences are, we should prepare our science and our society to be able to deal with the reality of differences instead of sticking our heads in the sand and pretending that differences cannot be discovered. If as scientists we wilfully abstain from laying out a rational framework for discussing human differences, we will leave a vacuum that will be filled by pseudoscience, an outcome that is far worse than anything we could achieve by talking openly. We will need to deal with these studies and react responsibly to them when they are published, but we can already be sure that we will be surprised by some of the outcomes. The right way to deal with the inevitable discovery of substantial differences across populations is to realize that their existence should not affect the way we conduct ourselves. As a society we should commit to according everyone equal rights despite the differences that exist among individuals. We aspire to treat all individuals with respect regardless of the extraordinary differences that exist among individuals within a population, it should not be so much more of an effort to accommodate the smaller but still significant average differences across populations.”Some of these points might be debatable and certainly might be emotionally charged for many people. They are discussed in the one of the last chapters of the book. I hope this discussion would not distract the general public and the scientific community from the main findings and the substantial break-through in the the ancient DNA research which is presented in this book. "
7,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7482598-jayesh,5,"This was a fantastic condensation of modern research on genomics and it's effect on our understanding of anthropology and history. Really, what is it with biologists that they are able to write these books understandable to a relatively lay audience without hiding entire detail about how the scientists go about doing their research and draw conclusions:We scientists are conditioned by the system of research funding to justify what we do in terms of practical application to health or technology. But shouldn’t intrinsic curiosity be valued for itself? Shouldn’t fundamental inquiry into who we are be the pinnacle of what we as a species hope to achieve? Isn’t an attribute of an enlightened society that it values intellectual activity that may not have immediate economic or other practical impact? The study of the human past—as of art, music, literature, or cosmology—is vital because it makes us aware of aspects of our common condition that are profoundly important and that we heretofore never imagined.Not that some details are hidden. Like use of Principal Component Analysis and other statistical techniques and how they get around problems with these techniques is mostly elided. Still it was fun learning about things Four Population Tests to identify likely common ancestors and how they group current and past populations of people.The weakest parts of the book are when Reich is trying to walk the tight rope of modern connections between race, behavior and genetics. Which is understandable, because it is a difficult topic. But his bad arguments don't do well for the values he wants to espouse. There is a lot of is vs. ought confusion, with no consistency. This is especially egregious in Chapter 11. Why do I need to be reminded of treating individuals as individuals, just because we find something about group averages. There's something to be said about Nietzsche, that he was correct to claim that trying to derive all our values from objective truth is not ideal, to say the least. But an interesting quote:I have deep sympathy for the concern that genetic discoveries about differences among populations may be misused to justify racism. But it is precisely because of this sympathy that I am worried that people who deny the possibility of substantial biological differences among populations across a range of traits are digging themselves into an indefensible position, one that will not survive the onslaught of science. In the last couple of decades, most population geneticists have sought to avoid contradicting the orthodoxy. When asked about the possibility of biological differences among human populations, we have tended to obfuscate, making mathematical statements in the spirit of Richard Lewontin about the average difference between individuals from within any one population being around six times greater than the average difference between populations. We point out that the mutations that underlie some traits that differ dramatically across populations—the classic example is skin color—are unusual, and that when we look across the genome it is clear that the typical differences in frequencies of mutations across populations are far less. But this carefully worded formulation is deliberately masking the possibility of substantial average differences in biological traits across populations.Anyway the book is a lot of fun. One of the funniest parts was about them finding proof for West Eurasian ancestry of large parts of South Asian population:They did not want to be part of a study that suggested a major West Eurasian incursion into India without being absolutely certain as to how the whole-genome data could be reconciled with their mitochondrial DNA findings. They also implied that the suggestion of a migration from West Eurasia would be politically explosive. They did not explicitly say this, but it had obvious overtones of the idea that migration from outside India had a transformative effect on the subcontinent.So to get around this:We wrote that the people of India today are the outcome of mixtures between two highly differentiated populations, “Ancestral North Indians” (ANI) and “Ancestral South Indians” (ASI), who before their mixture were as different from each other as Europeans and East Asians are today. The ANI are related to Europeans, central Asians, Near Easterners, and people of the Caucasus, but we made no claim about the location of their homeland or any migrations. The ASI descend from a population not related to any present-day populations outside India. We showed that the ANI and ASI had mixed dramatically in India. The result is that everyone in mainland India today is a mix, albeit in different proportions, of ancestry related to West Eurasians, and ancestry more closely related to diverse East Asian and South Asian populations. No group in India can claim genetic purity.And for the rest of the chapter, he deadpan goes on using the ANI-ASI terminology.Finally, no one comes out looking good when you go far back in time. And we are mixes all the way down."

He navigates the ethics of genetic research with special sensitivity to how this research has been abused and misused in the past, leading to oppression, genocide, and decades of struggle for many people groups throughout history.While any book claiming to have the ""new"" research will be inevitably superceded, this is the book to check out right now for a 2010s-landscape view of genetics, and population studies.Completely fascinating."

[…] when we discover biological differences governing behavior, they may not be working in the way we naively assume. — David Reich, Who We Are and How We Got Here.
Reich has done a tremendous job condensing the work of many people and disparate areas of research into a compelling story that is potentially more informative for the history and process behind the scientific discoveries than the conclusions or his commentary on their societal effects. While the book is highly recommended based alone on the wealth of new ideas and potential to upturn old facts accepted by many, and is the reason I gave it a high rating rather than because I agree with everything said, it should be read with caution and an eye for ""what is not said"" for reasons pointed out below. 	DNA vs ArcheologyThe book is mainly divided into an introductory portion, where the story of the Neanderthals helps provide a basis to go over techniques used in the ancient DNA field. Reich then moves across the globe—from Europe through India, the Americas, East Asians, and Africa—and goes over different migratory patterns that have been revealed by ancient DNA analysis. In addition, as is the case with India, he shows cases where endogamy (marrying within certain groups) can be demonstrated by analysis of highly unlikely similarity of DNA coding regions across time in specific populations. Further, he also shows how cases like the ""Star Cluster"" can help demonstrate cases in which specific males (or groups of males) had an outsized levels of breeding success, potentially due to war or migration as mentioned previously. An interesting question that he does not really address is the use of ancient DNA analysis to show how monogamy or polygamy play out in actuality, or if there was more cheating going on than would be expected giving stated societal norms across time and regions. Lastly, he ends looking both at the future (good) and the ethical implications of ancient DNA analysis (the weakest part of the book, more on that later). Overall, the style suites the topic really well and is a great way to get people new to the field acquainted with a forest-level view.Reich does a convincing job of showing the advantages of ancient DNA analysis over traditional archeology in certain areas, such as pointing out the discrepancy between archeologists claiming that for there to have been a large incursion of non-Indians into that subcontinent, replacing people and leaving a genetic footprint, that there would be carbon, etc. evidence of burnt towns, etc. But the well recorded fall of Rome by the Visigoths and others did not leave such a record to the degree anticipated, throwing such conclusions into doubt. This can be captured in the classic phrase ""absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence"".  	Estimating the past from genomic data.However, and this is a theme about my criticisms of the book, he does not provide examples or speculate on places where the archeological record does show migration or invasion but there is not much ancient or modern DNA evidence left. Two scenarios (of many) would be an invasion where the invading population did not breed much with the locals despite large changes to civilization (think modern American wars) or pass through migrations on the way to some other destination (if those occurred). It would have been informative for him to spend time on the limits of what could possibly be known given ancient DNA basically relies on the dynamics of sex to have occurred in some predicted pattern (e.g. conquering males impregnating conquered females). Further, it is not clear how much the Star Cluster or similar traits is due to a single male or many closely related males, e.g. whether there is a limitation in what this type of analysis can tell us. These might be hidden within academic reviews, but the point of this book should be to give a high-level view of the pros and cons of ancient DNA analysis without a reader needing to get their hands dirty on the first pass.  [image error]	Good illustration of why whole genome analysis can be very useful.On the other hand, he does a good job pointing out several neat ideas, such as due to the random splitting of DNA during production of gametes, that several generations back one is unlikely to contain DNA from all ones ancestors (by sexual reproduction). In addition, he does a good job at attacking old dogmas that are based on bad assumptions, such as Richard Lewontin's 1972 study The Apportionment of Human Diversity (see Lewontin's Fallacy, that don't take into account the whole genome or correlations between variations across the genome. This type of thinking is still prevalent, as can be seen in a recent National Geographic issue, see There’s No Scientific Basis for Race—It's a Made-Up Label.In addition, his small aside about finding that the cochlear contains the best store of ancient DNA is fun and could potentially have been an opportunity to point out serendipity in science (should that be the case here). There are several other times, such as the story of discovering ""ghost"" populations that may no longer exists but related Europeans and Native Americans that was resolved finding the Mal'ta boy, where he brings up cool stories of how science leads to hypotheses turns to field work and final novel insights about the world. This is captured in a nice assertion Reich makes near the beginning:
We scientists are conditioned by the system of research funding to justify what we do in terms of practical application to health or technology. But shouldn’t intrinsic curiosity be valued for itself? Shouldn’t fundamental inquiry into who we are be the pinnacle of what we as a species hope to achieve? Isn’t an attribute of an enlightened society that it values intellectual activity that may not have immediate economic or other practical impact? The study of the human past—as of art, music, literature, or cosmology—is vital because it makes us aware of aspects of our common condition that are profoundly important and that we heretofore never imagined. — David Reich, Who We Are and How We Got Here.
And it reminds me of Richard Feynman's excellent The Value of Science essay and a key quote:
Another value of science is the fun called intellectual enjoyment which some people get from reading and learning and thinking about it, and which others get from working in it. This is an important point, one which is not considered enough by those who tell us it is our social responsibility to reflect on the impact of science on society. — Richard Feynman The Value of Science.
Reich also gives overviews of several techniques used in the field to identify likely common ancestors (Four Population Test) and to group current and past groups of people (e.g. principal component analysis). These are supplemented by excellent diagrams. However, he doesn't spend much time pointing out to the reader problems with these techniques or how they get around them. This is especially important as it relates to discussions of grouping people into categories based on (in the book) obvious delineations between say Europeans and some Asians subcategories.
Our initial approach was to carry out a principal component analysis, which can identify combinations of mutation frequencies that are most efficient at finding differences among samples. — David Reich, Who We Are and How We Got Here.
 	Example of principal component analysis to reduce many genetic variations across groups into a single, easy to read graph.As a scientist, and knowing how quickly new fields can evolve and old methods be found to contain technical and conceptual errors, I am alarmed by Reich's lack of giving any kind of confidence (mathematical or otherwise) about statements being made that upturn old archeological or other theories. Given many studies he cited are less than a decade, sometimes only a couple years old, this is concerning. He does not spend much time going over more caveats to the technical methods (e.g. extraction of DNA from ancient samples, though he does talk about some initial challenges and solutions in the case of Neanderthal DNA) or conceptual ideas (e.g. Four Population Test). This is evidenced, for example, in his out of place bringing up of the Jefferson-Hemings relationship that adds nothing to the story but he presents as if it has been conclusively shown (with genetics, while glossing over the caveats). More humility about the possibilities of ancient DNA analysis would have strengthened the book.  [image error]	Text has many simple illustrations that help get scientific points across.Reich would also have done well to specifically state who he is referring to when he makes comments about those wanting to return to a 'racially pure' state, while he leaves their timescale for determining purity indefinite. Those discussing maintaining a recent European stock in their writings (e.g. The Daily Stormer, American Renaissance, Occidental Dissent, etc.) are slightly different that those proposing old Nordic Theories and similar stories (e.g. see The Long Journey, The Rising Tide of Color: Against White World Supremacy, etc.). He does briefly mention the Eurogenes and several other blogs, but only in passing and not directly in relation to his reference to 'racists' and 'bigots'. Further, he then contradicts himself by pointing out:
However, in Europe, where we have made most progress in the ancient DNA revolution so far, we know that by four thousand years ago, many populations were already highly similar in their ancestry composition to those of today. […] For example, the classic measure of genetic differentiation between two British populations is about one hundred times smaller than the same measurement of population differentiation comparing Europeans to East Asians. — David Reich, Who We Are and How We Got Here.
That he does not attempt to reconcile these comments about populations that are relatively homogenous and have not mixed much over recent history leaves room for people to misinterpret or use such findings to justify their beliefs.
Ancient DNA has established major migration and mixture between highly divergent populations as a key force shaping human prehistory, and ideologies that seek a return to a mythical purity are flying in the face of hard science. — David Reich, Who We Are and How We Got Here.
In addition, at the end of several chapters and throughout the book Reich makes reference to 'racial purity' not being a thing—without taking care to note that purity depends on the timescale used and, thus, is an annoying strawman. As noted above, he also contradicts this statement in several cases, among which include the distinct ethnic groups in Indian that have been maintained for tens of generations even among physically mixed populations.
Around a third of Indian groups experienced population bottlenecks as strong or stronger than the ones that occurred among Finns or Ashkenazi Jews. […]Many of the population bottlenecks in India were also exceedingly old. […] It meant that after the population bottleneck, the ancestors of the Vysya had maintained strict endogamy, allowing essentially no genetic mixing into their group for thousands of years. Even an average rate of influx into the Vysya of as little as 1 percent per generation would have erased the genetic signal of a population bottleneck. The ancestors of the Vysya did not live in geographic isolation.[…] And the Vysya were not unique. A third of the groups we analyzed gave similar signals, implying thousands of groups in India like this. — David Reich, Who We Are and How We Got Here.
In addition, he also seems focused on the idea of human migrations to the exclusion of focusing on how ancient DNA can tell us about changes occurring in non-migratory populations (thought he hints at the end of the book about this). For example, this could address Clark's A Farewell to Alms assertion about rich Britons breeding more being a reason for the industrial revolution and would be a starting point for many interesting analyses. During the discussion of the low occurrence of mixture between physically inter-mixed groups within India, e.g. endogamy or the caste system, he then goes on a tangent about his Jewishness and how he sympathized with the (unnamed) people who were prevent from finding love outside their ethnic/social group. These very overt tendencies to favor mixture over non-mixture are concerning in that he doesn't state in reality what guides his (and those in the fields) scientific questions and how that might bias future hypotheses or research, impacting interpretation of the past and having consequences for how society at large interprets the fields results.
The genome revolution provides us with a shared history that, if we pay proper attention, should give us an alternative to the evils of racism and nationalism, and make us realize that we are all entitled equally to our human heritage. [emphasis mine] — David Reich, Who We Are and How We Got Here.
This book, along with the excellent The Neuroscience of Intelligence by Richard Haier and many others will start to raise questions that need to be addressed by scientists and non-scientists. To put it bluntly, old and new research points toward the ability to quantify intelligence (broadly defined or by IQ) and DNA (and other) analysis has shown fairly definitively that there are different clusters of humans (e.g. ethnicities and ancestral groups for those wanting to avoid the loaded 'race' category). The question remains that once people combine the two areas of research, as China is attempting to do specifically looking at the genetics of g, are we as a society equipped to handle the results regardless of what they might be (especially if differences appear)? Will nationalism of the kind focused on celebrating a shared culture be instead directed toward war-like nationalism focused on extermination of those with traits that are not desired (by some group)? His blanket negative statements on anything tribal related—be that racism, nationalism, endogamy, etc.—cloud useful insights and suggestions that could be gleaned by a more nuanced position. [image error]	Different statistics for admixture from Schaefer, 2016. Reich could have included a paragraph or two on comparison between methods.
In an individualistic society, ethnic history reminds us of the enduring consequences of centuries-old cultural patterns into which each individual is born. […] It is not personal merit but simply good fortune to be born into a group whose values and skills make life easier to cope with.[…]Substantial reshuffling of the rankings of nations and races at different stages of history undermine genetic explanations in general. A reshuffling of the IQ rankings of American ethnic groups within a period of half a century26 undermines the theory of genetic determination of intelligence, even aside from questions about the tests themselves. The fact that black orphans raised by white families have IQs at or above the national average27 is even stronger evidence against that theory. — Thomas Sowell, Ethnic America.
Thomas Sowell in Ethnic America appears to attribute many of the differences between ethnic groups to differences in culture and notes that persistent disparities between African-Americans/Hispanics and Caucasian-descent/Asians need to be explained. In his famous How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement? and subsequent essays and books, Arthur Jensen proposes that IQ is heritable. The Bell Curve, Levin's thought-provoking Why Race Matters, and many others point toward potential genetic differences between groups. Reich somewhat addresses this field of research but does so haphazardly and at times commits the same errors as he accuses other of, e.g. when criticizing Watson and others, he notes that there is no genetic evidence of different IQ of (sub-Saharan) Africans, ignoring the evidence that there is a lower IQ (but that we don't yet know the genetic origin). He offers the following solution to deal with the fallout of finding differences between human groups:
The right way to deal with the inevitable discovery of substantial differences across populations is to realize that their existence should not affect the way we conduct ourselves. As a society we should commit to according everyone equal rights despite the differences that exist among individuals. If we aspire to treat all individuals with respect regardless of the extraordinary differences that exist among individuals within a population, it should not be so much more of an effort to accommodate the smaller but still significant average differences across populations. — David Reich, Who We Are and How We Got Here.
Given human nature toward tribalism and noticing differences, this is a naïve solution. It would have been nice for him to at least briefly note how this type of thinking jives with how humans behave in the real, non-utopian world. Seeing as he makes mention of the misuse of archeology in the past by National Socialists and others, this is not too much to ask. There are many other gaps along these lines that he should have addressed, but instead danced around or ignored.=======Full review: http://bahanonu.com/syscarut/articles/204/."
10,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172572-lemar,5,David Reich comes off as a sincere guy who loves his work: a puzzle master of human ancestry who is among the first with previously missing pieces. The book explains the methods and the subtle art of obtaining and analyzing ancient DNA using the whole genome. This sequencing illuminates far more than mitochondrial DNA or Y-chromosome research could. If you’re still with me you’ll love this book! 
11,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,5,"Not so long ago, Mayan script could not be read. It was not really until the 1970's that enough was understood to learn many of the most significant facts about the Mayan history, pre-European contact. Prior to that time, there were prominent researchers who thought that the ancient Mayan civilization was a peaceful one. Some even thought that the apparent ruined cities were actually just religious centers, which the Mayans would go to only occasionally, for ceremonies. Once the Mayan script was readable, it became apparent that the Mayan civilization was actually a lot more like ancient Greece or Renaissance Italy, with multiple warring city-states that would engage in a nearly endless series of alliances, wars, and betrayals. The archaeology could help inform this history, but it couldn't provide it in the first place; you needed to be able to read the script.So it is with the study of prehistoric times, but the script in question is not one invented by humans, but rather one that invented humans: DNA. Archaeologists, linguists, biologists, and others have all provided valuable information about what our human, or proto-human, ancestors did or didn't do in the past. But, until recently, we couldn't actually read the DNA of the mummies, frozen corpses, or bog sacrifices which came to light from time to time. David Reich is one of the first generation of researchers who can. Hold on to your hat, we are in for a whirlwind of change and an avalanche of new findings.My personal favorite: it appears that the blond, blue-eyed, pale-skinned northern European is not a ""pure"" race, Aryan or anything else, but rather the result of a mixture of three races. One, was brown skinned and brown eyed, but with blond hair. One, was brown skinned and black haired, but with blue eyes. The third, was brown eyed and black haired, with pale skin.Reich successfully covers a heck of a lot of ground, here, in a readable and even enjoyable way. Neanderthals (and other homo-but-not-sapien species), the Indian subcontinent and castes, the origins of the Indo-Europeans, how many groups came across the Bering Strait to become the ancestors of the Native Americans, the many leavings (and occasional returns) of humans to sub-Saharan Africa (and what was happening with the people who stayed there), the settling of east Asia, and a whole host of ethical and political issues.An example: if you get people to voluntarily donate their DNA, for the explicit purpose of using it in scientific research, taking care to get informed consent forms signed, and then their tribe announces that they do not give consent for anyone in their tribe to take part in such research, what do you do? Ignore the issue of tribal-level consent, or deny the individuals the same right to self-determination (on having their DNA sequenced) that you would give any white person? These donors took the time to donate a DNA sample and fill out the paperwork, after all, with the expectation that it would advance science; telling them it won't be used after all is sort of breaking your promise. There are no easy answers here, and there's a lot of icky history with regard to the science of genetics, and the field of research into Native American tribe's ancestors. Reich does a good job of discussing the issues in a thoughtful way.In fact, that kind of encapsulates a lot of the issues with DNA research. We like to think of ourselves as individuals, with the right to know ourselves, but anyone who has looked into the issue of how DNA testing interacts with adoption, or infidelity, or genetic susceptibility to disease, encounters the fact that allowing one person to get the data, denies anyone related (or theoretically related) to them the option of not doing that, or keeping it private if they do. We share DNA. It ties us, and our histories and our decisions, together, even when we would rather it did not. Knowing something about your DNA, tells you something about mine as well. Not being allowed to know about your ancestors, denies me the ability to know something about mine (because we're all related, eventually). As the evidence so far shows, we have been splitting into different races, and then mixing again, for a long long time, and it has happened on every continent, multiple times.There is also a great deal of discussion about the different things we learn from mitochondrial DNA (inherited from the mother only), Y chromosomes (inherited from the father only), and the rest of our DNA. Looking at all three types of data can tell us things we don't always like to hear about. Like, for example, tales of all of the men in a region being exterminated by the invaders, but the women appear to have survived and reproduced. It is hard to believe that most of that did not resemble ancient tales of rape and pillage. We are, all of us, descended from people who did some very bad things.Oh, and for you ""Highlander"" fans, you will be happy to know that the Kurgan people are, in fact, probably the ones who spread the Indo-European languages across two continents.I also want to point out that Reich makes excellent use of visuals to tell a complex story (or more than one). Maps,, timelines, and all manner of diagrams help us to follow the multiple splitting and merging events, and when and where they happened.Reich admits early on that much of what he has to tell us, could be modified by more discoveries in the near future, but what we know already is enough to think on for many days. On the whole, though, what we have gotten from this new science so far, is a glimpse into a distant past, well before written history, that was as full of drama and tragedy, adventure and violence and sex as any opera or ancient Greek epic. It was all forgotten, entirely 100% forgotten and lost, for millennia. Until now. Now, like the skeleton in the closet of the human family's old house, it is all coming out."

The topic was of interest and I hoped (unreasonably, it seems) that it would improve as I read. It did not. I fell asleep repeatedly trying to read it. I was thrilled to finish. Why? This is a textbook-like survey of the author’s work using whole DNA as opposed to Y DNA or mitochondrial DNA to analyze ancient bones in an effort to uncover the origin of modern humans. The process is incredibly technical and is really a mathematical exercise using statistical models on decoded DNA. So you’re going to read a lot about statistical tests, models used to analyze migrations of ancient humans, and the challenges inherent in such work. This scientist is less interested in the narrative of human history as it is uncovered by his work and much more devoted to finding new laboratory models. The introduction was interesting as he laid the foundation for the work to come. But then it deteriorated into an incredible boring tome, broken up occasionally by a useful insight or fact (the presence of “ghost species” being one). Each chapter in the main section of the book was a discrete exploration of specific geographic ranges and what has been found in the DNA there. So there is a section on Europe (Eurasian), India, Africa, Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, East Asia ... with little to connect any of it unless you can recall the mind-numbing detail from a prior chapter. Even the diagrams aren’t especially helpful. The later chapters, exploring the political and social ramifications of his work — “race”, gender, health risks, future research — were edifying but not enough to redeem the rest of it. My expectation was for a book similar to “Sapiens” in that it would provide a narrative that helped lay people understand those migrations, interbreeding of long-lost human species, the scope of human history revealed by DNA. Nope. That is not how this read. Mostly, he walked the reader through the technical processes that enabled him to reach some conclusions, the big one being: Humans are impure. A mixed up species with a bunch of other species hidden in our genes. He does challenge the current orthodoxy that populations may have genetic dispositions to certain traits, behaviors, talents. Today’s belief system is built on denying that populations can have genetic differences, primarily because in the past that has been used to discriminate based on “race”. He pushes the reader to realize that we are already finding those differences and will need to have a moral and ethical means to accept those differences without using them as an excuse to reject others. His discussion of the role of male power in spreading genetic material into populations that were different from them was disturbing in that he completely ignores the reality that much of this “spreading” was the result of raping conquered women. The result is that there is a lot of diversity in the female line of humans and not much in the male. The men who succeeded in leaving their Y chromosomes throughout the world were the ones who were most aggressive and violent as they displaced more peaceful men during human migrations. The implications of this to human history are vital... but he insists on referring to these people as “couples”, as if women always had a voice in choosing those men. He makes that assumption with Thomas Jefferson as well, when discussing race in the U.S. and how so many African Americans came to have Eurasian/European genetic material in them. Understanding the evolution of modern humans can lead us to a deeper understanding our how our species behaves even today. We will need to look to archeologists and anthropologists for those insights and narratives. Hopefully, they will be able to understand the work of people like this author and to be able to challenge it when appropriate. This book won’t be much help unless they first take a lot of courses in DNA science and statistics. If you, like me, are not thrilled with statistics, avoid this book. The author could have made his points in a book half the size."
13,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48011083-steve,4,"I selected this book expecting a straightforward review of the current science regarding the development of our species. While Professor Reich largely met this expectation, he unfortunately delved into the politics that seems inextricably and unfortunately attached to genetic studies today; I had hoped, in error it turns out, to have left this debate behind with Michael Staub’s The Mismeasure of Minds. I’ve mentioned previously that genetic researchers seem to be walking a tightrope; one politically incorrect statement, one unpalatable observation, whatever the scientific merit, and their career is possibly ended. Professor Reich, however, makes a strong case for the pursuit of truth despite the risks; if it were me, I’d avoid the field entirely.I conclude from this work that we as individuals are the product of a far greater degree of genetic admixture than previously acknowledged. Rather than single branches developing off a common trunk, Professor Reich notes we have developed through an interlaced latticework; societies have migrated far and wide, some notable recent groups even leaving no current trace of their existence, referred to in the field as ghost populations. These findings puncture forcefully the notion of racial purity, indeed purity of any sort; this world is one giant blender of DNA.An asymmetry came to mind in reading this book. I thought about how much we seem concerned for our ancestors, the desire for our own personal stories, and how little we are concerned for our future generations. I’m fairly certain my ancestors in the 1700s paid zero mind to me; so why am I so interested in them. Why is it we spend so little energy thinking of the generations to come and so much thinking of the generations that preceded?"
14,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,4,"Good book. These science books can be hard to judge since the field changes so quickly and since each author peddles his or her own theories and research on the origins of humanity and how humanity moved around. I don’t have the science background to assess whether the research is valid, so I won’t comment. That said, the book seemed well organized chapter wise and was a fairly quick read. The writing was readable and wasn’t too tedious, a nice bonus with scientist books. The content seemed all right. Nothing out of the range of probable possibilities though the author seemed determined to salt the narrative with his own editorial comments amidst the research. His arguments seemed reasonable enough and I did learn new information. So, the book was a bit better than expected.  All in all, I give this a 4. It’s interesting on the whole and the writing is clear and readable. Aside from over editorializing, the book was pretty reasonable with the material and arguments presented. Good contribution to science.  "
15,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3038974-steve-van-slyke,5,"Having read earlier books on this topic by Svante Paabo, Spencer Wells and others I was anxious to read something current. I wasn't disappointed. This, as others have said, is an excellent summary of the state of genetic research using ancient DNA to determine how we all got to where we are today. The only downside is that the rate of advancement in the field--as the author states--is so high at the moment that unless you read this within two to three years of publication it may well be out of date.The author emphasizes the importance of ""whole genome"" research, pointing out that the companies providing genetic information to the public today are primarily using only mitochondrial and Y-chromosome DNA, which only tell the story of two lineages out of thousands.Some key points for me were that the history of humankind is not like a tree with branches that separate and never rejoin. Ancient DNA has revealed that it is more like a trellis or a braided stream where lineages branch off but then often merge at some later point, Homo sapiens and Neanderthals being just one example of many.Another interesting point was that Northern Europeans are more closely related to Native Americans than they are to East Asians. This is due to an ancient population of north Eurasians that no longer exist, but when they did they spread west and east across Europe and Siberia and thus contributed ancestry to the people that left northeast Asia to cross Beringia as well as modern north Europeans. Similar stories are recounted for other modern day groups such as those from India and Oceania.One final story of personal interest is that ancient DNA research has revealed that the sub-Saharan tribe that is most closely related to all non-African people today are the Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania. Coincidentally I was in Tanzania a little over a year ago and had the pleasure of going on a hunt with a small band of Hadza men. They are rapidly being squeezed out of their ancestral hunting territories and number less than 1500 individuals today, so it was very special to spend a day with them.This is a very worthwhile read, but don't leave it your bookshelf unread for too long."

As we continue to do genetic work, we keep encountering more and more patterns that reflect the extraordinary impact this interbreeding has had on the genomes of people living today.... ""Were the Neanderthals the only archaic humans who interbred with our ancestors? Or were there other major hybridizations in our past?"" (The test I took revealed a 4% Neanderthal components to my genetics.)Page 59 - ""The Denisova discovery proved that interbreeding between archaic and modern humans during the migration of modern humans from Africa and the Near East was not a freak event. So far, DNA from two archaic human populations--Neanderthals and Denisovans--has been sequenced, and in both cases, the data made it possible to detect hybridization ... that had been previously unknown. I would not be surprised if DNA sequenced from the next newly discovered archaic population will also point to a previously unknown hybridization event.""Page 62 - "" ... the archaic people who interbred with the ancestors of New Guineans were not close relative of the Siberian Denisovans. When we examined the genomes of present-day New Guineans and Australians ... we discovered ... a population split that occurred 400,000 to 280,000 years ago. This meant that the ancestors of the Siberian Denisovans separated from the Denisovan lineage that contributed ancestry to New Guineans two-thirds of the way back to the separation of the ancestors of Denisovans from Neanderthals.... ""Most likely there are other Denisovan populations as well that we haven't sampled at all. Maybe we should even consider Neanderthals as part of this broad Denisonvan family.Page 95 - ""The high differentiation of human populations in the Near East ten thousand years ago was a specific instance of a broader pattern across the vast region of West Eurasia ... there were at least four major populations ... farmers of the Fertile Crescent, the farmers of Iran, the hunter-gatherers of central and western Europe, and the hunter-gatherers of eastern Europe. All these populations differed from one another as much as Europeans differ from East Asians today. Scholars ... had they lived ten thousand years ago, would have categorized these groups as 'races,' even though nome of these groups survives in unmixed form today.""... ""The fusion of these highly different populations into today's West Eurasians is vividly evident in what might be considered the classic northern European look: blue eyes, light skin, and blond hair. Analysis of ancient DNA data shows that western European hunter-gatherers around eight thousand years ago had blue eyes but dark skin and dark hair, a combination that is rare today. The first farmers of Europe mostly had light skin but dark hair and brown eyes--thus light skin in Europe largely owes its origins to migrating farmers. The earliest known example of the classic European blond hair mutation is in an Ancient North Eurasian from the Lake Baikal region of eastern Siberia from seventeen thousand years ago. The hundreds of millions of copies of this mutation in central and western Europe today likely derive from a massive migration into the region of people bearing Ancient North Eurasian ancestry, an event that is related in the next chapter. ""Surprisingly, the ancient DNA revolution, through its discovery of the pervasiveness of ghost populations and their mixture, is fueling a critique of race ... By demonstrating that the genetic fault lines in West Eurasia between ten thousand and four thousand years ago were entirely different from today's, the ancient DNA revolution has shown that today's classification do not reflect fundamental 'pure' units of biology. Instead, today's divisions are recent phenomena ...""Page 156 - ""If there is anything that scholars studying the history of humans in the Americas agree on, it is that the span of human occupation of the New World has been the blink of an eye relative to the extraordinary length of human occupation of Africa and Eurasia. ...

(See Dewar's Bones for perspective Bones: Discovering the First Americans page 171 - ""The first genome-scale study of Native American population history came in 2012, when my laboratory published data on fifty-two diverse populations. A major limitation of the study was that we had no samples at all from the lower forth-eight states of the United States because of anxieties about genetic research on Native Americans ... ""Most of the individuals we studied derived small fractions of their genomes from African or European ancestors in their genomes ... especially in Canada, all the individuals we sampled had at least some non-Native American ancestry. "" ... For forty-seven of the fifty-two populations, we could not detect differences in their relatedness to Asians. This suggested to us that the vast majority of Native Americans today; including all those from Mexico southward, as well as populations from eastern Canada, descend from a single common lineage. (Five remaining populations, all from the Arctic or the Pacific Northwest coast of Alaska and Canada, also had evidence of ancestry from different lineages.) Thus the extraordinary physical differences among Native American groups today are due to evolution since splitting from a common ancestral population, not to immigration from different sources in Eurasia.Page 176 - ""Population Y - The next card dealt from the genetic deck was a complete surprise--at least to us geneticists."" ... an approximately 11,500-year-old skeleton ... found in Brazil ... more similar to those of indigenous peoples from Australia and New Guinea than to ...

""It really looked like evidence of a migration into the Americas of an ancient population more closely related to Australians, New Guineans, and Andamanese than to present-day Siberians.

My analyses revealed that the Chukchi harbor around 40 percent First American ancestry due to backflow from America to Asia. ... the genetic data clarify that the affinity is due to back-migration, as the Chucki are more closely related to some populations of entirely First American ancestry than to others, a finding that can only be explained if a sublineage of First Americans that originated well after the initial diversification of First American lineages in North America migrated back to Asia. The explanation for this observation is that the Eskimo-Aleut speakerswho established themselves in North America mixed heavily with local Native Americans (who contributed about half their ancestry) and then took their successful way of life back through the Arctic with them to Siberia ... a type of finding that is difficult to prove with archaeology--is the kind of surprise that genetics is in a unique position to deliver."""
18,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2736147-riju-ganguly,2,"This book may well go down as one of the classics of our times. Unfortunately, for me the book was considerably disappointing, despite the wealth of information and concepts that it describes. Reason behind that feeling had been summed up by the author himself at the end of the book: the study of ancient DNA, and thus this book, had been almost entirely Eurocentric.Also, the book turned out to be rather unnecessarily ruminating over philosophical aspects of various findings, while the same ground had been covered by Yuval Noah Harari and Carl Zimmer in their astonishing works in a far more interesting and dramatic manner. It seems that top-notch scientists, even while talking about their own findings and implications, tend to be somewhat conservative and boring.Last but not the least, while devoting chapter after chapter on Europe and Neanderthals or their absence, the book exhausts India in thirty odd pages. In that single chapter it tries to capture the issues of caste, genetics, movements within the sub-continent and sundry others, while glossing over key issues like:1. Who were Harappans?2. What might have happened to them?These issues have considerably dampened my enthusiasm in this area. It seems, as mentioned by that old saying, I would have to keep searching for a better, more reliable and focused book on the study of ancient DNA and its findings.CHARAIVETI."

As a one-stop guide for catching up with the ancient DNA revolution, it is unequaled. It is also a refreshingly honest look into the life of a practicing prominent scientist in the age of large research labs and giant research consortiums. Coming along for the ride are some lucid explanations of many of the statistical tests used in ancestry mapping, like the Four Populations Test, and methods used to estimate the dates of admixture events. For any outsider to the field who wants to be able to read the flood of research on ancient genomics with more comprehension, this is a valuable introduction. An incomplete list of some prominent themes with illustrative quotes:1. The most central theme of the book is probably the  immense power of ancient DNA as a way to understand the past.  Reich views it as more powerful than radiocarbon dating, the most important scientific advance in archeology:		* ""These advances mean that whole-genome study of ancient DNA no longer requires screening large numbers of skeletal remains before it is possible to find a few individuals whose DNA can be analyzed. Instead, a substantial fraction of screened samples dating to the last ten thousand years can now be converted to working genome-wide data. The new methods have made it possible to analyze hundreds of samples in a single study. With such data, it is possible to reconstruct population changes in exquisite detail, transforming our understanding of the past.""		* ""These days, human genome variation has surpassed the traditional toolkit of archaeology—the study of the artifacts left behind by past societies—in what it can reveal of changes in human populations in the deep""2.  There has been Neanderthal, Denisovan, and other Archaic Human admixture into many extant human populations, with proportions and sources varying for different populations.  		* It seems very likely that some genes in those admixture events were advantageous and have subsequently been selected for, while others have experienced have strong selection against them:			* ""One of the most striking genomic discoveries of the past few years is a mutation in a gene that is active in red blood cells and that allows people who live in high-altitude Tibet to thrive in their oxygen-poor environment. Rasmus Nielsen and colleagues have shown that the segment of DNA on which this mutation occurs matches much more closely to the Siberian Denisovan genome than to DNA from Neanderthals or present-day Africans.21 This suggests that some Denisovan relatives in mainland Asia may have harbored an adaptation to high altitude, which the ancestors of Tibetans inherited through Denisovan interbreeding. Archaeological evidence shows that the first inhabitants of the Tibetan high plateau began living there seasonally after eleven thousand years ago, and that permanent occupation based on agriculture began around thirty-six hundred years ago.22 It is likely that the mutation increased rapidly in frequency only after these dates, a prediction that will be possible to test directly through DNA studies of ancient Tibetans.""			* ""at genes associated with the biology of keratin proteins, present-day Europeans and East Asians have inherited much more Neanderthal ancestry on average than is the case for most other groups of genes.23 This suggests that versions of keratin biology genes carried by Neanderthals were preserved in non-Africans by the pressures of natural selection, perhaps because keratin is an essential ingredient of skin and hair, which are important for providing protection from the elements in cold environments such as the ones that modern humans were moving into and to which Neanderthals were already adapted.""3.  Currently extant human populations roughly match folk notions of race but in a deep sense are themselves the result of many admixture events in the distant past.  That is, while Europeans are quite distinct from East Asians, who are themselves quite distinct from Native Americans/Amerindians, these continental groups are themselves the results of admixture events from previously distinct populations, who were themselves the result of mixture events. In other words, we [humans] are a mix all the way down. 		* ""Today, the peoples of West Eurasia—the vast region spanning Europe, the Near East, and much of central Asia—are genetically highly similar. The physical similarity of West Eurasian populations was recognized in the eighteenth century by scholars who classified the people of West Eurasia as “Caucasoids” to differentiate them from East Asian “Mongoloids,” sub-Saharan African “Negroids,” and “Australoids” of Australia and New Guinea. In the 2000s, whole-genome data emerged as a more powerful way to cluster present-day human populations than physical features.""		* ""Measured in this way, populations within West Eurasia are typically around seven times more similar to one another than West Eurasians are to East Asians. When frequencies of mutations are plotted on a map, West Eurasia appears homogeneous, from the Atlantic façade of Europe to the steppes of central Asia. There is a sharp gradient of change in central Asia before another region of homogeneity is reached in East Asia.""		* ""What we had found was evidence that people in northern Europe, such as the French, are descended from a mixture of populations, one of which shared more ancestry with present-day Native Americans than with any other population living today.""		*  ""Instead of a tree, a better metaphor may be a trellis, branching and remixing far back into the past. "" (7)  4.  Contrary to post WWII anthropology's consensus, at least some of the great cultural transitions that occurred in the archaeological record were the result of population replacement, not just the cultural propagation of new ideas and technologies.  This partially validates the predictions of some old-school (and often racist) anthropologists who thought genocide and conquering (ala Conan the Barbarian's line [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PQ63...] ) was the most common cause of drastic change in the archaeological record but the deep origins of human populations as fundamentally mixed kind of pushes back against many of their other claims.		* "" The discovery that the Corded Ware culture reflected a mass migration of people into central Europe from the steppe was not just a sterile academic finding. It had political and historical resonance. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the German archaeologist Gustaf Kossinna was among the first to articulate the idea that cultures of the past that were spread across large geographic regions could be recognized through similarities in style of the artifacts they left behind. He also went further in viewing archaeologically identified cultures as synonymous with peoples, and he originated the idea that the spread of material culture could be used to trace ancient migrations, an approach he called the siedlungsarchäologische Methode, or “Settlement Archaeology.” ... Kossinna suggested that the cultural roots of the Germans and of Germanic languages today lay in the Corded Ware culture. In his essay “The Borderland of Eastern Germany: Home Territory of the Germans,” he argued that because the Corded Ware culture included the territories of Poland, Czechoslovakia, and western Russia of his day, it gave Germans the moral birthright to claim those regions as their own. "" 		* ""migrating farmers whose ancestors originated in the Near East spread over Europe with little mixture with the hunter-gatherers they encountered along the way, a sharp contrast to Luca Cavalli-Sforza’s model for the farming expansion into Europe that had been popular until this time and that emphasized extensive mixture and interaction with the local hunter-gatherers during the expansion. .""		* ""The extraordinary fact that emerges from ancient DNA is that just five thousand years ago, the people who are now the primary ancestors of all extant northern Europeans had not yet arrived""		* ""Prior to the explosion of ancient DNA data in 2015, most archaeologists found it inconceivable that the genetic changes associated with the spread of the Yamnaya culture could be as dramatic as the archaeological changes. ""5.  In an understandable but misguided (in Reich's view)) effort to push back against racism, many population geneticists and anthropologists have been mealy-mouthed/deceptive about what DNA actually reveals about population structure by saying mathematically true but deceptive statements, using unfamiliar words like ancestry or population structure to refer to traditional notions of race, and avoiding the issue entirely.  He views Lewontin, Gould and others as falling in this camp of 'deceptive with good intentions', and thinks that scientists should discuss the issue more head-on, as doing otherwise will concede the issue to scientists or informed bloggers who are less averse to speaking openly and speculatively on race. 		* Examples of political considerations impacting science:			* ""While we were in the final stages of preparing a paper for submission in 2015, one of the German archaeologists who contributed skeletal samples wrote a letter to all coauthors: “We must(!) avoid…being compared with the so called ‘siedlungsarchäologische Methode’ from Gustaf Kossinna!” He and several contributors then resigned as authors""			* ""At the time I felt that we were being prevented by political considerations from revealing what we had found.""			* ""At a workshop on genetic studies of Native Americans that I attended in 2013, multiple researchers stood up from the audience to say that the response of the Karitiana, Havasupai, Navajo, and others had made them too wary to do any research Native Americans (including disease research)....the withdrawal of Navajo samples from out study was distressing, since they were among those with the very best documentation of informed consent..these individuals personals decisions to participate in the study were overruled by the tribal council's moratorium nine years later. "" *""I have deep sympathy for the concern that genetic discoveries about differences among populations may be misused to justify racism. But it is precisely because of this sympathy that I am worried that people who deny the possibility of substantial biological differences among populations across a range of traits are digging themselves into an indefensible position, one that will not survive the onslaught of science. In the last couple of decades, most populations geneticists have sought to avoid contradicting the orthodoxy. When asked about the possibility of biological differences among human populations, we have tended to obfuscate.."" * ""To understand why it is no longer an option for geneticists to lock arms with anthropologists and imply that any differences among human populations are so modest that they can be ignored, go no further than the 'genome bloggers'...take pleasure in pointing out contradictions between the politically correct messages academics often give about the indistinguishability of traits across populations and their papers showing that this is not the way the science is heading. ""6.  One of the most interesting findings from ancient genomics is using ancient DNA to infer social inequality in admixture events by seeing relative diversity in mitochondrial (maternally transmitted only) DNA versus more homogenity in Y chromosomes (paternally transmitted only).  Lots of mt-DNA in conjunction with only a few Y chromosomes implies a few men with many corresponding females, a marker of sexual inequality (via polygamy) and social inequality (the ability of a few men to monopolize the available women). This pattern is seen in many population replacements or admixture events:		* ""mixtures of highly divergent groups have happened time and again, homogenizing populations just as divergent from one another as Europeans, Africans, and Naive Americans. And in many of these great admixtures, a central theme has been the coupling of men with social power in one population and women from the other. "" 		* ""Comparison of Y-chromosome and mitochondrial DNA types that are highly different in frequency between African-Americans and Europeans also shows that by far the majority of the European ancestry in these populations comes from males, the result of social inequality in which mixed-race couplings were primarily between free males and females slaves...contribution of European American men to the genetic makeup of the present-day African American population is about 4 times that of the European American women....sociologist Orlando Patterson, he pointed out that fraction of the European ancestry in African Americans that came from males-- which if different from half is called ''sex bias""-- must have been far greater during the time of slavery. Since the civil rights movement in the USA in the mid-20th century, cultural changes have caused the sex bias to reverse, with more coupling between black men and white women. If we carried out DNA studies of African American skeletons from a hundred years ago, there is every reason to expect an even greater sex bias. ""		* ""sex bias has been central to the history of our species. ""		* ""great variability among males in the number of offspring produced means that by searching for genomic signatures of past variability in the number of children men have had, we can obtain genetic insights into the degree of social inequality in society as a whole, and not just between males and females. ""		* ""Star Cluster analysis provides objective information about the importance of extreme inequalities in power at different points in the past. ""		* ""on the Y chromosome, the studies found a pattern that was strikingly different. IN East Asians, Europeans, Near Easterners, and North Africans, the authors found many Star Clusters with common male ancestors living roughly 5 thousand years ago...powerful males in this period left an extraordinary impact on the populations that followed them-- more than in any previous period-- with some bequeathing DNA to more descendants today than Ghengis Khan. "" 	*  Miscellaneous notes I took on themes  	1. Neanderthal and out-of-Africa humans mixed and male offspring had reduced fertility	2. We're mixes all the way down	3. There can be REALLY strong endogamy for thousands of years: Ari ethnic group in Ethiopia, caste system in India,	4. Inequality between sexes and within societies has a genetic proxy: inbalance between male and female ancestry-- find this with Star Cluster Analysis		* Yamnayo are BIG in this. 	5. Ancient DNA is revealing TONS of surprises...	6. Reich consistently points out places where he got stuff wrong or changed his mind	* used to be strong proponent of Mitochondrial Eve hypothesis and Out of Africa Hypothesis	* didn't believe Excoffier on lower fertility of Neanderthal-Human hybridsHighly recommended book!Some flaws that I'm not qualified to speculate overmuch on:Mainly, Reich is very dismissive of research outside genetics on the question of average phenotypic differences between groups as any kind of evidence for or against average genetic differences. I'm obviously not an expert on this, but head to Twitter to see smarter people duking it out on this or wait for more reviews from actual scientists...He also has a few throwaway suggestions on the moral imperative to treat individuals as individuals, and not let any conclusions we come to in the future on groups impact individual treatment. His suggestions are so uncontroversial and obvious (like his suggestion to measure phenotype instead of using genotype to predict phenotype) that I'm unsure if he meant them as serious suggestions as opposed to platitudes. For one, Stephen Pinker has made the same argument with the same reasoning in 'The Blank Slate' at least a decade before Reich, as have serious thinkers from all political sides for the last 50 years. So that's not exactly something we needed genetic evidence to remind us of. So don't expect political radicalism from this book-- which is a good thing, IMO."

And yet--the present San people of southern Africa split off from West Africans and all the rest of us, 300,000-250,000 years ago. These two claims can't both be true. He says nothing about the contradiction. pp. 2, 13.Assumes each mutation (any change from one letter--A, G, C, or T--to any of the other three) happened only once, so all of us who have it, descend from one person. p. 18. Seems to me an unwarranted assumption.""Across chromosomes 1-22, the most recent shared ancestor for all present-day people ranges mostly between 5 million and 1 million years ago, and nowhere is it estimated to be more recent than 320,000 years ago."" p. 16. Chromosomes aren't all passed whole from parent to child. Your parents each got 23 chromosomes from each of their parents. But your parents didn't give you a full copy of one or the other grandparental version of every chromosome. Instead the 23 chromosomes you got from your mother were assembled from, on average, 68 chunks of DNA, each chunk being all or part of a chromosome from one or other of her parents. (Her 23 chromosomes were snipped in, on average, a total of 45 places.) The 23 sperm chromosomes were cut in, on average, 26 places. So your dad bequeathed you 49 chunks of DNA, each chunk from one or the other of his parents. There's also mitochondrial DNA (maternal). In all you have about 118 DNA chunks, each from one of your grandparents. (46 chromosomes + mitochondrial DNA + about 71 chromosome cuts).The splices can be in different places in successive generations. p. 11. So from g generations back, you inherited a total of 47 + 71(g - 1) chunks of DNA. The author says this wrong on page 12, ""118 DNA stretches one generation back, 189 two generations back, … ."" But the 118 chunks are already from your grandparents.This means the maximum number of your ancestors, g generations back, who could have contributed DNA to you is the lesser of:2^g, or47 + 71(g - 1), orthe world population at the time:https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i... https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i... Does not mention the Toba volcanic eruption around 70,000 years ago that killed very nearly all humans. Writing on human prehistory, how can you not?https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toba_... Ascribes too much to DNA as a cause: ""In 2010, geneticists analyzed genomes of 180,000 people with measured heights, and found 180 genetic changes that are more common in shorter people. This means that these changes, or ones nearby, contribute directly to reduced height. In 2012, a study showed that at the 180 changes, southern Europeans tend to have the versions that reduce height … the only explanation is natural selection for increased height in northern Europeans or decreased height in southern Europeans."" p. 19. No, southern Europe is also poorer. Childhood nutrition has a tremendous effect on height. One example: during WWII, German taking of French crops malnourished the French: average height of boys dropped by 7 centimeters (2.75 inches), and of girls by 11 centimeters (4.33 inches). Antony Beevor, /The Second World War/, p. 425. Having southern European DNA is /correlated/ to lower height. Doesn't prove a cause.Again: ""A 2016 study analyzed the genomes of several thousand present-day Britons and found natural selection for increased height, blonder hair, bluer eyes, larger infant head size …"" p. 20. These were the Danes and Norse who conquered Britain! They conquered not because they had blond hair, nor even because they were tall, but because they were desperate. Britons succumbed not because they were brown-haired, nor even because they were short, but because they for centuries thrived by farming and herding, without having to hack their neighbors to bits. So they weren't ready to repel even the much-less-numerous Norse.If the conquerors' descendants have been lording it ever since, it need not be because of their inherited DNA, but because of their inherited status.The author overreaches, finding DNA as the cause of everything. You need other sources; the book is inadequate:Restriction sites are places where researchers snip the genome. The DNA-fragment-ends next to (associated with) these sites, Restriction-site-Associated DNA (RAD) are pieces researchers compare, one genome to another:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restr... He assumes that the mutation rate--probability of a random genetic change, per generation, per location in the genome--is the same everywhere in the genome. AND that all those changes are still there, everywhere in the genome. To the contrary, mutations that happen in a location that codes for an essential protein, and cause the failure of that function, /cannot/ persist. By contrast, mutations in the large stretches of so-called ""junk DNA"" that seem not to code for proteins, all stay. So the author's claim that we all got our mitochondria from one woman who lived 160,000 years ago, and our Y chromosomes from a man who lived similarly recently, while the rest of our genome comes from multiple ancestors living millions of years ago--seems to rest on misinterpreted data.The large chromosomes have genetic space to accumulate any mutations that occur, without damage to the organism. The mitochondria and Y chromosome don't.The similarities of everyone's mitochondria and Y chromosomes need not mean a recent ancestor, but rather nonsurvival of mutations.There can be persisting mutations only where they don't hurt the organism. Anything essential can't randomly mutate and survive.As in, the overall mechanism of protein synthesis is fundamental to life, and so is universally conserved with only trivial differences between humans and hydrothermal bacteria. --The Vital Question: Energy, Evolution, and the Origins of Complex Life, Nick Lane, chapter 4, footnote 1, p. 123 of 360The mutation rate is assumed to be 1.25*10^-8 per generation ""per site,"" they don't say what a site is: Sheehan, Harris, & Song, p. 656.

The math leading to the author's estimates of antiquity of most-recent shared ancestor, starts from this presumption:Assume ""each member of a generation chooses its mother at random from the previous generation, the choices of the different members being independent."" If so, two members of the same generation have a probability (1 - 1/M)^g of having different ancestors g generations back, with M mothers per generation.But the author doesn't tell us that. from Origins of the Coalescent: 1974-1982,J.

The notes are mainly just journal-article citations.Self-congratulatory tone.A few bone fragments found in Denisov Cave in the Altai Mountains in Siberia yielded DNA of 30,000-to-50,000-years-ago humans now called Denisovans. The author's team found that present-day aboriginal Australians & New Guineans have 5% Denisovan ancestry, while other Asians have a fraction of a percent, Europeans & Africans none. The author says the idea that Denisovans interbred in or near tropical Oceanea with our other ancestors is ""hard to square with an absence of artifacts or big-skulled skeletons in the region!!??"" pp. 61-62. So he thinks the interbreeding happened elsewhere. Yet even in a Siberian cave we have only a pinky bone and a tooth. No skull. No skeleton. In the tropics, or even in summer in the north woods, remains don't last long. Scavengers & decay see to it.

25,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1192324-ana,5,"I could have finished this book in 2018, but as I was approaching the end, I started to read it in smaller chunks, to make it last…What a great read! This book is basically a summary of the state of the art in terms of genetic research using ancient DNA (i.e. DNA from skeletal remains up to hundreds of thousands years old) and the use of data taken from the whole genome at once, instead of just small stretches of it, as done before, made possible technological advances that allowed the costs of the analysis to be dramatically reduced and made the extraction of DNA material from ancient bones more efficient. The discoveries made meanwhile are rapidly disrupting our assumptions about the past, as human genome variation has surpassed the traditional toolkit of archaeology (i.e. the study of artefacts left behind by past societies) in what it can revel of changes in human populations in the deep past. The main idea I took from this book was that ancient DNA has established major migration and mixture between highly divergent populations as a key force in the shaping of human prehistory, and ideologies that seek a return to a mythical purity are flying in the face of hard science. One of the interesting stories described in the book was the discovery of evidence suggesting a major West Eurasian incursion into India, which turns out politically explosive, as it implies that no group in India can claim genetic purity. Just three days ago, I read this very interesting piece at the BBC website, where this same study is mentioned, as being challenged by Hindu nationalists, for whom its results came as a shock:https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-i...This book also made it clear to me that there will be big challenges in the times to come, as these new techniques will allow research to a level of accuracy as has never been done before, into sensitive issues that society might not be prepared to handle (i.e., the inevitable discovery of substantial differences across populations).To summarise, this book is immensely interesting, it contains so much new and exciting information, it touches sensitive, thought provoking issues and it even has some fun parts. However, don’t expect a fast read. At least for me, the first two thirds f the book required full attention and sometimes re-reading of paragraphs or going back a few pages to refresh my memory about some issue needed to fully understand what I was reading. But I found it nevertheless worth it. So, if you are up to a challenging, but deeply rewarding read, go get it! But do it fast. Ancient DNA labs are now producing data so fast that the time lag between data production and publication is already longer than the time it takes to double the data in the field! So be prepared to start reading a lot about the new findings in the newspapers (such as the one mentioned above). Books like Reich’s give us the basis to better understand all that is to come."
26,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22614612-caroline,2,"At first I found it interesting to think about what we can learn from ancient DNA samples and how. But it turned out a lot of what we can learn is stuff I just don’t care about. It’s really hard for me to pay attention to a discussion of how some ancient group of people who no longer exist migrated across Eurasia 5000 years ago, and such discussions were most of the book. At the end, Reich threw in some commentary about race and inequality, which was a lot more engaging. I didn’t feel like I took much away from those sections, though."
27,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3749410-aaron-arnold,5,"This is absolutely the book to read if you're interested in genetic history, either your own or humanity's. Reich zooms out tens and hundreds of thousands of years ago, far past most Big History books, discussing how the latest research on recent discoveries of ancient DNA has begun to make sense of the vast movements of peoples in the dim unremembered mists of time from before we have written records. The rapid pace of technological advancement in genetics research, to the point where we can reconstruct detailed models of peoples we know only from scattered bone fragments, is challenging a lot of what we thought we knew about the past (did humans really evolve solely in Africa? how many waves of migration from Asia to the Americas? how recently did modern racial categories form?), and as astonishing as it is to imagine that we can track the migration and reproductive patterns of long-vanished ethnicities and even extinct subspecies like Neanderthals and Denisovans, genetics has advanced to the point where we can even identify ""ghost populations"" in our modern genomes - long-dead ancestors who have left no trace of language, settlement, or literature, but whose migrations and mixings live on in our DNA. The rapid pace of discovery in this field means many specific conclusions might be in flux, but as Reich shows, the wealth of knowledge unlocked by DNA sequencing means fields like history and anthropology already have plenty to chew on. I haven't found this kind of rigorous, sustained investigation of the deep roots of our ancestry anywhere else."

29,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9628169-charles-j,4,"We have all heard of the fad for DNA ancestry testing. Being a paranoid, I haven’t joined the crowd, because all testing companies are happy to hand over the results to the police, and what if I need to keep quiet some heinous crime I commit where I leave my DNA behind? Not to mention, what those tests claim to reveal about you is limited, in many cases, by inadequate comparison data, which the companies fill in with lies. But that lack of comparison data is swiftly being remedied, both in the present, and in the past, which is the topic of this book.David Reich is a prominent scientist in the field of ancient DNA. This means that he and his colleagues collect DNA from skeletons around the world and then slice-and-dice the data to figure who moved where from where in prehistory—and to divide people into identifiable and distinguishable groups. It is this latter enterprise that is fraught with political peril, since if groups of humans are distinguishable on a genetic basis, then it may appear that we are not all one big happy human family. Reich therefore threads the needle, with mixed success. He has no doubt that groups of humans differ in many important ways—but those aren’t necessarily the ways we think. His key point in the entire book is that all human populations are mixtures, frequently of groups we would not expect, and so theories based on the supposed historical purity of an ethnic group are inherently silly. Whether that keeps him out of controversy, we will see in this review.Reich begins with a fairly detailed description of the history and practice of DNA testing of samples from dead people. Nobody will ever accuse Reich of sparkling prose, but he competently transmits to the reader the relevant information, which is very interesting if you pay attention. Numerous very well-done maps and other visual aids complement the dense text. This science is surprisingly recent—all in the past ten years, and most of it in the past five. Thus, one of Reich’s frequently repeated points is how fast the field is changing and how the amount of data available is exponentially increasing. This does not change his conclusions, but does suggest that refinement and ever-more-narrow focus will be possible when examining human history through DNA (and, of course, that commercial DNA testing of live people will be more accurate in its results).True, the author overstates the importance of his own project, which vanity is natural, I suppose. He tells us that grasping the precise differences between Neanderthals and humans, for example, will “take an evolutionary Manhattan Project.” That doesn’t sound like a great use of resources, since last I looked into it the Neanderthals had all checked out. But Reich instead concludes “This Manhattan Project of human evolutionary biology is one to which we as a species should commit ourselves. . . . I expect that the findings will be so complicated . . . that few people will find the answer comprehensible.” Still, this “scientific question is profoundly important.” Why? Beats me. Reich doesn’t tell us.Anyway, the key scientific point is that all DNA contains mutations, and by comparing the resulting differences in sequences of DNA, it is possible both to group human populations and to roughly calculate at which point they diverged from a common ancestor. By this means a type of family tree can be constructed. Thus, for example, it is relatively easy to show not only that populations in Africa diverged from populations outside Africa about 50,000 years ago (the “out of Africa” hypothesis, now proven), but also that those outside passed through a “population bottleneck” reducing diversity, while populations in Africa never faced such a bottleneck, and therefore have more genetic diversity. (Actually, there were multiple bottlenecks—the Finns, for example, are subject to a variety of unique genetic diseases, since all are descended from two men about 3,000 years ago.) Tree, though, according to Reich, is the wrong metaphor. It is more like a trellis, as human populations combined and recombined over time, creating a tangled web of ancestry.Reich spends quite a bit of time on how we became human—that is, homo sapiens as opposed to homo neanderthalensis or one of the other proto-human lineages. The common perception is that that there was a magic switch, perhaps not due to a large black alien monolith, but still some sudden change that enabled human language and tool usage, distinguishing us not only from animals, but from all our ancestors. Although this is not a focus of his book, Reich’s says that this is unlikely, since the most recent shared common ancestor of all modern humans was about 320,000 years ago, and the “switch” was about 70,000 years ago. Thus, different groups must have “switched” independently. As Reich points out, while groups of humans differ predictably and genetically on many traits, from eye color to height, it has become clear that in most cases a large number of genes each contribute to each trait, suggesting that a simple tale of natural selection for a particular gene is not accurate (although it is for some traits, such as selection for lactose tolerance). For that reason, at least as far as we can tell, there is no one single gene that enabled us to leap beyond all our ancestors.Since everybody wants to know, Reich talks about sex with Neanderthals. Yes, they interbred with humans. Not all humans, though. Reich claims that “non-African genomes today are around 1.5 to 2.1 percent Neanderthal in origin,” a percentage that has declined linearly over time, something Reich attributes in part to hybrids potentially having reduced fertility. (African genomes contain zero Neanderthal genes, since only the populations that left Africa interacted with the Neanderthals.) The Neanderthals weren’t the only “archaic humans,” though. DNA has shown evidence of more, including the Denisovans (from DNA found in Russia) and the Flores Island “hobbits.” (And I see in the news today that an entirely new one was just discovered in the Philippines). Again, the lineage of these other archaic humans can be traced—those modern humans with the most Denisovan ancestry, for example, are found only in New Guinea, the same place where modern humans have the most Neanderthal ancestry, as it happens. In some ways this is the tip of the iceberg, because, Reich tells us, the DNA data shows evidence of “ghost populations”—precursor archaic populations of whom no skeletons have been found, even farther back in the human family tree. The evidence suggests it is possible, for example, that humans left Africa more than a million years ago, and sometime before 300,000 years ago returned to Africa, then left again in the migration we are more familiar with. Reich is certain this and many other puzzles will soon be solved, and he’s probably right.In all his analysis, Reich doesn’t rely only on DNA, fortunately—he ties in other archaeological data, and to the extent feasible, linguistic data. At the same time, he gives DNA primacy, gleefully pointing out various instances in which, he says, DNA has overturned received wisdom based on archaeology. Among these are the destruction of Nicholas Dirks’s claim that caste endogamy in India was a creation of British rule. Instead, the DNA shows ultra-strict caste endogamy, even within very narrow caste subgroups, has existed for thousands of years (although, naturally, Reich feels he has to virtue signal, noting “I find restrictions on marriage discomfiting,” even though nobody asked him, and nobody cares what his personal opinions are).Reich spends quite a bit of time on Eurasia, trying to trace the movements of peoples, and in particular focusing on the relationship of farming to different identifiable groups, noting that farming spread in part by groups replacing other groups, and partially by cultural transmission or local invention. In Europe, populations were repeatedly swept aside by others—for example, the genetics embodied by the builders of Stonehenge, around 3500 B.C., were within a thousand years nearly totally replaced by those with Eurasian steppe ancestry, the Bell Beaker people. And somewhat later, the Corded Ware people, both a culture and an identifiable genetic group, came from the steppes and replaced much of the European population in the second millennium B.C.This question of the relative importance of replacement and cultural transmission in the movement of technology is fraught, since ever since the nineteenth century brought us scientific racism, various proponents of racial purity have claimed that their ancestors replaced inferior peoples, as shown by the spread of technology, and therefore they are better and more deserving. Reich notes that the reaction to this line of thought has improperly elevated the importance of mere cultural transmission, or, put more accurately, politicized science and eroded its reliability. And, in fact, he says that German co-authors on papers of his have resigned as authors, afraid that the DNA evidence supports German racial theorists (pre-Nazi ones, but still).For all the fascination in this, Reich loses the plot when he tries to stretch his narrative beyond his competence. Some of this is simple political correctness—Reich consistently uses the annoying and inaccurate term “Native American” instead of the more accurate, and normally used in anthropology (at least until recently—I’m not sure now), term of “American Indian.” Reich kowtows to the ideology behind this propaganda repeatedly, probably because Indian tribal demands to veto harvesting and use of genetic data are a real problem for him getting the data he wants. Thus, we get abasement like “There is also an awareness that some scientists have studied Native Americans to learn about questions of interest primarily to non-Native Americans, without paying attention to the interests of Native Americans themselves.” Well, yes. Why would it be different? On the other hand, when your studies involve tearing apart the skeletons of a tribe’s ancestors so you can get at the richest source of DNA, a bone in the inner ear, I have a lot of sympathy for horrified Indian elders. We also get dumb statements like “the last five hundred years have witnessed repeated cases in which people of European ancestry have exploited the indigenous peoples of the Americas using the toolkit of Western science.” I’m not sure what those “cases” are, since none are named, though perhaps by “exploiting” he means the West blessing the natives with our toolkit of antibiotics and anesthetics.Reich also offers examples, fortunately only a few, of atrocious history. Most notably, he repeatedly cites the totally discredited 1950s anthropologist Marija Gimbutas, whose fantasy of a wholly imaginary female-led, pacifist early European culture is the stuff of comedy. (Among other silliness, she claimed that images of young girls and bulls in Minoan Crete depicted a game where happy girls jumped over bulls as part of their training in the matriarchy. What they actually showed, as real archaeologists proved, was virgins being sacrificed by being thrown to wild bulls.) Gimbutas also believed that Neolithic Eurasian cultures were peaceful, another joke disproven by Lawrence Keeley in ""War Before Civilization,"" although weirdly, still desperately believed by many. None of this really detracts from the book, but when Reich sticks to hard science, his book is a lot better.No doubt mixtures are what all humans are. Reich makes that very clear, with no wiggle room. What causes Reich his first problem is how those mixtures came about. Namely, often by conquest, and his data repeatedly confirms legends of conquest, most notably in the subjugation of the Dravidic peoples of India by people from the North, just as the Rig Veda claims. Reich tries to soften this, aware of the Nazi focus on the spread of Indo-European language by “Aryans,” and the current conflicts in India over these matters, but the facts are what the facts are, and those line up with the legends. Trying to avoid the hate patrol, he says “we groped toward a formulation that would be scientifically accurate as well as sensitive to these issues” of “cultural resonance.” Ha ha. Nicely put. So they slapped fresh labels on the relevant people, calling the invaders “Ancestral North Indians” and the conquered people “Ancestral South Indians,” said they were all mixed up in the modern era, and called it a day.Ah, but how did they get “all mixed up”? That’s where Reich’s second problem shows up. This, not discredited racial theories of pure group descent, is where Reich gets himself tied in knots. It’s easy enough to disprove racial theories, or rather racial group origin theories, since it’s now easy to prove that human populations repeatedly mix, and as I say Reich does so, covering all the continents. But the mixing isn’t uniform. Reich is just shocked, shocked, to find that two things are true. First, when populations mix, usually a very small number of men from Population A, the invaders, dominate the descendants of the mixed group. Second, the women of Population B all give it up only to men from Population A, so the genetic material of the men of Population B mostly disappears. This is true, among other places, in India, Latin America, and among descendants of those conquered by the Mongols. Who could have guessed? Not Reich, who maunders on and on about how this shows “inequality” and that most dread of maladies, “sexual dominance.” He also name-checks “sex bias” and “sexual inequality.” Welcome to the real world, where absent an opposing moral code biology dictates human action and strong men get the women, many and often. This isn’t a “genetic scar,” it’s how the world works. And it’s a bit much for a geneticist to demand “struggle” against the “demon” of “sexual inequality” because it is an “ennobling behavior”; it may be, but on what basis an atheist materialist like Reich claims that, I have no idea. (Looking at Reich’s picture, one imagines that he doesn’t think he’d come out among Population A’s winning alpha males, which may account for his snippy reaction to reality. Unlike me—I look like the Kurgan in Highlander.)And for his pièce de résistance, Reich faces, but then tries to slip by, his biggest problem. That is that racial mixing doesn’t obviate his other finding, that as of today there are distinct populations, by which Reich means “races,” and those populations have very different genetic characteristics. He admits that to say “race is a social construct” is just a total falsehood, and the work of people like Richard Lewontin purporting to show that groups cannot be legitimately distinguished has been totally falsified. The logical next question is what the differences mean for the perceptible characteristics of those populations. Some are merely cosmetic, but are there others? Certainly there are—Reich himself notes many, such as height, tolerance of high altitudes, and so forth. How about others, such as general intelligence?This is the third rail of genetic research, though, understandably. True, the modern groups discerned by DNA testing don’t line up with the old racial groupings, or at least not completely, due to the extensive mixing in relatively recent history that Reich documents. But the visceral reaction against these types of claims usually prevents any admission of them. It even prevents wholly legitimate medical research that might be of profound help to some population groups. Reich narrates various demands to censor his and others’ genetic research, among other things citing a Northwestern political scientist who is demanding that Congress pass a law banning the publication of any federally-funded research (i.e., almost all of it) that even mentions “genetics associated with variables of race, ethnicity, nationality, or any other category of population that is observed or imagined as heritable.”I personally find it of little importance or interest if different races differ as to intelligence, though no doubt general intelligence correlates with individual success in the modern world. Like Thomas Sowell, I suppose I’m open to the idea that different races have different characteristics such as intelligence; I just don’t care that much. First, I do not think a flourishing society can take an instrumentalist view of human beings, reducing them to their capacities on a set of defined traits. I therefore agree with Reich that whatever the differences, “If we aspire to treat all individuals with respect regardless of the extraordinary differences that exist among individuals within a population, it should not be so much more of an effort to accommodate the smaller but still significant average differences among populations.” The flaw in applying Reich’s reasoning, though, is that it doesn’t appeal to our modern society, which is inherently instrumentalist, since it has abandoned any coherent moral code at the same time it abandoned religion. I also agree with Reich that every person should be given “every chance to succeed”—although that does imply that some groups will then potentially succeed at greater rates than others. In practice, then, it becomes a question of what, if anything, is to be done to alleviate inequalities across groups potentially resulting from genetic differences.Second, as to any given society, even if the average intelligence of that society were found to be lower than another, for whatever reason, it would still have enough highly intelligent people to run the society as well as any human society has ever been run—if the society has the right culture, able to get everyone, even the less intelligent or less able on whatever measure is relevant, to pull the society along together. Unfortunately, most cultures in human history have been pretty crap, a few have been mediocre, and only one, the Christendom of the West, has ever been excellent (and it’s mostly gone now, with the West now running on fumes, so those in Europe complaining about Muslims swamping Europe are, in large part, barking up the wrong tree).Reich, though, flails. He tries to establish his “I’m not a racist” bona fides by attacking Nicholas Wade, the only major popular author in recent years to suggest that heritable genetic characteristics created the success of the West, in part by correlation of desirable genetic traits to “Caucasians.” Wade’s is a pretty mild point, in essence that superior social institutions were the result of small genetic differences, and those social institutions made the difference, which is impossible to argue, though the origin of superior social institutions is open to question. Now, I had my quibbles about Wade’s book, but Reich tries to have it both ways, saying that Wade “combines compelling content with parts that are entirely speculative,” and “he does not identify any serious scholarship in genetics supporting his conclusions.” But Wade’s point is that, as Reich himself summarizes, “a politically correct alliance of anthropologists and geneticists has banded together to suppress the truth that there are significant differences among human populations.” Given that Reich says the same thing, though not quite so baldly, and that Reich is the type of person Wade thinks should be doing the “serious scholarship,” yet he makes very clear he has no intention of doing so, one can’t really complain that Wade doesn’t prove his points.[Review completes as first comment.]"
30,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1182891-sue,4,"The excitement in reading Who We Are and How We Got Here is in witnessing the birth of a new science. David Reich warns the reader in the introduction that studies of ancient DNA are providing new information at such a rapid pace that some of the book’s fascinating findings might already, at publication, be eclipsed by new findings. Reich is not simply reporting on a scientific movement; he is a distinguished geneticist who studies ancient DNA.Efforts to reconstruct the long ago have generally fallen to archeologists, linguists, and anthropologists. Those people continue to be important to the study, but geneticists are adding information derived from DNA studies. One such discovery made headlines not too long ago: the discovery that most people of European background have some Neanderthal genetic material.Indeed, I found myself early on in the reading wondering if I should reread Jean Auel’s The Clan of the Cave Bear, because it turns out that her deeply imagined novel of Homo Sapiens meeting Neanderthal got it about right. Studies of ancient DNA are providing new information about how groups moved from one territory to another, intermingled (or didn’t), succumbed to war or natural disaster, and formed a prehistory that is different from what we thought it to be. This book is a splendid effort to tell the beginning of a science story that is going to flourish and mature.The big encompassing idea I took away is that studies of ancient DNA teach us that the population in any one locale has changed a number of times, particularly following the end of the ice age about 10,000 years ago. We are all genetic mixtures; the connections between people and a specific piece of land are not static or even deep-seated.It would be beyond my energy level to try to summarize all these various movements, but I want to write a paragraph about what has been learned about today’s Europeans, if only for the self-serving awareness that I will learn something about my own roots. Archeological findings have shown that Anatolian farmers (modern Turkey) spread to Greece 9000 years ago, and then northwest to the British Isles. They were believed to have intermarried with hunter-gatherers already living in western Europe. However, genetic discoveries identified a third ancient group, one which contributed about half of the genes of northern Europeans beginning about 5000 years ago. The group was herders from the steppes of Asia, whose genes are known from their own burial mounds. In some way, the herders either bred more successfully or they exterminated the farmers. Why did that happen? It’s still an open question, but one hypothesis comes from the fact that 7 percent of DNA samples from Europe and the steppes contain DNA of the microbe that caused Europe’s Black Death in the Middle Ages. Perhaps steppe people had experienced and survived the plague and carried some immunity, but transmitted it to European farmers, thus wiping out many of them.Reich deals with some of the delicate issues which may arise with the new science. He recognizes that ideologies around ethnicity and origins have led to abuses, notably in Nazi ideology, but in other cultures as well. He is aware that the new science practiced in his and other labs will be wading sometimes in difficult waters. He is aware that some cultures will not tolerate what they might see as desecration of ancient burials. Stay tuned. This is going to get interesting. This book is eminently readable. It just took me many more hours than it would have if my grounding in genetics were better. I write most book reviews for my own benefit because it helps me refine my thoughts, but it is certainly true on this occasion. It turned out to occupy more summer hours than I imagined. Beach read indeed."
31,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,5,"I accidentally delivered the e-galley of this book to the wrong device and forgot about it for a year--too bad, because it was fascinating. It certainly deserves my ""five stars for having gotten me to look at something familiar in a new way.""Previously I had a vague sense that humans evolved in Africa, then migrated in stages to other parts of the world and proceeded to hang out there for about 40,000 years during which nothing much happened, until for some reason ancient civilizations started to develop. When you write it like that, it's obviously not right! In this book we learned that while the earliest modern humans were not yet accomplishing much in the technology department, there was still a lot going on in the form of population movement. The author's lab at Harvard is pioneering new ways of extracting and analyzing DNA from prehistoric modern humans (i.e. humans like us, but before our recorded history; humans that sometimes had contact with Neanderthals and Denisovans). By comparing DNA from bodies found in different places, which can also be dated, these researchers are beginning to be able to explain how different groups migrated, settled, and conquered each other. Some of these groups (like the Yamnaya and the Funnel Beaker people) have glimmers of specific culture that we can also see in artifacts. Reich carefully calls these groups ""populations"" even though some of them are akin to what people today would call ""races."" The biggest take-home from this book is that ""race"" is a useless concept on longer timescales, because populations of people have been on the move for so many thousands of years. (My appearance, as a person with blue eyes and pale skin and hair, is the novel result of populations mixing tens of thousands of years ago, so the idea that it may correspond to some ""pure"" or ""original"" category of person is scientific nonsense in addition to being destructive in all the ways we already know.)There were portions of the book where I felt like my grasp of what the author was saying about the methods and math behind their conclusions was weak, and that I wouldn't be able to explain it to another person. The lab works with an applied mathematician who does statistical analysis of the likelihood of certain genes being related to each other; several times they've been able to infer the existence of a population based on the existence of descendants whose genome is part mystery, and then have actually found remains of a member of that population. This is impressive, but there were parts I felt like I was taking on faith.I was willing to do that partly because the author seems so meticulous, particularly in discussing the potentially misunderstood or misused aspects of his research. In one of the the earlier chapters there is a measured discussion of why Native Americans are reluctant to participate in DNA studies (past abuses of medical researchers; a sense that they already know their identity), where he also discusses how trust might start to be re-established. Later there is a lengthy pre-rebuttal, if I can call it that, of how right-wing race essentialists might attempt to to appropriate this work for their own purposes, and how it reveals their lack of understanding of the science. I didn't agree with everything he wrote, but I thought he put a lot of thought into humanities-type questions, for a scientist. One matter he stresses at the beginning is that the quantity of available ancient DNA data is doubling faster than it takes to publish a journal article in the field. This book may already contain inaccuracies that have been disproven or may miss new developments. I don't think that undermines its worthwhileness, given that it's full of information I haven't seen elsewhere. Review copy received from Edelweiss."
32,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80994215-roberta-allen,2,"This was an interesting but ultimately disappointing book for a number of reasons. First, so much of the data and hypotheses rest on statistical measurements. The author does not take the time to fully explain these, which is crucial to his exposition as much depends on the assumed frequency of mutations. Secondly, it does not live up to its title. The most detailed part of the book deals with what the author calls West Asia, i.e., mainly Europe. There are a considerable number of issues in other areas of the world, due to lack of suitable remains and social and cultural concerns, in the case of Native Americans particularly legitimate. Various ancient cultures are mentioned without grounding in why they were considered distinct cultures. This contributed to the book's being confusing. The last part of the book is a polemic arguing for the singular importance of ancient DNA analysis and the fervent hope that its findings, which in the research so far bolster the concept of race, albeit one of considerable past intermixture of populations, will lead to greater understanding. Given the history of the misuse and simplification of science I think the author is naive in considering the obstacles to a measured, objective understanding of the findings. For example, he has a chapter dealing with the evidence for strong, powerful men passing on their DNA (obviously mainly through slave women) in much greater frequency than other males historically. Rather than feeling that such a practice is outmoded and that equality of the sexes is important, I can see this finding being used to bolster the traditional male, patriarchal role. One can only hope that more empathetic views will prevail."
33,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1099934-john,4,"4.5 in substance, 3 in actual writing clarity. This books gives an overview of the new methods of using “ancient DNA” to learn about human history. There are really 3 parts to it - (1) an overview of the new methods (which are very new); (2) a revised history of the ancestry of various regions using these methods (North America, East Asia, Africa, etc.); and (3) the implications of this new research/knowledge on modern policy debates.So the second part is the longest and most interesting. The takeaway is that we’re all mutts - we’re all mixtures of different peoples and the ancient DNA methods provide clear maps of these mixtures. There’s no such thing as static “race” - there are just populations mixing with and displacing other populations. To be clear, he claims that those populations remained isolated long enough to have some biological differences (this is the controversial part and he addresses it in the 3rd part), but that doesn’t mean that there are fixed “races” like many assume. And so the ancient DNA methods clarify this history and correct a lot of long-held assumptions. It also gives some insights into the history of languages. The first part is interesting, but it’s a bit of slog at times - and I honestly didn’t follow the science in several places. And so I wouldn’t say this is an easy read. But if you like this stuff, it does cover the most recent developments and illustrates just how revolutionary this ancient DNA method will be. "

I hate it when people are still reading terribly out of date books in fields like this as their introduction (and Amazon listing popsci books over 10 years old as first in some search results on this topic) it not even occurring to these readers to check whether the books are still right, never mind knowing what to look up - there are fields in which books for the general public ought to be intentionally made to fall out of print after 5 years (maybe less) because they are no longer accurate, which of course publishers would hate, and sooner if a lot of findings emerge that contradict them.Long critical NYT report on palaeogenomics and David Reich's lab in Jan 2019:https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/ma...A lot of the basic material in the first half will be superfluous for someone who already knows a modicum about the field or has read this book . Its most salient points start about halfway through at section 5. ""Looking for the Lapita"".The problems it highlights are that the biggest palaeogenomics labs, but especially David Reich's at Harvard (the example it covers in detail, about Vanuatu, shows the Max Planck team taking a more nuanced and careful approach) are acting like big corporations, dominating the field and pushing others out whilst also using some bad practices. (Definite shades of Amazon or Google I thought.) And, at least in the case of a couple of papers discussed there - the implication is that it's more general - is that prestigious journals like Nature are allowing sloppy work through by Reich's team - such as major extrapolations from very small and unrepresentative samples with context insufficiently described - which they would never accept from non-superstar researchers. The real-world relevance of the problems is shown by a fresh example which feels urgent. While there is some legislation in place for Native Americans in North America, even if it is not fully adequate, there is very little to protect small Pacific island nations from Chinese neocolonialism, and so the implication of first colonisation by Asian groups a few thousand years ago (as a mere 3-4 samples in one of Reich's papers seemed to imply), versus admixture with of Papuans who had been in the region much longer, has potentially great import. It has not gone unnoticed that the stunning, magisterial sweep of genetic revisionism, on the one hand, and a genetic emphasis on radical prehistoric migrations, on the other, bear more than a little in common. Some anthropologists and archaeologists accept this analogy with gallows humor. One told me that I should model this article after the format of the standard Nature paper: “Ancient DNA Reveals Massive Population Turnovers in the Humanities,”...Even if the skulls were the same age as the rest of the bones at the cemetery, there was still the matter of how oddly they had been interred — one inside a jar, the others arrayed like a shield across another skeleton’s chest. “This seems to suggest,” Reviewer Two adds, “that the three people were special in some way. Hence I am concerned about drawing too many conclusions from such a small number of individuals plus individuals who were certainly not a random sample of the population.” Shouldn’t the collaborating archaeologists have pointed all this out?The revision addressed very few of the objecting reviewers’ concerns, and the changes it did provide struck those reviewers — who were asked, to their surprise, to review the revision — as perfunctory and weak...While so much of Reich’s work has conjured the notion of sweeping, wholesale replacements by one population of another, the Jena paper proposed instead a much more gradual process. Their samples demonstrated not a single decisive turnover event but at least 500 years of ongoing traffic between Papuans and Austronesians — plenty of time to explain how the former had managed to pick up the latter’s languages, for one thing. Whatever happened in that period was clearly complex, but it seemed to them inaccurate to describe it as the one-off snuffing out of one group by another. “The idea that one day there were tons of people in canoes,” Krause told me when I met him in Jena, “that’s not how we should see it.” What Reich was wont to attribute to simple “migration” was just a restatement of the problem of what happened. The actual causal mechanism could have been malaria, or warfare, or volcanic activity, or some competitive advantage in agriculture.Although I've always found palaeogenomics very exciting, and was following it well before this had become its accepted name, there's one problem I've always had with it and which I don't think has been given enough prominence, or made the conclusions cautious enough; it was succinctly described in that article by Frederique Valentin, a French bioarchaeologist, “A small sample,” she replied, “is only representative of itself.”I don't think any of this changes the fact that this book is the best current guide to this stuff for the intelligent layperson in one volume. The only issue there is one which affects a lot of reading of non-fiction, reviewing of it on GR: too many people a) take a non-fiction book to be a last word on something because it's a book from a major publisher, rather than seeing it as one work in conversation with others and b) don't realise that books usually get less peer-review before publication (especially if they are for a non-academic press) than a journal paper, so the author's enthusiasms and potential inaccuracies get greater free rein.

Many readers approach the book looking for a more scientific version of the popular ""Sapiens"" by Harari. That's half the story. Reich is more interested, despite the title on the cover, in who we are than in how we got here or why. Perfect for the scientist or geneticist, a little bit more complex for the average reader. The first part is an illustration of new techniques and statistical models adopted by Reich and his team. Highly skimmable for those who are not particularly interested in methods or just don't grasp them so easily.The second part is an account of where the main populations come from. Again, I focused more on where than on how the lab team proved genetic differences/affinities.The third part, one of the most readable, explains why genetics is important and the role it might play in society. There is a consensus among anthropologists and geneticists that has morphed, apparently without questioning, into the dogmatic orthodoxy that there is no such a thing as biological difference among populations. This orthodoxy is now far from sustainable in the light of new scientific discoveries. Still, Reich's work has been too often questioned by the scientific community, who believe that studying the DNA to understand biological differences between groups equals to flirting with racism. Another unfounded criticism I read was that, when writing about the mixing of populations, he doesn't account for ""sexual violence"", describing the mixing between male conquerors and female conquered as a logical consequence of mass migrations of the ancient past. A remark so ill-informed and witless that I wonder how someone who doesn't understand basic power relations in history can even read (Reich's book).3/5 is fair "

42,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15728519-r-hul,5,"David Reich leads the DNA laboratory at Harvard University which has been at the forefront of the recent field of population genetics, pioneering many DNA extraction and mathematical analysis techniques to search for clues into the ancestry of various human populations worldwide. In the early days of gene sequencing, mitochondrial DNA and y-chromosomes were respectively analyzed to trace maternal and paternal lineages of people, but recent advances have allowed analysis of the whole genome, which sheds statistical light into the vast majority of one's prehistoric ancestors who aren't related only an entirely maternal or paternal line. The breakdown of DNA in remains from hot and humid locations had meant that much early work on ancient DNA was done on high latitude locations like Europe and Siberia, but later discoveries of highly enriched and preserved DNA from the inner ear of skeletons have provided ancient DNA data from many regions worldwide. Population geneticists have reported so many blockbuster findings in journals over the last decade about peopling of Eurasia, spread of Indo-European languages and other contentious topics, that Reich's book written for an audience of general interest is very timely today.Ancestral clues in the genome today are linked to mutations in genes that occur randomly, and recombination of the genetic code during its transmission from parents to offspring. When the mutations in present day populations are compared with ancient DNA across the whole genome, statistical inferences can be arrived at about likelihood of descent. The size of the segments of mutant DNA is also an indicator of the number of generations between the ancient and present populations carrying a particular mutation, given that recombination chops up DNA segments during every parent-offspring transmission. When DNA analysis is combined with what is known in the fields of archaeology, anthropology and linguistics, many coherent patterns begin to emerge, and other patterns long held sacrosanct are decisively subverted.Early genome studies had supported the view that a single relatively late (~50,000 years ago) migration from Africa is responsible for all human diversity outside Africa today. Reich points out how ancient DNA conclusively showed however that humans outside Africa today trace a small but singnificant (~2%) proportion of their ancestry to Neanderthals and Denisovans, who were early emigres from Africa and who interbred with the human wave out of Africa ~50,000 years before present (BP). Neanderthals and Denisovans don't exist today in a form without unbred with later humans but their remains and ancient DNA have been found. There are also archaic human ""ghost"" populations who genome studies show to have left their trace in humans today but from whom there are no remains found. Those humans who did not leave the homeland of Africa, where there is maximum genetic diversity among humans today, do not have Neanderthal or Denisovan ancestry. However, this story is also different from the multi-regional hypothesis which held that modern humans in Africa, Europe, Asia and the Americas descended from different homo-erectus populations evolving in isolation over millenia. Evidence of multiple population movements and mixtures shows a more nuanced story.Once modern humans were established as the sole homo-population, Reich's narrative moves to the multiple migrations, after the last ice age ended ~15,000 years BP, connected to a warming planet and the invention of agriculture. In this period, the story of Eurasia is split into a western half stretching from the sub-continent of Europe to the sub-continent of India, and an eastern half including China, surrounding regions and islands stretching from Polynesia to Australia to Madagascar. In the western half, after farming was invented in the Levant & Iran, farmer groups quickly spread west into Europe and east into India before 7000 years BP. Around 5000 years BP, another population related to these farmers migrated north of the caucuses into the Eurasian steppe, and from there radiated again with horses and wheeled chariots carrying with them the Indo European languages that by ~3000 years BP dominated the vast region from the British isles to the Gangetic plain. In Eastern Eurasia, rice agriculture in the Yangtze valley and Millet agriculture in the Yellow river valley give rise to independent settler populations. The latter spread southward and eastward forming the Han, the world's largest ethnic group today. The former spread to Taiwan and then across the island chain to Australia and Polynesia. Rice agriculture is also transmitted south of the Himalayas into India. In many ways, Reich makes a conclusive case for greater Mesopotamia and North-Central China as the two cradles of civilization in Eurasia, and India as a land of mixture of East & West. Reich further models today's African populations as having been profoundly influenced by the Bantu agricultural expansion starting ~4000 years BP from west-central Africa east & southwards, leaving traces in ancestry as well as languages. Native Americans are also modeled as having descended from migrations across the land-bridges that opened up in the Bering strait after 15000 years BP.The steppe origins and admixed realities that Reich presents of Europeans as well as Indians today puts paid to both groups who have tried to use Indo-European languages in their founding myths. Neither does the proto-Indo-European conform to an early 20th century blue-eyed Nordic ideal, not is the proto-Indo-European homeland in India as many Indian nationalists claim today. Reich is particularly insightful about India when he says- ""People tend to think of India, with its more than 1.3 billion people, as having a tremendously large population, and indeed many Indians as well as foreigners see it this way. But genetically, this is an incorrect way to view the situation. The Han Chinese are truly a large population. They have been mixing freely for thousands of years. In contrast, there are few if any Indian groups that are demographically very large, and the degree of genetic differentiation among Indian jati groups living side by side in the same village is typically two to three times higher than the genetic differentiation between northern and southern Europeans. The truth is that India is composed of a large number of small populations.""After the excesses of eugenics in the early 20th century, consensus views in anthropology have tended towards cultural diffusion rather than mass migration as the mechanism for spread of agriculture, languages and technologies. However, Reich shows that in many cases, mass population migration and replacement have been a central part of our past. In addition, genomics points to significant differences in risk factors that different populations have to specific diseases, and differences in natural selectin for height in different populations. Reich even indicates that there is every likelihood that different populations have different average cognitive abilities even if the variation within groups may be larger than that between groups. Some human groups today have after all been separated for > 50,000 years (> 2000 generations), which is plenty of time for natural selection to form broad differences. In the final part of the book, Reich attempts to frame this and other evidence that genomics provides within the liberal humanist enlightenment worldview that he identifies with. His central argument here is that if the political left responds to harsh realities that science uncovers only with denial and attempts at cover-up, they cede space to the extremists to interpret and frame these realities in divisive ways. Reich argues passionately that differences in abilities across populations is not an argument for not treating everybody with equal respect and for striving to achieve broad equality across societies. He compares our efforts as a society to achieve equality and justice across genders despite knowing the clear biological differences between the sexes to the need to do the same across populations. Noble as the thought may be, I wonder if, on average, we will find within us the empathy to care across population groups that don't interact as frequenty as we do across the sexes that do so closely within the family unit that we grow up in.Population genomics is a recent, and sometimes controversial field. However, Reich's brilliant book makes clear the power of this new science to reveal some of the deepest secrets of our past with a clarity that other fields of inquiries into it have lacked. Such revolutionary knowledge will impact all areas of life. It is hence imperative for an informed person to engage with and critically analyze this field. Extensively footnoted, this book is packed with knowledge and is immensely thought-provoking."
43,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74519811-alvaro-de-menard,5,"This is primarily a book about cutting-edge advances in ancient DNA, but there are also some detours into highly controversial current-day population genetics and behavioral genetics issues.The ancient DNA stuff is fascinating, and made even cooler by the fact that Reich and his lab at Harvard are at the forefront of all the big discoveries. This isn't one of those pop science books where a journalist summarizes research for you. Reich gives a first-person view of the scientific process, and it's awesome. He describes the problems with gathering, extracting, isolating, and analyzing DNA from ancient skeletons, and how the techniques were developed to make the process thousands of times cheaper than it was. Hypotheses are proposed and tested, counterintuitive and unexpected results have to be explained, and further tests developed to evaluate them.The book starts out with some general introductory notes, some discussion of Neanderthal and Denisovan interbreeding, and then we get to the meat: 5 chapters on the migration patterns that resulted in current-day populations, one for each region: Europe, India, the Americas, East Asia, and finally Africa. The recurring pattern is that there are no ""pure"" populations. There was invasion and mixing everywhere.The finding that several of the great populations outside of Africa today are profoundly mixed was at odds with what most scientists expected. Prior to the genome revolution, I, like most others, had assumed that the big genetic clusters of populations we see today reflect the deep splits of the past. But in fact the big clusters today are themselves the result of mixtures of very different populations that existed earlier. We have since detected similar patterns in every population we have analyzed: East Asians, South Asians, West Africans, southern Africans. There was never a single trunk population in the human past. It has been mixtures all the way down.And very often the current inhabitants are recent arrivals.If the ancient DNA studies of the last few years have shown anything clearly, it is that the geographic distribution of people living today is often misleading about the dwelling places of their ancestors.People like those at Stonehenge were building great temples to their gods, and tombs for their dead, and could not have known that within a few hundred years their descendants would be gone and their lands overrun. The extraordinary fact that emerges from ancient DNA is that just five thousand years ago, the people who are now the primary ancestors of all extant northern Europeans had not yet arrived.In many cases the DNA results overturn the orthodoxy established by anthropologists and archaeologists. For example,Prior to the explosion of ancient DNA data in 2015, most archaeologists found it inconceivable that the genetic changes associated with the spread of the Yamnaya culture could be as dramatic as the archaeological changes. Even the archaeologist David Anthony, a leading proponent of the idea that the spread of Yamnaya culture was transformative in the history of Eurasia, could not bring himself to suggest that its spread was driven by mass migration. Instead, he proposed that most aspects of Yamnaya culture spread through imitation and proselytization.But the genetics showed otherwise.Sometimes this creates issues of a political nature. The migration explanation had originally been proposed by a guy called Gustaf Kossinna, whom the Nazis liked very very much. So:While we were in the final stages of preparing a paper for submission in 2015, one of the German archaeologists who contributed skeletal samples wrote a letter to all coauthors: “We must(!) avoid…being compared with the so called ‘siedlungsarchäologische Methode’ from Gustaf Kossinna!” He and several contributors then resigned as authors.One of the most interesting aspects was the usage of language to corroborate the genetic evidence. At the same time DNA can help establish which linguistic theory is correct. The spread of Indo-European languages by steppe pastoralists invading Europe and India is the classic example (overturning theories of Anatolian origin), and Reich brings up many such cases across the globe.Elaborate migration diagrams are spread throughout to illustrate geographically the results from the DNA analyses. A couple of examples: A Tale of Two Subcontinents

The Genetic Origin of Present-Day West Eureasians

Reich hammers in the point about ""purity"" again and again, partly to emphasize that he's not a racist – but I don't know how much it matters. Does anyone outside of stormfront care whether Europeans are ""pure"" steppe pastoralists or a mix of middle-eastern farmers with steppe pastoralists? I just don't think that is the level on which racism operates today. The third part contains two chapters that focus more on controversial present-day issues. One chapter is devoted to ""the genomics of inequality"", where he describes the outsize evolutionary success some men have had, and how this usually involved 1) gender inequality, 2) inequality between the males in society, 3) conquest. The euphemism ""sex-asymmetric population mixture"" describes the frequent event of an invading force killing all the men and taking the women.Curiously, throughout the book Reich keeps suggesting (though not outright stating) that since mixture and replacement are in our past, they are fundamentally part of what makes us human and we shouldn't really object to them in the future. But when it comes to inequality he goes the opposite way. Perhaps a Straussian inconsistency? One possible response might be to conclude that inequality is part of human nature and that we should just accept it. But I think the lesson is just the opposite.Finally, ""The Genomics of Race and Identity"". This is going to be the most controversial aspect of the book. Reich tackles first the clustering into populations, and then the differences between these populations.One of the most interesting bits is that Reich essentially admits geneticists have been lying to the public (""we have tended to obfuscate"") about populations and their differences. He then goes on to say that this approach is becoming untenable because of bloggers like Razib Khan and Dienekes:The genome bloggers’ political beliefs are fueled partly by the view that when it comes to discussion about biological differences across populations, the academics are not honoring the spirit of scientific truth-seeking. The genome bloggers take pleasure in pointing out contradictions between the politically correct messages academics often give about the indis​tingu​ishab​ility of traits across populations and their papers showing that this is not the way the science is heading.But whether we like it or not, there is no stopping the genome revolution. The results that it is producing are making it impossible to maintain the orthodoxy established over the last half century, as they are revealing hard evidence of substantial differences across populations.And while he writes that ""It is now undeniable that there are nontrivial average genetic differences across populations in multiple traits"", he's not really willing to take a position on what those group differences are. He writes about some results on eg cancer risk, but does not go beyond that (not even Ashkenazi IQ). He makes sure to distance himself from people like Wade, Cochran, Harpending, Clark, and Watson: they are drawing inferences that are insufficiently supported by the currently available data. I feel it is important to explain that just because many academics have been engaged in trying to maintain an implausible orthodoxy, it does not mean that every unorthodox “heretic” is right.Ultimately he takes the position Pinker has been pushing: scientists have to talk about this stuff, otherwise they risk ceding control of the space to bad actors."
44,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6701660-lyndsey-chamberlain,3,"There are parts of this book I loved and large sections of this book I struggled with, the following good reads reviewer sums up more or less what I thought of this book: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Interesting but problematic in several ways. It is clear that Reich has several biases in worldview and ideology that he is painfully unaware of and dismisses them as ‘political correctness.’ He considers his views to be an adherence to science and scientific evidence and dismisses criticism as bias not rooted in science. Which mainly refers to ‘hard science’ with little acknowledgement for several fields of the social sciences. While I agree that an understanding of humans must be, and is rooted in the physical sciences, including genetics, biology, neuroscience, etc, the human experience is equally rooted in the social sciences, humanities, our cultures, and even spirituality, which leads me to my next point: His views concerning the apprehension First Nations people feel towards participating in his western science paradigm of genetic research are paternalistic and demonstrate ignorance when it comes to understanding and respecting First Nation worldview and way of life, which made this section particularly difficult to read. It is further clear that these views come solely from an ideology of western science and its inherent truth, with no concern, acknowledgement, or understanding of culture. The study of ancient DNA is extremely interesting and extremely important, however, it being the authors singular truth does not require it to be everybody’s single truth and way of viewing the world. This is a lesson that western science as an institution, and Reich as an extension of this institution, has yet to learn to the detriment of its own field and purpose. The view that it is the single and ultimate truth is similar to a religious worldview and inherently isolating. Overall the genetic aspects of this book that focus on human evolution and ancient DNA are very interesting. The issue I have is not with the study of ancient DNA or its evolutionary findings, but more so with the bias, ideology, and at times interpretation (see linked review) of some findings. If you read this book with a critical lens you will still come away interested and more knowledgeable about human evolution. That being said, it is dense with information and requires a fair amount of prior background info or patience to get through. The information is highly specialized and seems as if it is intended to be communicated to an audience with extensive knowledge of human evolution and genetics. "
45,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4954129-bethany,3,"There was a recent NY Times article on Reich's lab's work on skulls from Vanuatu and the impact of telling indigenous peoples that their ancestors weren't the first/only people to settle the land they live in. That article also went into some allegations of shadiness on the part of Reich's and others' ancient DNA labs - that they are something of a genetic mafia, with hookups to publish in Nature with extremely brief and (implied in the NYT article) perfunctory peer review, so if archaeologists aren't willing to ""collaborate"" (i.e. turn over their samples) their archaeology careers are dead in the water. So that was my context before actually listening to Reich's book. Now that I've listened to it I think he actually does a great job in discussing how and why he works. It's readable even though it's a really technical topic, given that even on audio I still managed to mostly follow the science. He is obviously extremely proud of his work, but there's a good amount of humility in the final chapters. He is very clear that he sees ancient DNA analysis as a tool of archaeology, not a replacement for it. He has a long discussion of why it's important for scientists to openly address biological population differences (because if they don't, racists will), and is clear about his motivation to use ancient DNA to give modern people a sense of connectedness with all of humanity, past and present (yet the road to hell may be paved with the good intentions of scientists....?)."
46,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73424717-caroline,4,"This was an excellent glimpse into a field I don't know much about: sometimes I'll see an article in some media about Neanderthal DNA or something, but I don't have enough context to really get what's going on. This book was an enjoyable way to get all that context; would recommend.I didn't really realize this before reading it, but it sounds like ancient DNA is a pretty exciting and fast-growing field; it's just in the last decade that we've made enough technological advances to do whole-genome sequencing on ancient human remains, and we've gotten a way better understanding of human history from doing this. Tbh it made me kind of jealous: it feels like this is one of those moments where there's a lot of low-hanging fruit and you don't actually have to be that smart or lucky to significantly improve our understanding of early human history.So yeah, read this to learn about:- interbreeding with archaic humans- agriculturalists and steppe pastoralists in Europe- the Indus Valley civilization and its fall- Indian caste division and endogamy- the tribes in the Amazon who are related to Australian aborigines- sex-asymmetric mixing between populationsetc. It's cool.I guess this also made me feel like I had a better overall picture of human population history, which is something like: there's a family tree that splits and branches off, as you'd imagine. Sometimes those branches end up as hunter-gatherers on random islands and do their own thing for thousands of years. But a lot of the time the branches continue to intermingle, one of them develops some new technology or something and conquers another, then they interbreed and produce a new population, and so on."
47,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68583290-jamie,4,"What a long, strange trip it’s been. The ability to analyze DNA from ancient and modern peoples has vastly expanded our knowledge of humankind’s past. There are remarkable stories being revealed about migrations and the mixing of different populations. Some of the information can be gleaned directly, such as by using the mitochondrial and y-chromosome clocks to determine how long ago one group split off from another, and some are the result of detective work, such as piecing together the causal factors that led the original Indo-Europeans to spread out in all directions, taking their language and culture from Britain to China, from Russia to India.It is fascinating to think that 50,000 years ago there were multiple distinct types of humans sharing Eurasia: Neanderthals; “hobbits” (Homo floresiensis); two distinct populations of Denisovans, one in the Altai Mountains where current Russia, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia meet, and one thousands of miles away in New Guinea; and modern humans. Analysis of their DNA provides evidence for when they split from each other and from ancient human lineages, and also discloses breeding across the various human lines. Modern non-African DNA is 1.5 to 2.1 percent Neanderthal, with the larger amount in East Asians and the smaller in Europeans.The evidence also shows the existence of ghost populations who contributed to modern peoples but no longer exist as distinct groups. The puzzling fact that Native Americans are more closely related to Europeans than to East Asians is explained by the one time existence of a group known as Ancient Northern Eurasians, who spread both east and west from what is now Russia. Some of them eventually migrated over the Bering Sea land bridge to North America. A 24,000 year old skeleton was analyzed and did indeed have the genetic traits that had been hypothesized for these now-vanished Ancient North Eurasians.There was a time when scholars throughout Europe and Asia put forth claims that their lands were the ancestral homeland of the Indo-Europeans, places as widely separated as India, Anatolia, the Balkans, and, of course, Germany and other Northern European nations. Although the evidence is not conclusive, a good case can be made for Proto-Indo-European originating in the vicinity of present day Iran. At some point speakers migrated to the steppes north of the Black Sea. This conjecture is supported by the ancient Hittite language, a very early offshoot of Indo-European, which can be explained as a split in the original Indo-European migration as they headed north, with some going west into Anatolia, where their descendants became the Hittites, and some continuing on to the steppes and becoming what is now known as the Yamnaya culture. The two great advancements which helped the Yamnaya spread across the globe were the wheel and the domestication of the horse. They might not have been the originators of either of these, but the vast steppes, stretching from Hungary to western China, were the perfect place to employ them to best advantage.The Yamnaya were a warlike people, as shown from the grave goods found in their tombs. When they began to spread out from their homeland about 5000 years ago it is possible that they did so non-violently. For instance, early Europe could have been so lightly populated that they did not need to fight for land, and indeed, there is evidence that forest clearing accelerated at this time. A more ominous possibility is that they could have brought diseases with them that decimated the existing peoples. They may have had a limited immunity to plague based on having lived with it since they arrived in the steppes, but the Europeans would have had none, and could have been largely wiped out. The author of this book mentions only in passing the third possible explanation for the spread of Indo-European, that warlike cultures tend to expand by conquest. The mobility given by the horse and the wheel would have been an overwhelming advantage. For a more detailed look at the origins and spread of Indo-European I recommend David Anthony’s excellent book The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World.Who knew that DNA analysis would be fraught with political and cultural landmines? Both China and India impose tight restrictions on the export of DNA data, ostensibly to build up their own capabilities in the field. Analysis shows that much of northern India today is of Indo-European origin, from invaders who came south from Afghanistan and east from Iran, but the current position in India is that Indo-European originated with them and then spread outwards, and that India has been homogeneous since the beginning of time. China too keeps close control of genetics research, lest some inconvenient findings about the Han majority slip out. In China all knowledge is political.In a similar manner many indigenous peoples, having been exploited in the past, are wary of promises made to them today about how DNA analysis could help them uncover their origins or identify disease patterns. Navajo tribal law prohibits their people from participating in genetic studies, saying, “Human genome testing is strictly prohibited by the Tribe. Navajos were created by Changing Woman; therefore they know where they came from.” (p.162)It is amazing how much has been learned about population genetics in the past two decades, and the technology continues to improve, making tests faster, cheaper, and more accurate. A window is opening onto our past, and shedding light on our present, with many more fascinating stories yet to be told. This book truly is about who we are and how we got here, and it points the way toward where we are going."
48,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26855073-lada,4,"This book is all DNA all the time, covering the research of the last few years on inferring movement of ancient human populations (without much complementary archeology, which took me by surprise). The last third of the book changes gears and discusses measuring historical inequality and other wild things using genetic sequencing, along with an ethics discussion. I think this book would be interesting to those who want to dive deep on the state of the art in sequencing ancient DNA. For those looking for a more complete treatment of far human history, might be worth it to wait a bit for more samples to be sequenced (which the book says is accelerating) and for the different disciplines to have a chance to catch up and collaborate."
49,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4756170-daniel,5,"Reich is a geneticist who is one of the pioneers of ancient DNA analysis. This books sums up what have been found. Basically humans move around a lot. We moved, settled down and became indigenous, and then new groups moved and mixed with the static group. This happened many times to make us. This book was so good that I listened to it and then read it to fully understand the whole thing. 1. Ancient DNA samples provide hitherto-unavailable glimpse into the origins of people. Population mixing is essential to the development of modern humans. Often times the people who are living in countries now are descendants of farmers who displaced the original hunter gatherers. We can construct the genome of ghost populations that no longer exist and whose remains had not been found by archeology. 2. The earliest humans separated from chimpanzee ancestors around 6 million years ago. These homo erectus went out of Africa to everywhere 1.8 million years ago. A superarchaic group split off around 1 million ago, then a third split of ancestors of modern humans 660 thousand years ago. Denisovans and Neanderthals split off around 400 thousand years ago. All the species interbred with each other apparently. 3. Early Homo sapiens appeared about 330 thousand years ago in Africa and spread out of Africa and into Near East 130 thousand years ago. They interbred with Neanderthals so 2% of the genome of non-Africans are from Neanderthals. They also interbred with Denisovans and New Guneans have around 5% of their genome. 4. Modern humans arrived in Europe about 53 thousand years ago and Neanderthals were extinct by 49 thousand years ago. East Asians actually have higher proportion of Neanderthal genes. Around this period modern humans started to use elaborate stone tools. No single mutation turned us into modern humans; likely many mutations caused it. 5. Ancient Northern Eurasians were ancestors of modern Europeans and Native Americans. Native Americans derived a third of their genome of them and the rest from East Asians. 6. Basal Eurasians contributed a quarter of the genome to modern European, Near Easterners, Iranians and Indians. They gave rise to Ancient Northern Europeans, Eastern Asians and Australians. They became the first hunter gatherers in Europe more than 39 thousand years ago. Then the eastern branch of the Basal Eurasians moved west 30 thousand years ago but was pushed out by glaciers 15 thousand years ago. Then South West Europeans migrated to other parts of Europe. Finally a Near Eastern group migrated into Europe around 14 thousand years ago. These were all hunter gatherers. Then farmers from Near East at Anatolia migrated into Europe. They mixed with previous groups 5000 years ago. Finally, Yamnaya people from the steppes with Ancient Northern Eurasians ancestry migrated west to Europe and displaced 70% of the population, forming the Corded Ware culture. They might have the wheel, horses and Yersinia plague bacteria to help them. European blue eyes were from hunter gatherers and light skin from Near Eastern farmers. Blond hair was from Ancient Northern Eurasians. 6. India was formed by mixing of 2 populations: Ancestral Southern Indians descended from Iranian farmers and indigenous hunter gatherers 9000 years ago. Then Ancestral Northern Indians who were descended from Yamnaya steppe people and Iranian farmers migrated 5000 years ago and mixed with the Ancestral Southern Indians to become modern Indians. 7. Native Americans came from Northern Eurasians in 4 waves: the first crossed the Alaska landbridge 23 thousand years ago. Then population Y crossed at an unknown date. The third wave came 5000 years ago, and the final wave came 1000 years ago. 8. Eastern Asians descended from Modern humans interbreeding with Neanderthals. Some from that union interbred with Denisovans to become New Guneans and Australians. Hunter Gathers went East from Near East 60 to 10 thousand years ago to East Asia. East Asians started from 2 populations 9000 years ago: Yellow River and Yangtze River Ghost Populations. The 2 populations mixed to give modern Han Chinese. Japanese descended from 20% ancient hunter gatherers (present Ainu) and 80% farmers that came through Korea about 2300 years ago. The mixing occured about 1600 years ago so it has taken many years for the segregation to break down. The Yangtze group spread to Indochina and Taiwan 5000 years ago. The they went to Philippines 4000 years ago, then Indonesia and beyond. 9. When populations mixed, generally the males from the dominant group mated with females from the displaced group. Powerful men like Ghengis Khan can have millions of descendants. 10. There are real differences between populations and we should not stick our heads in the sand and pretend that everyone is the same. However in the same way we should not be prejudiced against people of different races."
50,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/782114-nathan-albright,4,"Although I am by no means fond of the evolutionary worldview of the author, a worldview that is shared by a great many writers of human prehistory [1], there is a great deal to enjoy about this book if one views it as a search for mysterious but clearly human relatives.  When viewed in that light this book can be highly entertaining.  This is not a book that deals with the question of identity on an individual level, but it seeks to understand how genetic research allows us to understand human beings on a population by population level, with the most interesting aspects of it being the way that human beings have repeatedly mixed over and over again to a great extent, allowing for a wide variety of genetic admixture thanks to questions of power imbalance and the willingness of human beings to sleep with anything that looks and feels suitable around them.  Whether or not one enjoys this particular idea of the author, there is a lot here for a reader to enjoy if they have an interest in genetic genealogy.The contents of this book are close to 300 pages and are divided into three parts and twelve chapters.  In the first part the author discusses the deep history of our species (I), looking at how the genome explains who we are (1), what sort of encounters mankind had with Neanderthals (2), and how ancient DNA opened the floodgate to research on humanity's past (3).  The second part of the book provides a regional history of how we got to where we are today (II) with a look at ghost populations of previously unknown groups (4), the making of modern Europe (5), the collision between two groups of people that formed India (6), the problematic search for Native American ancestors (7), the genetic origins of East Asians (8), and the difficult task of rejoining Africa to the human story (9).  The third and final part of the book discusses the genome as a disruptive force (III), showing the genomics of inequality (10), race and identity (11), and the future of ancient DNA (12).  After this the author closes with some notes and an index, after having written a book that is likely to cause a great deal of controversy and encourage people to debunk some of his speculations.A book like this has to be taken with a very large grain of salt, or perhaps a sizable salt shaker.  The author is simultaneously someone trying to explain science to the reader as well as someone who is a rather obvious booster for science and genetic research in particular, which makes some of his writing rather muddled.  At key parts of this book the author shows himself to be trying to sell the idea of funding genetic research and engaging in research to the reader, even where that genetic research involves populations have have limited means or serious reservations about being involved in genetic research, as is the case in China and India, where there are laws that prevent people from being exported out of the country, or Native Americans who have viewed genetic research as another coercive way of losing their heritage or Africans whose impoverished state has made it tough to get enough genetic research to answer some basic questions about the continent's migrations.  All in all, this book has a lot of entertainment value, but it is the sort of work that one cannot expect will remain relevant for very long in the face of research advances.[1] See, for example:https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2018...https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2016...https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2016...https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2018..."
51,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81225964-bill-newell,2,"David Reich’s Who We Are and How We Got There: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past (New York: Pantheon Books, 2018) 286 pp., has a lot going for it—insight into a whole new field of study that is arguably interdisciplinary, a big picture look at the migrations and interactions of human and proto-human groups over the last few 100,000 years, and an authoritative summary of the scholarly methods and findings of the field by one of its leading researchers. But I cannot recommend it, unless you know a whole lot more about whole genome DNA sequencing and advanced applied statistics than I do (and I took several statistics courses in grad school and taught myself quite a bit more as I worked on my dissertation), or you are content to skip over roughly half the contents of the book and limit your reading to his conclusions.  It turns out that Reich wrote for two audiences, the educated layperson and other experts in the field or related disciplines (such as archeology, linguistics, or race and gender studies). But his one concession to non-experts is an opening chapter on “How the Genome Explains Who We Are.” Many scientifically literate readers may find that chapter a bit too basic. Yet when he explained the reasoning underlying the tests he and other researchers have developed to study each of the topics in the book, he almost immediately left me in the dust. I don’t know what inferences can credibly be drawn from the location and rate of mutations, the length of common sequences of DNA, etc. And having waded valiantly word-by-word through the entire book, I still don’t know. I expect a science book for non-scientists to provide sufficient basis for me to judge for myelf if the author’s inferences are warranted. His does not. My suspicion is he’s spent so much of his time giving conference presentations to other experts in the field, or classroom presentations to advanced students at Harvard, that he has no idea how to communicate to anyone else.  As a social scientist, I also have a bone to pick with him (and with other prominent biologists such as E.O. Wilson) about the role of biology in explaining human behavior. Throughout most of the book, he quite appropriately refers to correlations between genomic patterns and population movements and interbreeding. But when he turns his attention near the end to “The Genomics of Race and Identity” he refers instead (unconsciously, perhaps?) to causation. Human predispositions and actions are driven by clusters of genes, not by social, cultural, political, economic, historical, or gender-based factors—let alone free will. The root of all human decisions and behavior is biological, and presumably then the entire set of social and behavioral science disciplines are epiphenomenal. They merely explain how genetically driven behavior manifests itself in particular contexts. I take offense at such disdain for the explanatory power of anything except the hard natural sciences. There are a few nuggets of insight awaiting the patient and trusting reader: The Tree of Life metaphor is not valid; All populations have undergone extensive mixing; The current inhabitants of any region are weakly related at best to its first human inhabitants; and personal ancestry testing gives misleading results. He also does a nice job of making the case for genomic testing, addressing concerns grounded in the eugenics movement, Nazi ideology, and White extermination of Native American peoples. But if one of those topics is what really interests you, I suggest spot reading and skipping the rest of the book"

54,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18716604-murray,4,"Whole genome analysis of remains of ancestral humans at different locations and in different eras is now used to track the pattern of human migrations and interbreeding. Mutations, or errors in DNA copying, occur on average about every thousand base-pairs at a fairly constant rate. We inherit three billion base-pairs from each parent. The density of different mutations on the same chromosomal segment can act as a “stop-watch” for how long different individuals shared a common ancestor. Reich developed the Four-Population test, comparing, for example, the genomes of two modern human populations with Neanderthal and Chimpanzees. If the two human populations descend from a common ancestor earlier than the Neanderthal they would be expected to share an equal density of mutations on a given genomic segment. If, however, one of the populations interbred with Neanderthals, that population would share more mutations with Neanderthals. (And modern humans interbred with Neanderthals as well as other extinct and ghost populations of homo-not-sapiens.) Another test, the Three-Population test, measures the frequency of mutations in a genomic segment in a test population of modern humans in comparison with two other populations. If the frequency of mutations in the test group is intermediate between the two comparators, then interbreeding is likely, as in African Americans in relation to Europeans and West Africans.Since mitochondrial DNA is inherited only from the maternal ovum, and male Y chromosome DNA from the paternal lineage, sex-specific patterns can be evaluated as well. Population bottle-necksin geographically isolated can be ascertained. Interbreeding of socially powerful males with females of conquered or socially weak populations can be identified.Using these methods Reich reveals the surprising results of the past 10-15 years of research which has upended what we came to believe about patterns of human migration and interbreeding. It has enlightened our understanding of the average differences across population groups as well as difference between individual within population groups, which has caused consternation in some circles of political correctness. I came across this issue in an editorial he published in the NY Times which alerted me for the first time to this important scientific discipline.Reich is eloquent when he talks about the social and political fall-out of his research. He waxes enthusiastically optimistic about future discoveries. I highly recommend this book with the following caveat: It is not an easy read for the relative layman. I am conversant, not expert, in many areas of science. This may not appeal to everyone who enjoys popular scientific treatises ala Steven Hawking and Richard Dalkins. Reich can be overly verbose and detailed, especially when discussing migration and interbreeding details related to specific population groups. For readability I award the book three stars, and for importance 5 stars. Hence the final average of four."
55,110187032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7283807-ben,2,"A broad survey of how ancient DNA analysis is changing our understanding of human development and migrations. I didn't find it inspiring, and would have liked a more focused and personal story. It feels like a bunch of Scientific American articles pasted together. (Every chapter is written to be standalone, so many basic facts are repeated ad nauseam.) And there isn't nearly enough about how the science was done. There are a few anecdotes, but very few, even though he was involved in a lot of the research. Reich is conflicted between writing for his peers (lots of namedropping, nothing bad ever said) and for a general audience. For example, he footnotes his sources, but he also writes them out in prose (e.g., ""In August 20xx, X, Y and Z, in an article titled 'ABC' in 'Nature,' found that…"") I found this bizarre. But the writing is always heavy-handed and never fluent, using ten words when one would do. On the bright side, the graphics are fantastic. Reich does give a great summary of the field, and his opinions on where it is going. He very briefly explains some of the techniques and breakthroughs. "

It is an amazing story, illustrated by many new facts from his own laboratory at Harvard, everything brand-new and published only recently. His book is organized more or less geographically as he discusses the great mixing zones in Europe, South Asia, East Asia, Africa and the Americas. I thought the colonization of Australia could have gotten a bit more attention, in the light of recent publications. By and large, the ancient DNA data show that almost all ethnic groups in the world today are mixtures of lineages that lived somewhere else in the past. There is no justification for the present over-emphasis on identity and group uniqueness. Instead the data reveal a great deal of connectedness, interbreeding and mixing across the globe. Reich, while providing a thorough account of DNA analysis including even the underlying statistics, does not avoid the big societal implications of modern population genomics, nor does he conceal his own Askhenazi Jewish background. This is a book of superb 21st century science writing."

It brought forward a lot of new insights into the past plus an exciting introduction into the field and possibilities of ancient-DNA. Among the many highlights was the material on the ancient history of India and the current populations of western-Europe. The author also has some fascinating content on what might lie ahead of us in terms of possible discoveries of genetic factors affecting human group differences and the unsustainability of the previous orthodoxy of the past. The book rightly offers plenty of words of caution concerning the dangers of speculation based on tentative findings. I highly recommend this book to any reader, but in particular to any young social scientist; it provides a glimpse of how the understanding of human societies can be advanced applying scientific reasoning.

The author introduces the technology with a tour of DNA and some of the methods that are used to determine ancestry such as the four population test. Reich presents not only results but the evidence leading to his conclusions, being clear as to what is fairly clearly shown, but also what intriguing possibilities are suggested. Excellent charts with detailed captions that summarize the movements of populations over time.Analysis of ancient DNA confirms that Neanderthals and humans interbred. The percentage has declined over time due as male hybrids had reduced fertility causing the minority ancestry to be removed from the population. Going back further, there is evidence of very early hybridization between archaic humans and chimpanzees, while the bonobos appear to have been abruptly separated. The percentage of Neanderthal DNA is higher in East Asians than Europeans due to dilution that occurred with the spread of farming through Europe.The Denisovians separated from the Neanderthals over 500,000 ya., with the Denisovians branching into a northerly population near Siberia and a southerly Australo-Denisovian population, the largest remnant ancestry of the latter being in the people of New Guinea. The Hobbits of Flores date after this branching, suggesting they are a population derived from the early Denisovians. Reich raises the possibility that humans, Neanderthals and Denisovians all arose from an early ancestor that lived in Europe with a later return of part of the human population to Africa. Homo antecessor found in Spain from one million ya. has genes that appear to be shared by all three early groups.An early surprise was the finding that Europeans are more closely related to Native Americans than they are to East Asians. Further analysis revealed a ghost population of early hunter-gathers that had existed in northern Europe about 35,000 ya., eventually expanding west to contribute to the modern European gene pool. Movement east contributed to the peoples that eventually moved to North America. Confirmation of this ideas came from genetic material of a boy from the Mal’ta site in south-central Siberia that matches this ghost population. Other ghost populations, such as the Basal Europeans, are indicated showing that the human past is not tree-like but one of periodic mixtures.Agriculturists spread from Anatolia into Europe around 9,000 ya., mixing with the indigenous hunter-gatherers. At about 5,000 ya. the successful Yamnaya herding culture started to spread from the steppes of northern Asia, replacing most of the European and British populations with 700 years. Pollen records show a transition from woodlands to more open grasslands at the time, suggesting the possibility that the Yamnaya reshaped the land to make it more steppe-like. Iberia seems to have been less affected, although the interchange of cultural ideas is still evident.India was dominated by two major populations at about 5,000 ya. The Ancestral North Indians (ANI) were related to the European and central Asian peoples while the Ancestral South Indians (ASI) were related to the East Asians. The Andaman Islanders are a remnant of the ASI. The ANI and ASI have mixed over time resulting in a gradient over India. The varna and jati caste systems have restricted mixing resulting in strong genetic differences among the various castes.Some peoples of central South America have a relationship to Australians, New Guineans, and Andamanese. This genetic material is not present elsewhere, including the Clovis, suggesting that they derive from a very early migration. The First Americans arrived either by the coastal route around 16,000 ya. of overland around 13,000 ya. The Paleo-Eskimos arrived in a later migration at about 5,000 ya. Interestingly, there is evidence that the Chukchi of Northern Siberia possess some Paleo-Eskimo genetic material, suggesting that a population migrated back from the Americas to Siberia. A final wave established the Neo-Eskimos about 1,000 ya. Evidence of the Paleo-Eskimos remains in both the Neo-Eskimos and the Na-Dene cultures along the west coast of North America.After the split between the Europeans and the Asians about 50,000 ya., the hunter-gathers spread through China, Siberia and S.E. Asia. It appears that farming was invented and became the basis for populations centered on the Yellow River and on the Yangtze River. While these cultures no longer exist, the Yellow River ancestry can be seen in the Tibetans, and that of the Yangtze in the Taiwanese and Vietnamese. Separate waves of migration occurred from S.E. Asia to Australia and New Guinea, from Taiwan to Vanuatu and Fiji, and a second later movement from New Guinea to Vanuatu and Fiji.Analysis is only now starting to provide insight into the complex movements over time within Africa. The earlier hunter-gatherer populations have been obscured by at least four expansions of agricultural societies such as the Bantu expansion from the area near Nigeria, into much of Southern Africa. In Part III of the book, Reich explores issues such as inequality leading to greater male genetic material in some populations, and the issue of identity as it relates to genetic origins."
