0,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"Because of the blurb and publicity, I expected a book about Dr. Richard Shepherd's career as the leading forensic pathologist in the UK. So naturally when I get lyrical passages about soaring in a Cesna over Hungerfood I'm thinking this book isn't for me. When the author writes in detail about his childhood and the women in his father's life, I'm thinking I didn't sign up for this, but it's an easy read and the writing improves after the initial overly-descriptive prose. Then - just like that - everything makes sense, why the Cesna, why the family, so I'm really into it. I've never had a book take so long to explain itself before.The book is an autobiography with a dual concentration of the author's home life and his professional life. In both real life and the book, he devotes far too much time and energy to his professional life. He gets told so too, but he can't get a grip on that. I think a lot of men are like that and it's the women that hold the marriage and family together, until eventually the children leave home and it all falls apart. Dr. Shepherd's case file as a forensic pathologist is very interesting. Sometimes though he gets a bee in his bonnet, as in a court case, and it's a 'he said, she said', for many, many pages, it's a bit tedious, but like everything else in the book, you wait a while and you see why he's written it like that. It's a very unusual way to put a book together.I was most interested in his work after the Al Qaeda terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. He went to New York and worked there. He said that one of the prime motivations to identify all the bodies/parts was that even though it would have been easier to have a mass grave, they knew that the families of the victims could not bear the idea of these loved ones being buried along with the terrorists who'd murdered them. He flew out to Bali for the night club massacre, also funded by Al Qaeda and the difference between the quiet dignity of the US with the bodies in refrigerated trucks, neatly lined up the US flag and flowers at the entrance and Bali, a single refrigerated truck and all the bodies bundled into bags and laid in the shade with ice from the supermarkets keeping them cool.He also wrote about Princess Diana's death. I didn't know she didn't look very badly injured and was talking until she passed out and later died from a very, very small rip in a vein in a lung that bled out inside her. So it was interesting. And when he got PTSD from the massacres, from being accused himself of not being diligent over a baby's death (he had been), charges that hung over him for a long time before being dismissed, I could see how his mental issues went right back to his childhood.So, all in all it the sum of its parts is 3 stars. But, taken as a whole, it is an enjoyable and enlightening 5 star read, and Dick Shepherd is a really nice guy and those who have him as a friend are really lucky.Tea - why the book cannot be Americanised. (view spoiler)[ Every discussion with the detectives or lawyers starts off with them all sitting down for a cup of tea. If there is a break, they have tea. And afterwards they either have another cup of tea or go down to the pub for a pint. You couldn't swap tea for coffee for a US market, as they'd all be buzzing on caffeine so much did they drink. (hide spoiler)]Notes on reading the book 2. (view spoiler)[ I'm a little over half-way now and an event has occurred which makes the whole (boring) beginning of the book make sense. It isn't even boring in retrospect. And it no longer seems over-written. I sthink it was weird to have the book put together like this but I do understand why. However, the explanation for putting in the non-maternal stepmother and her issues is being gone into like a small nail being pounded by a big hammer. I want to say 'I get it, I get it'.In the words of the Beatles, ""I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)""  (hide spoiler)]Notes on reading the book 1(view spoiler)[ I thought this was going to be about the author's work as a forensic pathologist. So far it is mostly autobiographical about his home life. Reading about his father's girlfriends and how he didn't want to marry his second wife who wasn't maternal blah blah blah It's very boring. The writing is overly-descriptive (why use one adjective when three will do plus a nice phrase? I've never been one for long lyrical descriptions either.) Also too many cliches. One review suggests that the book concentrates on the author's PTSD. I hope not. (hide spoiler)]"
1,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38610813-paromjit,5,"Dr Richard Shepherd writes a fascinating and riveting blend of autobiography and memoir about his time as a top forensic pathologist in Britain. He has been involved in too many to count headlining criminal cases, disasters, and terrorist incidents in recent British history. He has carried out almost 25,000 post mortems, a head spinning number, in his search to determine the truth of how a person died. The nature of truth itself is a complex and complicated beast that he has to tussle with. Given the nature of his profession, it is inevitable there are plenty of grisly aspects to his job, and to be honest, I completely respect Shepherd, he does a job I could not ever imagine wanting to do, I just would not be able to handle it, particularly given the close encounters with the dead on almost a every day basis, through all those years. And he himself is not left untouched as he provides insights into his personal life, the emotional wear and tear, and the toll it takes on his mental health and the impact on his family. I was surprised just how wide ranging aspects of his work are, including the need to be so well acquainted with extensive parts of the law. This is an insightful book, I was hugely impressed with Dr Richard Shepherd, his compassion, his dedication, determination, and using his expertise to act as a advocate for the dead. This is for true crime aficionados and crime fiction fans alike, its eye opening and knowledgeable about forensic pathology, providing real life clarity and written in a easy to read style. Many thanks to Penguin Michael Joseph for an ARC."
2,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47571190-beata,5,"Dr Richard Shepherd wrote a most honest book about his profession and his personal life. I am truly touched by his honesty, but first and foremost, by the respect he shows to all victims on whom he performed post mortem. Each victim received Dr Shepherd's full attention, and was treated with the utmost reverence. All stories are sad, the saddest are those of children who suffered abuse on the part of their parents .... Honesty which I mentioned refers also to the stress induced by his unique profession that put a strain on his own health and family life. This memoir is not an easy read but allowed me for the first time to learn about forensic pathology from a professional who is sincere and direct in a most respectful way.I listened to an audiobook read by the Author whose perfect diction and steady reading pace added to the delicate and difficult subject of the book.Five stars to the Author for the courage to write about his ups and downs, and for the respect which I felt throughout whole book.A thank-you to my GR Friends whose reviews encouraged me to read this book."
3,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32446295-somethingsnotright,5,"This is a brilliant memoir from the UK's leading forensic pathologist, Dr Richard Shepherd, seamslessly weaving together case studies from his work and details of his life story.Dr Shepherd has worked on some of the  most high profile cases during the course of his career, in the UK and internationally including:• The Hungerford Massacre (1987) - his first unsupervised major case and the one that left the first scar on his psyche.• The death of Princess Diana (1997)• The Clapham Rail Disaster (1998)• 9-11  (2001)• Bali bombing (2002)• 7/7 London bombings (2005)His writing is both clinical and warm, he shows his humanity in the face of the horrors he confronts in his work. He discusses candidly the PTSD that threatened to consume him. Having worked in vet medicine, there are cases that haunt me. I still dream about the third animal I ever euthanized (out of hundreds) and am obsessive about always checking the bodies of animals hit by cars in case they are still alive and suffering. I cannot imagine the impact of years of dealing with cases on the scale Dr Shepherd has. Honestly, I would be worried if it did not impact him. He discusses the reality of his profession being unlike TV where the forensic teams sweep in to find the critical evidence and save the day. Dr Shepherd describes police who sometimes view forensics with annoyance, particularly when the evidence does not fit their narrative. Dr Shepherd also covers his experiences as an expert witness.I enjoyed reading the medical bits - I laughed at some paragraphs about the beauty of the internal organs and structures of bodies. I feel the same but always felt slightly Jeffrey Dahmer-esque trying to explain to friends the beauty of smooth, pearly cartilage or the iridescent shimmer of the inside of an eyeball. Dr Shepherd writes:"" But I still had time to experience that sense of wonder at the body: its intricate systems, its colours and, yes, its beauty. For blood is not just red - it is bright red. The gallbladder is not just green, it is the green of jungle foliage. The brain is white and grey - and that is not the grey of a November sky - it is the silver-grey of darting fish. The liver is not a dull school-uniform brown, it is the sharp red-brown of a freshly ploughed field.""(p48)In detailing the putrefaction of bodies he describes: ""...the extraordinary and beautiful fern-like patterns of the veins closest to the surface"" as bacteria spreads through the blood vessels.(p101) If you are currently feeling queasy, this is where you should stop reading because the book also contains some interesting facts:• A person can die of bruising alone - rarely, but he describes the case of a 19 year old male sex worker who sustained 105 bruises and died of the resulting disseminated intravascular coagulation.• Adipose is the third stage of decomposition wherein the body's saturated fat undergoes a chemical change, turning it into a waxy, soap-like substance, preserving that part of the body like a waxwork. As the process progresses, it will turn grey and firm and, it can sometimes reveal the cause of death by preserving a bullet hole. • A drowned body will develop opaque, wrinkly skin often called ""washerwoman's hands"". After a few days left in the water the macerated skin will separate and peel off - a process known as ""de-gloving"".Dr Shepherd notes: ""This is no David Attenborough documentary"". He is not kidding. But it is fascinating and brilliant. "
4,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1170391-sara,4,"I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. When I saw this on Netgalley, I was intrigued. I was already reading a book on the concept of death and what comes after for bodies (Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers) so I was fascinated to read about the work of a pathologist in a world that still feels very inaccessible to the general public. The book encompasses many famous cases that Richard Shepherd has been directly involved with during what could be called the ‘golden age’ of pathology, as well as examining the personal troubles pathologists may face in the course of their career. My first thought while reading was just how ‘human’ Richard Shepherd came across in his writing. He treats his patients with obvious care, and has a great passion for the profession and with passing that knowledge on. It was lovely to read about an individual who actively seeks to improve their profession, not only for their own benefit, but for the greater good. His writing certainly made the concept of post mortem more acceptable and less ‘scary’ or morbid. I found the content itself rather mixed. I think this is a result of the fact it was written over a long period of time, and is full of information, but unfortunately not all of it is that compelling. I loved the chapters based around his work and cases, which ranged from mass disasters like the Marchioness sinking to famous cases such as the Stephen Lawrence murder and Princess Diana. These cases are often described quite clinically, with a detached scientific approach, of how the autopsies are carried out and the processes and agencies involved. It’s empathetic and to the point but without getting too personal. The earlier sections also include some almost ‘Sherlock Holmes’ style deductions to cases that helped determine what happened to the deceased, which I really enjoyed. However, these become less frequent as the book progresses due to the changing nature of pathology as a profession and the introduction of DNA evidence. There are also some truly heartbreaking chapters dedicated to the difficult, and often controversial, subject of child autopsies. The subject is dealt with delicately, with a range of cases explored, while still managing to convey the emotional difficulties encountered by all involved. I would say that the book does tend to jump from case to case quite rapidly, sometimes disrupting the overall flow of the book. As it progresses these examples of cases also become less frequent, which was a shame as I found them so interesting. However, the latter half is compelling on a more personal level, as we see the harsher realities of experiencing so much death, as well as the often unnerving cross examinations in court which can lead to self doubt and PTSD. I personally would have preferred less focus on the author’s private life as I was less interested in it, however it does make him feel more approachable. A thoughtful insight into a closeted world that’s told with obvious passion and extensive knowledge of the subject."
5,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18681658-arna,5,"This book was so fascinating! Part autobiography, part memoir, Unnatural causes is about Dr Shepard’s life and his work including high profile criminal cases and mass disasters. The writing was excellent, Dr Shepard describes everything in detail in a way that everyone can understand and not just in medical jargon. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀I loved this book. I’ll admit I didn’t really much about what forensic pathologists do so this work was a real eye opener into all that they do, it’s a lot more than just autopsies!⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀I’d recommend to anyone who enjoys doctor memoirs, this one is just of a slightly different kind. 👨🏻‍⚕️🕵🏻‍♂️"

And it is not caused by all of them. It is not caused by any particular disaster I have been involved in clearing up. And it is not caused by all of them. It is caused, in its entirety, by a lifetime of bearing first-hand witness to, on behalf of everyone–courts, relatives, public, society–man’s inhumanity to man.”Will review later. "
7,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24882791-india-m-clamp,4,"Reading about Dr. Richard Shepard (UK Pathologist) was not banal. Truly adored his utterly vivid description of the 911/Twin Towers trailers filled with body parts and his flair for recognizing the distinct smell of burned bodies. His cases are told to us rather void of emotion and in a style lacking melancholic variation in tone. During his career in the United Kingdom and America performing over 23,000 autopsies (which includes Princess Diana) called in when a suspicious or unexplained death occurred, and then Dr. Richard Shepherd was retained to painstakingly solve the enigma---with eagle-like focus---required to solve a questionable death. Light reading is not found here. Common questions at the crime scene where, at what range? At what direction and could the wound be self-inflicted? Death or injury by others to gain attention and other “Munchausen” revelations are highlighted as well and old familiar patterns are explained. Mercy too is given by Dr. Shepherd. “Perhaps I wanted to view that horrifying thing...called death. Pathology was interesting but forensic pathology was medicine and then some. I understood that, unlike other pathologists, the forensic pathologist does have patients...his patients are dead.” ---Richard Shepherd, MD Unnatural Causes is tear inspiring, shocking and sad. Death and science show/tell all. His own personal sacrifices for his profession: work with knives at the dinner table and almost missing an opera with his wife were just a few. No doubt this British pathologist has flawless record of care/advocacy for those who can no longer ask for justice. Brilliant."
8,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma,3,"There's something indescribably fascinating about what comes after death. And I don't mean the whole heaven/hell scenario, but what happens during the inevitable breakdown of our bodies, the processed falling apart of that place we inhabit before some event, some failure, or some person takes it from us. As a forensic pathologist, Dr Richard Shepherd has dealt with death of all types, from everyday, natural passing to murder sprees like that at Hungerford. Sounds good, right? However, this suffers on two fronts. The first being that it's not enough about the cases. I find the dead interesting, the drama of the doctor's life much less so, and there's far too much of the latter. My fault for not checking the focus, but honestly his struggles with his private life were not what I wanted to read about. The book sets a very emotional tone and it was hard going. Pretty quickly I decided to skip anything personal and just read about his work. However, this leads to the second problem- the basic and uninspiring nature of the storytelling. The book has no flow, it's stilted and manages to make even the sections dealing with murder a little bit tedious. Sadly, he is not one of those people who can transfer their exceptional talent into an engaging tale.So, if you want a medical memoir with a strong dose of personal reflection and emotional contemplation, this may be for you, but my recommendation would be to read All That Remains: A Life in Death. Unfortunately, this one is not nearly as interesting as it sounds.ARC via Netgalley"

In their universe, there was a complete absence of emotion. Not to mention its ugly sister, pain.""Dr Richard Shepherd is the UK's top forensic pathologist, having performed over 23,000 post-mortems. In Unnatural Causes, he examines the cases that have defined his fascinating career.One of the BEST non-fiction books I've listened to, perfectly combining my love of both true crime and science. The book kicks off with the first major incident he was in charge of, the Hungerford Massacre, and right away I knew I was gonna be hooked! His enthusiasm and passion, as well as his respect for those he works on, shines through for the entirety of this novel.Not only does Shepherd cover his professional life, but also gives some insight into his personal life in a way that is thankfully always relevant to his career (otherwise I wouldn't care). He covers so many topics and cases that he worked on - 9/11, Princess Diana's death, the Clapham Rail Disaster, 7/7 London bombings, the autopsies of babies...the list goes on. He also openly talks about self doubt and the PTSD that threatened to consume him. I honestly never wanted this one to end. I would recommend this to any true crime fan - especially if you're interested in the science that goes into it as well! 5 stars. "
10,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5349403-carolyn,3,"This book details the life and career of Dr. Richard Shepherd. From an early age he was interested in forensic pathology, a profession very few contemplate pursuing. After years of medical study, he achieved his goal of becoming a renowned UK pathologist. He conducted postmortems while always treating the deceased with utmost reverence and compassion, and spoke to the bereaved families with sympathy and sincerity. During his career, he was involved in some of the most sensational mass murders, terrorist attacks, and horrifying accidents. His expertise was often needed to determine if individual deaths were the result of murder, accidental, or natural causes. His conclusions were often different from those of detectives and disputed by lawyers and other pathologists when he testified in court as an expert witness. He felt the stress of possibly making a mistake but prevailed in the accuracy of his conclusions. He explains forensic pathology in a direct, none-sensational manner making the grim subject more palatable for the reader. I wished he had gone into more detail and given more information on solving the puzzles surrounding the cause of deaths. The narration was detached and dull when describing the most sensational and fascinating cases. He was always determined to find the truth and be an advocate for the deceased.  His work was all-consuming, and his detached manner took a toll on his home life and outside activities. Repressed feelings, stemming from his professional, objective manner from the 20,000 autopsies he conducted, finally led to panic attacks, and flashbacks the result of PTSD. I felt the narration switching back and forth between his medical work and his homelife interfered with the pace and flow of the book.I would have liked to read more about his involvement, theories and conclusions in some of his best-known cases; the death of Princess Diana, the Hungerford mass murder, the Clapham Train disaster, the Bali night club bombing, and the WTC 9/11 attack.  I had not anticipated so much autobiography, which is not my favourite type of reading. It puts his dedication and long hours of work in the context of his personal life. I believe it serves as a cautionary warning for people contemplating this type of profession."
11,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27078093-alice-lippart,4,"Fascinating, accessible and a little grim. "
12,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21413858-k-j-charles,0,"Absolutely excellent. A fascinating read about the life of a forensic pathologist, full of not just intriguing details about bodies and what we do to them, but also a lot of honesty about the emotional toll on the pathologist and the bereaved. Really compelling and extremely well and fluently written."
13,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16471876-liz-barnsley,4,"Usually with non fiction I read in dribs and drabs around my other reads – not so with “Unnatural Causes” which I read from cover to cover whilst barely drawing breath.A fascinating man and a fascinating life – Dr Richard Shepherd tells it how it is and his involvement in so many high profile cases makes this a hugely compelling look behind the scenes, beyond all those news stories and into the true realities. From Hungerford to 9/11 his very honest and genuinely compassionate way of describing events, challenges and difficult truths is endlessly, brilliantly evocative.What struck me was his way of giving as much to the smaller, everyday tragedies as to the hugely well known ones. Every case he takes on gets the same descriptively emotional resonance and his obviously moral determination that the truth will out, however unpalatable that truth may be.He is also very open about his own faults and rather than holding himself up as infallible, keeps the fact of his humanity and his own human errors – whether professional or personal – woven into the narrative as seamlessly as his successes. This makes for a genuine understanding of the world of Forensic pathology, a subject I now know more about than I ever thought I would, as well as of the man himself.I thought it was brilliant. I’m sure that Unnatural Causes barely scratches the surface of a life and career ongoing.Highly Recommended."
14,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47108351-anna-kaling,2,"Unnatural Causes suffers from a misleading blurb; this book wasn't written to share some of the science behind forensic pathology, but as a kind of therapy for the author as he nears retirement. That's not what I signed up for and why it gets two stars.I bought the book because I was interested in learning more about the science behind pathology, and how a corpse can help solve its own murder. Unnatural Causes did deliver this, although on quite a superficial level, but the science was overshadowed by reminiscences of the author's personal life, especially his unhappy marriage to the long-suffering Jen. Mine was the audiobook version, and it took over two hours for Mr Shepherd to finish talking about his childhood and marriage and actually get to some pathology.Most of the cases he focuses on in the book are interesting, although delivered in a pompous voice lacking in any humour. I wasn't expecting a laugh a minute in a book about dead bodies, but a bit of light relief would have been welcome. It didn't help that I listened to this straight after the excellent This Is Going To Hurt by Adam Kay, which managed to be exceptionally poignant AND make me laugh out loud.I was also annoyed that, in a book where Mr Shepherd labours the importance of truth and his own dedication to telling the truth at all costs, he constantly points out mistakes other people have made - the police, other pathologists, the courts - but not his own. When he finally does talk about a case where his actions were criticised by several knowledgeable people, he presents it as if he were the victim of a string of other people's errors and did absolutely no wrong. I would have liked to see some humility and acknowledgement that he's as human as the many, many people whose errors he mentions.I'm sure there are better books on pathology for laymen who want to understand some of the science; I've just ordered Stiff by Mary Roach and I hope it will deliver where Unnatural Causes didn't."

It was a raw and powerful read, definitely not one to tackle before bedtime due to the subject content. The author Richard has worked as a forensic pathologist for many years and has worked on high-profile cases including Princess Diana and Stephen Lawrence. Some of the chapters of the various cases were truly shocking and eye-opening. Does give you uneasy feels, however, does a good job breaking down what goes into forensics and criminology in general! "
16,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"This is a very personal memoir of a forensic pathologist. Of course the content is macabre. It also shows how society has changed its attitudes toward certain aspects of death, such as that of infants. From that of feeling sorry for the parents to immediate suspicion. The author also covers the falling apart of his marriage in a most sympathetic and humble manner, readily admitting to his failures as a husband. Definitely recommended! "
17,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5663034-k,4,"Trigger warnings: so very many graphic descriptions of autopsies and dead bodies. Also death of a parent, murder, rape, death, mental health, deaths in custody, disasters, terrorist attacks, car accidents, stabbings, death of a child, death of a baby etc etc etc. Look, it's a memoir by a forensic pathologist. If anything to do with death, descriptions of bodies, or murder is a trigger for you? I'd probably give this one a miss. I was hooked by this book from page 1 and I flew through it, which isn't especially common for me with nonfiction books. Shepherd tells a compelling story about his life and his career, as well as the impact that his career has had on his mental health. He discusses the difficulties of juggling a home life and a young family with being called out to crime scenes and autopsies at all hours. He talks about well-known cases he's worked on, as well as the things he was personally passionate about. He discusses the changes in the legal system and the impact it's had on forensics. Basically? It was FASCINATING from start to finish and I really enjoyed this. "
18,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21637893-chris-steeden,3,"Dr Richard Shepherd is a forensic pathologist who is now in his 60’s and has performed over 20,000 post-mortems. This is going to be one hell of a read. I thought.His first major incident, that he was in-charge of, was the Hungerford massacre. The description of when he went to the scene was just horrific. Real nightmare stuff. Checking out the bodies in-situ where they fell after being shot by Michael Ryan. He killed 16 people. What a start to the book. Gross but compelling.Shepherd does cover a lot of cases but not in as much depth as I thought. I expected a case per chapter like the Hungerford massacre but there was an awful lot of personal information in there and it all felt a bit disjointed. He goes over some of the big events like the Clapham rail crash, the Marchioness sinking and the story of poor Rachel Nickell in amongst others. As you can see this is a very UK-centric book. When he qualified, he was installed at Guy’s Hospital in London under the UK’s best-known pathologist, Dr Iain West. I can see why he put in a lot of the personal information as it was very relevant to his job. It is especially relevant to any of those people thinking of getting into this field. The job will affect you and it will affect your family. It is all consuming, that much is made clear. It was his life. Even when he was cutting the Sunday roast joint he was still thinking about different types of knives to use and how they cut. Lovely. His ‘love’ for his job is laid bare. The way he describes cutting bodies is like an art form. The parts I found interesting were the actual cases though. Some of them are hard to read as they deal with infanticide, traffic accidents, stabbings, shootings etc. He goes into details on ones where the outcome looks obvious but he finds evidence of other foul or dubious play. These were fascinating.All-in-all it was a good read but not a great one for me."

This is an intriguing narrative, a creative memoir that discusses the changes in society and attitudes to policing, medicine and science in an easy to read format that is engaging and illuminating.

Richard Shepherd is a forensic pathologist who has dealt with some of the UK's biggest tragedies and this is his story. At times it is a difficult read due to the fact that it deals with ""mans inhumanity to man"" as he says himself, and it is not nice to read about. His own personal journey and emotions were well written, and it is definitely an emotive read. Recommended for sure if you like medical non-fiction."

Captivating insight into what goes on behind the scenes of crimes and at the morgue with details of famous and less famous but no less fascinating real life cases. For me, listening to this book takes me back to a riveting summer spent observing and assisting in autopsies for my elective term at university. While I concede it's a field that provides endless variety and challenges, it is also harrowing and confronting in displaying the evils that people are capable of. I therefore take my hat off to Dr Shepherd for his lifetime commitment to serve the truth and to get justice for victims of crimes and their families. Well written and delivered by the man himself."

He offered support after the 9/11 attacks on New York City, the London 7/7 bombings and even the death of princess Diana in the summer of 1997. The authors humility and never ending desire to find the truth at whatever cost is what comes across most strongly in his book - he repeatedly details how he had to learn to detach himself emotionally from his patient in order to find out the true cause of death. It’s simply astounding just how much the human body can tell us about the dying process. What is perhaps most touching is that writing this book has acted as a cathartic activity for the author and helped him to reflect on the impact his career has had on his own mental health, family life and wellbeing. Highly recommend for anyone interested in the link between crime and the medical sciences. "
24,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2040938-helen,5,"5 stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐This proved to be a fascinating account of the career and personal life of one of the country's foremost forensic pathologists, a gentleman who comes across as genuinely caring about the people he's working for - not just the dead themselves, but their families and wider society. Equally clear is that he cares about the noble principles of truth, justice and integrity, even in the face of incredibly challenging circumstances. The cases he worked on or was involved in were both run of the mill and of international interest, from bar brawls to the Hungerford massacre. There's enough science and anatomy described to satisfy the curiosity of readers with a particular interest in the forensic side without being off-putting to the less scientifically-minded. Dr Shepherd's account is made all the more engaging for his sometimes tumultuous personal life and eventual struggle with anxiety and PTSD, which I was happy to read he has come to manage, and that the writing of this book was part of the process of coming to terms with all he's seen and done. Remarkable man and a well-written, accessible and fascinating book. Highly recommended for those with an interest in medicine and forensics. "

It was a lot of fun, very interesting (albeit not detailed enough for me lol, I know I'm weird) but after that it was only downhill for me. The remaining chapters until I had maybe 50 pages left were extremely dull imo, I lost interest and I just didn't really care about any of the information given. I can't think of a specific reason except that I was just genuinely not interested and I guess I just expected something else? It was quite dull. The last 50 pages were a little more interesting but unfortunately I was just really happy when I reached the final page, and thinking ""wow, I finally finished this book"" should not be the first thought when reading the last few sentences.Overall a very informative and insightful read that was also entertaining at times!"
26,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3846535-christina-mcdonald,5,"I've been trying to weave more nonfiction books into my reading lately and have found I really enjoy medical memoirs. Unnatural Causes was high on my list to read, and I wasn't disappointed.Unflinchingly honest, fascinatingly told and impeccably written, Dr. Shepherd tells of all sorts of death, from serial killer to natural disaster, horrific murders to freak accidents. I read with a sort of morbid curiosity, expecting to be a little grossed out, but everything was told quite clinically. Although details are definitely not spared, Dr. Shepherd writes about everything--from the autopsy itself, to speaking to family members, to speaking in court--with a calm and sensitive air that I found myself really respecting.What I found really interesting is that Dr. Shepherd didn't shy away from the ways he's been touched and affected in his pursuit for the truth. This book is a beautiful account of how his personal life, his family life, and mental health, suffered, and yet he remains committed to respecting the dead and finding the truth.I highly recommend this book if you enjoy medical memoirs."
27,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34073754-sara-marsden,5,"I devoured this book in a few hours, something I’ve not managed to do for a while now.I love reading about forensic science and this is perhaps the best of the nonfiction books I’ve read on the subject. Shepherd’s enthusiasm for his work and his respect for the people he worked on just shines through the pages. It’s incredible that someone who has such an emotionally taxing job that involves having to become quite resilient and hardened to death writes in such a poetic way with such tenderness towards these people. As he mentioned this is a man who has performed over 20,000 post-mortems and he hasn’t even retired yet. Considering the work cases he was on, many high profile, there is no arrogance here. He’s brutally honest about his life and his attitude towards displaying emotion in such a raw and refreshing way. I really loved it. This is how you write a memoir. I’d highly recommend this to anyone with an interest in forensics. I learnt a lot about the biology but also the politics that goes on regarding forensic pathology A wonderful read."
28,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2940271-undrakh,4,"Despite how I've learnt uncomfortably lot about cadavers, I was also reminded of death's power in bringing people closer to life. An heightened awareness of fragile existence - not an easy thought of course, but I think it grounds people. This was a great example of no-nonsense life story of someone who dedicated himself to the science and practice of pathology which he deeply believed to be honorable and humane work; nobody can disagree with this after reading this book. P.S. The book contains graphic descriptions of murder scenes, major disasters, very detailed process of postmortem (autopsy), so if you think you maybe sensitive to subjects like this, it might be best to skip this one."

Unnatural Causes
 is the memoir of one of Britain's top forensic pathologists, Dr Richard Shepherd. This memoir chronicles Dr Shepherd's prolific career, as well as his personal life and how certain milestones helped and hindered his career.I'm a huge true crime fan and I especially love reading books by people who work in forensics or crime investigation. This book was a delight to read! When I say Dr Shepherd is a prolific forensic pathologist, I mean prolific. The man worked on over 23,000 post-mortems, including several of Britain's biggest disasters such as the Hungerford massacre and the Marchioness boat crash on the River Thames. I thoroughly enjoyed this book from start to finish, and highly recommend to anyone who has a love of true crime. Great read!"

And the effect his consuming dedication to his career had on his marriage, family and his own personal health.Told in a sympathetic manner which many will find comforting it is a very touching read.Most readers I am sure will take some new knowledge from the peek in to forensic pathology that Dr Shepherd gives us with his extensive expertise in this field.A very unique and interesting account.My thanks go to the author, publisher and Netgalley in providing this arc in return for honest review."
32,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44143662-evie-braithwaite,3,"While I thought this was a fascinating insight into forensic pathology, I wish there was more detail about the strange cases Dr Shepherd touched upon over his sweeping 30-year career. This man was involved in some of the most famous forensic cases in Britain. However, there was more attention on his private life and the ins and outs of his disintegrating first marriage. This could partly be down to the monotonous narration of the audiobook, but ultimately, I was underwhelmed. "
33,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108050788-beth-mulhall,5,"This might just be the best book I’ve read all year. I loved it from start to finish and sometimes had to stop myself reading it so that the whole thing would last longer. The author managed to balance the harsh reality of the medical side of his life with the extremely personal side to create a completely engrossing narrative. His career seems so extraordinary that it reads like fiction, and yet these horrific events that he was a key part of actually happened, and to experience them from another angle was fascinating. "

It fuelled my curiosity regarding this line of work while being 100% respectful of the dead and their families. I felt so many emotions; shock, upset and sympathy to name a few. Famous events were not sensationalised to add effect yet the day to day work carried out was described in a way that made me turn page after page! "
35,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35014606-aqsa,4,"Shepherd is a forensic pathologist with a long career, and has worked on many high profile cases like the Hungerford massacre and the Marchioness disaster. But the smaller individual cases were just as interesting and educational, as he builds up an image of crimes based on the injuries of its victims.He treats these cases with respect and professionalism, but the book doesn’t fall into the trap of becoming a series of dry facts because he shares his own struggles too - his family life, his inability to open up, difficulties in knowing what to say to relatives of the dead and in witness stands as lawyers increasingly question his competence in the pursuit of winning their cases.There were moments where I couldn’t empathise, but for the most part I think this was a valuable read, especially to have matter of fact, scientific explanations around death, when it is so often a mysterious and fearsome concept."
36,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54159531-ruthy-lavin,4,"A fantastic, one sitting read, bringing enlightening insight into the fascinating life of Dr Richard Shepherd, eminent Forensic pathologist. He has worked on more than 230,000 autopsies, which is incredible in its own right, over a career spanning 40 years. Some of his cases are extremely high profile - Princess Diana being one of them. Written honestly and openly, this book is a revelation."
37,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4480250-jim-sullivan,4,"4.0*This is a must read for readers who enjoy the crime genre where postmortems are part of the story. It gives insight, facts and helps you have a greater understanding.It is nonfiction and gives deep insight to the forensic pathologist occupation. The account is frank and honest. Dr Richard Shepherd opens himself to the reader without holding back his vulnerabilities. He puts all of his story out without favor to himself. This is a courageous thing to do, given that we all hold back aspects of ourselves because of fear of being judged by others. His open and honest account of his marriage and his flaws made me warm to his person.Writing the book as therapy following years of stress that climax in PTSD shows that this is a very personal book for him. Dr Shepherd performed over 23,000 postmortems throughout his career spanning 40 years. His pride in his contribution to humankind shines through his book. The insight that he gives to a profession that most people cringe from is profound. As with most people, I wonder how pathologists cope with postmortems, many who are in advanced states of decomposition. Dr Shepherds matter of fact account of the work and his sensitive and respectful approach removes much of the repulsion I previously felt with deceased bodies.The book helped me grow personally. Before reading this book, there is no way I would view the body of a loved one who had decomposed, however after reading this book I would consider it.Dr Shepherds thirst for the truth on how people die motivated by giving their being a respectful last rite, filled me with admiration for him and his profession.The changing times particularly expressed in privatizing his profession has led to a drop in the search for the truth is a sad and worrying development. Academic research in causes of death nowadays is almost nonexistent and society is poorer as a result. This trend could be arrested by restoring public funding to the profession, but this seems unlikely.I applaud Dr Shepherd and thank him for sharing his professional and personal life.My rating criteria is..I round down5.0 - Amazing4.5 - I loved it4.0 - I liked it a lot3.5 - I Liked it3.0 - It was OK2.5 - Just2.0 - I wouldn't bother1.5 - I didn't like it much1.0 - I disliked it"

Surely a memoir by him would be chock-a-block full of interesting info on pathology and autopsies and forensic science?Nope.Instead we get a whole lot about his disintegrating first marriage - spoiler alert - and a lot about the admin involved in being a pathologist. yay.There are cases he outright refuses to really discuss at all, claiming that basically the readership can't handle it, and for the others, well, not a lot is said either.The writing style was fairly easy to read - I devoured this in a few days - but the substance of it was not."
39,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83796025-mommy-reads-and-reviews,4,This book describes the author’s professional life as forensic pathologist. As a psychologist I find death fascinating. Maybe I should rephrase that. I find human’s response to death fascinating. Fascinatingly too where Dr Shepherd’s cases. His final burn out and PSTD is actually totally natural. As he describes panic attacks and invasive images (flash backs) I found myself nodding in understanding. His mind has had a totally normal response to doing a job which most of us couldn’t imagine doing. So a big hats off to Dr Shepherd and his incredible career and work!
40,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1740824-jo,4,Shepherd is one of the UK's top forensic pathologists; this is his story. He has worked on many high profile cases from serial killers to terrorist attacks to mass murders. This was fascinating and an absorbing read.
41,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19218176-flapper72,5,"Amazing book. Obviously kindle recommends have got me sussed! Another book I downloaded after a recommendation from amazon and a cheap deal. I always then admit that I'm a medic and wonder if that might make me see some of these books differently but I think that this really would be a great read for everyone. A forensic pathologist who has been involved in so many high profile cases during his career it really is quite astounding. Hungerford, Stephen Laurence, Rachel Nickel, Lady Di, 9/11 etc etc etc. It's a part of medicine I never really think about but the way that forensic pathologist used to work was astounding - being called out to crimes, seeing victims in situ, taking notes there, then, back to the mortuary, full external examination and then the part we all think about, the internal examination. Patients are still referred to as patients and the forensic pathologist was integral to all these crimes and paid by the government. His experience leaves me speechless and the all encompassing way that cases would take over his life. Thinking about the wounds, the bruising, the way the patient was found. Thinking back to other cases, other experiences and learning from them so that, over his career, he became an expert in knife crime - what knife caused the crime, which wound caused the injury. Also, how he instigated change in restraint of vulnerable individuals and set up a training course after he noticed an increasing number of people dying whilst being restrained. I know this review is all over the place but, genuinely, it was quite amazing. Not surprisingly, it took it's toll on Dr Shepherd personally. Also, there has been a change in funding of forensic pathologists such that the government (universities, medical schools) no longer pay forensic pathologists to lecture and thus they are now self employed. They're maybe not called in early in crimes or unclear deaths, we, as a population might suffer not knowing things and not being able to change for the future. The experience of a career and working as part of a team meant that Dr Shepherd was able to change things for us, the British public, (restraint of vulnerable individuals leading to increased death, Rachel Nickel's death being linked to another similar attack, his experience in knife injuries being used in convicting Stephen Laurence's killers) I worry that in this brave new world where pathologists are only called if it's blatantly obviously does a disservice to many people in our society who are no longer able to tell their story.

42,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10281457-laura,4,"Book reviews on www.snazzybooks.com This is such an interesting book; it's right up my street as it sort of combines elements of 'true crime' with medicine and gives me, as the reader, an insight into how forensic pathology works - these combined together makes a truly intriguing read!Richard Shepherd writes in quite a factual way, so if you're a fan of dramatic retellings then you're probably better looking elsewhere. I am glad of this; it lends the proper respect and care to the work - after all, most of the content is about people who have died, and this book highlights the stress and pressures of being a forensic pathologist. It also opened my eyes to the political implications of some cases, without being too dry or complicated. At times I felt a bit queasy reading about the autopsies but that's no surprise as I'm not great with gory details!I absolutely loved that the book covers so many key historical moments, some of which I remembered and some I'd heard about - these included: Princess Diana's death in 1997 and the absolute furore over the incident; 9/11; the murder of Stephen Lawrence, and many more. It was so interesting to read about well-known cases from a different point of view - namely from that of the pathologist working the case. The many things they have to consider, and the wide-range of medical knowledge which is required to do their job, is something I found very interesting to read about.I think I'd prefer less information about the author's personal and family life - although this does of course feed into elements of his career and the pressure of trying to juggle family life with big cases - but the interesting case details more than made up for this in my opinion!Many thanks to Michael Joseph for providing a copy of this novel on which I chose to write an honest and unbiased review."

Having now devoured it in less than a day, I can see why there was such a long hold line. This is a fascinating book, a fantastic partner read to ‘Smoke Gets In Your Eyes’ if you ever feel inclined toward a binge read session about death, and an insight into a profession that is little discussed. I got into law with the aim of eventually joining the coroners court, bouncing from once wanting to be a forensic pathologist, so when the author describes his pursuit of truth in the deaths of people and his marvel at the human body, I empathise completely. Every single person in their death deserves to be accorded respect, and their families and loved ones answers. While the author covers some very high profile cases (like the Hungerford Massacre), there’s also a lot of detail and care in the cases of people who did not lead extraordinary lives. The respect the author pays every case he had was wonderful. There’s also a fascinating insight into the way that these kinds of jobs coexist awkwardly with the vicissitudes of life- navigating your children trying to determine who stabbed who in one of your cases, for instance. The humanity the author brings to this difficult topic was illuminating, and reminds us that those who pursue what others consider ‘ghoulish’ careers still live as the rest of us do. This was such a good read, and I only wish it were longer and had more cases. "
44,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10803624-fiction-addition-angela,3,"This is a memoir from Dr Richard Shepherd who during his career has been involved in some high profile cases including;The Hungerford Massacre, 9-11, Bali Bombing, 7/7 London Bombing, Princess Diana’s death and The Clapham Rail Disaster. Dr Shepherd is a forensic pathologist who is now in his sixties and has performed around 25,000 Post - mortems. If your interested in the what happens to our bodies after death this book is for you. It isn’t easy reading and I was surprised at how wide his work responsibilities stretched. His writings has both elements work- clinical and his family life and being a caring human being. He also goes on to talk about his own battles with PTSD. This book does jump around quite a bit and it can lose its flow. A lot of his personal life is involved in here so if you just want the forensic pathology element it’s more than that.Overall I am always fascinated by true crime stories and evidence and also by out bodily functions and how fascinating the human body is. So I did enjoy it but I thought some parts jumped too much and for me there was a tad too much of his personal life. Recommend for those interested in medicine and forensics but definitely not a light read. 3 Stars"
45,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55895088-adam-croston,4,"Corona Lockdown Book #10I bought this book on a whim, being impressed by the comments of praise attributed to it. (The bargain sale price helped also).I don’t care for medical science, not since failing to engage with basic high school biology, nor was I particularly invested in the medical explanations in this book (as well put as they were). The enjoyment I took from this book was in experiencing a fascinating career of a brilliant man, told in his very own, honest words. Dr Shepherd’s journey through pathology has seen him conduct post-mortems on over 23,000 body’s, from homicides to victims of the most horrific disasters, he packs a lot of their stories into these 400-or-so pages. And that’s what I most appreciated about his memoir, his methods, reasoning, and life experience of the truth. Both his personal truth, and the truth told by the bodies of the dead are laid bare. This was a truly moving memoir, which given my presumption that forensic pathologists are cold, detached beings, makes this book all the more surprising. "
46,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70759152-lesley-mclean,4,"An honest and remarkable account of the good Doctor’s years in pathology. Remarkable because of the many significant cases his career has involved, and the number of bodies he has examined, using his science to prise open their secrets. The book covers event after event, from his starting days involved with the Hungerford Massacre, to the sinking of the Marchioness, and his involvement in uncovering the truths of many cases since. His memoir is never sensationalist, and is always respectful to the dead and the living left behind.Although based in science, his book is never heavy-going (though it does occasionally skirt the borders of it when he’s detailing minutiae as if he is in the mortuary with the body on the table).If you are interested in what happens when there is a questionable death, whether of an individual or in a full-blown incident, this is a fantastic book explaining the procedures and the relationships between the departments involved. Well worth a read."
47,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17445096-gayle-noble,4,"Dr Richard Shepherd has had a long and distinguished career in forensic pathology, and has worked on some of the UK's most famous cases including the notorious Harold Shipman, a doctor who killed many, perhaps hundreds of his patients. Dr Shepherd has also worked on the fallout from some of the worst terrorist attacks and disasters of the last thirty years.I've always had an interest in forensic science and pathology is definitely one area that fascinates me. Whilst reading this book, I was struck by how different the actual job is to what is portrayed onscreen. (I was absolutely aghast, and yet not surprised, at the fact that pathology has been allowed to fall prey to the academic insistence on research above all and perhaps even cost-cutting. Very sad state of affairs. Especially when you consider what an important job it is.) I felt that the author did a good job of balancing out the personal information alongside the work. The author was also extremely honest about his dealings with PTSD and having his competency questioned towards the end. Naturally I found the cases compelling reading, especially the ones about Diana, Princess of Wales, and the sinking of the Marchioness. They were detailed without being sensationalist, graphic without being overly gory. It is a fascinating book and one that I would recommend to anyone with an interest in this area.

48,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10248931-lynne,4,"Far more years ago than I care to remember, Professor Keith Simpson's autobiography 'Forty Years of Murder' both gripped and fascinated my adolescent brain. Interestingly, Dr Shepherd also references Professor Simpson frequently, stating that his text book on forensic pathology sparked his desire to follow in his hero's footsteps. Unlike Simpson's entertaining autobiography, this does not divide chapters into infamous cases such as Haigh and Heath, but focuses more on Dr Shepherd himself. This doesn't mean that many of his experiences are unfamiliar, indeed he shares dealing with the Marchioness disaster, the aftermath of September 11, as well as tragic murder cases such as that of Rachel Nickell.Above all, Shepherd is honest in discussing his feelings and the resulting PTSD that assaulted him late in his career as well as an inevitably crumbling marriage. Engagingly written and accessible to those with no knowledge of medical or criminal procedure whatsoever. "

Dr Richard Shepherd is one of the countries top Forensic Pathologists & has done post mortems on such high cases such as Stephen Laurence, Rachel Nickell, the Marchioness disaster on the Thames, Hungerford victims, Shipmans victims, 9/11 & many many more. This led to a fantastic read that goes indepth to the daily life of a pathologist & also the adverse affects the stresses can have on a family unit.

The writing style was honest, visceral and all-encompassing. Richard Shepherd comes across as not only a fastidious pathologist keen to get to the truth, but a caring human being (albeit with faults like the rest of us which he is not shy to admit). Most of the cases he quotes from the 1980's I sadly remember, particularly Hillsborough which was poignant for my part of the world. And the Rachel Nickell murder sticks in my mind due to its shocking nature at the time. Fascinating, heartbreaking, shocking, and well worth a read. "
51,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30833806-paul,5," In reading Dr. Shepherd's book I was returning to a subject I have looked at before. But with those books the always dealt with how this profession came to be. With the most recent being that of Professor Keith Simpson. It was only taking this book up in my hands did I finial make it to a far more contemporary look at the world of pathology. It is a subject that I am more than aware that most people don't want to peek behind the curtain of. It's gruesome and grizzly. I suspect that it is only the findings the will interest people. But for me, there is something truly fascinating about finding out how these men and women pull the clues from our bodies and piece together who we came to our ends.  This book blends his own life's story with that of the advancements within his chosen field. It allowed me to gain some perspective on how things have changed over the years. It strikes me that somethings or should I say the way in which they go about it. probably has not changed all that much. But the tools at there disposal have moved forward in leaps and bounds. In reading this book I started to realize that crimes that are now common placer for prosecution only a few decades ago my have gone completely missed. It is staggering to read, we all assume that these men and women are invaluable and that the must know everything about how the human heart stops beating. But as I discovered they are only as good as the research and knowledge that is available to them. To his credit, this is one man who has always tried his best by those who end up on his cutting table.  The style in which the author chooses to set out his story, at least for me makes it a very accessible book to read. He blends his lives story in with cases that are both unknown and those at least to the people of England well known. For me, this adds a great deal for those who have been forgotten it gives them a voice and allows us to remember them. It also focuses on them and not on those who had killed them. It gave me a real human insight into the work this author does. Which may sound weird but to often in books of this ilk feel very clinical and with the detachment I to feel a lack of empathy for those I read about. But Dr. Shepherd has delivered a book that will draw you into his world and make you pay attention. I found it astounding that one man came to work on so many cases that were spread across our papers and news for so long. With this comes a great deal of stress and worry. I was surprised to read how the author explained how this came to affect him. It is a subject that is never to my knowledge talked about. We accept that these people choose to do these kinds of jobs and that is the end of it. So it came across as a very brutal and raw thing to read. With this book, I got to learn a great deal about the modern work of pathology. It is at times a dark place to live. To passages that deal with infant death where some of the hardest for me to read. There is nothing worse than reading about a life cut so short. But at least Dr. Shepherd was there to speak for those who can't. I would highly recommend you giving this book a chance as it is a subject that while we may not want to look at is still important and Dr. Shepherd has done an amazing job in conveying this world. "
52,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4570995-evelin,4,"I’ve been a sucker for good (and occasionally weird) medical literature for quite a long time. So thank you, Silja, for getting me this one. It was quite a handful, since the work of a forensic pathologist is harsh and Shepherd doesn’t spare the reader from gloomy details (will never forget the hands). The more I am in awe of the sympathy and warmth he puts into his work and into this book. It winded down a bit for me towards the end, might be because it was a bit too long, but I really liked last 20-or-so pages, tied the story up nicely."
53,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4981259-gizzard,3,Maybe right between 3 and 4 (3 is a good but average book for me). This has a lot more personal memoir than I was expecting and that part was a mixed bag. The pathologist parts and history were quite good. The personal memoir about growing up was also good. The parts about his first wife and his children had too much self justification for leaving his first marriage. It was almost eye rolling towards the end. He takes responsibility for his failings but every comment on the decades long marriage is foreshadowing a split.
54,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18933829-andi,5,Brilliant! I feel as though I have learnt so much about death and how our bodies die. Also how the system works when someone has had a tragic death. I watch and read lots of crime dramas but this book describes it at the coal face! Absolutely mesmerising stuff! Thank you for your care and expertise Dr. Shepherd but please don’t take this the wrong way but I don’t want to meet one of your colleagues 😉. 
55,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15204358-danielle,5,"Unnatural Causes is an autobiography, memoir of Britain’s top forensic pathologist.It’s never an area that I have thought much about but it is truly incredible. To be able to identify from a dead body, the exact cause of death is fascinating.The cases that Dr Shepherd writes about include high profile cases such as Lady Diana, serial killers and mass murderers, terrorist and natural disasters. It was interesting to read how pathology had changed from when he first began practicing to how it is now. With body fat, tattoos and piercings and self-harm being more common it today’s society. I am in awe of any pathologist who can do autopsies on humans of all ages who have experienced so many causes of death and be able to separate their own lives from their work. Shepherd had his own personal experiences and described his PTSD as being caused by seeing constantly man’s inhumanity to man.A really fascinating and interesting book.🥼🔪 🧬 💀"
56,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52318338-louise,5,"An outstanding book that has you gripped from the first page to the last. Not for everyone - there are some scenes that some may describe as gruesome - but the care and dedication that Shepherd puts into his work from day 1 is incomparable. A must-read for anyone with any remote interest in the medical, pathology, or forensics field. "
57,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739605-helen-costello,4,"I'm well known for my love of books on a medical theme so this one was always going to be up my street. With some autobiographies they can be a bit dry though but I needn't have worried about this one. Its incredible how many well known disasters Richard Shepherd has been involved in but for each post mortem he always treats each of the deceased with respect. For all my love of medical procedures (reading about them, not having them!) I can still be rather squeamish but this book didn't bother me. There are descriptions of bodies having post mortem and murder scenes but it is so fascinating that there was no need to feel nauseous."
58,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4877957-denise,5,"Fascinating insights into the life and long and distinguished career of forensic pathologist Dr Richard Shepherd, who was involved in some of the most high profile cases in the UK over the past four decades. An absolutely compelling read, both for the intriguing cases discussed and for the honest portrayal of the high emotional toll working with death for so long takes. "
59,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115612745-frances-elgar,4,"Here continues my morbid obsession with hospitals, crime and death (who doesn’t love a good murder mystery!!).Reviews raved about this book, and I must say they were right! After being a massive fan of Silent Witness I was prepared for the gory details that would be described in the book - but was impressed with the sensitivity and realness Dr Shepherd gave to each individual case he described in the book.At times, it was incredibly heavy (what else do you expect from a pathologist's life story though!), and it took a good 100 pages for me to get stuck in. A quick moving, case filled with gory murder details? No, but an depth and substantial knowledge and education of pathology and the science behind it was fascinating.The descriptions of the 9/11 site, the Bali bombings and the death of Princess Diana really stuck with me. Here is someone with first hand experience of these events and how the aftermath was handled. The book is well and truly fascinating."
60,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28283498-marissa,3,"I was anticipating a good read but feel very let down. I expected this book to be more medical and not so much about the personal life of Dr. Shepard himself. I still found it to be an interesting read, however I wish there was more discussion and detail about the forensic pathology aspect. 3.5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️ "
61,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8545345-kelly,3,"I have been trying to write this review for ages because I have warring opinions.Generally, this book was incredibly interesting and I loved that it was easy to read but still packed with information, facts and real cases. It was quite emotive due to the nature of the cases, despite the actual writing tone being matter of fact and as unemotive as the author. I did not mind the concurrent chronicles of Shepherd's personal life - mainly because I am a nosy bitch. I thought that seeing the impact on Shepherd personally and on his family life was a consequence that many do not consider when thinking of the life of a pathologist - all glammed up by CSI type shows.I did not find the chronological approach the easiest to follow. I thought that it would have been better to chapter off the different cases and weave the personal elements into the cases. As it was, the cases stretched over a number of years and I struggled to keep track of where some had finished when they were mentioned later. I also felt that the personal elements were tacked on the end rather clunkily because they fit with the timing.My biggest issue however was with the tone at times, finding it often arrogant and at times it came.aceoss as biased. I also found the tone infuriating when speaking of women.The marriage to Jen was written in a way that suggests that Shepherd's life would have been easier if Jen hadn't wanted to further her career and become a Dr. There were times when he really spoke about her as if she should have been willing to sacrifice her life for his career. Then he would tack a sentence on saying, but I was proud of her so I suffered! Heaven forbid that he had to look after his own children to help his wife. There was also this compulsive need to remind us that he was a good father.Secondly - and I cannot stress how much this pissed me off. We have spent the whole book being told about the careers of the white men folk and how hard they worked and how skilled they were. Then in walks Vesna Djurovic. Dr Djurovic is an eminent pathologist. Yet this is how Shepherd describes her when she starts working at Guys:'...tall, blonde, leggy woman...who wore a short skirt and a friendly smile.'Absolutely no indication of her skillset or experience.He then speaks of her being 'claimed' by his boss Iain. Like she is a goldfish at the fair. Iain eventually marries her, congrats to them. Shepherd seems to give more respect to the dead than a live woman with a sterling career.Likewise, Jen became a Dr while raising kids with a largely absent husband and later in life. But when asked about the issues in his marriage he doesn't admit that he cannot connect to her emotionally or that the absences of BOTH OF THEIR JOBS are taking a toll, he says that she doesn't make him dinner. That is why their marriage isn't working. That traditional role of the little lady that proves her love for her husband. Dr Jen doesn't make him dinner. Bad woman.It was clear that Shepherd harboured ill-feeling when he described Iain and Vesna as a star couple of the pathology world. Citing their forays into social life and noting that he couldn't have this role because bloody Jen had decided to better herself and her job as a Dr meant that they didn't have the time to party. Honestly, I really felt for Jen throughout this book.I genuinely thought that this was going to be a strong 4, if not 5 star review but as the tone of arrogance grew and Shepherd seemed more incapable of taking criticism or admitting to errors, whether personal or professional, I started losing my interest in Shepherd and my rating dwindled"

Dr Shepherd worked on some of the most notable cases in recent British history. (Hungerford massacre, Marchioness disaster, Stephen Lawrence and many more). I learned about people finding the mummified bodies of newborns in their attics/ under their floorboards, something I had never heard of before.At the end of the book too the author talks about his mental health and the effect his career had on it. For a job that requires you to distance yourself from the emotions of it all, I thought it was refreshing and needed that he spoke about his mental health."

Dr Shepherd had worked on many cases included 9/11, the Hungerford massacre and the sinking of the Marchioness, Harold Shipman cases and the terrorist attack in Bali. He has had an incredible career which has taken him all over the globe. I certainly couldn't do his job but the fact he still has the same passion for it as when we first started out is amazing and admirable. 5 out of 5 stars doesn't seem enough."

69,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19863335-molly,4,"I read this on recommendation of my sister who was thoroughly amused with the gruesome depictions of deaths and the process of decomposition, so when I started reading I assumed it would be like many other pieces of work which are essentially science communication as entertainment. This was different though. Sheperd weaves stories of his work with personal narrative, giving a slowly building sense of how his work affects his life and relationships, without ever making you doubt his dedication to forensic pathology. I wished that at some points he had been clearer over what year we were in as I tried to work out his age and experience, and this was not aided by the oscillation through time that the book makes. That said, the back and forth does feel authentically like a story you might be told by a relative, if only it were more clearly signposted. The cases discussed are always treated carefully and with respect, and it is refreshing to see Sheperd critique his own work and offer up his vulnerability throughout the book. His attitudes towards the crimes against and by women and black people are more nuanced than would sadly be expected from a person of his age, and it was empowering to read that this white middle class man used his positions of power to do something to help. My personal issue with the writing was with some of the clinical language used, it is understandable given the topics covered and the mental state of the author why such clinical language is employed, but I know that words such as ‘obese’, while medically accurate, can be difficult for some readers. Overall I enjoyed the book immensely, it tackles tough topics with kindness and compassion and is a rare insight into the intersect between the work and personal life of a professional in their field under the heavy weight of trust and opinion."
70,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8675686-kristiana,5,Incredibly interesting insight into forensic pathology and also the struggles of balancing being at the top of a profession and family life.

73,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108250738-samantha-hood,4,"I had high hopes for this book and I definitely enjoyed it, but it didn't quite hit the spot to be a 5* read. If you are interested in pathology, murders, or serious crimes and you've never really thought about how the pathologists feel, their first experience with a dead body or their first-ever autopsy on their own then you will ultimately love this book. The first couple of chapters are brilliant. They're such a mind-blowing insight into what pathology really is and the training that goes into being a pathologist is far more than you would ever anticipate considering they 'only deal with the dead'... it is SO much more than that. It's a very well written book; informative and upsetting at times, however, I found the parts relating to Richard Shepherd's personal life a little dull at times. I don't think they ultimately fitted within the themes of this book although I do understand the parts where he introduces his wife and children so as to ensure the reader understands the difficulties of juggling such an on-call job... it really is a way of life, a lifestyle and not just a job. However, other parts I really didn't feel were necessary. Aside from that, I thoroughly enjoyed this and learning more about autopsies and how the emergency services require such detailed descriptions when pursuing a charge or even just providing some understanding to bereaved families. A pathologist has such an important job and I hope from reading this book that people realise how important they truly are. "

I love medical non fiction and this is definitely one of the best ones I've ever read. Its incredibly fascinating and interesting. Richard worked on so many cases, including some very famous and high profile ones. I learnt so much about pathology from this book. It is not dry at all, which I know puts some people off non fiction. It was written in a very accessible, easy to read way. It also was very personal. You found out a lot about his own life, which I was not expecting going in but it was a pleasant surprise. However, I would give caution going into this book. It gives very graphic descriptions of some very sad real life cases including: suicide, violent crime, stabbings, murder, mass tragedies and disasters, shootings and SIDS. It's not an easy read in that sense so definitely exercise caution if that's the kind of thing that triggers you. Overall, I really enjoyed this book and I learnt a lot from it.TW: PTSD, suicide, graphic descriptions of death, disease and the body after its died.

Shepherd talks of his own life along side his career, and what led up to it, which added a person layer to the book rather than it just being factual and work based.""... And it was through her sudden death that Harold Shipman was finally revealed as a serial killer."" Shepherd has worked on many high profile cases, which of course are most captivating to read about. Such as Harold Shipman. The fact that Shipman killed 215 patients (and it is believed many more) and got away with it for 20 years always blows my mind - genuinely shocking. So the fact that Richard Shepherd did at least a few postmortems on some of his victims,one of whom was actually a family friend, drew me into Richard Shepherd's life even further... I won't say anymore besides the fact that I highly recommend this book!!"
80,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5973187-wsclai,3,"Reviews and ratings published for new books can be misleading. To me, this book is certainly overrated. When I started reading it, I thought it is entirely about his job as a forensic pathologist but it is not. All those life events of the author are distracting and something I am not really interested in. I simply skipped through them and just focussed on the cases. It’s more like an autobiography of a pathologist who holds a rather high regard of himself than a book about the working life of a pathologist."
81,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7283807-ben,4,"Forensic pathology—who knew it would be interesting? I enjoy reading about all sorts of different jobs, in any well-written memoir. This fits the bill, it is at least decently well written. Most of Shepherd's job is actually fairly pedestrian. For example, in one incident, he has to help identify bodies after a party cruise sinks in the Thames. Shepherd takes his job very seriously, and clearly enjoys it, despite suffering from some PTSD. The variety of cases, ranging from determining whether a death is a murder or self defense, to judging whether to report an infant's death as SIDS, to working to improve police restraint technique to avoid suffocation. He weaves in his personal life in an effective way, perhaps slightly indulgently but not too much so. The gruesome aspects of his job made it hard to connect with his children, and his wife was opposed to hearing anything about it. I found it interesting, in a somewhat disappointing way, how much the surrounding context around a death affected his report. Shepherd often seems to be under a lot of pressure from police and prosecutors, and so while he is professional he is definitely not neutral, or unbiased. He does not want to let the bad guy get away. > Any wavering, and defendants might be sent down for crimes they did not commit – or freed when they were guilty> Analytical readers will by now be associating my reluctance at the start of my career to meet relatives with the death of my own mother so early in life. And at my subsequent willingness to engage with others' grief they will say, 'Aha! He couldn't allow himself to experience the enormity of grief for his own loss! So, he experiences it again and again in manageable proportions through the grief of others. And, at the end of the meeting, he walks away from it!' I accept that there is probably something in that theory.> I felt that Anna, who must only have been seven years old, should not really be helping me reconstruct a homicide. … 'But your biology book diagrams don't have stab wounds.' 'I really think I can take it, Dad.' Maybe she was right. Maybe it was time to stop shielding my children from the unusual nature of my work. … Anna is a consultant histopathologist and, yes, she does have a keen interest in post-mortem and forensic medicine and even works for some of the coroners I worked for years ago> To the continued disgust of my family, I now used pork bellies or cow kidneys for my stabbing exercises. It was extremely hard to reproduce quite the feel of pushing through human skin, muscle and then an internal organ – perhaps because supermarket meat is seldom fresh. In reality, people who have killed with a knife are usually astonished by how easy it is. Once the blade has cut through the clothing and the skin, the inner body tissues put up little resistance.> People find it hard to believe that, in mass disasters, visual identification is unreliable, especially so when death has been traumatic or the body has been immersed in water. But even the uninjured and undecomposed dead are often simply not recognizable to those who knew them as animated individuals.> the overall aim was to turn the rugby scrum of forcible detention into something used only when necessary, and in a well-managed and safe way. The result, I believe, has been a dramatic reduction in the number of restraint deaths by the authorities. In fact, it is now much more dangerous to be arrested by a fellow citizen or shop or nightclub security staff.> In the Crown Court, a mother charged with manslaughter would be convicted only if her guilt is beyond reasonable doubt . The Family Court, which hears the local authority's request to remove her next child from her, must reconsider her case all over again – but apply a different level of proof. The Family Court applies the lower standard of proof – the balance of probabilities – to reach its conclusions. That can be defined as a 50.1 per cent chance of guilt … Sometimes, a year or more after a baby has been buried, we return to the file because another child has been born and there is the question now of safeguarding the living. By that time, a fuller picture of the baby's life and death may have emerged.> It has amazed me, over the years, how frequently men (but not noticeably women) will kill their best friend. And brothers commit fratricide even more frequently.> This is a very common misperception of an individual who is stabbed: time and time again I have heard victims say that they could just feel a punch rather than the knife itself penetrating> The university medical schools had always paid us to lecture in our subject but they decided – almost all of them, one by one – that now they would not continue funding or teaching forensic pathology. The main reason they gave was lack of forensic research and lack of publication in prestigious scientific journals. … We had essentially been privatized. From now on, instead of providing forensic services for free, our salaries paid by the universities at which we taught, we would directly bill the police, coroners or defence solicitors for payment.> 'SIDS, Dick. It's SIDS.' 'But there's too much about it that's not quite right. I'd rather give ""Unascertained"".' 'We're not here to pass judgement on them for having a few cannabis plants in the attic, for heaven's sake. Or for liking a drink. They're obviously not a chaotic pair of addicts. The father has a regular job, the baby was healthy and well cared for, they turned up for all their health-visitor appointments and vaccinations, there was a supportive wider family – the grandma, the sister. No, don't let's leave ""Unascertained"" hanging over a young couple who're simply poor and doing their best.' SIDS it was, then."

83,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12325885-keri,5,"This autobiography-memoir of a forensic pathologist is a compelling mix of science, true crime, the vagaries of legal systems, and the cost that some careers have on one’s personal life. The author has apparently performed over 20,000 post-mortem examinations in his working lifetime and he shares the details of some of them, from the mundane to the famous (although not being British I was only vaguely familiar with most of the well-publicized cases he mentioned.) His thoughts on Princess Diana’s death were of particular interest to me since that event looms large in my memory. Before beginning a review I will often skim other reviews, in particular the ones who rate the opposite of me. The negative reviews for this book seem centered on readers’ dislike of the amount of focus on the author’s personal life- from childhood to the present day, at the expense of more stories and details about his cases. I didn’t find that to be a problem at all. To me there seemed to be a very good balance of his personal life and his cases. They very much influenced each other. Perhaps the problem was with unrealistic expectations as to the content of the book- the blurb only mentions personal cost and family at the very end, although I would point out that the subtitle does say “the life and many deaths of Britain’s top forensic pathologist” (emphasis added). I listened to this on audiobook and it was narrated by the author which I always appreciate in non-fiction, especially memoir or autobiography.Had I noticed that the author is British and all of this is set in England, I might not have picked it up, thinking it would not have any comment to make on the practice of forensic pathology in America; however, I’m glad I didn’t notice that and did pick it up. It doesn’t in fact comment much on the practice and progression of forensic pathology in the U.S., aside from a couple of brief mentions (including a bit from after 9/11). But the book still resonated with me. Although we live and work on different continents and in very different fields, I also work in a para-legal profession- meaning neither of us are law enforcement officers or lawyers working directly with criminal and civil legal cases, rather our work often informs and influences those cases. Many of his frustrations over time I have also noticed in my own world- for example, the vast increase in both the amount of documentation required, and in the amount and intensity of public and legal scrutiny; the personal attacks; the demand for black and white decision making and 100% accuracy in a field that as he notes is a “combination of facts, experience and judgement”, as is mine; and last but not least the constant exposure to human suffering and tragedy over decades of time. It is a heavy burden. I'm glad the author confronted his demons to write this. Recommended. "
84,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56688456-emi,4,"4.5 ****Wow, what a fascinating, engaging, and emotional read. This book definitely isn't for everybody, but it perfectly hit the intellectual parts of my brain that love to acquire medical knowledge and also the more emotional side of learning about people, human nature, and society. Listening to the audiobook meant that hearing Dr. Richard Shepard himself talk about these things was very clear to understand due to his incredible knowledge but also meant that he didn't overstate or embellish or hyperbolise any of the morbid details but showed with a quiet emotion the hard parts of his life and career over the course of this book. What struck me the most when reading was probably the sections on mass disasters. I don't know why but I've never in my life considered or properly thought about the logistics of dealing with the dead in such events. When you hear about terrorism events on the news you think about how awful it must be for the families who have lost loved ones and how horrible it is for the victims but you never consider the practicalities that doctors, hospitals, pathologists, the government etc. are doing to get society back to normal as soon as possible. The descriptions of preparing a whole warehouse to turn into a mortuary to conduct thousands upon thousands of post-mortems after terrorist bombing attacks, the realisation that it was an intensely logistically difficult and medically challenging operation to catalogue, identify, and collect every single body part after 9/11, (a process which was only completed in 2013) with every British victim having to be flown back from America to be examined by Dr. Shepard etc. etc. My astonishment is endless at the jobs that people have that are so necessary for society to function but that so many of us wouldn't be able to cope with. I'm glad, because of this, that Dr. Shepard did open up at the end of the book about the PTSD he's acquired from examining over 23,000 dead bodies over the years. I don't know if pathologists get the same recognition as normal doctors because they are not technically ""saving lives"" but what they do is so important and difficult and fascinating to read about that I for one will certainly be more aware of the ""behind the scenes"" of death and the people that work to make it as palatable and un-traumatic for the living, whilst taking on the bulk of the trauma themselves.

85,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112848372-bookswithgeorgia,5,"This is a truly fascinating read from start to finish. Do you know when you just feel so glad and grateful that a book has been written? That’s how I feel about this one!Part autobiography and part memoir, this book offers an insight into the world of forensic pathology - a world that many of us probably do not give much thought to. I’ve always been incredibly interested in anything medical, and I’m a true-crime junkie too so I knew that this book was going to be a major hit with me. It really didn’t disappoint! Top forensic pathologist, Dr Richard Shepherd, has worked on many interesting cases including the Hungerford massacre, the Clapham rail distaster, 9/11, the 7/7 bombings, and even Princess Diana. It was so interesting to learn about his work, but also to gain a real insight into the judicial system and all the things that go on behind close doors in this profession. Shepherd sheds light on many issues in this book, particularly within the legal system, injustice within society and even his own experience with a debilitating mental illness. He also talks about each case in an extremely respectful way, remembering that these casualties were once real people with real lives. The book is a really good balance of him talking about his work and his fascinating profession, but also his personal life, i.e. his marriage, family life and personal struggles, and how each of these aspects of his life were affected by his work.I would say that despite the book being entirely centred around death, and often unlawful death, this is not an exceptionally heavy read. I didn’t find it to be toooo gory either so I really think it’s worth giving a go if you like the sound of it! More than anything, I’ve come away from this book with a lot of newfound knowledge on the topic of forensic pathology, and a real sense of respect for everyone involved in that profession. In my opinion, one of the most rewarding things about reading is when you come away from a book feeling more educated!🤓"
86,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96381170-chelsea-r-h,5,"I really enjoyed this book and found it completely fascinating. It delved into the rather shadowy world of forensic pathology, which most people are completely unaware of, beyond the stereotypes and half-truths portrayed in popular crime dramas, such as NCIS. In many ways, Dr Shepherd demystified death, informing the reader about the practicalities of death--why and how it occurs, what happens after you die, the legalities surrounding death and a bunch of other topics. He also weaves his own personal story, and how he became to be regarded as one of Britain's top pathologists, between fascinating cases and facts.I don't necessarily recommend this book unreservedly though. A lot of people could find this boko disturbing or triggering. Dr Shepherd delves into some exceeding graphic (though not glorified, simply scientific) descriptions of cases he has worked on. They include several horrific rapes, child abuse cases, and several astoundingly callous murders, as well large scale accidents, tragedies and mass murders. There's also several instances of deaths triggered by racism, and the deaths of black people in police custody, or caused by inappropriate restraint are also discussed in depth. Besides all that, there are also numerous descriptions of how a post-mortem is performed and what a body looks like during the process. As I've already said, none of this glorified or reveled in, Dr Shepherd is merely stating facts and reporting the truth, however, I know a lot of people cannot or do not want to handle these things, and so should be warned before reading this book.Overall, I loved reading this book, despite a few sections that disturbed or distressed me. It was very good, and it shone light on a part of society that isn't considered very regularly, helping to normalise it and make it a more comfortable experience for the average grieving family member, who may have to go through the process for whatever reason. I highly recommend it, if you think you can stomach some of the more difficult topics it covers."

It was explained in layman's terms and was not bogged down with medical jargon or official medical terminology (which I, personally, wouldn't mind but it wouldn't be for everyone).Dr Richard Shepherd is one of the UK's leading pathologists and has worked on some of the most famous and infamous deaths over the last forty or so years both nationally and internationally.Cases the UK populace will know well are mentioned such as the one of Rachel Nickell, the single mum who was walking on Wimbledon Common with her two-year-old son back in 1992 when she was murdered and raped while her son looked on. Her assailant was caught, arrested and jailed only to be acquitted just a few years later. He turned out not to be the murderer at all. Or Stephen Lawrence, the eighteen-year-old black youth brutally stabbed by five white males back in 1993 merely because of the colour of his skin (only two of the five men have been jailed).Then there are the very famous cases; 9/11, 7/7, the death of Princess Diana and the Bali bombings.On top of these totally immersive cases Dr Shepherd talks of his personal life; his wife and children, his obsession with work and the stresses involved in determining how someone may have died and making sure, in the minutest detail, that what he records and says is absolutely correct.From page one to page four-hundred-and-forty-four the world around me dissolved into nothingness and this book became the only thing in existence. It has quickly been marked as one of my favourites and I am convinced, once you have read it, it will be one of yours too."
88,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7132654-noel-powell,4,"I sort of came upon this book by accident. I had recently read the very funny ""This is going to hurt"" by Adam Kay about the life of a junior gynacoligist. I thought that I had enjoyed the jolly japes so much that I would read another medical autobiography. However this time the fun would be centred around cadavers not lady parts. Boy was I in for a surprise. No farcical comedy here. It is a very serious book. Nonetheless I found myself being drawn in to the cases of infamous deaths through the eyes of the man who cuts up the bodies to find the clues. Thousands of bodies. While fascinating though this career was, it has a heavy price. There is a thread of doom, melancholy and misery through out this book but you feel you have to turn the page. The writer would seem to be an unemotional type to begin but his choice of career and the need to close off mentally sees him being dragged down into PTSD. So you read on for the compelling murder puzzles while also have a sinking feeling. Its like watching disaster from afar. Its fascinating and sad at the same time but you just have to look. I should say it is very well written. It is a very different book from the one I thought I was going to read but I am glad that I have read it all the same."
89,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89494011-amy,3,"At around 25% into this book I honestly considered DNF'ing because the writing was just not gripping and we were getting more about Shepherd's family life than his actual job. It was honestly a bit boring and there didn't feel like there was any life in the writing. It felt a bit like he'd simply put pen to paper and wrote a shopping list. HOWEVER, I am glad I stuck with it because it got infinitely better as the book went on and especially the last 25% you can tell how passionate he is about his work and the role that he has in death. I really felt like I was able to connect with him more as the book went on, and found myself immersed in his world.I really enjoy the sections of the book that were solely focused on the cases that he has worked on; they were very interesting to me and learning about what his job entails was intriguing. I don't think there was enough of this and thats where this book suffered in my opinion. Shepherd has a tendency to jump rapidly from case to case and the book doesn't flow overly naturally. I think this cold be in part due to the fact that it was written over a period of time and due to the personal experiences he had going on at the time. I don't think he's a natural storyteller and it did show at times.Overall this is clearly a man who is passionate about the work he does and it does show towards the end. An interesting, if not that enjoyable, read. "
90,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28283498-marissa,3,"I was anticipating a good read but feel very let down. I expected this book to be more medical and not so much about the personal life of Dr. Shepard himself. I still found it to be an interesting read, however I wish there was more discussion and detail about the forensic pathology aspect. 3.5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️ "
91,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8545345-kelly,3,"I have been trying to write this review for ages because I have warring opinions.Generally, this book was incredibly interesting and I loved that it was easy to read but still packed with information, facts and real cases. It was quite emotive due to the nature of the cases, despite the actual writing tone being matter of fact and as unemotive as the author. I did not mind the concurrent chronicles of Shepherd's personal life - mainly because I am a nosy bitch. I thought that seeing the impact on Shepherd personally and on his family life was a consequence that many do not consider when thinking of the life of a pathologist - all glammed up by CSI type shows.I did not find the chronological approach the easiest to follow. I thought that it would have been better to chapter off the different cases and weave the personal elements into the cases. As it was, the cases stretched over a number of years and I struggled to keep track of where some had finished when they were mentioned later. I also felt that the personal elements were tacked on the end rather clunkily because they fit with the timing.My biggest issue however was with the tone at times, finding it often arrogant and at times it came.aceoss as biased. I also found the tone infuriating when speaking of women.The marriage to Jen was written in a way that suggests that Shepherd's life would have been easier if Jen hadn't wanted to further her career and become a Dr. There were times when he really spoke about her as if she should have been willing to sacrifice her life for his career. Then he would tack a sentence on saying, but I was proud of her so I suffered! Heaven forbid that he had to look after his own children to help his wife. There was also this compulsive need to remind us that he was a good father.Secondly - and I cannot stress how much this pissed me off. We have spent the whole book being told about the careers of the white men folk and how hard they worked and how skilled they were. Then in walks Vesna Djurovic. Dr Djurovic is an eminent pathologist. Yet this is how Shepherd describes her when she starts working at Guys:'...tall, blonde, leggy woman...who wore a short skirt and a friendly smile.'Absolutely no indication of her skillset or experience.He then speaks of her being 'claimed' by his boss Iain. Like she is a goldfish at the fair. Iain eventually marries her, congrats to them. Shepherd seems to give more respect to the dead than a live woman with a sterling career.Likewise, Jen became a Dr while raising kids with a largely absent husband and later in life. But when asked about the issues in his marriage he doesn't admit that he cannot connect to her emotionally or that the absences of BOTH OF THEIR JOBS are taking a toll, he says that she doesn't make him dinner. That is why their marriage isn't working. That traditional role of the little lady that proves her love for her husband. Dr Jen doesn't make him dinner. Bad woman.It was clear that Shepherd harboured ill-feeling when he described Iain and Vesna as a star couple of the pathology world. Citing their forays into social life and noting that he couldn't have this role because bloody Jen had decided to better herself and her job as a Dr meant that they didn't have the time to party. Honestly, I really felt for Jen throughout this book.I genuinely thought that this was going to be a strong 4, if not 5 star review but as the tone of arrogance grew and Shepherd seemed more incapable of taking criticism or admitting to errors, whether personal or professional, I started losing my interest in Shepherd and my rating dwindled"

Dr Shepherd worked on some of the most notable cases in recent British history. (Hungerford massacre, Marchioness disaster, Stephen Lawrence and many more). I learned about people finding the mummified bodies of newborns in their attics/ under their floorboards, something I had never heard of before.At the end of the book too the author talks about his mental health and the effect his career had on it. For a job that requires you to distance yourself from the emotions of it all, I thought it was refreshing and needed that he spoke about his mental health."

Dr Shepherd had worked on many cases included 9/11, the Hungerford massacre and the sinking of the Marchioness, Harold Shipman cases and the terrorist attack in Bali. He has had an incredible career which has taken him all over the globe. I certainly couldn't do his job but the fact he still has the same passion for it as when we first started out is amazing and admirable. 5 out of 5 stars doesn't seem enough."

99,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19863335-molly,4,"I read this on recommendation of my sister who was thoroughly amused with the gruesome depictions of deaths and the process of decomposition, so when I started reading I assumed it would be like many other pieces of work which are essentially science communication as entertainment. This was different though. Sheperd weaves stories of his work with personal narrative, giving a slowly building sense of how his work affects his life and relationships, without ever making you doubt his dedication to forensic pathology. I wished that at some points he had been clearer over what year we were in as I tried to work out his age and experience, and this was not aided by the oscillation through time that the book makes. That said, the back and forth does feel authentically like a story you might be told by a relative, if only it were more clearly signposted. The cases discussed are always treated carefully and with respect, and it is refreshing to see Sheperd critique his own work and offer up his vulnerability throughout the book. His attitudes towards the crimes against and by women and black people are more nuanced than would sadly be expected from a person of his age, and it was empowering to read that this white middle class man used his positions of power to do something to help. My personal issue with the writing was with some of the clinical language used, it is understandable given the topics covered and the mental state of the author why such clinical language is employed, but I know that words such as ‘obese’, while medically accurate, can be difficult for some readers. Overall I enjoyed the book immensely, it tackles tough topics with kindness and compassion and is a rare insight into the intersect between the work and personal life of a professional in their field under the heavy weight of trust and opinion."
100,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8675686-kristiana,5,Incredibly interesting insight into forensic pathology and also the struggles of balancing being at the top of a profession and family life.

103,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108250738-samantha-hood,4,"I had high hopes for this book and I definitely enjoyed it, but it didn't quite hit the spot to be a 5* read. If you are interested in pathology, murders, or serious crimes and you've never really thought about how the pathologists feel, their first experience with a dead body or their first-ever autopsy on their own then you will ultimately love this book. The first couple of chapters are brilliant. They're such a mind-blowing insight into what pathology really is and the training that goes into being a pathologist is far more than you would ever anticipate considering they 'only deal with the dead'... it is SO much more than that. It's a very well written book; informative and upsetting at times, however, I found the parts relating to Richard Shepherd's personal life a little dull at times. I don't think they ultimately fitted within the themes of this book although I do understand the parts where he introduces his wife and children so as to ensure the reader understands the difficulties of juggling such an on-call job... it really is a way of life, a lifestyle and not just a job. However, other parts I really didn't feel were necessary. Aside from that, I thoroughly enjoyed this and learning more about autopsies and how the emergency services require such detailed descriptions when pursuing a charge or even just providing some understanding to bereaved families. A pathologist has such an important job and I hope from reading this book that people realise how important they truly are. "

I love medical non fiction and this is definitely one of the best ones I've ever read. Its incredibly fascinating and interesting. Richard worked on so many cases, including some very famous and high profile ones. I learnt so much about pathology from this book. It is not dry at all, which I know puts some people off non fiction. It was written in a very accessible, easy to read way. It also was very personal. You found out a lot about his own life, which I was not expecting going in but it was a pleasant surprise. However, I would give caution going into this book. It gives very graphic descriptions of some very sad real life cases including: suicide, violent crime, stabbings, murder, mass tragedies and disasters, shootings and SIDS. It's not an easy read in that sense so definitely exercise caution if that's the kind of thing that triggers you. Overall, I really enjoyed this book and I learnt a lot from it.TW: PTSD, suicide, graphic descriptions of death, disease and the body after its died.

And it was through her sudden death that Harold Shipman was finally revealed as a serial killer."" Shepherd has worked on many high profile cases, which of course are most captivating to read about. Such as Harold Shipman. The fact that Shipman killed 215 patients (and it is believed many more) and got away with it for 20 years always blows my mind - genuinely shocking. So the fact that Richard Shepherd did at least a few postmortems on some of his victims,one of whom was actually a family friend, drew me into Richard Shepherd's life even further... I won't say anymore besides the fact that I highly recommend this book!!"

When I started reading it, I thought it is entirely about his job as a forensic pathologist but it is not. All those life events of the author are distracting and something I am not really interested in. I simply skipped through them and just focussed on the cases. It’s more like an autobiography of a pathologist who holds a rather high regard of himself than a book about the working life of a pathologist."
111,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7283807-ben,4,"Forensic pathology—who knew it would be interesting? I enjoy reading about all sorts of different jobs, in any well-written memoir. This fits the bill, it is at least decently well written. Most of Shepherd's job is actually fairly pedestrian. For example, in one incident, he has to help identify bodies after a party cruise sinks in the Thames. Shepherd takes his job very seriously, and clearly enjoys it, despite suffering from some PTSD. The variety of cases, ranging from determining whether a death is a murder or self defense, to judging whether to report an infant's death as SIDS, to working to improve police restraint technique to avoid suffocation. He weaves in his personal life in an effective way, perhaps slightly indulgently but not too much so. The gruesome aspects of his job made it hard to connect with his children, and his wife was opposed to hearing anything about it. I found it interesting, in a somewhat disappointing way, how much the surrounding context around a death affected his report. Shepherd often seems to be under a lot of pressure from police and prosecutors, and so while he is professional he is definitely not neutral, or unbiased. He does not want to let the bad guy get away. > Any wavering, and defendants might be sent down for crimes they did not commit – or freed when they were guilty> Analytical readers will by now be associating my reluctance at the start of my career to meet relatives with the death of my own mother so early in life. And at my subsequent willingness to engage with others' grief they will say, 'Aha! He couldn't allow himself to experience the enormity of grief for his own loss! So, he experiences it again and again in manageable proportions through the grief of others. And, at the end of the meeting, he walks away from it!' I accept that there is probably something in that theory.> I felt that Anna, who must only have been seven years old, should not really be helping me reconstruct a homicide. … 'But your biology book diagrams don't have stab wounds.' 'I really think I can take it, Dad.' Maybe she was right. Maybe it was time to stop shielding my children from the unusual nature of my work. … Anna is a consultant histopathologist and, yes, she does have a keen interest in post-mortem and forensic medicine and even works for some of the coroners I worked for years ago> To the continued disgust of my family, I now used pork bellies or cow kidneys for my stabbing exercises. It was extremely hard to reproduce quite the feel of pushing through human skin, muscle and then an internal organ – perhaps because supermarket meat is seldom fresh. In reality, people who have killed with a knife are usually astonished by how easy it is. Once the blade has cut through the clothing and the skin, the inner body tissues put up little resistance.> People find it hard to believe that, in mass disasters, visual identification is unreliable, especially so when death has been traumatic or the body has been immersed in water. But even the uninjured and undecomposed dead are often simply not recognizable to those who knew them as animated individuals.> the overall aim was to turn the rugby scrum of forcible detention into something used only when necessary, and in a well-managed and safe way. The result, I believe, has been a dramatic reduction in the number of restraint deaths by the authorities. In fact, it is now much more dangerous to be arrested by a fellow citizen or shop or nightclub security staff.> In the Crown Court, a mother charged with manslaughter would be convicted only if her guilt is beyond reasonable doubt . The Family Court, which hears the local authority's request to remove her next child from her, must reconsider her case all over again – but apply a different level of proof. The Family Court applies the lower standard of proof – the balance of probabilities – to reach its conclusions. That can be defined as a 50.1 per cent chance of guilt … Sometimes, a year or more after a baby has been buried, we return to the file because another child has been born and there is the question now of safeguarding the living. By that time, a fuller picture of the baby's life and death may have emerged.> It has amazed me, over the years, how frequently men (but not noticeably women) will kill their best friend. And brothers commit fratricide even more frequently.> This is a very common misperception of an individual who is stabbed: time and time again I have heard victims say that they could just feel a punch rather than the knife itself penetrating> The university medical schools had always paid us to lecture in our subject but they decided – almost all of them, one by one – that now they would not continue funding or teaching forensic pathology. The main reason they gave was lack of forensic research and lack of publication in prestigious scientific journals. … We had essentially been privatized. From now on, instead of providing forensic services for free, our salaries paid by the universities at which we taught, we would directly bill the police, coroners or defence solicitors for payment.> 'SIDS, Dick. It's SIDS.' 'But there's too much about it that's not quite right. I'd rather give ""Unascertained"".' 'We're not here to pass judgement on them for having a few cannabis plants in the attic, for heaven's sake. Or for liking a drink. They're obviously not a chaotic pair of addicts. The father has a regular job, the baby was healthy and well cared for, they turned up for all their health-visitor appointments and vaccinations, there was a supportive wider family – the grandma, the sister. No, don't let's leave ""Unascertained"" hanging over a young couple who're simply poor and doing their best.' SIDS it was, then."

113,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12325885-keri,5,"This autobiography-memoir of a forensic pathologist is a compelling mix of science, true crime, the vagaries of legal systems, and the cost that some careers have on one’s personal life. The author has apparently performed over 20,000 post-mortem examinations in his working lifetime and he shares the details of some of them, from the mundane to the famous (although not being British I was only vaguely familiar with most of the well-publicized cases he mentioned.) His thoughts on Princess Diana’s death were of particular interest to me since that event looms large in my memory. Before beginning a review I will often skim other reviews, in particular the ones who rate the opposite of me. The negative reviews for this book seem centered on readers’ dislike of the amount of focus on the author’s personal life- from childhood to the present day, at the expense of more stories and details about his cases. I didn’t find that to be a problem at all. To me there seemed to be a very good balance of his personal life and his cases. They very much influenced each other. Perhaps the problem was with unrealistic expectations as to the content of the book- the blurb only mentions personal cost and family at the very end, although I would point out that the subtitle does say “the life and many deaths of Britain’s top forensic pathologist” (emphasis added). I listened to this on audiobook and it was narrated by the author which I always appreciate in non-fiction, especially memoir or autobiography.Had I noticed that the author is British and all of this is set in England, I might not have picked it up, thinking it would not have any comment to make on the practice of forensic pathology in America; however, I’m glad I didn’t notice that and did pick it up. It doesn’t in fact comment much on the practice and progression of forensic pathology in the U.S., aside from a couple of brief mentions (including a bit from after 9/11). But the book still resonated with me. Although we live and work on different continents and in very different fields, I also work in a para-legal profession- meaning neither of us are law enforcement officers or lawyers working directly with criminal and civil legal cases, rather our work often informs and influences those cases. Many of his frustrations over time I have also noticed in my own world- for example, the vast increase in both the amount of documentation required, and in the amount and intensity of public and legal scrutiny; the personal attacks; the demand for black and white decision making and 100% accuracy in a field that as he notes is a “combination of facts, experience and judgement”, as is mine; and last but not least the constant exposure to human suffering and tragedy over decades of time. It is a heavy burden. I'm glad the author confronted his demons to write this. Recommended. "
114,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56688456-emi,4,"4.5 ****Wow, what a fascinating, engaging, and emotional read. This book definitely isn't for everybody, but it perfectly hit the intellectual parts of my brain that love to acquire medical knowledge and also the more emotional side of learning about people, human nature, and society. Listening to the audiobook meant that hearing Dr. Richard Shepard himself talk about these things was very clear to understand due to his incredible knowledge but also meant that he didn't overstate or embellish or hyperbolise any of the morbid details but showed with a quiet emotion the hard parts of his life and career over the course of this book. What struck me the most when reading was probably the sections on mass disasters. I don't know why but I've never in my life considered or properly thought about the logistics of dealing with the dead in such events. When you hear about terrorism events on the news you think about how awful it must be for the families who have lost loved ones and how horrible it is for the victims but you never consider the practicalities that doctors, hospitals, pathologists, the government etc. are doing to get society back to normal as soon as possible. The descriptions of preparing a whole warehouse to turn into a mortuary to conduct thousands upon thousands of post-mortems after terrorist bombing attacks, the realisation that it was an intensely logistically difficult and medically challenging operation to catalogue, identify, and collect every single body part after 9/11, (a process which was only completed in 2013) with every British victim having to be flown back from America to be examined by Dr. Shepard etc. etc. My astonishment is endless at the jobs that people have that are so necessary for society to function but that so many of us wouldn't be able to cope with. I'm glad, because of this, that Dr. Shepard did open up at the end of the book about the PTSD he's acquired from examining over 23,000 dead bodies over the years. I don't know if pathologists get the same recognition as normal doctors because they are not technically ""saving lives"" but what they do is so important and difficult and fascinating to read about that I for one will certainly be more aware of the ""behind the scenes"" of death and the people that work to make it as palatable and un-traumatic for the living, whilst taking on the bulk of the trauma themselves. "
115,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112848372-bookswithgeorgia,5,"This is a truly fascinating read from start to finish. Do you know when you just feel so glad and grateful that a book has been written? That’s how I feel about this one!Part autobiography and part memoir, this book offers an insight into the world of forensic pathology - a world that many of us probably do not give much thought to. I’ve always been incredibly interested in anything medical, and I’m a true-crime junkie too so I knew that this book was going to be a major hit with me. It really didn’t disappoint! Top forensic pathologist, Dr Richard Shepherd, has worked on many interesting cases including the Hungerford massacre, the Clapham rail distaster, 9/11, the 7/7 bombings, and even Princess Diana. It was so interesting to learn about his work, but also to gain a real insight into the judicial system and all the things that go on behind close doors in this profession. Shepherd sheds light on many issues in this book, particularly within the legal system, injustice within society and even his own experience with a debilitating mental illness. He also talks about each case in an extremely respectful way, remembering that these casualties were once real people with real lives. The book is a really good balance of him talking about his work and his fascinating profession, but also his personal life, i.e. his marriage, family life and personal struggles, and how each of these aspects of his life were affected by his work.I would say that despite the book being entirely centred around death, and often unlawful death, this is not an exceptionally heavy read. I didn’t find it to be toooo gory either so I really think it’s worth giving a go if you like the sound of it! More than anything, I’ve come away from this book with a lot of newfound knowledge on the topic of forensic pathology, and a real sense of respect for everyone involved in that profession. In my opinion, one of the most rewarding things about reading is when you come away from a book feeling more educated!🤓"
116,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96381170-chelsea-r-h,5,"I really enjoyed this book and found it completely fascinating. It delved into the rather shadowy world of forensic pathology, which most people are completely unaware of, beyond the stereotypes and half-truths portrayed in popular crime dramas, such as NCIS. In many ways, Dr Shepherd demystified death, informing the reader about the practicalities of death--why and how it occurs, what happens after you die, the legalities surrounding death and a bunch of other topics. He also weaves his own personal story, and how he became to be regarded as one of Britain's top pathologists, between fascinating cases and facts.I don't necessarily recommend this book unreservedly though. A lot of people could find this boko disturbing or triggering. Dr Shepherd delves into some exceeding graphic (though not glorified, simply scientific) descriptions of cases he has worked on. They include several horrific rapes, child abuse cases, and several astoundingly callous murders, as well large scale accidents, tragedies and mass murders. There's also several instances of deaths triggered by racism, and the deaths of black people in police custody, or caused by inappropriate restraint are also discussed in depth. Besides all that, there are also numerous descriptions of how a post-mortem is performed and what a body looks like during the process. As I've already said, none of this glorified or reveled in, Dr Shepherd is merely stating facts and reporting the truth, however, I know a lot of people cannot or do not want to handle these things, and so should be warned before reading this book.Overall, I loved reading this book, despite a few sections that disturbed or distressed me. It was very good, and it shone light on a part of society that isn't considered very regularly, helping to normalise it and make it a more comfortable experience for the average grieving family member, who may have to go through the process for whatever reason. I highly recommend it, if you think you can stomach some of the more difficult topics it covers."
117,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26176887-chris,5,"An absolutely fascinating read from start to finish.This was a very honest, down-to-earth read. It was explained in layman's terms and was not bogged down with medical jargon or official medical terminology (which I, personally, wouldn't mind but it wouldn't be for everyone).Dr Richard Shepherd is one of the UK's leading pathologists and has worked on some of the most famous and infamous deaths over the last forty or so years both nationally and internationally.Cases the UK populace will know well are mentioned such as the one of Rachel Nickell, the single mum who was walking on Wimbledon Common with her two-year-old son back in 1992 when she was murdered and raped while her son looked on. Her assailant was caught, arrested and jailed only to be acquitted just a few years later. He turned out not to be the murderer at all. Or Stephen Lawrence, the eighteen-year-old black youth brutally stabbed by five white males back in 1993 merely because of the colour of his skin (only two of the five men have been jailed).Then there are the very famous cases; 9/11, 7/7, the death of Princess Diana and the Bali bombings.On top of these totally immersive cases Dr Shepherd talks of his personal life; his wife and children, his obsession with work and the stresses involved in determining how someone may have died and making sure, in the minutest detail, that what he records and says is absolutely correct.From page one to page four-hundred-and-forty-four the world around me dissolved into nothingness and this book became the only thing in existence. It has quickly been marked as one of my favourites and I am convinced, once you have read it, it will be one of yours too."
118,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7132654-noel-powell,4,"I sort of came upon this book by accident. I had recently read the very funny ""This is going to hurt"" by Adam Kay about the life of a junior gynacoligist. I thought that I had enjoyed the jolly japes so much that I would read another medical autobiography. However this time the fun would be centred around cadavers not lady parts. Boy was I in for a surprise. No farcical comedy here. It is a very serious book. Nonetheless I found myself being drawn in to the cases of infamous deaths through the eyes of the man who cuts up the bodies to find the clues. Thousands of bodies. While fascinating though this career was, it has a heavy price. There is a thread of doom, melancholy and misery through out this book but you feel you have to turn the page. The writer would seem to be an unemotional type to begin but his choice of career and the need to close off mentally sees him being dragged down into PTSD. So you read on for the compelling murder puzzles while also have a sinking feeling. Its like watching disaster from afar. Its fascinating and sad at the same time but you just have to look. I should say it is very well written. It is a very different book from the one I thought I was going to read but I am glad that I have read it all the same."
119,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89494011-amy,3,"At around 25% into this book I honestly considered DNF'ing because the writing was just not gripping and we were getting more about Shepherd's family life than his actual job. It was honestly a bit boring and there didn't feel like there was any life in the writing. It felt a bit like he'd simply put pen to paper and wrote a shopping list. HOWEVER, I am glad I stuck with it because it got infinitely better as the book went on and especially the last 25% you can tell how passionate he is about his work and the role that he has in death. I really felt like I was able to connect with him more as the book went on, and found myself immersed in his world.I really enjoy the sections of the book that were solely focused on the cases that he has worked on; they were very interesting to me and learning about what his job entails was intriguing. I don't think there was enough of this and thats where this book suffered in my opinion. Shepherd has a tendency to jump rapidly from case to case and the book doesn't flow overly naturally. I think this cold be in part due to the fact that it was written over a period of time and due to the personal experiences he had going on at the time. I don't think he's a natural storyteller and it did show at times.Overall this is clearly a man who is passionate about the work he does and it does show towards the end. An interesting, if not that enjoyable, read. "
120,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28283498-marissa,3,"I was anticipating a good read but feel very let down. I expected this book to be more medical and not so much about the personal life of Dr. Shepard himself. I still found it to be an interesting read, however I wish there was more discussion and detail about the forensic pathology aspect. 3.5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️ "
121,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8545345-kelly,3,"I have been trying to write this review for ages because I have warring opinions.Generally, this book was incredibly interesting and I loved that it was easy to read but still packed with information, facts and real cases. It was quite emotive due to the nature of the cases, despite the actual writing tone being matter of fact and as unemotive as the author. I did not mind the concurrent chronicles of Shepherd's personal life - mainly because I am a nosy bitch. I thought that seeing the impact on Shepherd personally and on his family life was a consequence that many do not consider when thinking of the life of a pathologist - all glammed up by CSI type shows.I did not find the chronological approach the easiest to follow. I thought that it would have been better to chapter off the different cases and weave the personal elements into the cases. As it was, the cases stretched over a number of years and I struggled to keep track of where some had finished when they were mentioned later. I also felt that the personal elements were tacked on the end rather clunkily because they fit with the timing.My biggest issue however was with the tone at times, finding it often arrogant and at times it came.aceoss as biased. I also found the tone infuriating when speaking of women.The marriage to Jen was written in a way that suggests that Shepherd's life would have been easier if Jen hadn't wanted to further her career and become a Dr. There were times when he really spoke about her as if she should have been willing to sacrifice her life for his career. Then he would tack a sentence on saying, but I was proud of her so I suffered! Heaven forbid that he had to look after his own children to help his wife. There was also this compulsive need to remind us that he was a good father.Secondly - and I cannot stress how much this pissed me off. We have spent the whole book being told about the careers of the white men folk and how hard they worked and how skilled they were. Then in walks Vesna Djurovic. Dr Djurovic is an eminent pathologist. Yet this is how Shepherd describes her when she starts working at Guys:'...tall, blonde, leggy woman...who wore a short skirt and a friendly smile.'Absolutely no indication of her skillset or experience.He then speaks of her being 'claimed' by his boss Iain. Like she is a goldfish at the fair. Iain eventually marries her, congrats to them. Shepherd seems to give more respect to the dead than a live woman with a sterling career.Likewise, Jen became a Dr while raising kids with a largely absent husband and later in life. But when asked about the issues in his marriage he doesn't admit that he cannot connect to her emotionally or that the absences of BOTH OF THEIR JOBS are taking a toll, he says that she doesn't make him dinner. That is why their marriage isn't working. That traditional role of the little lady that proves her love for her husband. Dr Jen doesn't make him dinner. Bad woman.It was clear that Shepherd harboured ill-feeling when he described Iain and Vesna as a star couple of the pathology world. Citing their forays into social life and noting that he couldn't have this role because bloody Jen had decided to better herself and her job as a Dr meant that they didn't have the time to party. Honestly, I really felt for Jen throughout this book.I genuinely thought that this was going to be a strong 4, if not 5 star review but as the tone of arrogance grew and Shepherd seemed more incapable of taking criticism or admitting to errors, whether personal or professional, I started losing my interest in Shepherd and my rating dwindled"

Dr Shepherd worked on some of the most notable cases in recent British history. (Hungerford massacre, Marchioness disaster, Stephen Lawrence and many more). I learned about people finding the mummified bodies of newborns in their attics/ under their floorboards, something I had never heard of before.At the end of the book too the author talks about his mental health and the effect his career had on it. For a job that requires you to distance yourself from the emotions of it all, I thought it was refreshing and needed that he spoke about his mental health."

Dr Shepherd had worked on many cases included 9/11, the Hungerford massacre and the sinking of the Marchioness, Harold Shipman cases and the terrorist attack in Bali. He has had an incredible career which has taken him all over the globe. I certainly couldn't do his job but the fact he still has the same passion for it as when we first started out is amazing and admirable. 5 out of 5 stars doesn't seem enough."

129,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19863335-molly,4,"I read this on recommendation of my sister who was thoroughly amused with the gruesome depictions of deaths and the process of decomposition, so when I started reading I assumed it would be like many other pieces of work which are essentially science communication as entertainment. This was different though. Sheperd weaves stories of his work with personal narrative, giving a slowly building sense of how his work affects his life and relationships, without ever making you doubt his dedication to forensic pathology. I wished that at some points he had been clearer over what year we were in as I tried to work out his age and experience, and this was not aided by the oscillation through time that the book makes. That said, the back and forth does feel authentically like a story you might be told by a relative, if only it were more clearly signposted. The cases discussed are always treated carefully and with respect, and it is refreshing to see Sheperd critique his own work and offer up his vulnerability throughout the book. His attitudes towards the crimes against and by women and black people are more nuanced than would sadly be expected from a person of his age, and it was empowering to read that this white middle class man used his positions of power to do something to help. My personal issue with the writing was with some of the clinical language used, it is understandable given the topics covered and the mental state of the author why such clinical language is employed, but I know that words such as ‘obese’, while medically accurate, can be difficult for some readers. Overall I enjoyed the book immensely, it tackles tough topics with kindness and compassion and is a rare insight into the intersect between the work and personal life of a professional in their field under the heavy weight of trust and opinion."
130,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8675686-kristiana,5,Incredibly interesting insight into forensic pathology and also the struggles of balancing being at the top of a profession and family life.

133,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108250738-samantha-hood,4,"I had high hopes for this book and I definitely enjoyed it, but it didn't quite hit the spot to be a 5* read. If you are interested in pathology, murders, or serious crimes and you've never really thought about how the pathologists feel, their first experience with a dead body or their first-ever autopsy on their own then you will ultimately love this book. The first couple of chapters are brilliant. They're such a mind-blowing insight into what pathology really is and the training that goes into being a pathologist is far more than you would ever anticipate considering they 'only deal with the dead'... it is SO much more than that. It's a very well written book; informative and upsetting at times, however, I found the parts relating to Richard Shepherd's personal life a little dull at times. I don't think they ultimately fitted within the themes of this book although I do understand the parts where he introduces his wife and children so as to ensure the reader understands the difficulties of juggling such an on-call job... it really is a way of life, a lifestyle and not just a job. However, other parts I really didn't feel were necessary. Aside from that, I thoroughly enjoyed this and learning more about autopsies and how the emergency services require such detailed descriptions when pursuing a charge or even just providing some understanding to bereaved families. A pathologist has such an important job and I hope from reading this book that people realise how important they truly are. "

I love medical non fiction and this is definitely one of the best ones I've ever read. Its incredibly fascinating and interesting. Richard worked on so many cases, including some very famous and high profile ones. I learnt so much about pathology from this book. It is not dry at all, which I know puts some people off non fiction. It was written in a very accessible, easy to read way. It also was very personal. You found out a lot about his own life, which I was not expecting going in but it was a pleasant surprise. However, I would give caution going into this book. It gives very graphic descriptions of some very sad real life cases including: suicide, violent crime, stabbings, murder, mass tragedies and disasters, shootings and SIDS. It's not an easy read in that sense so definitely exercise caution if that's the kind of thing that triggers you. Overall, I really enjoyed this book and I learnt a lot from it.TW: PTSD, suicide, graphic descriptions of death, disease and the body after its died.

And it was through her sudden death that Harold Shipman was finally revealed as a serial killer."" Shepherd has worked on many high profile cases, which of course are most captivating to read about. Such as Harold Shipman. The fact that Shipman killed 215 patients (and it is believed many more) and got away with it for 20 years always blows my mind - genuinely shocking. So the fact that Richard Shepherd did at least a few postmortems on some of his victims,one of whom was actually a family friend, drew me into Richard Shepherd's life even further... I won't say anymore besides the fact that I highly recommend this book!!"

When I started reading it, I thought it is entirely about his job as a forensic pathologist but it is not. All those life events of the author are distracting and something I am not really interested in. I simply skipped through them and just focussed on the cases. It’s more like an autobiography of a pathologist who holds a rather high regard of himself than a book about the working life of a pathologist."
141,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7283807-ben,4,"Forensic pathology—who knew it would be interesting? I enjoy reading about all sorts of different jobs, in any well-written memoir. This fits the bill, it is at least decently well written. Most of Shepherd's job is actually fairly pedestrian. For example, in one incident, he has to help identify bodies after a party cruise sinks in the Thames. Shepherd takes his job very seriously, and clearly enjoys it, despite suffering from some PTSD. The variety of cases, ranging from determining whether a death is a murder or self defense, to judging whether to report an infant's death as SIDS, to working to improve police restraint technique to avoid suffocation. He weaves in his personal life in an effective way, perhaps slightly indulgently but not too much so. The gruesome aspects of his job made it hard to connect with his children, and his wife was opposed to hearing anything about it. I found it interesting, in a somewhat disappointing way, how much the surrounding context around a death affected his report. Shepherd often seems to be under a lot of pressure from police and prosecutors, and so while he is professional he is definitely not neutral, or unbiased. He does not want to let the bad guy get away. > Any wavering, and defendants might be sent down for crimes they did not commit – or freed when they were guilty> Analytical readers will by now be associating my reluctance at the start of my career to meet relatives with the death of my own mother so early in life. And at my subsequent willingness to engage with others' grief they will say, 'Aha! He couldn't allow himself to experience the enormity of grief for his own loss! So, he experiences it again and again in manageable proportions through the grief of others. And, at the end of the meeting, he walks away from it!' I accept that there is probably something in that theory.> I felt that Anna, who must only have been seven years old, should not really be helping me reconstruct a homicide. … 'But your biology book diagrams don't have stab wounds.' 'I really think I can take it, Dad.' Maybe she was right. Maybe it was time to stop shielding my children from the unusual nature of my work. … Anna is a consultant histopathologist and, yes, she does have a keen interest in post-mortem and forensic medicine and even works for some of the coroners I worked for years ago> To the continued disgust of my family, I now used pork bellies or cow kidneys for my stabbing exercises. It was extremely hard to reproduce quite the feel of pushing through human skin, muscle and then an internal organ – perhaps because supermarket meat is seldom fresh. In reality, people who have killed with a knife are usually astonished by how easy it is. Once the blade has cut through the clothing and the skin, the inner body tissues put up little resistance.> People find it hard to believe that, in mass disasters, visual identification is unreliable, especially so when death has been traumatic or the body has been immersed in water. But even the uninjured and undecomposed dead are often simply not recognizable to those who knew them as animated individuals.> the overall aim was to turn the rugby scrum of forcible detention into something used only when necessary, and in a well-managed and safe way. The result, I believe, has been a dramatic reduction in the number of restraint deaths by the authorities. In fact, it is now much more dangerous to be arrested by a fellow citizen or shop or nightclub security staff.> In the Crown Court, a mother charged with manslaughter would be convicted only if her guilt is beyond reasonable doubt . The Family Court, which hears the local authority's request to remove her next child from her, must reconsider her case all over again – but apply a different level of proof. The Family Court applies the lower standard of proof – the balance of probabilities – to reach its conclusions. That can be defined as a 50.1 per cent chance of guilt … Sometimes, a year or more after a baby has been buried, we return to the file because another child has been born and there is the question now of safeguarding the living. By that time, a fuller picture of the baby's life and death may have emerged.> It has amazed me, over the years, how frequently men (but not noticeably women) will kill their best friend. And brothers commit fratricide even more frequently.> This is a very common misperception of an individual who is stabbed: time and time again I have heard victims say that they could just feel a punch rather than the knife itself penetrating> The university medical schools had always paid us to lecture in our subject but they decided – almost all of them, one by one – that now they would not continue funding or teaching forensic pathology. The main reason they gave was lack of forensic research and lack of publication in prestigious scientific journals. … We had essentially been privatized. From now on, instead of providing forensic services for free, our salaries paid by the universities at which we taught, we would directly bill the police, coroners or defence solicitors for payment.> 'SIDS, Dick. It's SIDS.' 'But there's too much about it that's not quite right. I'd rather give ""Unascertained"".' 'We're not here to pass judgement on them for having a few cannabis plants in the attic, for heaven's sake. Or for liking a drink. They're obviously not a chaotic pair of addicts. The father has a regular job, the baby was healthy and well cared for, they turned up for all their health-visitor appointments and vaccinations, there was a supportive wider family – the grandma, the sister. No, don't let's leave ""Unascertained"" hanging over a young couple who're simply poor and doing their best.' SIDS it was, then."

143,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12325885-keri,5,"This autobiography-memoir of a forensic pathologist is a compelling mix of science, true crime, the vagaries of legal systems, and the cost that some careers have on one’s personal life. The author has apparently performed over 20,000 post-mortem examinations in his working lifetime and he shares the details of some of them, from the mundane to the famous (although not being British I was only vaguely familiar with most of the well-publicized cases he mentioned.) His thoughts on Princess Diana’s death were of particular interest to me since that event looms large in my memory. Before beginning a review I will often skim other reviews, in particular the ones who rate the opposite of me. The negative reviews for this book seem centered on readers’ dislike of the amount of focus on the author’s personal life- from childhood to the present day, at the expense of more stories and details about his cases. I didn’t find that to be a problem at all. To me there seemed to be a very good balance of his personal life and his cases. They very much influenced each other. Perhaps the problem was with unrealistic expectations as to the content of the book- the blurb only mentions personal cost and family at the very end, although I would point out that the subtitle does say “the life and many deaths of Britain’s top forensic pathologist” (emphasis added). I listened to this on audiobook and it was narrated by the author which I always appreciate in non-fiction, especially memoir or autobiography.Had I noticed that the author is British and all of this is set in England, I might not have picked it up, thinking it would not have any comment to make on the practice of forensic pathology in America; however, I’m glad I didn’t notice that and did pick it up. It doesn’t in fact comment much on the practice and progression of forensic pathology in the U.S., aside from a couple of brief mentions (including a bit from after 9/11). But the book still resonated with me. Although we live and work on different continents and in very different fields, I also work in a para-legal profession- meaning neither of us are law enforcement officers or lawyers working directly with criminal and civil legal cases, rather our work often informs and influences those cases. Many of his frustrations over time I have also noticed in my own world- for example, the vast increase in both the amount of documentation required, and in the amount and intensity of public and legal scrutiny; the personal attacks; the demand for black and white decision making and 100% accuracy in a field that as he notes is a “combination of facts, experience and judgement”, as is mine; and last but not least the constant exposure to human suffering and tragedy over decades of time. It is a heavy burden. I'm glad the author confronted his demons to write this. Recommended. "
144,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56688456-emi,4,"4.5 ****Wow, what a fascinating, engaging, and emotional read. This book definitely isn't for everybody, but it perfectly hit the intellectual parts of my brain that love to acquire medical knowledge and also the more emotional side of learning about people, human nature, and society. Listening to the audiobook meant that hearing Dr. Richard Shepard himself talk about these things was very clear to understand due to his incredible knowledge but also meant that he didn't overstate or embellish or hyperbolise any of the morbid details but showed with a quiet emotion the hard parts of his life and career over the course of this book. What struck me the most when reading was probably the sections on mass disasters. I don't know why but I've never in my life considered or properly thought about the logistics of dealing with the dead in such events. When you hear about terrorism events on the news you think about how awful it must be for the families who have lost loved ones and how horrible it is for the victims but you never consider the practicalities that doctors, hospitals, pathologists, the government etc. are doing to get society back to normal as soon as possible. The descriptions of preparing a whole warehouse to turn into a mortuary to conduct thousands upon thousands of post-mortems after terrorist bombing attacks, the realisation that it was an intensely logistically difficult and medically challenging operation to catalogue, identify, and collect every single body part after 9/11, (a process which was only completed in 2013) with every British victim having to be flown back from America to be examined by Dr. Shepard etc. etc. My astonishment is endless at the jobs that people have that are so necessary for society to function but that so many of us wouldn't be able to cope with. I'm glad, because of this, that Dr. Shepard did open up at the end of the book about the PTSD he's acquired from examining over 23,000 dead bodies over the years. I don't know if pathologists get the same recognition as normal doctors because they are not technically ""saving lives"" but what they do is so important and difficult and fascinating to read about that I for one will certainly be more aware of the ""behind the scenes"" of death and the people that work to make it as palatable and un-traumatic for the living, whilst taking on the bulk of the trauma themselves.

I’ve always been incredibly interested in anything medical, and I’m a true-crime junkie too so I knew that this book was going to be a major hit with me. It really didn’t disappoint! Top forensic pathologist, Dr Richard Shepherd, has worked on many interesting cases including the Hungerford massacre, the Clapham rail distaster, 9/11, the 7/7 bombings, and even Princess Diana. It was so interesting to learn about his work, but also to gain a real insight into the judicial system and all the things that go on behind close doors in this profession. Shepherd sheds light on many issues in this book, particularly within the legal system, injustice within society and even his own experience with a debilitating mental illness. He also talks about each case in an extremely respectful way, remembering that these casualties were once real people with real lives. The book is a really good balance of him talking about his work and his fascinating profession, but also his personal life, i.e. his marriage, family life and personal struggles, and how each of these aspects of his life were affected by his work.I would say that despite the book being entirely centred around death, and often unlawful death, this is not an exceptionally heavy read. I didn’t find it to be toooo gory either so I really think it’s worth giving a go if you like the sound of it! More than anything, I’ve come away from this book with a lot of newfound knowledge on the topic of forensic pathology, and a real sense of respect for everyone involved in that profession. In my opinion, one of the most rewarding things about reading is when you come away from a book feeling more educated!🤓"
146,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96381170-chelsea-r-h,5,"I really enjoyed this book and found it completely fascinating. It delved into the rather shadowy world of forensic pathology, which most people are completely unaware of, beyond the stereotypes and half-truths portrayed in popular crime dramas, such as NCIS. In many ways, Dr Shepherd demystified death, informing the reader about the practicalities of death--why and how it occurs, what happens after you die, the legalities surrounding death and a bunch of other topics. He also weaves his own personal story, and how he became to be regarded as one of Britain's top pathologists, between fascinating cases and facts.I don't necessarily recommend this book unreservedly though. A lot of people could find this boko disturbing or triggering. Dr Shepherd delves into some exceeding graphic (though not glorified, simply scientific) descriptions of cases he has worked on. They include several horrific rapes, child abuse cases, and several astoundingly callous murders, as well large scale accidents, tragedies and mass murders. There's also several instances of deaths triggered by racism, and the deaths of black people in police custody, or caused by inappropriate restraint are also discussed in depth. Besides all that, there are also numerous descriptions of how a post-mortem is performed and what a body looks like during the process. As I've already said, none of this glorified or reveled in, Dr Shepherd is merely stating facts and reporting the truth, however, I know a lot of people cannot or do not want to handle these things, and so should be warned before reading this book.Overall, I loved reading this book, despite a few sections that disturbed or distressed me. It was very good, and it shone light on a part of society that isn't considered very regularly, helping to normalise it and make it a more comfortable experience for the average grieving family member, who may have to go through the process for whatever reason. I highly recommend it, if you think you can stomach some of the more difficult topics it covers."
147,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26176887-chris,5,"An absolutely fascinating read from start to finish.This was a very honest, down-to-earth read. It was explained in layman's terms and was not bogged down with medical jargon or official medical terminology (which I, personally, wouldn't mind but it wouldn't be for everyone).Dr Richard Shepherd is one of the UK's leading pathologists and has worked on some of the most famous and infamous deaths over the last forty or so years both nationally and internationally.Cases the UK populace will know well are mentioned such as the one of Rachel Nickell, the single mum who was walking on Wimbledon Common with her two-year-old son back in 1992 when she was murdered and raped while her son looked on. Her assailant was caught, arrested and jailed only to be acquitted just a few years later. He turned out not to be the murderer at all. Or Stephen Lawrence, the eighteen-year-old black youth brutally stabbed by five white males back in 1993 merely because of the colour of his skin (only two of the five men have been jailed).Then there are the very famous cases; 9/11, 7/7, the death of Princess Diana and the Bali bombings.On top of these totally immersive cases Dr Shepherd talks of his personal life; his wife and children, his obsession with work and the stresses involved in determining how someone may have died and making sure, in the minutest detail, that what he records and says is absolutely correct.From page one to page four-hundred-and-forty-four the world around me dissolved into nothingness and this book became the only thing in existence. It has quickly been marked as one of my favourites and I am convinced, once you have read it, it will be one of yours too."
148,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7132654-noel-powell,4,"I sort of came upon this book by accident. I had recently read the very funny ""This is going to hurt"" by Adam Kay about the life of a junior gynacoligist. I thought that I had enjoyed the jolly japes so much that I would read another medical autobiography. However this time the fun would be centred around cadavers not lady parts. Boy was I in for a surprise. No farcical comedy here. It is a very serious book. Nonetheless I found myself being drawn in to the cases of infamous deaths through the eyes of the man who cuts up the bodies to find the clues. Thousands of bodies. While fascinating though this career was, it has a heavy price. There is a thread of doom, melancholy and misery through out this book but you feel you have to turn the page. The writer would seem to be an unemotional type to begin but his choice of career and the need to close off mentally sees him being dragged down into PTSD. So you read on for the compelling murder puzzles while also have a sinking feeling. Its like watching disaster from afar. Its fascinating and sad at the same time but you just have to look. I should say it is very well written. It is a very different book from the one I thought I was going to read but I am glad that I have read it all the same."
149,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89494011-amy,3,"At around 25% into this book I honestly considered DNF'ing because the writing was just not gripping and we were getting more about Shepherd's family life than his actual job. It was honestly a bit boring and there didn't feel like there was any life in the writing. It felt a bit like he'd simply put pen to paper and wrote a shopping list. HOWEVER, I am glad I stuck with it because it got infinitely better as the book went on and especially the last 25% you can tell how passionate he is about his work and the role that he has in death. I really felt like I was able to connect with him more as the book went on, and found myself immersed in his world.I really enjoy the sections of the book that were solely focused on the cases that he has worked on; they were very interesting to me and learning about what his job entails was intriguing. I don't think there was enough of this and thats where this book suffered in my opinion. Shepherd has a tendency to jump rapidly from case to case and the book doesn't flow overly naturally. I think this cold be in part due to the fact that it was written over a period of time and due to the personal experiences he had going on at the time. I don't think he's a natural storyteller and it did show at times.Overall this is clearly a man who is passionate about the work he does and it does show towards the end. An interesting, if not that enjoyable, read. "
150,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28283498-marissa,3,"I was anticipating a good read but feel very let down. I expected this book to be more medical and not so much about the personal life of Dr. Shepard himself. I still found it to be an interesting read, however I wish there was more discussion and detail about the forensic pathology aspect. 3.5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️ "
151,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8545345-kelly,3,"I have been trying to write this review for ages because I have warring opinions.Generally, this book was incredibly interesting and I loved that it was easy to read but still packed with information, facts and real cases. It was quite emotive due to the nature of the cases, despite the actual writing tone being matter of fact and as unemotive as the author. I did not mind the concurrent chronicles of Shepherd's personal life - mainly because I am a nosy bitch. I thought that seeing the impact on Shepherd personally and on his family life was a consequence that many do not consider when thinking of the life of a pathologist - all glammed up by CSI type shows.I did not find the chronological approach the easiest to follow. I thought that it would have been better to chapter off the different cases and weave the personal elements into the cases. As it was, the cases stretched over a number of years and I struggled to keep track of where some had finished when they were mentioned later. I also felt that the personal elements were tacked on the end rather clunkily because they fit with the timing.My biggest issue however was with the tone at times, finding it often arrogant and at times it came.aceoss as biased. I also found the tone infuriating when speaking of women.The marriage to Jen was written in a way that suggests that Shepherd's life would have been easier if Jen hadn't wanted to further her career and become a Dr. There were times when he really spoke about her as if she should have been willing to sacrifice her life for his career. Then he would tack a sentence on saying, but I was proud of her so I suffered! Heaven forbid that he had to look after his own children to help his wife. There was also this compulsive need to remind us that he was a good father.Secondly - and I cannot stress how much this pissed me off. We have spent the whole book being told about the careers of the white men folk and how hard they worked and how skilled they were. Then in walks Vesna Djurovic. Dr Djurovic is an eminent pathologist. Yet this is how Shepherd describes her when she starts working at Guys:'...tall, blonde, leggy woman...who wore a short skirt and a friendly smile.'Absolutely no indication of her skillset or experience.He then speaks of her being 'claimed' by his boss Iain. Like she is a goldfish at the fair. Iain eventually marries her, congrats to them. Shepherd seems to give more respect to the dead than a live woman with a sterling career.Likewise, Jen became a Dr while raising kids with a largely absent husband and later in life. But when asked about the issues in his marriage he doesn't admit that he cannot connect to her emotionally or that the absences of BOTH OF THEIR JOBS are taking a toll, he says that she doesn't make him dinner. That is why their marriage isn't working. That traditional role of the little lady that proves her love for her husband. Dr Jen doesn't make him dinner. Bad woman.It was clear that Shepherd harboured ill-feeling when he described Iain and Vesna as a star couple of the pathology world. Citing their forays into social life and noting that he couldn't have this role because bloody Jen had decided to better herself and her job as a Dr meant that they didn't have the time to party. Honestly, I really felt for Jen throughout this book.I genuinely thought that this was going to be a strong 4, if not 5 star review but as the tone of arrogance grew and Shepherd seemed more incapable of taking criticism or admitting to errors, whether personal or professional, I started losing my interest in Shepherd and my rating dwindled"

155,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107954768-nelly,5,"This was genuinely one of the most interesting and engrossing books I have ever read. Dr Shepherd worked on some of the most notable cases in recent British history. (Hungerford massacre, Marchioness disaster, Stephen Lawrence and many more). I learned about people finding the mummified bodies of newborns in their attics/ under their floorboards, something I had never heard of before.At the end of the book too the author talks about his mental health and the effect his career had on it. For a job that requires you to distance yourself from the emotions of it all, I thought it was refreshing and needed that he spoke about his mental health."

Dr Shepherd had worked on many cases included 9/11, the Hungerford massacre and the sinking of the Marchioness, Harold Shipman cases and the terrorist attack in Bali. He has had an incredible career which has taken him all over the globe. I certainly couldn't do his job but the fact he still has the same passion for it as when we first started out is amazing and admirable. 5 out of 5 stars doesn't seem enough."

159,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19863335-molly,4,"I read this on recommendation of my sister who was thoroughly amused with the gruesome depictions of deaths and the process of decomposition, so when I started reading I assumed it would be like many other pieces of work which are essentially science communication as entertainment. This was different though. Sheperd weaves stories of his work with personal narrative, giving a slowly building sense of how his work affects his life and relationships, without ever making you doubt his dedication to forensic pathology. I wished that at some points he had been clearer over what year we were in as I tried to work out his age and experience, and this was not aided by the oscillation through time that the book makes. That said, the back and forth does feel authentically like a story you might be told by a relative, if only it were more clearly signposted. The cases discussed are always treated carefully and with respect, and it is refreshing to see Sheperd critique his own work and offer up his vulnerability throughout the book. His attitudes towards the crimes against and by women and black people are more nuanced than would sadly be expected from a person of his age, and it was empowering to read that this white middle class man used his positions of power to do something to help. My personal issue with the writing was with some of the clinical language used, it is understandable given the topics covered and the mental state of the author why such clinical language is employed, but I know that words such as ‘obese’, while medically accurate, can be difficult for some readers. Overall I enjoyed the book immensely, it tackles tough topics with kindness and compassion and is a rare insight into the intersect between the work and personal life of a professional in their field under the heavy weight of trust and opinion."
160,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8675686-kristiana,5,Incredibly interesting insight into forensic pathology and also the struggles of balancing being at the top of a profession and family life.

163,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108250738-samantha-hood,4,"I had high hopes for this book and I definitely enjoyed it, but it didn't quite hit the spot to be a 5* read. If you are interested in pathology, murders, or serious crimes and you've never really thought about how the pathologists feel, their first experience with a dead body or their first-ever autopsy on their own then you will ultimately love this book. The first couple of chapters are brilliant. They're such a mind-blowing insight into what pathology really is and the training that goes into being a pathologist is far more than you would ever anticipate considering they 'only deal with the dead'... it is SO much more than that. It's a very well written book; informative and upsetting at times, however, I found the parts relating to Richard Shepherd's personal life a little dull at times. I don't think they ultimately fitted within the themes of this book although I do understand the parts where he introduces his wife and children so as to ensure the reader understands the difficulties of juggling such an on-call job... it really is a way of life, a lifestyle and not just a job. However, other parts I really didn't feel were necessary. Aside from that, I thoroughly enjoyed this and learning more about autopsies and how the emergency services require such detailed descriptions when pursuing a charge or even just providing some understanding to bereaved families. A pathologist has such an important job and I hope from reading this book that people realise how important they truly are. "

I love medical non fiction and this is definitely one of the best ones I've ever read. Its incredibly fascinating and interesting. Richard worked on so many cases, including some very famous and high profile ones. I learnt so much about pathology from this book. It is not dry at all, which I know puts some people off non fiction. It was written in a very accessible, easy to read way. It also was very personal. You found out a lot about his own life, which I was not expecting going in but it was a pleasant surprise. However, I would give caution going into this book. It gives very graphic descriptions of some very sad real life cases including: suicide, violent crime, stabbings, murder, mass tragedies and disasters, shootings and SIDS. It's not an easy read in that sense so definitely exercise caution if that's the kind of thing that triggers you. Overall, I really enjoyed this book and I learnt a lot from it.TW: PTSD, suicide, graphic descriptions of death, disease and the body after its died. SIDS, stabbings, mass disasters, violent crime, shootings and murder are also described in detail"

And it was through her sudden death that Harold Shipman was finally revealed as a serial killer."" Shepherd has worked on many high profile cases, which of course are most captivating to read about. Such as Harold Shipman. The fact that Shipman killed 215 patients (and it is believed many more) and got away with it for 20 years always blows my mind - genuinely shocking. So the fact that Richard Shepherd did at least a few postmortems on some of his victims,one of whom was actually a family friend, drew me into Richard Shepherd's life even further... I won't say anymore besides the fact that I highly recommend this book!!"
170,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5973187-wsclai,3,"Reviews and ratings published for new books can be misleading. To me, this book is certainly overrated. When I started reading it, I thought it is entirely about his job as a forensic pathologist but it is not. All those life events of the author are distracting and something I am not really interested in. I simply skipped through them and just focussed on the cases. It’s more like an autobiography of a pathologist who holds a rather high regard of himself than a book about the working life of a pathologist."
171,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7283807-ben,4,"Forensic pathology—who knew it would be interesting? I enjoy reading about all sorts of different jobs, in any well-written memoir. This fits the bill, it is at least decently well written. Most of Shepherd's job is actually fairly pedestrian. For example, in one incident, he has to help identify bodies after a party cruise sinks in the Thames. Shepherd takes his job very seriously, and clearly enjoys it, despite suffering from some PTSD. The variety of cases, ranging from determining whether a death is a murder or self defense, to judging whether to report an infant's death as SIDS, to working to improve police restraint technique to avoid suffocation. He weaves in his personal life in an effective way, perhaps slightly indulgently but not too much so. The gruesome aspects of his job made it hard to connect with his children, and his wife was opposed to hearing anything about it. I found it interesting, in a somewhat disappointing way, how much the surrounding context around a death affected his report. Shepherd often seems to be under a lot of pressure from police and prosecutors, and so while he is professional he is definitely not neutral, or unbiased. He does not want to let the bad guy get away. > Any wavering, and defendants might be sent down for crimes they did not commit – or freed when they were guilty> Analytical readers will by now be associating my reluctance at the start of my career to meet relatives with the death of my own mother so early in life. And at my subsequent willingness to engage with others' grief they will say, 'Aha! He couldn't allow himself to experience the enormity of grief for his own loss! So, he experiences it again and again in manageable proportions through the grief of others. And, at the end of the meeting, he walks away from it!' I accept that there is probably something in that theory.> I felt that Anna, who must only have been seven years old, should not really be helping me reconstruct a homicide. … 'But your biology book diagrams don't have stab wounds.' 'I really think I can take it, Dad.' Maybe she was right. Maybe it was time to stop shielding my children from the unusual nature of my work. … Anna is a consultant histopathologist and, yes, she does have a keen interest in post-mortem and forensic medicine and even works for some of the coroners I worked for years ago> To the continued disgust of my family, I now used pork bellies or cow kidneys for my stabbing exercises. It was extremely hard to reproduce quite the feel of pushing through human skin, muscle and then an internal organ – perhaps because supermarket meat is seldom fresh. In reality, people who have killed with a knife are usually astonished by how easy it is. Once the blade has cut through the clothing and the skin, the inner body tissues put up little resistance.> People find it hard to believe that, in mass disasters, visual identification is unreliable, especially so when death has been traumatic or the body has been immersed in water. But even the uninjured and undecomposed dead are often simply not recognizable to those who knew them as animated individuals.> the overall aim was to turn the rugby scrum of forcible detention into something used only when necessary, and in a well-managed and safe way. The result, I believe, has been a dramatic reduction in the number of restraint deaths by the authorities. In fact, it is now much more dangerous to be arrested by a fellow citizen or shop or nightclub security staff.> In the Crown Court, a mother charged with manslaughter would be convicted only if her guilt is beyond reasonable doubt . The Family Court, which hears the local authority's request to remove her next child from her, must reconsider her case all over again – but apply a different level of proof. The Family Court applies the lower standard of proof – the balance of probabilities – to reach its conclusions. That can be defined as a 50.1 per cent chance of guilt … Sometimes, a year or more after a baby has been buried, we return to the file because another child has been born and there is the question now of safeguarding the living. By that time, a fuller picture of the baby's life and death may have emerged.> It has amazed me, over the years, how frequently men (but not noticeably women) will kill their best friend. And brothers commit fratricide even more frequently.> This is a very common misperception of an individual who is stabbed: time and time again I have heard victims say that they could just feel a punch rather than the knife itself penetrating> The university medical schools had always paid us to lecture in our subject but they decided – almost all of them, one by one – that now they would not continue funding or teaching forensic pathology. The main reason they gave was lack of forensic research and lack of publication in prestigious scientific journals. … We had essentially been privatized. From now on, instead of providing forensic services for free, our salaries paid by the universities at which we taught, we would directly bill the police, coroners or defence solicitors for payment.> 'SIDS, Dick. It's SIDS.' 'But there's too much about it that's not quite right. I'd rather give ""Unascertained"".' 'We're not here to pass judgement on them for having a few cannabis plants in the attic, for heaven's sake. Or for liking a drink. They're obviously not a chaotic pair of addicts. The father has a regular job, the baby was healthy and well cared for, they turned up for all their health-visitor appointments and vaccinations, there was a supportive wider family – the grandma, the sister. No, don't let's leave ""Unascertained"" hanging over a young couple who're simply poor and doing their best.' SIDS it was, then."
172,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46881762-babs,4,Amazing. Loved it. Not for the faint hearted but if you like this kind of stuff you’ll love this book. 
173,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12325885-keri,5,"This autobiography-memoir of a forensic pathologist is a compelling mix of science, true crime, the vagaries of legal systems, and the cost that some careers have on one’s personal life. The author has apparently performed over 20,000 post-mortem examinations in his working lifetime and he shares the details of some of them, from the mundane to the famous (although not being British I was only vaguely familiar with most of the well-publicized cases he mentioned.) His thoughts on Princess Diana’s death were of particular interest to me since that event looms large in my memory. Before beginning a review I will often skim other reviews, in particular the ones who rate the opposite of me. The negative reviews for this book seem centered on readers’ dislike of the amount of focus on the author’s personal life- from childhood to the present day, at the expense of more stories and details about his cases. I didn’t find that to be a problem at all. To me there seemed to be a very good balance of his personal life and his cases. They very much influenced each other. Perhaps the problem was with unrealistic expectations as to the content of the book- the blurb only mentions personal cost and family at the very end, although I would point out that the subtitle does say “the life and many deaths of Britain’s top forensic pathologist” (emphasis added). I listened to this on audiobook and it was narrated by the author which I always appreciate in non-fiction, especially memoir or autobiography.Had I noticed that the author is British and all of this is set in England, I might not have picked it up, thinking it would not have any comment to make on the practice of forensic pathology in America; however, I’m glad I didn’t notice that and did pick it up. It doesn’t in fact comment much on the practice and progression of forensic pathology in the U.S., aside from a couple of brief mentions (including a bit from after 9/11). But the book still resonated with me. Although we live and work on different continents and in very different fields, I also work in a para-legal profession- meaning neither of us are law enforcement officers or lawyers working directly with criminal and civil legal cases, rather our work often informs and influences those cases. Many of his frustrations over time I have also noticed in my own world- for example, the vast increase in both the amount of documentation required, and in the amount and intensity of public and legal scrutiny; the personal attacks; the demand for black and white decision making and 100% accuracy in a field that as he notes is a “combination of facts, experience and judgement”, as is mine; and last but not least the constant exposure to human suffering and tragedy over decades of time. It is a heavy burden. I'm glad the author confronted his demons to write this. Recommended. "
174,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56688456-emi,4,"4.5 ****Wow, what a fascinating, engaging, and emotional read. This book definitely isn't for everybody, but it perfectly hit the intellectual parts of my brain that love to acquire medical knowledge and also the more emotional side of learning about people, human nature, and society. Listening to the audiobook meant that hearing Dr. Richard Shepard himself talk about these things was very clear to understand due to his incredible knowledge but also meant that he didn't overstate or embellish or hyperbolise any of the morbid details but showed with a quiet emotion the hard parts of his life and career over the course of this book. What struck me the most when reading was probably the sections on mass disasters. I don't know why but I've never in my life considered or properly thought about the logistics of dealing with the dead in such events. When you hear about terrorism events on the news you think about how awful it must be for the families who have lost loved ones and how horrible it is for the victims but you never consider the practicalities that doctors, hospitals, pathologists, the government etc. are doing to get society back to normal as soon as possible. The descriptions of preparing a whole warehouse to turn into a mortuary to conduct thousands upon thousands of post-mortems after terrorist bombing attacks, the realisation that it was an intensely logistically difficult and medically challenging operation to catalogue, identify, and collect every single body part after 9/11, (a process which was only completed in 2013) with every British victim having to be flown back from America to be examined by Dr. Shepard etc. etc. My astonishment is endless at the jobs that people have that are so necessary for society to function but that so many of us wouldn't be able to cope with. I'm glad, because of this, that Dr. Shepard did open up at the end of the book about the PTSD he's acquired from examining over 23,000 dead bodies over the years. I don't know if pathologists get the same recognition as normal doctors because they are not technically ""saving lives"" but what they do is so important and difficult and fascinating to read about that I for one will certainly be more aware of the ""behind the scenes"" of death and the people that work to make it as palatable and un-traumatic for the living, whilst taking on the bulk of the trauma themselves.

175,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112848372-bookswithgeorgia,5,"This is a truly fascinating read from start to finish. Do you know when you just feel so glad and grateful that a book has been written? That’s how I feel about this one!Part autobiography and part memoir, this book offers an insight into the world of forensic pathology - a world that many of us probably do not give much thought to. I’ve always been incredibly interested in anything medical, and I’m a true-crime junkie too so I knew that this book was going to be a major hit with me. It really didn’t disappoint! Top forensic pathologist, Dr Richard Shepherd, has worked on many interesting cases including the Hungerford massacre, the Clapham rail distaster, 9/11, the 7/7 bombings, and even Princess Diana. It was so interesting to learn about his work, but also to gain a real insight into the judicial system and all the things that go on behind close doors in this profession. Shepherd sheds light on many issues in this book, particularly within the legal system, injustice within society and even his own experience with a debilitating mental illness. He also talks about each case in an extremely respectful way, remembering that these casualties were once real people with real lives. The book is a really good balance of him talking about his work and his fascinating profession, but also his personal life, i.e. his marriage, family life and personal struggles, and how each of these aspects of his life were affected by his work.I would say that despite the book being entirely centred around death, and often unlawful death, this is not an exceptionally heavy read. I didn’t find it to be toooo gory either so I really think it’s worth giving a go if you like the sound of it! More than anything, I’ve come away from this book with a lot of newfound knowledge on the topic of forensic pathology, and a real sense of respect for everyone involved in that profession. In my opinion, one of the most rewarding things about reading is when you come away from a book feeling more educated!🤓"
176,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96381170-chelsea-r-h,5,"I really enjoyed this book and found it completely fascinating. It delved into the rather shadowy world of forensic pathology, which most people are completely unaware of, beyond the stereotypes and half-truths portrayed in popular crime dramas, such as NCIS. In many ways, Dr Shepherd demystified death, informing the reader about the practicalities of death--why and how it occurs, what happens after you die, the legalities surrounding death and a bunch of other topics. He also weaves his own personal story, and how he became to be regarded as one of Britain's top pathologists, between fascinating cases and facts.I don't necessarily recommend this book unreservedly though. A lot of people could find this boko disturbing or triggering. Dr Shepherd delves into some exceeding graphic (though not glorified, simply scientific) descriptions of cases he has worked on. They include several horrific rapes, child abuse cases, and several astoundingly callous murders, as well large scale accidents, tragedies and mass murders. There's also several instances of deaths triggered by racism, and the deaths of black people in police custody, or caused by inappropriate restraint are also discussed in depth. Besides all that, there are also numerous descriptions of how a post-mortem is performed and what a body looks like during the process. As I've already said, none of this glorified or reveled in, Dr Shepherd is merely stating facts and reporting the truth, however, I know a lot of people cannot or do not want to handle these things, and so should be warned before reading this book.Overall, I loved reading this book, despite a few sections that disturbed or distressed me. It was very good, and it shone light on a part of society that isn't considered very regularly, helping to normalise it and make it a more comfortable experience for the average grieving family member, who may have to go through the process for whatever reason. I highly recommend it, if you think you can stomach some of the more difficult topics it covers."
177,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26176887-chris,5,"An absolutely fascinating read from start to finish.This was a very honest, down-to-earth read. It was explained in layman's terms and was not bogged down with medical jargon or official medical terminology (which I, personally, wouldn't mind but it wouldn't be for everyone).Dr Richard Shepherd is one of the UK's leading pathologists and has worked on some of the most famous and infamous deaths over the last forty or so years both nationally and internationally.Cases the UK populace will know well are mentioned such as the one of Rachel Nickell, the single mum who was walking on Wimbledon Common with her two-year-old son back in 1992 when she was murdered and raped while her son looked on. Her assailant was caught, arrested and jailed only to be acquitted just a few years later. He turned out not to be the murderer at all. Or Stephen Lawrence, the eighteen-year-old black youth brutally stabbed by five white males back in 1993 merely because of the colour of his skin (only two of the five men have been jailed).Then there are the very famous cases; 9/11, 7/7, the death of Princess Diana and the Bali bombings.On top of these totally immersive cases Dr Shepherd talks of his personal life; his wife and children, his obsession with work and the stresses involved in determining how someone may have died and making sure, in the minutest detail, that what he records and says is absolutely correct.From page one to page four-hundred-and-forty-four the world around me dissolved into nothingness and this book became the only thing in existence. It has quickly been marked as one of my favourites and I am convinced, once you have read it, it will be one of yours too."
178,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7132654-noel-powell,4,"I sort of came upon this book by accident. I had recently read the very funny ""This is going to hurt"" by Adam Kay about the life of a junior gynacoligist. I thought that I had enjoyed the jolly japes so much that I would read another medical autobiography. However this time the fun would be centred around cadavers not lady parts. Boy was I in for a surprise. No farcical comedy here. It is a very serious book. Nonetheless I found myself being drawn in to the cases of infamous deaths through the eyes of the man who cuts up the bodies to find the clues. Thousands of bodies. While fascinating though this career was, it has a heavy price. There is a thread of doom, melancholy and misery through out this book but you feel you have to turn the page. The writer would seem to be an unemotional type to begin but his choice of career and the need to close off mentally sees him being dragged down into PTSD. So you read on for the compelling murder puzzles while also have a sinking feeling. Its like watching disaster from afar. Its fascinating and sad at the same time but you just have to look. I should say it is very well written. It is a very different book from the one I thought I was going to read but I am glad that I have read it all the same."
179,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89494011-amy,3,"At around 25% into this book I honestly considered DNF'ing because the writing was just not gripping and we were getting more about Shepherd's family life than his actual job. It was honestly a bit boring and there didn't feel like there was any life in the writing. It felt a bit like he'd simply put pen to paper and wrote a shopping list. HOWEVER, I am glad I stuck with it because it got infinitely better as the book went on and especially the last 25% you can tell how passionate he is about his work and the role that he has in death. I really felt like I was able to connect with him more as the book went on, and found myself immersed in his world.I really enjoy the sections of the book that were solely focused on the cases that he has worked on; they were very interesting to me and learning about what his job entails was intriguing. I don't think there was enough of this and thats where this book suffered in my opinion. Shepherd has a tendency to jump rapidly from case to case and the book doesn't flow overly naturally. I think this cold be in part due to the fact that it was written over a period of time and due to the personal experiences he had going on at the time. I don't think he's a natural storyteller and it did show at times.Overall this is clearly a man who is passionate about the work he does and it does show towards the end. An interesting, if not that enjoyable, read. "
180,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28283498-marissa,3,"I was anticipating a good read but feel very let down. I expected this book to be more medical and not so much about the personal life of Dr. Shepard himself. I still found it to be an interesting read, however I wish there was more discussion and detail about the forensic pathology aspect. 3.5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️ "
181,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8545345-kelly,3,"I have been trying to write this review for ages because I have warring opinions.Generally, this book was incredibly interesting and I loved that it was easy to read but still packed with information, facts and real cases. It was quite emotive due to the nature of the cases, despite the actual writing tone being matter of fact and as unemotive as the author. I did not mind the concurrent chronicles of Shepherd's personal life - mainly because I am a nosy bitch. I thought that seeing the impact on Shepherd personally and on his family life was a consequence that many do not consider when thinking of the life of a pathologist - all glammed up by CSI type shows.I did not find the chronological approach the easiest to follow. I thought that it would have been better to chapter off the different cases and weave the personal elements into the cases. As it was, the cases stretched over a number of years and I struggled to keep track of where some had finished when they were mentioned later. I also felt that the personal elements were tacked on the end rather clunkily because they fit with the timing.My biggest issue however was with the tone at times, finding it often arrogant and at times it came.aceoss as biased. I also found the tone infuriating when speaking of women.The marriage to Jen was written in a way that suggests that Shepherd's life would have been easier if Jen hadn't wanted to further her career and become a Dr. There were times when he really spoke about her as if she should have been willing to sacrifice her life for his career. Then he would tack a sentence on saying, but I was proud of her so I suffered! Heaven forbid that he had to look after his own children to help his wife. There was also this compulsive need to remind us that he was a good father.Secondly - and I cannot stress how much this pissed me off. We have spent the whole book being told about the careers of the white men folk and how hard they worked and how skilled they were. Then in walks Vesna Djurovic. Dr Djurovic is an eminent pathologist. Yet this is how Shepherd describes her when she starts working at Guys:'...tall, blonde, leggy woman...who wore a short skirt and a friendly smile.'Absolutely no indication of her skillset or experience.He then speaks of her being 'claimed' by his boss Iain. Like she is a goldfish at the fair. Iain eventually marries her, congrats to them. Shepherd seems to give more respect to the dead than a live woman with a sterling career.Likewise, Jen became a Dr while raising kids with a largely absent husband and later in life. But when asked about the issues in his marriage he doesn't admit that he cannot connect to her emotionally or that the absences of BOTH OF THEIR JOBS are taking a toll, he says that she doesn't make him dinner. That is why their marriage isn't working. That traditional role of the little lady that proves her love for her husband. Dr Jen doesn't make him dinner. Bad woman.It was clear that Shepherd harboured ill-feeling when he described Iain and Vesna as a star couple of the pathology world. Citing their forays into social life and noting that he couldn't have this role because bloody Jen had decided to better herself and her job as a Dr meant that they didn't have the time to party. Honestly, I really felt for Jen throughout this book.I genuinely thought that this was going to be a strong 4, if not 5 star review but as the tone of arrogance grew and Shepherd seemed more incapable of taking criticism or admitting to errors, whether personal or professional, I started losing my interest in Shepherd and my rating dwindled"

Dr Shepherd worked on some of the most notable cases in recent British history. (Hungerford massacre, Marchioness disaster, Stephen Lawrence and many more). I learned about people finding the mummified bodies of newborns in their attics/ under their floorboards, something I had never heard of before.At the end of the book too the author talks about his mental health and the effect his career had on it. For a job that requires you to distance yourself from the emotions of it all, I thought it was refreshing and needed that he spoke about his mental health."

Dr Shepherd had worked on many cases included 9/11, the Hungerford massacre and the sinking of the Marchioness, Harold Shipman cases and the terrorist attack in Bali. He has had an incredible career which has taken him all over the globe. I certainly couldn't do his job but the fact he still has the same passion for it as when we first started out is amazing and admirable. 5 out of 5 stars doesn't seem enough."

189,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19863335-molly,4,"I read this on recommendation of my sister who was thoroughly amused with the gruesome depictions of deaths and the process of decomposition, so when I started reading I assumed it would be like many other pieces of work which are essentially science communication as entertainment. This was different though. Sheperd weaves stories of his work with personal narrative, giving a slowly building sense of how his work affects his life and relationships, without ever making you doubt his dedication to forensic pathology. I wished that at some points he had been clearer over what year we were in as I tried to work out his age and experience, and this was not aided by the oscillation through time that the book makes. That said, the back and forth does feel authentically like a story you might be told by a relative, if only it were more clearly signposted. The cases discussed are always treated carefully and with respect, and it is refreshing to see Sheperd critique his own work and offer up his vulnerability throughout the book. His attitudes towards the crimes against and by women and black people are more nuanced than would sadly be expected from a person of his age, and it was empowering to read that this white middle class man used his positions of power to do something to help. My personal issue with the writing was with some of the clinical language used, it is understandable given the topics covered and the mental state of the author why such clinical language is employed, but I know that words such as ‘obese’, while medically accurate, can be difficult for some readers. Overall I enjoyed the book immensely, it tackles tough topics with kindness and compassion and is a rare insight into the intersect between the work and personal life of a professional in their field under the heavy weight of trust and opinion."
190,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8675686-kristiana,5,Incredibly interesting insight into forensic pathology and also the struggles of balancing being at the top of a profession and family life.

If you are interested in pathology, murders, or serious crimes and you've never really thought about how the pathologists feel, their first experience with a dead body or their first-ever autopsy on their own then you will ultimately love this book. The first couple of chapters are brilliant. They're such a mind-blowing insight into what pathology really is and the training that goes into being a pathologist is far more than you would ever anticipate considering they 'only deal with the dead'... it is SO much more than that. It's a very well written book; informative and upsetting at times, however, I found the parts relating to Richard Shepherd's personal life a little dull at times. I don't think they ultimately fitted within the themes of this book although I do understand the parts where he introduces his wife and children so as to ensure the reader understands the difficulties of juggling such an on-call job... it really is a way of life, a lifestyle and not just a job. However, other parts I really didn't feel were necessary. Aside from that, I thoroughly enjoyed this and learning more about autopsies and how the emergency services require such detailed descriptions when pursuing a charge or even just providing some understanding to bereaved families. A pathologist has such an important job and I hope from reading this book that people realise how important they truly are. "

I love medical non fiction and this is definitely one of the best ones I've ever read. Its incredibly fascinating and interesting. Richard worked on so many cases, including some very famous and high profile ones. I learnt so much about pathology from this book. It is not dry at all, which I know puts some people off non fiction. It was written in a very accessible, easy to read way. It also was very personal. You found out a lot about his own life, which I was not expecting going in but it was a pleasant surprise. However, I would give caution going into this book. It gives very graphic descriptions of some very sad real life cases including: suicide, violent crime, stabbings, murder, mass tragedies and disasters, shootings and SIDS. It's not an easy read in that sense so definitely exercise caution if that's the kind of thing that triggers you. Overall, I really enjoyed this book and I learnt a lot from it.TW: PTSD, suicide, graphic descriptions of death, disease and the body after its died.

And it was through her sudden death that Harold Shipman was finally revealed as a serial killer."" Shepherd has worked on many high profile cases, which of course are most captivating to read about. Such as Harold Shipman. The fact that Shipman killed 215 patients (and it is believed many more) and got away with it for 20 years always blows my mind - genuinely shocking. So the fact that Richard Shepherd did at least a few postmortems on some of his victims,one of whom was actually a family friend, drew me into Richard Shepherd's life even further...

When I started reading it, I thought it is entirely about his job as a forensic pathologist but it is not. All those life events of the author are distracting and something I am not really interested in. I simply skipped through them and just focussed on the cases. It’s more like an autobiography of a pathologist who holds a rather high regard of himself than a book about the working life of a pathologist."
201,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7283807-ben,4,"Forensic pathology—who knew it would be interesting? I enjoy reading about all sorts of different jobs, in any well-written memoir. This fits the bill, it is at least decently well written. Most of Shepherd's job is actually fairly pedestrian. For example, in one incident, he has to help identify bodies after a party cruise sinks in the Thames. Shepherd takes his job very seriously, and clearly enjoys it, despite suffering from some PTSD. The variety of cases, ranging from determining whether a death is a murder or self defense, to judging whether to report an infant's death as SIDS, to working to improve police restraint technique to avoid suffocation. He weaves in his personal life in an effective way, perhaps slightly indulgently but not too much so. The gruesome aspects of his job made it hard to connect with his children, and his wife was opposed to hearing anything about it. I found it interesting, in a somewhat disappointing way, how much the surrounding context around a death affected his report. Shepherd often seems to be under a lot of pressure from police and prosecutors, and so while he is professional he is definitely not neutral, or unbiased. He does not want to let the bad guy get away. > Any wavering, and defendants might be sent down for crimes they did not commit – or freed when they were guilty> Analytical readers will by now be associating my reluctance at the start of my career to meet relatives with the death of my own mother so early in life. And at my subsequent willingness to engage with others' grief they will say, 'Aha! He couldn't allow himself to experience the enormity of grief for his own loss! So, he experiences it again and again in manageable proportions through the grief of others. And, at the end of the meeting, he walks away from it!' I accept that there is probably something in that theory.> I felt that Anna, who must only have been seven years old, should not really be helping me reconstruct a homicide. … 'But your biology book diagrams don't have stab wounds.' 'I really think I can take it, Dad.' Maybe she was right. Maybe it was time to stop shielding my children from the unusual nature of my work. … Anna is a consultant histopathologist and, yes, she does have a keen interest in post-mortem and forensic medicine and even works for some of the coroners I worked for years ago> To the continued disgust of my family, I now used pork bellies or cow kidneys for my stabbing exercises. It was extremely hard to reproduce quite the feel of pushing through human skin, muscle and then an internal organ – perhaps because supermarket meat is seldom fresh. In reality, people who have killed with a knife are usually astonished by how easy it is. Once the blade has cut through the clothing and the skin, the inner body tissues put up little resistance.> People find it hard to believe that, in mass disasters, visual identification is unreliable, especially so when death has been traumatic or the body has been immersed in water. But even the uninjured and undecomposed dead are often simply not recognizable to those who knew them as animated individuals.> the overall aim was to turn the rugby scrum of forcible detention into something used only when necessary, and in a well-managed and safe way. The result, I believe, has been a dramatic reduction in the number of restraint deaths by the authorities. In fact, it is now much more dangerous to be arrested by a fellow citizen or shop or nightclub security staff.> In the Crown Court, a mother charged with manslaughter would be convicted only if her guilt is beyond reasonable doubt . The Family Court, which hears the local authority's request to remove her next child from her, must reconsider her case all over again – but apply a different level of proof. The Family Court applies the lower standard of proof – the balance of probabilities – to reach its conclusions. That can be defined as a 50.1 per cent chance of guilt … Sometimes, a year or more after a baby has been buried, we return to the file because another child has been born and there is the question now of safeguarding the living. By that time, a fuller picture of the baby's life and death may have emerged.> It has amazed me, over the years, how frequently men (but not noticeably women) will kill their best friend. And brothers commit fratricide even more frequently.> This is a very common misperception of an individual who is stabbed: time and time again I have heard victims say that they could just feel a punch rather than the knife itself penetrating> The university medical schools had always paid us to lecture in our subject but they decided – almost all of them, one by one – that now they would not continue funding or teaching forensic pathology. The main reason they gave was lack of forensic research and lack of publication in prestigious scientific journals. … We had essentially been privatized. From now on, instead of providing forensic services for free, our salaries paid by the universities at which we taught, we would directly bill the police, coroners or defence solicitors for payment.> 'SIDS, Dick. It's SIDS.' 'But there's too much about it that's not quite right. I'd rather give ""Unascertained"".' 'We're not here to pass judgement on them for having a few cannabis plants in the attic, for heaven's sake. Or for liking a drink. They're obviously not a chaotic pair of addicts. The father has a regular job, the baby was healthy and well cared for, they turned up for all their health-visitor appointments and vaccinations, there was a supportive wider family – the grandma, the sister. No, don't let's leave ""Unascertained"" hanging over a young couple who're simply poor and doing their best.' SIDS it was, then."

203,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12325885-keri,5,"This autobiography-memoir of a forensic pathologist is a compelling mix of science, true crime, the vagaries of legal systems, and the cost that some careers have on one’s personal life. The author has apparently performed over 20,000 post-mortem examinations in his working lifetime and he shares the details of some of them, from the mundane to the famous (although not being British I was only vaguely familiar with most of the well-publicized cases he mentioned.) His thoughts on Princess Diana’s death were of particular interest to me since that event looms large in my memory. Before beginning a review I will often skim other reviews, in particular the ones who rate the opposite of me. The negative reviews for this book seem centered on readers’ dislike of the amount of focus on the author’s personal life- from childhood to the present day, at the expense of more stories and details about his cases. I didn’t find that to be a problem at all. To me there seemed to be a very good balance of his personal life and his cases. They very much influenced each other. Perhaps the problem was with unrealistic expectations as to the content of the book- the blurb only mentions personal cost and family at the very end, although I would point out that the subtitle does say “the life and many deaths of Britain’s top forensic pathologist” (emphasis added). I listened to this on audiobook and it was narrated by the author which I always appreciate in non-fiction, especially memoir or autobiography.Had I noticed that the author is British and all of this is set in England, I might not have picked it up, thinking it would not have any comment to make on the practice of forensic pathology in America; however, I’m glad I didn’t notice that and did pick it up. It doesn’t in fact comment much on the practice and progression of forensic pathology in the U.S., aside from a couple of brief mentions (including a bit from after 9/11). But the book still resonated with me. Although we live and work on different continents and in very different fields, I also work in a para-legal profession- meaning neither of us are law enforcement officers or lawyers working directly with criminal and civil legal cases, rather our work often informs and influences those cases. Many of his frustrations over time I have also noticed in my own world- for example, the vast increase in both the amount of documentation required, and in the amount and intensity of public and legal scrutiny; the personal attacks; the demand for black and white decision making and 100% accuracy in a field that as he notes is a “combination of facts, experience and judgement”, as is mine; and last but not least the constant exposure to human suffering and tragedy over decades of time. It is a heavy burden. I'm glad the author confronted his demons to write this. Recommended. "

This book definitely isn't for everybody, but it perfectly hit the intellectual parts of my brain that love to acquire medical knowledge and also the more emotional side of learning about people, human nature, and society. Listening to the audiobook meant that hearing Dr. Richard Shepard himself talk about these things was very clear to understand due to his incredible knowledge but also meant that he didn't overstate or embellish or hyperbolise any of the morbid details but showed with a quiet emotion the hard parts of his life and career over the course of this book. What struck me the most when reading was probably the sections on mass disasters. I don't know why but I've never in my life considered or properly thought about the logistics of dealing with the dead in such events. When you hear about terrorism events on the news you think about how awful it must be for the families who have lost loved ones and how horrible it is for the victims but you never consider the practicalities that doctors, hospitals, pathologists, the government etc. are doing to get society back to normal as soon as possible. The descriptions of preparing a whole warehouse to turn into a mortuary to conduct thousands upon thousands of post-mortems after terrorist bombing attacks, the realisation that it was an intensely logistically difficult and medically challenging operation to catalogue, identify, and collect every single body part after 9/11, (a process which was only completed in 2013) with every British victim having to be flown back from America to be examined by Dr. Shepard etc. etc. My astonishment is endless at the jobs that people have that are so necessary for society to function but that so many of us wouldn't be able to cope with. I'm glad, because of this, that Dr. Shepard did open up at the end of the book about the PTSD he's acquired from examining over 23,000 dead bodies over the years. I don't know if pathologists get the same recognition as normal doctors because they are not technically ""saving lives"" but what they do is so important and difficult and fascinating to read about that I for one will certainly be more aware of the ""behind the scenes"" of death and the people that work to make it as palatable and un-traumatic for the living, whilst taking on the bulk of the trauma themselves.

205,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112848372-bookswithgeorgia,5,"This is a truly fascinating read from start to finish. Do you know when you just feel so glad and grateful that a book has been written? That’s how I feel about this one!Part autobiography and part memoir, this book offers an insight into the world of forensic pathology - a world that many of us probably do not give much thought to. I’ve always been incredibly interested in anything medical, and I’m a true-crime junkie too so I knew that this book was going to be a major hit with me. It really didn’t disappoint! Top forensic pathologist, Dr Richard Shepherd, has worked on many interesting cases including the Hungerford massacre, the Clapham rail distaster, 9/11, the 7/7 bombings, and even Princess Diana. It was so interesting to learn about his work, but also to gain a real insight into the judicial system and all the things that go on behind close doors in this profession. Shepherd sheds light on many issues in this book, particularly within the legal system, injustice within society and even his own experience with a debilitating mental illness. He also talks about each case in an extremely respectful way, remembering that these casualties were once real people with real lives. The book is a really good balance of him talking about his work and his fascinating profession, but also his personal life, i.e. his marriage, family life and personal struggles, and how each of these aspects of his life were affected by his work.I would say that despite the book being entirely centred around death, and often unlawful death, this is not an exceptionally heavy read. I didn’t find it to be toooo gory either so I really think it’s worth giving a go if you like the sound of it! More than anything, I’ve come away from this book with a lot of newfound knowledge on the topic of forensic pathology, and a real sense of respect for everyone involved in that profession. In my opinion, one of the most rewarding things about reading is when you come away from a book feeling more educated!🤓"
206,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96381170-chelsea-r-h,5,"I really enjoyed this book and found it completely fascinating. It delved into the rather shadowy world of forensic pathology, which most people are completely unaware of, beyond the stereotypes and half-truths portrayed in popular crime dramas, such as NCIS. In many ways, Dr Shepherd demystified death, informing the reader about the practicalities of death--why and how it occurs, what happens after you die, the legalities surrounding death and a bunch of other topics. He also weaves his own personal story, and how he became to be regarded as one of Britain's top pathologists, between fascinating cases and facts.I don't necessarily recommend this book unreservedly though. A lot of people could find this boko disturbing or triggering. Dr Shepherd delves into some exceeding graphic (though not glorified, simply scientific) descriptions of cases he has worked on. They include several horrific rapes, child abuse cases, and several astoundingly callous murders, as well large scale accidents, tragedies and mass murders. There's also several instances of deaths triggered by racism, and the deaths of black people in police custody, or caused by inappropriate restraint are also discussed in depth. Besides all that, there are also numerous descriptions of how a post-mortem is performed and what a body looks like during the process. As I've already said, none of this glorified or reveled in, Dr Shepherd is merely stating facts and reporting the truth, however, I know a lot of people cannot or do not want to handle these things, and so should be warned before reading this book.Overall, I loved reading this book, despite a few sections that disturbed or distressed me. It was very good, and it shone light on a part of society that isn't considered very regularly, helping to normalise it and make it a more comfortable experience for the average grieving family member, who may have to go through the process for whatever reason. I highly recommend it, if you think you can stomach some of the more difficult topics it covers."
207,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26176887-chris,5,"An absolutely fascinating read from start to finish.This was a very honest, down-to-earth read. It was explained in layman's terms and was not bogged down with medical jargon or official medical terminology (which I, personally, wouldn't mind but it wouldn't be for everyone).Dr Richard Shepherd is one of the UK's leading pathologists and has worked on some of the most famous and infamous deaths over the last forty or so years both nationally and internationally.Cases the UK populace will know well are mentioned such as the one of Rachel Nickell, the single mum who was walking on Wimbledon Common with her two-year-old son back in 1992 when she was murdered and raped while her son looked on. Her assailant was caught, arrested and jailed only to be acquitted just a few years later. He turned out not to be the murderer at all. Or Stephen Lawrence, the eighteen-year-old black youth brutally stabbed by five white males back in 1993 merely because of the colour of his skin (only two of the five men have been jailed).Then there are the very famous cases; 9/11, 7/7, the death of Princess Diana and the Bali bombings.On top of these totally immersive cases Dr Shepherd talks of his personal life; his wife and children, his obsession with work and the stresses involved in determining how someone may have died and making sure, in the minutest detail, that what he records and says is absolutely correct.From page one to page four-hundred-and-forty-four the world around me dissolved into nothingness and this book became the only thing in existence. It has quickly been marked as one of my favourites and I am convinced, once you have read it, it will be one of yours too."
208,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7132654-noel-powell,4,"I sort of came upon this book by accident. I had recently read the very funny ""This is going to hurt"" by Adam Kay about the life of a junior gynacoligist. I thought that I had enjoyed the jolly japes so much that I would read another medical autobiography. However this time the fun would be centred around cadavers not lady parts. Boy was I in for a surprise. No farcical comedy here. It is a very serious book. Nonetheless I found myself being drawn in to the cases of infamous deaths through the eyes of the man who cuts up the bodies to find the clues. Thousands of bodies. While fascinating though this career was, it has a heavy price. There is a thread of doom, melancholy and misery through out this book but you feel you have to turn the page. The writer would seem to be an unemotional type to begin but his choice of career and the need to close off mentally sees him being dragged down into PTSD. So you read on for the compelling murder puzzles while also have a sinking feeling. Its like watching disaster from afar. Its fascinating and sad at the same time but you just have to look. I should say it is very well written. It is a very different book from the one I thought I was going to read but I am glad that I have read it all the same."
209,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89494011-amy,3,"At around 25% into this book I honestly considered DNF'ing because the writing was just not gripping and we were getting more about Shepherd's family life than his actual job. It was honestly a bit boring and there didn't feel like there was any life in the writing. It felt a bit like he'd simply put pen to paper and wrote a shopping list. HOWEVER, I am glad I stuck with it because it got infinitely better as the book went on and especially the last 25% you can tell how passionate he is about his work and the role that he has in death. I really felt like I was able to connect with him more as the book went on, and found myself immersed in his world.I really enjoy the sections of the book that were solely focused on the cases that he has worked on; they were very interesting to me and learning about what his job entails was intriguing. I don't think there was enough of this and thats where this book suffered in my opinion. Shepherd has a tendency to jump rapidly from case to case and the book doesn't flow overly naturally. I think this cold be in part due to the fact that it was written over a period of time and due to the personal experiences he had going on at the time. I don't think he's a natural storyteller and it did show at times.Overall this is clearly a man who is passionate about the work he does and it does show towards the end. An interesting, if not that enjoyable, read. "
210,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28283498-marissa,3,"I was anticipating a good read but feel very let down. I expected this book to be more medical and not so much about the personal life of Dr. Shepard himself. I still found it to be an interesting read, however I wish there was more discussion and detail about the forensic pathology aspect. 3.5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️ "
211,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8545345-kelly,3,"I have been trying to write this review for ages because I have warring opinions.Generally, this book was incredibly interesting and I loved that it was easy to read but still packed with information, facts and real cases. It was quite emotive due to the nature of the cases, despite the actual writing tone being matter of fact and as unemotive as the author. I did not mind the concurrent chronicles of Shepherd's personal life - mainly because I am a nosy bitch. I thought that seeing the impact on Shepherd personally and on his family life was a consequence that many do not consider when thinking of the life of a pathologist - all glammed up by CSI type shows.I did not find the chronological approach the easiest to follow. I thought that it would have been better to chapter off the different cases and weave the personal elements into the cases. As it was, the cases stretched over a number of years and I struggled to keep track of where some had finished when they were mentioned later. I also felt that the personal elements were tacked on the end rather clunkily because they fit with the timing.My biggest issue however was with the tone at times, finding it often arrogant and at times it came.aceoss as biased. I also found the tone infuriating when speaking of women.The marriage to Jen was written in a way that suggests that Shepherd's life would have been easier if Jen hadn't wanted to further her career and become a Dr. There were times when he really spoke about her as if she should have been willing to sacrifice her life for his career. Then he would tack a sentence on saying, but I was proud of her so I suffered! Heaven forbid that he had to look after his own children to help his wife. There was also this compulsive need to remind us that he was a good father.Secondly - and I cannot stress how much this pissed me off. We have spent the whole book being told about the careers of the white men folk and how hard they worked and how skilled they were. Then in walks Vesna Djurovic. Dr Djurovic is an eminent pathologist. Yet this is how Shepherd describes her when she starts working at Guys:'...tall, blonde, leggy woman...who wore a short skirt and a friendly smile.'Absolutely no indication of her skillset or experience.He then speaks of her being 'claimed' by his boss Iain. Like she is a goldfish at the fair. Iain eventually marries her, congrats to them. Shepherd seems to give more respect to the dead than a live woman with a sterling career.Likewise, Jen became a Dr while raising kids with a largely absent husband and later in life. But when asked about the issues in his marriage he doesn't admit that he cannot connect to her emotionally or that the absences of BOTH OF THEIR JOBS are taking a toll, he says that she doesn't make him dinner. That is why their marriage isn't working. That traditional role of the little lady that proves her love for her husband. Dr Jen doesn't make him dinner. Bad woman.It was clear that Shepherd harboured ill-feeling when he described Iain and Vesna as a star couple of the pathology world. Citing their forays into social life and noting that he couldn't have this role because bloody Jen had decided to better herself and her job as a Dr meant that they didn't have the time to party. Honestly, I really felt for Jen throughout this book.I genuinely thought that this was going to be a strong 4, if not 5 star review but as the tone of arrogance grew and Shepherd seemed more incapable of taking criticism or admitting to errors, whether personal or professional, I started losing my interest in Shepherd and my rating dwindled"

Dr Shepherd worked on some of the most notable cases in recent British history. (Hungerford massacre, Marchioness disaster, Stephen Lawrence and many more). I learned about people finding the mummified bodies of newborns in their attics/ under their floorboards, something I had never heard of before.At the end of the book too the author talks about his mental health and the effect his career had on it. For a job that requires you to distance yourself from the emotions of it all, I thought it was refreshing and needed that he spoke about his mental health."

Dr Shepherd had worked on many cases included 9/11, the Hungerford massacre and the sinking of the Marchioness, Harold Shipman cases and the terrorist attack in Bali. He has had an incredible career which has taken him all over the globe. I certainly couldn't do his job but the fact he still has the same passion for it as when we first started out is amazing and admirable. 5 out of 5 stars doesn't seem enough."

219,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19863335-molly,4,"I read this on recommendation of my sister who was thoroughly amused with the gruesome depictions of deaths and the process of decomposition, so when I started reading I assumed it would be like many other pieces of work which are essentially science communication as entertainment. This was different though. Sheperd weaves stories of his work with personal narrative, giving a slowly building sense of how his work affects his life and relationships, without ever making you doubt his dedication to forensic pathology. I wished that at some points he had been clearer over what year we were in as I tried to work out his age and experience, and this was not aided by the oscillation through time that the book makes. That said, the back and forth does feel authentically like a story you might be told by a relative, if only it were more clearly signposted. The cases discussed are always treated carefully and with respect, and it is refreshing to see Sheperd critique his own work and offer up his vulnerability throughout the book. His attitudes towards the crimes against and by women and black people are more nuanced than would sadly be expected from a person of his age, and it was empowering to read that this white middle class man used his positions of power to do something to help. My personal issue with the writing was with some of the clinical language used, it is understandable given the topics covered and the mental state of the author why such clinical language is employed, but I know that words such as ‘obese’, while medically accurate, can be difficult for some readers. Overall I enjoyed the book immensely, it tackles tough topics with kindness and compassion and is a rare insight into the intersect between the work and personal life of a professional in their field under the heavy weight of trust and opinion."
220,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8675686-kristiana,5,Incredibly interesting insight into forensic pathology and also the struggles of balancing being at the top of a profession and family life.

223,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108250738-samantha-hood,4,"I had high hopes for this book and I definitely enjoyed it, but it didn't quite hit the spot to be a 5* read. If you are interested in pathology, murders, or serious crimes and you've never really thought about how the pathologists feel, their first experience with a dead body or their first-ever autopsy on their own then you will ultimately love this book. The first couple of chapters are brilliant. They're such a mind-blowing insight into what pathology really is and the training that goes into being a pathologist is far more than you would ever anticipate considering they 'only deal with the dead'... it is SO much more than that. It's a very well written book; informative and upsetting at times, however, I found the parts relating to Richard Shepherd's personal life a little dull at times. I don't think they ultimately fitted within the themes of this book although I do understand the parts where he introduces his wife and children so as to ensure the reader understands the difficulties of juggling such an on-call job... it really is a way of life, a lifestyle and not just a job. However, other parts I really didn't feel were necessary. Aside from that, I thoroughly enjoyed this and learning more about autopsies and how the emergency services require such detailed descriptions when pursuing a charge or even just providing some understanding to bereaved families. A pathologist has such an important job and I hope from reading this book that people realise how important they truly are. "

I love medical non fiction and this is definitely one of the best ones I've ever read. Its incredibly fascinating and interesting. Richard worked on so many cases, including some very famous and high profile ones. I learnt so much about pathology from this book. It is not dry at all, which I know puts some people off non fiction. It was written in a very accessible, easy to read way. It also was very personal. You found out a lot about his own life, which I was not expecting going in but it was a pleasant surprise. However, I would give caution going into this book. It gives very graphic descriptions of some very sad real life cases including: suicide, violent crime, stabbings, murder, mass tragedies and disasters, shootings and SIDS. It's not an easy read in that sense so definitely exercise caution if that's the kind of thing that triggers you. Overall, I really enjoyed this book and I learnt a lot from it.TW: PTSD, suicide, graphic descriptions of death, disease and the body after its died.

And it was through her sudden death that Harold Shipman was finally revealed as a serial killer."" Shepherd has worked on many high profile cases, which of course are most captivating to read about. Such as Harold Shipman. The fact that Shipman killed 215 patients (and it is believed many more) and got away with it for 20 years always blows my mind - genuinely shocking. So the fact that Richard Shepherd did at least a few postmortems on some of his victims,one of whom was actually a family friend, drew me into Richard Shepherd's life even further...

When I started reading it, I thought it is entirely about his job as a forensic pathologist but it is not. All those life events of the author are distracting and something I am not really interested in. I simply skipped through them and just focussed on the cases. It’s more like an autobiography of a pathologist who holds a rather high regard of himself than a book about the working life of a pathologist."
231,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7283807-ben,4,"Forensic pathology—who knew it would be interesting? I enjoy reading about all sorts of different jobs, in any well-written memoir. This fits the bill, it is at least decently well written. Most of Shepherd's job is actually fairly pedestrian. For example, in one incident, he has to help identify bodies after a party cruise sinks in the Thames. Shepherd takes his job very seriously, and clearly enjoys it, despite suffering from some PTSD. The variety of cases, ranging from determining whether a death is a murder or self defense, to judging whether to report an infant's death as SIDS, to working to improve police restraint technique to avoid suffocation. He weaves in his personal life in an effective way, perhaps slightly indulgently but not too much so. The gruesome aspects of his job made it hard to connect with his children, and his wife was opposed to hearing anything about it. I found it interesting, in a somewhat disappointing way, how much the surrounding context around a death affected his report. Shepherd often seems to be under a lot of pressure from police and prosecutors, and so while he is professional he is definitely not neutral, or unbiased. He does not want to let the bad guy get away. > Any wavering, and defendants might be sent down for crimes they did not commit – or freed when they were guilty> Analytical readers will by now be associating my reluctance at the start of my career to meet relatives with the death of my own mother so early in life. And at my subsequent willingness to engage with others' grief they will say, 'Aha! He couldn't allow himself to experience the enormity of grief for his own loss! So, he experiences it again and again in manageable proportions through the grief of others. And, at the end of the meeting, he walks away from it!' I accept that there is probably something in that theory.> I felt that Anna, who must only have been seven years old, should not really be helping me reconstruct a homicide. … 'But your biology book diagrams don't have stab wounds.' 'I really think I can take it, Dad.' Maybe she was right. Maybe it was time to stop shielding my children from the unusual nature of my work. … Anna is a consultant histopathologist and, yes, she does have a keen interest in post-mortem and forensic medicine and even works for some of the coroners I worked for years ago> To the continued disgust of my family, I now used pork bellies or cow kidneys for my stabbing exercises. It was extremely hard to reproduce quite the feel of pushing through human skin, muscle and then an internal organ – perhaps because supermarket meat is seldom fresh. In reality, people who have killed with a knife are usually astonished by how easy it is. Once the blade has cut through the clothing and the skin, the inner body tissues put up little resistance.> People find it hard to believe that, in mass disasters, visual identification is unreliable, especially so when death has been traumatic or the body has been immersed in water. But even the uninjured and undecomposed dead are often simply not recognizable to those who knew them as animated individuals.> the overall aim was to turn the rugby scrum of forcible detention into something used only when necessary, and in a well-managed and safe way. The result, I believe, has been a dramatic reduction in the number of restraint deaths by the authorities. In fact, it is now much more dangerous to be arrested by a fellow citizen or shop or nightclub security staff.> In the Crown Court, a mother charged with manslaughter would be convicted only if her guilt is beyond reasonable doubt . The Family Court, which hears the local authority's request to remove her next child from her, must reconsider her case all over again – but apply a different level of proof. The Family Court applies the lower standard of proof – the balance of probabilities – to reach its conclusions. That can be defined as a 50.1 per cent chance of guilt … Sometimes, a year or more after a baby has been buried, we return to the file because another child has been born and there is the question now of safeguarding the living. By that time, a fuller picture of the baby's life and death may have emerged.> It has amazed me, over the years, how frequently men (but not noticeably women) will kill their best friend. And brothers commit fratricide even more frequently.> This is a very common misperception of an individual who is stabbed: time and time again I have heard victims say that they could just feel a punch rather than the knife itself penetrating> The university medical schools had always paid us to lecture in our subject but they decided – almost all of them, one by one – that now they would not continue funding or teaching forensic pathology. The main reason they gave was lack of forensic research and lack of publication in prestigious scientific journals. … We had essentially been privatized. From now on, instead of providing forensic services for free, our salaries paid by the universities at which we taught, we would directly bill the police, coroners or defence solicitors for payment.> 'SIDS, Dick. It's SIDS.' 'But there's too much about it that's not quite right. I'd rather give ""Unascertained"".' 'We're not here to pass judgement on them for having a few cannabis plants in the attic, for heaven's sake. Or for liking a drink. They're obviously not a chaotic pair of addicts. The father has a regular job, the baby was healthy and well cared for, they turned up for all their health-visitor appointments and vaccinations, there was a supportive wider family – the grandma, the sister. No, don't let's leave ""Unascertained"" hanging over a young couple who're simply poor and doing their best.' SIDS it was, then."

233,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12325885-keri,5,"This autobiography-memoir of a forensic pathologist is a compelling mix of science, true crime, the vagaries of legal systems, and the cost that some careers have on one’s personal life. The author has apparently performed over 20,000 post-mortem examinations in his working lifetime and he shares the details of some of them, from the mundane to the famous (although not being British I was only vaguely familiar with most of the well-publicized cases he mentioned.) His thoughts on Princess Diana’s death were of particular interest to me since that event looms large in my memory. Before beginning a review I will often skim other reviews, in particular the ones who rate the opposite of me. The negative reviews for this book seem centered on readers’ dislike of the amount of focus on the author’s personal life- from childhood to the present day, at the expense of more stories and details about his cases. I didn’t find that to be a problem at all. To me there seemed to be a very good balance of his personal life and his cases. They very much influenced each other. Perhaps the problem was with unrealistic expectations as to the content of the book- the blurb only mentions personal cost and family at the very end, although I would point out that the subtitle does say “the life and many deaths of Britain’s top forensic pathologist” (emphasis added). I listened to this on audiobook and it was narrated by the author which I always appreciate in non-fiction, especially memoir or autobiography.Had I noticed that the author is British and all of this is set in England, I might not have picked it up, thinking it would not have any comment to make on the practice of forensic pathology in America; however, I’m glad I didn’t notice that and did pick it up. It doesn’t in fact comment much on the practice and progression of forensic pathology in the U.S., aside from a couple of brief mentions (including a bit from after 9/11). But the book still resonated with me. Although we live and work on different continents and in very different fields, I also work in a para-legal profession- meaning neither of us are law enforcement officers or lawyers working directly with criminal and civil legal cases, rather our work often informs and influences those cases. Many of his frustrations over time I have also noticed in my own world- for example, the vast increase in both the amount of documentation required, and in the amount and intensity of public and legal scrutiny; the personal attacks; the demand for black and white decision making and 100% accuracy in a field that as he notes is a “combination of facts, experience and judgement”, as is mine; and last but not least the constant exposure to human suffering and tragedy over decades of time. It is a heavy burden. I'm glad the author confronted his demons to write this. Recommended. "

This book definitely isn't for everybody, but it perfectly hit the intellectual parts of my brain that love to acquire medical knowledge and also the more emotional side of learning about people, human nature, and society. Listening to the audiobook meant that hearing Dr. Richard Shepard himself talk about these things was very clear to understand due to his incredible knowledge but also meant that he didn't overstate or embellish or hyperbolise any of the morbid details but showed with a quiet emotion the hard parts of his life and career over the course of this book. What struck me the most when reading was probably the sections on mass disasters. I don't know why but I've never in my life considered or properly thought about the logistics of dealing with the dead in such events. When you hear about terrorism events on the news you think about how awful it must be for the families who have lost loved ones and how horrible it is for the victims but you never consider the practicalities that doctors, hospitals, pathologists, the government etc. are doing to get society back to normal as soon as possible. The descriptions of preparing a whole warehouse to turn into a mortuary to conduct thousands upon thousands of post-mortems after terrorist bombing attacks, the realisation that it was an intensely logistically difficult and medically challenging operation to catalogue, identify, and collect every single body part after 9/11, (a process which was only completed in 2013) with every British victim having to be flown back from America to be examined by Dr. Shepard etc. etc. My astonishment is endless at the jobs that people have that are so necessary for society to function but that so many of us wouldn't be able to cope with. I'm glad, because of this, that Dr. Shepard did open up at the end of the book about the PTSD he's acquired from examining over 23,000 dead bodies over the years. I don't know if pathologists get the same recognition as normal doctors because they are not technically ""saving lives"" but what they do is so important and difficult and fascinating to read about that I for one will certainly be more aware of the ""behind the scenes"" of death and the people that work to make it as palatable and un-traumatic for the living, whilst taking on the bulk of the trauma themselves.

235,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112848372-bookswithgeorgia,5,"This is a truly fascinating read from start to finish. Do you know when you just feel so glad and grateful that a book has been written? That’s how I feel about this one!Part autobiography and part memoir, this book offers an insight into the world of forensic pathology - a world that many of us probably do not give much thought to. I’ve always been incredibly interested in anything medical, and I’m a true-crime junkie too so I knew that this book was going to be a major hit with me. It really didn’t disappoint! Top forensic pathologist, Dr Richard Shepherd, has worked on many interesting cases including the Hungerford massacre, the Clapham rail distaster, 9/11, the 7/7 bombings, and even Princess Diana. It was so interesting to learn about his work, but also to gain a real insight into the judicial system and all the things that go on behind close doors in this profession. Shepherd sheds light on many issues in this book, particularly within the legal system, injustice within society and even his own experience with a debilitating mental illness. He also talks about each case in an extremely respectful way, remembering that these casualties were once real people with real lives. The book is a really good balance of him talking about his work and his fascinating profession, but also his personal life, i.e. his marriage, family life and personal struggles, and how each of these aspects of his life were affected by his work.I would say that despite the book being entirely centred around death, and often unlawful death, this is not an exceptionally heavy read. I didn’t find it to be toooo gory either so I really think it’s worth giving a go if you like the sound of it! More than anything, I’ve come away from this book with a lot of newfound knowledge on the topic of forensic pathology, and a real sense of respect for everyone involved in that profession. In my opinion, one of the most rewarding things about reading is when you come away from a book feeling more educated!🤓"
236,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96381170-chelsea-r-h,5,"I really enjoyed this book and found it completely fascinating. It delved into the rather shadowy world of forensic pathology, which most people are completely unaware of, beyond the stereotypes and half-truths portrayed in popular crime dramas, such as NCIS. In many ways, Dr Shepherd demystified death, informing the reader about the practicalities of death--why and how it occurs, what happens after you die, the legalities surrounding death and a bunch of other topics. He also weaves his own personal story, and how he became to be regarded as one of Britain's top pathologists, between fascinating cases and facts.I don't necessarily recommend this book unreservedly though. A lot of people could find this boko disturbing or triggering. Dr Shepherd delves into some exceeding graphic (though not glorified, simply scientific) descriptions of cases he has worked on. They include several horrific rapes, child abuse cases, and several astoundingly callous murders, as well large scale accidents, tragedies and mass murders. There's also several instances of deaths triggered by racism, and the deaths of black people in police custody, or caused by inappropriate restraint are also discussed in depth. Besides all that, there are also numerous descriptions of how a post-mortem is performed and what a body looks like during the process. As I've already said, none of this glorified or reveled in, Dr Shepherd is merely stating facts and reporting the truth, however, I know a lot of people cannot or do not want to handle these things, and so should be warned before reading this book.Overall, I loved reading this book, despite a few sections that disturbed or distressed me. It was very good, and it shone light on a part of society that isn't considered very regularly, helping to normalise it and make it a more comfortable experience for the average grieving family member, who may have to go through the process for whatever reason. I highly recommend it, if you think you can stomach some of the more difficult topics it covers."
237,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26176887-chris,5,"An absolutely fascinating read from start to finish.This was a very honest, down-to-earth read. It was explained in layman's terms and was not bogged down with medical jargon or official medical terminology (which I, personally, wouldn't mind but it wouldn't be for everyone).Dr Richard Shepherd is one of the UK's leading pathologists and has worked on some of the most famous and infamous deaths over the last forty or so years both nationally and internationally.Cases the UK populace will know well are mentioned such as the one of Rachel Nickell, the single mum who was walking on Wimbledon Common with her two-year-old son back in 1992 when she was murdered and raped while her son looked on. Her assailant was caught, arrested and jailed only to be acquitted just a few years later. He turned out not to be the murderer at all. Or Stephen Lawrence, the eighteen-year-old black youth brutally stabbed by five white males back in 1993 merely because of the colour of his skin (only two of the five men have been jailed).Then there are the very famous cases; 9/11, 7/7, the death of Princess Diana and the Bali bombings.On top of these totally immersive cases Dr Shepherd talks of his personal life; his wife and children, his obsession with work and the stresses involved in determining how someone may have died and making sure, in the minutest detail, that what he records and says is absolutely correct.From page one to page four-hundred-and-forty-four the world around me dissolved into nothingness and this book became the only thing in existence. It has quickly been marked as one of my favourites and I am convinced, once you have read it, it will be one of yours too."
238,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7132654-noel-powell,4,"I sort of came upon this book by accident. I had recently read the very funny ""This is going to hurt"" by Adam Kay about the life of a junior gynacoligist. I thought that I had enjoyed the jolly japes so much that I would read another medical autobiography. However this time the fun would be centred around cadavers not lady parts. Boy was I in for a surprise. No farcical comedy here. It is a very serious book. Nonetheless I found myself being drawn in to the cases of infamous deaths through the eyes of the man who cuts up the bodies to find the clues. Thousands of bodies. While fascinating though this career was, it has a heavy price. There is a thread of doom, melancholy and misery through out this book but you feel you have to turn the page. The writer would seem to be an unemotional type to begin but his choice of career and the need to close off mentally sees him being dragged down into PTSD. So you read on for the compelling murder puzzles while also have a sinking feeling. Its like watching disaster from afar. Its fascinating and sad at the same time but you just have to look. I should say it is very well written. It is a very different book from the one I thought I was going to read but I am glad that I have read it all the same."
239,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89494011-amy,3,"At around 25% into this book I honestly considered DNF'ing because the writing was just not gripping and we were getting more about Shepherd's family life than his actual job. It was honestly a bit boring and there didn't feel like there was any life in the writing. It felt a bit like he'd simply put pen to paper and wrote a shopping list. HOWEVER, I am glad I stuck with it because it got infinitely better as the book went on and especially the last 25% you can tell how passionate he is about his work and the role that he has in death. I really felt like I was able to connect with him more as the book went on, and found myself immersed in his world.I really enjoy the sections of the book that were solely focused on the cases that he has worked on; they were very interesting to me and learning about what his job entails was intriguing. I don't think there was enough of this and thats where this book suffered in my opinion. Shepherd has a tendency to jump rapidly from case to case and the book doesn't flow overly naturally. I think this cold be in part due to the fact that it was written over a period of time and due to the personal experiences he had going on at the time. I don't think he's a natural storyteller and it did show at times.Overall this is clearly a man who is passionate about the work he does and it does show towards the end. An interesting, if not that enjoyable, read. "
240,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28283498-marissa,3,"I was anticipating a good read but feel very let down. I expected this book to be more medical and not so much about the personal life of Dr. Shepard himself. I still found it to be an interesting read, however I wish there was more discussion and detail about the forensic pathology aspect. 3.5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️ "
241,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8545345-kelly,3,"I have been trying to write this review for ages because I have warring opinions.Generally, this book was incredibly interesting and I loved that it was easy to read but still packed with information, facts and real cases. It was quite emotive due to the nature of the cases, despite the actual writing tone being matter of fact and as unemotive as the author. I did not mind the concurrent chronicles of Shepherd's personal life - mainly because I am a nosy bitch. I thought that seeing the impact on Shepherd personally and on his family life was a consequence that many do not consider when thinking of the life of a pathologist - all glammed up by CSI type shows.I did not find the chronological approach the easiest to follow. I thought that it would have been better to chapter off the different cases and weave the personal elements into the cases. As it was, the cases stretched over a number of years and I struggled to keep track of where some had finished when they were mentioned later. I also felt that the personal elements were tacked on the end rather clunkily because they fit with the timing.My biggest issue however was with the tone at times, finding it often arrogant and at times it came.aceoss as biased. I also found the tone infuriating when speaking of women.The marriage to Jen was written in a way that suggests that Shepherd's life would have been easier if Jen hadn't wanted to further her career and become a Dr. There were times when he really spoke about her as if she should have been willing to sacrifice her life for his career. Then he would tack a sentence on saying, but I was proud of her so I suffered! Heaven forbid that he had to look after his own children to help his wife. There was also this compulsive need to remind us that he was a good father.Secondly - and I cannot stress how much this pissed me off. We have spent the whole book being told about the careers of the white men folk and how hard they worked and how skilled they were. Then in walks Vesna Djurovic. Dr Djurovic is an eminent pathologist. Yet this is how Shepherd describes her when she starts working at Guys:'...tall, blonde, leggy woman...who wore a short skirt and a friendly smile.'Absolutely no indication of her skillset or experience.He then speaks of her being 'claimed' by his boss Iain. Like she is a goldfish at the fair. Iain eventually marries her, congrats to them. Shepherd seems to give more respect to the dead than a live woman with a sterling career.Likewise, Jen became a Dr while raising kids with a largely absent husband and later in life. But when asked about the issues in his marriage he doesn't admit that he cannot connect to her emotionally or that the absences of BOTH OF THEIR JOBS are taking a toll, he says that she doesn't make him dinner. That is why their marriage isn't working. That traditional role of the little lady that proves her love for her husband. Dr Jen doesn't make him dinner. Bad woman.It was clear that Shepherd harboured ill-feeling when he described Iain and Vesna as a star couple of the pathology world. Citing their forays into social life and noting that he couldn't have this role because bloody Jen had decided to better herself and her job as a Dr meant that they didn't have the time to party. Honestly, I really felt for Jen throughout this book.I genuinely thought that this was going to be a strong 4, if not 5 star review but as the tone of arrogance grew and Shepherd seemed more incapable of taking criticism or admitting to errors, whether personal or professional, I started losing my interest in Shepherd and my rating dwindled"

Dr Shepherd worked on some of the most notable cases in recent British history. (Hungerford massacre, Marchioness disaster, Stephen Lawrence and many more). I learned about people finding the mummified bodies of newborns in their attics/ under their floorboards, something I had never heard of before.At the end of the book too the author talks about his mental health and the effect his career had on it. For a job that requires you to distance yourself from the emotions of it all, I thought it was refreshing and needed that he spoke about his mental health."

Dr Shepherd had worked on many cases included 9/11, the Hungerford massacre and the sinking of the Marchioness, Harold Shipman cases and the terrorist attack in Bali. He has had an incredible career which has taken him all over the globe. I certainly couldn't do his job but the fact he still has the same passion for it as when we first started out is amazing and admirable. 5 out of 5 stars doesn't seem enough."

249,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19863335-molly,4,"I read this on recommendation of my sister who was thoroughly amused with the gruesome depictions of deaths and the process of decomposition, so when I started reading I assumed it would be like many other pieces of work which are essentially science communication as entertainment. This was different though. Sheperd weaves stories of his work with personal narrative, giving a slowly building sense of how his work affects his life and relationships, without ever making you doubt his dedication to forensic pathology. I wished that at some points he had been clearer over what year we were in as I tried to work out his age and experience, and this was not aided by the oscillation through time that the book makes. That said, the back and forth does feel authentically like a story you might be told by a relative, if only it were more clearly signposted. The cases discussed are always treated carefully and with respect, and it is refreshing to see Sheperd critique his own work and offer up his vulnerability throughout the book. His attitudes towards the crimes against and by women and black people are more nuanced than would sadly be expected from a person of his age, and it was empowering to read that this white middle class man used his positions of power to do something to help. My personal issue with the writing was with some of the clinical language used, it is understandable given the topics covered and the mental state of the author why such clinical language is employed, but I know that words such as ‘obese’, while medically accurate, can be difficult for some readers. Overall I enjoyed the book immensely, it tackles tough topics with kindness and compassion and is a rare insight into the intersect between the work and personal life of a professional in their field under the heavy weight of trust and opinion."
250,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8675686-kristiana,5,Incredibly interesting insight into forensic pathology and also the struggles of balancing being at the top of a profession and family life.

If you are interested in pathology, murders, or serious crimes and you've never really thought about how the pathologists feel, their first experience with a dead body or their first-ever autopsy on their own then you will ultimately love this book. The first couple of chapters are brilliant. They're such a mind-blowing insight into what pathology really is and the training that goes into being a pathologist is far more than you would ever anticipate considering they 'only deal with the dead'... it is SO much more than that. It's a very well written book; informative and upsetting at times, however, I found the parts relating to Richard Shepherd's personal life a little dull at times. I don't think they ultimately fitted within the themes of this book although I do understand the parts where he introduces his wife and children so as to ensure the reader understands the difficulties of juggling such an on-call job... it really is a way of life, a lifestyle and not just a job. However, other parts I really didn't feel were necessary. Aside from that, I thoroughly enjoyed this and learning more about autopsies and how the emergency services require such detailed descriptions when pursuing a charge or even just providing some understanding to bereaved families. A pathologist has such an important job and I hope from reading this book that people realise how important they truly are. "

I love medical non fiction and this is definitely one of the best ones I've ever read. Its incredibly fascinating and interesting. Richard worked on so many cases, including some very famous and high profile ones. I learnt so much about pathology from this book. It is not dry at all, which I know puts some people off non fiction. It was written in a very accessible, easy to read way. It also was very personal. You found out a lot about his own life, which I was not expecting going in but it was a pleasant surprise. However, I would give caution going into this book. It gives very graphic descriptions of some very sad real life cases including: suicide, violent crime, stabbings, murder, mass tragedies and disasters, shootings and SIDS. It's not an easy read in that sense so definitely exercise caution if that's the kind of thing that triggers you. Overall, I really enjoyed this book and I learnt a lot from it.TW: PTSD, suicide, graphic descriptions of death, disease and the body after its died.

And it was through her sudden death that Harold Shipman was finally revealed as a serial killer."" Shepherd has worked on many high profile cases, which of course are most captivating to read about. Such as Harold Shipman. The fact that Shipman killed 215 patients (and it is believed many more) and got away with it for 20 years always blows my mind - genuinely shocking. So the fact that Richard Shepherd did at least a few postmortems on some of his victims,one of whom was actually a family friend, drew me into Richard Shepherd's life even further...

When I started reading it, I thought it is entirely about his job as a forensic pathologist but it is not. All those life events of the author are distracting and something I am not really interested in. I simply skipped through them and just focussed on the cases. It’s more like an autobiography of a pathologist who holds a rather high regard of himself than a book about the working life of a pathologist."
261,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7283807-ben,4,"Forensic pathology—who knew it would be interesting? I enjoy reading about all sorts of different jobs, in any well-written memoir. This fits the bill, it is at least decently well written. Most of Shepherd's job is actually fairly pedestrian. For example, in one incident, he has to help identify bodies after a party cruise sinks in the Thames. Shepherd takes his job very seriously, and clearly enjoys it, despite suffering from some PTSD. The variety of cases, ranging from determining whether a death is a murder or self defense, to judging whether to report an infant's death as SIDS, to working to improve police restraint technique to avoid suffocation. He weaves in his personal life in an effective way, perhaps slightly indulgently but not too much so. The gruesome aspects of his job made it hard to connect with his children, and his wife was opposed to hearing anything about it. I found it interesting, in a somewhat disappointing way, how much the surrounding context around a death affected his report. Shepherd often seems to be under a lot of pressure from police and prosecutors, and so while he is professional he is definitely not neutral, or unbiased. He does not want to let the bad guy get away. > Any wavering, and defendants might be sent down for crimes they did not commit – or freed when they were guilty> Analytical readers will by now be associating my reluctance at the start of my career to meet relatives with the death of my own mother so early in life. And at my subsequent willingness to engage with others' grief they will say, 'Aha! He couldn't allow himself to experience the enormity of grief for his own loss! So, he experiences it again and again in manageable proportions through the grief of others. And, at the end of the meeting, he walks away from it!' I accept that there is probably something in that theory.> I felt that Anna, who must only have been seven years old, should not really be helping me reconstruct a homicide. … 'But your biology book diagrams don't have stab wounds.' 'I really think I can take it, Dad.' Maybe she was right. Maybe it was time to stop shielding my children from the unusual nature of my work. … Anna is a consultant histopathologist and, yes, she does have a keen interest in post-mortem and forensic medicine and even works for some of the coroners I worked for years ago> To the continued disgust of my family, I now used pork bellies or cow kidneys for my stabbing exercises. It was extremely hard to reproduce quite the feel of pushing through human skin, muscle and then an internal organ – perhaps because supermarket meat is seldom fresh. In reality, people who have killed with a knife are usually astonished by how easy it is. Once the blade has cut through the clothing and the skin, the inner body tissues put up little resistance.> People find it hard to believe that, in mass disasters, visual identification is unreliable, especially so when death has been traumatic or the body has been immersed in water. But even the uninjured and undecomposed dead are often simply not recognizable to those who knew them as animated individuals.> the overall aim was to turn the rugby scrum of forcible detention into something used only when necessary, and in a well-managed and safe way. The result, I believe, has been a dramatic reduction in the number of restraint deaths by the authorities. In fact, it is now much more dangerous to be arrested by a fellow citizen or shop or nightclub security staff.> In the Crown Court, a mother charged with manslaughter would be convicted only if her guilt is beyond reasonable doubt . The Family Court, which hears the local authority's request to remove her next child from her, must reconsider her case all over again – but apply a different level of proof. The Family Court applies the lower standard of proof – the balance of probabilities – to reach its conclusions. That can be defined as a 50.1 per cent chance of guilt … Sometimes, a year or more after a baby has been buried, we return to the file because another child has been born and there is the question now of safeguarding the living. By that time, a fuller picture of the baby's life and death may have emerged.> It has amazed me, over the years, how frequently men (but not noticeably women) will kill their best friend. And brothers commit fratricide even more frequently.> This is a very common misperception of an individual who is stabbed: time and time again I have heard victims say that they could just feel a punch rather than the knife itself penetrating> The university medical schools had always paid us to lecture in our subject but they decided – almost all of them, one by one – that now they would not continue funding or teaching forensic pathology. The main reason they gave was lack of forensic research and lack of publication in prestigious scientific journals. … We had essentially been privatized. From now on, instead of providing forensic services for free, our salaries paid by the universities at which we taught, we would directly bill the police, coroners or defence solicitors for payment.> 'SIDS, Dick. It's SIDS.' 'But there's too much about it that's not quite right. I'd rather give ""Unascertained"".' 'We're not here to pass judgement on them for having a few cannabis plants in the attic, for heaven's sake. Or for liking a drink. They're obviously not a chaotic pair of addicts.

262,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46881762-babs,4,Amazing. Loved it. Not for the faint hearted but if you like this kind of stuff you’ll love this book. 
263,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12325885-keri,5,"This autobiography-memoir of a forensic pathologist is a compelling mix of science, true crime, the vagaries of legal systems, and the cost that some careers have on one’s personal life. The author has apparently performed over 20,000 post-mortem examinations in his working lifetime and he shares the details of some of them, from the mundane to the famous (although not being British I was only vaguely familiar with most of the well-publicized cases he mentioned.) His thoughts on Princess Diana’s death were of particular interest to me since that event looms large in my memory. Before beginning a review I will often skim other reviews, in particular the ones who rate the opposite of me. The negative reviews for this book seem centered on readers’ dislike of the amount of focus on the author’s personal life- from childhood to the present day, at the expense of more stories and details about his cases. I didn’t find that to be a problem at all. To me there seemed to be a very good balance of his personal life and his cases. They very much influenced each other. Perhaps the problem was with unrealistic expectations as to the content of the book- the blurb only mentions personal cost and family at the very end, although I would point out that the subtitle does say “the life and many deaths of Britain’s top forensic pathologist” (emphasis added). I listened to this on audiobook and it was narrated by the author which I always appreciate in non-fiction, especially memoir or autobiography.Had I noticed that the author is British and all of this is set in England, I might not have picked it up, thinking it would not have any comment to make on the practice of forensic pathology in America; however, I’m glad I didn’t notice that and did pick it up. It doesn’t in fact comment much on the practice and progression of forensic pathology in the U.S., aside from a couple of brief mentions (including a bit from after 9/11). But the book still resonated with me. Although we live and work on different continents and in very different fields, I also work in a para-legal profession- meaning neither of us are law enforcement officers or lawyers working directly with criminal and civil legal cases, rather our work often informs and influences those cases. Many of his frustrations over time I have also noticed in my own world- for example, the vast increase in both the amount of documentation required, and in the amount and intensity of public and legal scrutiny; the personal attacks; the demand for black and white decision making and 100% accuracy in a field that as he notes is a “combination of facts, experience and judgement”, as is mine; and last but not least the constant exposure to human suffering and tragedy over decades of time. It is a heavy burden. I'm glad the author confronted his demons to write this. Recommended. "
264,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56688456-emi,4,"4.5 ****Wow, what a fascinating, engaging, and emotional read. This book definitely isn't for everybody, but it perfectly hit the intellectual parts of my brain that love to acquire medical knowledge and also the more emotional side of learning about people, human nature, and society. Listening to the audiobook meant that hearing Dr. Richard Shepard himself talk about these things was very clear to understand due to his incredible knowledge but also meant that he didn't overstate or embellish or hyperbolise any of the morbid details but showed with a quiet emotion the hard parts of his life and career over the course of this book. What struck me the most when reading was probably the sections on mass disasters. I don't know why but I've never in my life considered or properly thought about the logistics of dealing with the dead in such events. When you hear about terrorism events on the news you think about how awful it must be for the families who have lost loved ones and how horrible it is for the victims but you never consider the practicalities that doctors, hospitals, pathologists, the government etc. are doing to get society back to normal as soon as possible. The descriptions of preparing a whole warehouse to turn into a mortuary to conduct thousands upon thousands of post-mortems after terrorist bombing attacks, the realisation that it was an intensely logistically difficult and medically challenging operation to catalogue, identify, and collect every single body part after 9/11, (a process which was only completed in 2013) with every British victim having to be flown back from America to be examined by Dr. Shepard etc. etc. My astonishment is endless at the jobs that people have that are so necessary for society to function but that so many of us wouldn't be able to cope with. I'm glad, because of this, that Dr. Shepard did open up at the end of the book about the PTSD he's acquired from examining over 23,000 dead bodies over the years. I don't know if pathologists get the same recognition as normal doctors because they are not technically ""saving lives"" but what they do is so important and difficult and fascinating to read about that I for one will certainly be more aware of the ""behind the scenes"" of death and the people that work to make it as palatable and un-traumatic for the living, whilst taking on the bulk of the trauma themselves. "
265,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112848372-bookswithgeorgia,5,"This is a truly fascinating read from start to finish. Do you know when you just feel so glad and grateful that a book has been written? That’s how I feel about this one!Part autobiography and part memoir, this book offers an insight into the world of forensic pathology - a world that many of us probably do not give much thought to. I’ve always been incredibly interested in anything medical, and I’m a true-crime junkie too so I knew that this book was going to be a major hit with me. It really didn’t disappoint! Top forensic pathologist, Dr Richard Shepherd, has worked on many interesting cases including the Hungerford massacre, the Clapham rail distaster, 9/11, the 7/7 bombings, and even Princess Diana. It was so interesting to learn about his work, but also to gain a real insight into the judicial system and all the things that go on behind close doors in this profession. Shepherd sheds light on many issues in this book, particularly within the legal system, injustice within society and even his own experience with a debilitating mental illness. He also talks about each case in an extremely respectful way, remembering that these casualties were once real people with real lives. The book is a really good balance of him talking about his work and his fascinating profession, but also his personal life, i.e. his marriage, family life and personal struggles, and how each of these aspects of his life were affected by his work.I would say that despite the book being entirely centred around death, and often unlawful death, this is not an exceptionally heavy read. I didn’t find it to be toooo gory either so I really think it’s worth giving a go if you like the sound of it! More than anything, I’ve come away from this book with a lot of newfound knowledge on the topic of forensic pathology, and a real sense of respect for everyone involved in that profession. In my opinion, one of the most rewarding things about reading is when you come away from a book feeling more educated!🤓"
266,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96381170-chelsea-r-h,5,"I really enjoyed this book and found it completely fascinating. It delved into the rather shadowy world of forensic pathology, which most people are completely unaware of, beyond the stereotypes and half-truths portrayed in popular crime dramas, such as NCIS. In many ways, Dr Shepherd demystified death, informing the reader about the practicalities of death--why and how it occurs, what happens after you die, the legalities surrounding death and a bunch of other topics. He also weaves his own personal story, and how he became to be regarded as one of Britain's top pathologists, between fascinating cases and facts.I don't necessarily recommend this book unreservedly though. A lot of people could find this boko disturbing or triggering. Dr Shepherd delves into some exceeding graphic (though not glorified, simply scientific) descriptions of cases he has worked on. They include several horrific rapes, child abuse cases, and several astoundingly callous murders, as well large scale accidents, tragedies and mass murders. There's also several instances of deaths triggered by racism, and the deaths of black people in police custody, or caused by inappropriate restraint are also discussed in depth. Besides all that, there are also numerous descriptions of how a post-mortem is performed and what a body looks like during the process. As I've already said, none of this glorified or reveled in, Dr Shepherd is merely stating facts and reporting the truth, however, I know a lot of people cannot or do not want to handle these things, and so should be warned before reading this book.Overall, I loved reading this book, despite a few sections that disturbed or distressed me. It was very good, and it shone light on a part of society that isn't considered very regularly, helping to normalise it and make it a more comfortable experience for the average grieving family member, who may have to go through the process for whatever reason. I highly recommend it, if you think you can stomach some of the more difficult topics it covers."
267,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26176887-chris,5,"An absolutely fascinating read from start to finish.This was a very honest, down-to-earth read. It was explained in layman's terms and was not bogged down with medical jargon or official medical terminology (which I, personally, wouldn't mind but it wouldn't be for everyone).Dr Richard Shepherd is one of the UK's leading pathologists and has worked on some of the most famous and infamous deaths over the last forty or so years both nationally and internationally.Cases the UK populace will know well are mentioned such as the one of Rachel Nickell, the single mum who was walking on Wimbledon Common with her two-year-old son back in 1992 when she was murdered and raped while her son looked on. Her assailant was caught, arrested and jailed only to be acquitted just a few years later. He turned out not to be the murderer at all. Or Stephen Lawrence, the eighteen-year-old black youth brutally stabbed by five white males back in 1993 merely because of the colour of his skin (only two of the five men have been jailed).Then there are the very famous cases; 9/11, 7/7, the death of Princess Diana and the Bali bombings.On top of these totally immersive cases Dr Shepherd talks of his personal life; his wife and children, his obsession with work and the stresses involved in determining how someone may have died and making sure, in the minutest detail, that what he records and says is absolutely correct.From page one to page four-hundred-and-forty-four the world around me dissolved into nothingness and this book became the only thing in existence. It has quickly been marked as one of my favourites and I am convinced, once you have read it, it will be one of yours too."
268,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7132654-noel-powell,4,"I sort of came upon this book by accident. I had recently read the very funny ""This is going to hurt"" by Adam Kay about the life of a junior gynacoligist. I thought that I had enjoyed the jolly japes so much that I would read another medical autobiography. However this time the fun would be centred around cadavers not lady parts. Boy was I in for a surprise. No farcical comedy here. It is a very serious book. Nonetheless I found myself being drawn in to the cases of infamous deaths through the eyes of the man who cuts up the bodies to find the clues. Thousands of bodies. While fascinating though this career was, it has a heavy price. There is a thread of doom, melancholy and misery through out this book but you feel you have to turn the page. The writer would seem to be an unemotional type to begin but his choice of career and the need to close off mentally sees him being dragged down into PTSD. So you read on for the compelling murder puzzles while also have a sinking feeling. Its like watching disaster from afar. Its fascinating and sad at the same time but you just have to look. I should say it is very well written. It is a very different book from the one I thought I was going to read but I am glad that I have read it all the same."
269,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89494011-amy,3,"At around 25% into this book I honestly considered DNF'ing because the writing was just not gripping and we were getting more about Shepherd's family life than his actual job. It was honestly a bit boring and there didn't feel like there was any life in the writing. It felt a bit like he'd simply put pen to paper and wrote a shopping list. HOWEVER, I am glad I stuck with it because it got infinitely better as the book went on and especially the last 25% you can tell how passionate he is about his work and the role that he has in death. I really felt like I was able to connect with him more as the book went on, and found myself immersed in his world.I really enjoy the sections of the book that were solely focused on the cases that he has worked on; they were very interesting to me and learning about what his job entails was intriguing. I don't think there was enough of this and thats where this book suffered in my opinion. Shepherd has a tendency to jump rapidly from case to case and the book doesn't flow overly naturally. I think this cold be in part due to the fact that it was written over a period of time and due to the personal experiences he had going on at the time. I don't think he's a natural storyteller and it did show at times.Overall this is clearly a man who is passionate about the work he does and it does show towards the end. An interesting, if not that enjoyable, read. "
270,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28283498-marissa,3,"I was anticipating a good read but feel very let down. I expected this book to be more medical and not so much about the personal life of Dr. Shepard himself. I still found it to be an interesting read, however I wish there was more discussion and detail about the forensic pathology aspect. 3.5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️ "
271,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8545345-kelly,3,"I have been trying to write this review for ages because I have warring opinions.Generally, this book was incredibly interesting and I loved that it was easy to read but still packed with information, facts and real cases. It was quite emotive due to the nature of the cases, despite the actual writing tone being matter of fact and as unemotive as the author. I did not mind the concurrent chronicles of Shepherd's personal life - mainly because I am a nosy bitch. I thought that seeing the impact on Shepherd personally and on his family life was a consequence that many do not consider when thinking of the life of a pathologist - all glammed up by CSI type shows.I did not find the chronological approach the easiest to follow. I thought that it would have been better to chapter off the different cases and weave the personal elements into the cases. As it was, the cases stretched over a number of years and I struggled to keep track of where some had finished when they were mentioned later. I also felt that the personal elements were tacked on the end rather clunkily because they fit with the timing.My biggest issue however was with the tone at times, finding it often arrogant and at times it came.aceoss as biased. I also found the tone infuriating when speaking of women.The marriage to Jen was written in a way that suggests that Shepherd's life would have been easier if Jen hadn't wanted to further her career and become a Dr. There were times when he really spoke about her as if she should have been willing to sacrifice her life for his career. Then he would tack a sentence on saying, but I was proud of her so I suffered! Heaven forbid that he had to look after his own children to help his wife. There was also this compulsive need to remind us that he was a good father.Secondly - and I cannot stress how much this pissed me off. We have spent the whole book being told about the careers of the white men folk and how hard they worked and how skilled they were. Then in walks Vesna Djurovic. Dr Djurovic is an eminent pathologist. Yet this is how Shepherd describes her when she starts working at Guys:'...tall, blonde, leggy woman...who wore a short skirt and a friendly smile.'Absolutely no indication of her skillset or experience.He then speaks of her being 'claimed' by his boss Iain. Like she is a goldfish at the fair. Iain eventually marries her, congrats to them. Shepherd seems to give more respect to the dead than a live woman with a sterling career.Likewise, Jen became a Dr while raising kids with a largely absent husband and later in life. But when asked about the issues in his marriage he doesn't admit that he cannot connect to her emotionally or that the absences of BOTH OF THEIR JOBS are taking a toll, he says that she doesn't make him dinner. That is why their marriage isn't working. That traditional role of the little lady that proves her love for her husband. Dr Jen doesn't make him dinner. Bad woman.It was clear that Shepherd harboured ill-feeling when he described Iain and Vesna as a star couple of the pathology world. Citing their forays into social life and noting that he couldn't have this role because bloody Jen had decided to better herself and her job as a Dr meant that they didn't have the time to party. Honestly, I really felt for Jen throughout this book.I genuinely thought that this was going to be a strong 4, if not 5 star review but as the tone of arrogance grew and Shepherd seemed more incapable of taking criticism or admitting to errors, whether personal or professional, I started losing my interest in Shepherd and my rating dwindled"

Dr Shepherd worked on some of the most notable cases in recent British history. (Hungerford massacre, Marchioness disaster, Stephen Lawrence and many more). I learned about people finding the mummified bodies of newborns in their attics/ under their floorboards, something I had never heard of before.At the end of the book too the author talks about his mental health and the effect his career had on it. For a job that requires you to distance yourself from the emotions of it all, I thought it was refreshing and needed that he spoke about his mental health."

Dr Shepherd had worked on many cases included 9/11, the Hungerford massacre and the sinking of the Marchioness, Harold Shipman cases and the terrorist attack in Bali. He has had an incredible career which has taken him all over the globe. I certainly couldn't do his job but the fact he still has the same passion for it as when we first started out is amazing and admirable. 5 out of 5 stars doesn't seem enough."

279,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19863335-molly,4,"I read this on recommendation of my sister who was thoroughly amused with the gruesome depictions of deaths and the process of decomposition, so when I started reading I assumed it would be like many other pieces of work which are essentially science communication as entertainment. This was different though. Sheperd weaves stories of his work with personal narrative, giving a slowly building sense of how his work affects his life and relationships, without ever making you doubt his dedication to forensic pathology. I wished that at some points he had been clearer over what year we were in as I tried to work out his age and experience, and this was not aided by the oscillation through time that the book makes. That said, the back and forth does feel authentically like a story you might be told by a relative, if only it were more clearly signposted. The cases discussed are always treated carefully and with respect, and it is refreshing to see Sheperd critique his own work and offer up his vulnerability throughout the book. His attitudes towards the crimes against and by women and black people are more nuanced than would sadly be expected from a person of his age, and it was empowering to read that this white middle class man used his positions of power to do something to help. My personal issue with the writing was with some of the clinical language used, it is understandable given the topics covered and the mental state of the author why such clinical language is employed, but I know that words such as ‘obese’, while medically accurate, can be difficult for some readers. Overall I enjoyed the book immensely, it tackles tough topics with kindness and compassion and is a rare insight into the intersect between the work and personal life of a professional in their field under the heavy weight of trust and opinion."
280,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8675686-kristiana,5,Incredibly interesting insight into forensic pathology and also the struggles of balancing being at the top of a profession and family life.

If you are interested in pathology, murders, or serious crimes and you've never really thought about how the pathologists feel, their first experience with a dead body or their first-ever autopsy on their own then you will ultimately love this book. The first couple of chapters are brilliant. They're such a mind-blowing insight into what pathology really is and the training that goes into being a pathologist is far more than you would ever anticipate considering they 'only deal with the dead'... it is SO much more than that. It's a very well written book; informative and upsetting at times, however, I found the parts relating to Richard Shepherd's personal life a little dull at times. I don't think they ultimately fitted within the themes of this book although I do understand the parts where he introduces his wife and children so as to ensure the reader understands the difficulties of juggling such an on-call job... it really is a way of life, a lifestyle and not just a job. However, other parts I really didn't feel were necessary. Aside from that, I thoroughly enjoyed this and learning more about autopsies and how the emergency services require such detailed descriptions when pursuing a charge or even just providing some understanding to bereaved families. A pathologist has such an important job and I hope from reading this book that people realise how important they truly are. "

I love medical non fiction and this is definitely one of the best ones I've ever read. Its incredibly fascinating and interesting. Richard worked on so many cases, including some very famous and high profile ones. I learnt so much about pathology from this book. It is not dry at all, which I know puts some people off non fiction. It was written in a very accessible, easy to read way. It also was very personal. You found out a lot about his own life, which I was not expecting going in but it was a pleasant surprise. However, I would give caution going into this book. It gives very graphic descriptions of some very sad real life cases including: suicide, violent crime, stabbings, murder, mass tragedies and disasters, shootings and SIDS. It's not an easy read in that sense so definitely exercise caution if that's the kind of thing that triggers you. Overall, I really enjoyed this book and I learnt a lot from it.TW: PTSD, suicide, graphic descriptions of death, disease and the body after its died.

And it was through her sudden death that Harold Shipman was finally revealed as a serial killer."" Shepherd has worked on many high profile cases, which of course are most captivating to read about. Such as Harold Shipman. The fact that Shipman killed 215 patients (and it is believed many more) and got away with it for 20 years always blows my mind - genuinely shocking. So the fact that Richard Shepherd did at least a few postmortems on some of his victims,one of whom was actually a family friend, drew me into Richard Shepherd's life even further...

When I started reading it, I thought it is entirely about his job as a forensic pathologist but it is not. All those life events of the author are distracting and something I am not really interested in. I simply skipped through them and just focussed on the cases. It’s more like an autobiography of a pathologist who holds a rather high regard of himself than a book about the working life of a pathologist."
291,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7283807-ben,4,"Forensic pathology—who knew it would be interesting? I enjoy reading about all sorts of different jobs, in any well-written memoir. This fits the bill, it is at least decently well written. Most of Shepherd's job is actually fairly pedestrian. For example, in one incident, he has to help identify bodies after a party cruise sinks in the Thames. Shepherd takes his job very seriously, and clearly enjoys it, despite suffering from some PTSD. The variety of cases, ranging from determining whether a death is a murder or self defense, to judging whether to report an infant's death as SIDS, to working to improve police restraint technique to avoid suffocation. He weaves in his personal life in an effective way, perhaps slightly indulgently but not too much so. The gruesome aspects of his job made it hard to connect with his children, and his wife was opposed to hearing anything about it. I found it interesting, in a somewhat disappointing way, how much the surrounding context around a death affected his report. Shepherd often seems to be under a lot of pressure from police and prosecutors, and so while he is professional he is definitely not neutral, or unbiased. He does not want to let the bad guy get away. > Any wavering, and defendants might be sent down for crimes they did not commit – or freed when they were guilty> Analytical readers will by now be associating my reluctance at the start of my career to meet relatives with the death of my own mother so early in life. And at my subsequent willingness to engage with others' grief they will say, 'Aha! He couldn't allow himself to experience the enormity of grief for his own loss! So, he experiences it again and again in manageable proportions through the grief of others. And, at the end of the meeting, he walks away from it!' I accept that there is probably something in that theory.> I felt that Anna, who must only have been seven years old, should not really be helping me reconstruct a homicide. … 'But your biology book diagrams don't have stab wounds.' 'I really think I can take it, Dad.' Maybe she was right. Maybe it was time to stop shielding my children from the unusual nature of my work. … Anna is a consultant histopathologist and, yes, she does have a keen interest in post-mortem and forensic medicine and even works for some of the coroners I worked for years ago> To the continued disgust of my family, I now used pork bellies or cow kidneys for my stabbing exercises. It was extremely hard to reproduce quite the feel of pushing through human skin, muscle and then an internal organ – perhaps because supermarket meat is seldom fresh. In reality, people who have killed with a knife are usually astonished by how easy it is. Once the blade has cut through the clothing and the skin, the inner body tissues put up little resistance.> People find it hard to believe that, in mass disasters, visual identification is unreliable, especially so when death has been traumatic or the body has been immersed in water. But even the uninjured and undecomposed dead are often simply not recognizable to those who knew them as animated individuals.> the overall aim was to turn the rugby scrum of forcible detention into something used only when necessary, and in a well-managed and safe way. The result, I believe, has been a dramatic reduction in the number of restraint deaths by the authorities. In fact, it is now much more dangerous to be arrested by a fellow citizen or shop or nightclub security staff.> In the Crown Court, a mother charged with manslaughter would be convicted only if her guilt is beyond reasonable doubt . The Family Court, which hears the local authority's request to remove her next child from her, must reconsider her case all over again – but apply a different level of proof. The Family Court applies the lower standard of proof – the balance of probabilities – to reach its conclusions. That can be defined as a 50.1 per cent chance of guilt … Sometimes, a year or more after a baby has been buried, we return to the file because another child has been born and there is the question now of safeguarding the living. By that time, a fuller picture of the baby's life and death may have emerged.> It has amazed me, over the years, how frequently men (but not noticeably women) will kill their best friend.

The main reason they gave was lack of forensic research and lack of publication in prestigious scientific journals. … We had essentially been privatized. From now on, instead of providing forensic services for free, our salaries paid by the universities at which we taught, we would directly bill the police, coroners or defence solicitors for payment.> 'SIDS, Dick.

No, don't let's leave ""Unascertained"" hanging over a young couple who're simply poor and doing their best.' SIDS it was, then."

293,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12325885-keri,5,"This autobiography-memoir of a forensic pathologist is a compelling mix of science, true crime, the vagaries of legal systems, and the cost that some careers have on one’s personal life. The author has apparently performed over 20,000 post-mortem examinations in his working lifetime and he shares the details of some of them, from the mundane to the famous (although not being British I was only vaguely familiar with most of the well-publicized cases he mentioned.) His thoughts on Princess Diana’s death were of particular interest to me since that event looms large in my memory. Before beginning a review I will often skim other reviews, in particular the ones who rate the opposite of me. The negative reviews for this book seem centered on readers’ dislike of the amount of focus on the author’s personal life- from childhood to the present day, at the expense of more stories and details about his cases. I didn’t find that to be a problem at all. To me there seemed to be a very good balance of his personal life and his cases. They very much influenced each other. Perhaps the problem was with unrealistic expectations as to the content of the book- the blurb only mentions personal cost and family at the very end, although I would point out that the subtitle does say “the life and many deaths of Britain’s top forensic pathologist” (emphasis added). I listened to this on audiobook and it was narrated by the author which I always appreciate in non-fiction, especially memoir or autobiography.Had I noticed that the author is British and all of this is set in England, I might not have picked it up, thinking it would not have any comment to make on the practice of forensic pathology in America; however, I’m glad I didn’t notice that and did pick it up. It doesn’t in fact comment much on the practice and progression of forensic pathology in the U.S., aside from a couple of brief mentions (including a bit from after 9/11). But the book still resonated with me. Although we live and work on different continents and in very different fields, I also work in a para-legal profession- meaning neither of us are law enforcement officers or lawyers working directly with criminal and civil legal cases, rather our work often informs and influences those cases. Many of his frustrations over time I have also noticed in my own world- for example, the vast increase in both the amount of documentation required, and in the amount and intensity of public and legal scrutiny; the personal attacks; the demand for black and white decision making and 100% accuracy in a field that as he notes is a “combination of facts, experience and judgement”, as is mine; and last but not least the constant exposure to human suffering and tragedy over decades of time. It is a heavy burden. I'm glad the author confronted his demons to write this. Recommended. "

This book definitely isn't for everybody, but it perfectly hit the intellectual parts of my brain that love to acquire medical knowledge and also the more emotional side of learning about people, human nature, and society. Listening to the audiobook meant that hearing Dr. Richard Shepard himself talk about these things was very clear to understand due to his incredible knowledge but also meant that he didn't overstate or embellish or hyperbolise any of the morbid details but showed with a quiet emotion the hard parts of his life and career over the course of this book. What struck me the most when reading was probably the sections on mass disasters. I don't know why but I've never in my life considered or properly thought about the logistics of dealing with the dead in such events. When you hear about terrorism events on the news you think about how awful it must be for the families who have lost loved ones and how horrible it is for the victims but you never consider the practicalities that doctors, hospitals, pathologists, the government etc. are doing to get society back to normal as soon as possible. The descriptions of preparing a whole warehouse to turn into a mortuary to conduct thousands upon thousands of post-mortems after terrorist bombing attacks, the realisation that it was an intensely logistically difficult and medically challenging operation to catalogue, identify, and collect every single body part after 9/11, (a process which was only completed in 2013) with every British victim having to be flown back from America to be examined by Dr. Shepard etc. etc. My astonishment is endless at the jobs that people have that are so necessary for society to function but that so many of us wouldn't be able to cope with. I'm glad, because of this, that Dr. Shepard did open up at the end of the book about the PTSD he's acquired from examining over 23,000 dead bodies over the years. I don't know if pathologists get the same recognition as normal doctors because they are not technically ""saving lives"" but what they do is so important and difficult and fascinating to read about that I for one will certainly be more aware of the ""behind the scenes"" of death and the people that work to make it as palatable and un-traumatic for the living, whilst taking on the bulk of the trauma themselves.

295,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112848372-bookswithgeorgia,5,"This is a truly fascinating read from start to finish. Do you know when you just feel so glad and grateful that a book has been written? That’s how I feel about this one!Part autobiography and part memoir, this book offers an insight into the world of forensic pathology - a world that many of us probably do not give much thought to. I’ve always been incredibly interested in anything medical, and I’m a true-crime junkie too so I knew that this book was going to be a major hit with me. It really didn’t disappoint! Top forensic pathologist, Dr Richard Shepherd, has worked on many interesting cases including the Hungerford massacre, the Clapham rail distaster, 9/11, the 7/7 bombings, and even Princess Diana. It was so interesting to learn about his work, but also to gain a real insight into the judicial system and all the things that go on behind close doors in this profession. Shepherd sheds light on many issues in this book, particularly within the legal system, injustice within society and even his own experience with a debilitating mental illness. He also talks about each case in an extremely respectful way, remembering that these casualties were once real people with real lives. The book is a really good balance of him talking about his work and his fascinating profession, but also his personal life, i.e. his marriage, family life and personal struggles, and how each of these aspects of his life were affected by his work.I would say that despite the book being entirely centred around death, and often unlawful death, this is not an exceptionally heavy read. I didn’t find it to be toooo gory either so I really think it’s worth giving a go if you like the sound of it! More than anything, I’ve come away from this book with a lot of newfound knowledge on the topic of forensic pathology, and a real sense of respect for everyone involved in that profession. In my opinion, one of the most rewarding things about reading is when you come away from a book feeling more educated!🤓"
296,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96381170-chelsea-r-h,5,"I really enjoyed this book and found it completely fascinating. It delved into the rather shadowy world of forensic pathology, which most people are completely unaware of, beyond the stereotypes and half-truths portrayed in popular crime dramas, such as NCIS. In many ways, Dr Shepherd demystified death, informing the reader about the practicalities of death--why and how it occurs, what happens after you die, the legalities surrounding death and a bunch of other topics. He also weaves his own personal story, and how he became to be regarded as one of Britain's top pathologists, between fascinating cases and facts.I don't necessarily recommend this book unreservedly though. A lot of people could find this boko disturbing or triggering. Dr Shepherd delves into some exceeding graphic (though not glorified, simply scientific) descriptions of cases he has worked on. They include several horrific rapes, child abuse cases, and several astoundingly callous murders, as well large scale accidents, tragedies and mass murders. There's also several instances of deaths triggered by racism, and the deaths of black people in police custody, or caused by inappropriate restraint are also discussed in depth. Besides all that, there are also numerous descriptions of how a post-mortem is performed and what a body looks like during the process. As I've already said, none of this glorified or reveled in, Dr Shepherd is merely stating facts and reporting the truth, however, I know a lot of people cannot or do not want to handle these things, and so should be warned before reading this book.Overall, I loved reading this book, despite a few sections that disturbed or distressed me. It was very good, and it shone light on a part of society that isn't considered very regularly, helping to normalise it and make it a more comfortable experience for the average grieving family member, who may have to go through the process for whatever reason. I highly recommend it, if you think you can stomach some of the more difficult topics it covers."
297,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26176887-chris,5,"An absolutely fascinating read from start to finish.This was a very honest, down-to-earth read. It was explained in layman's terms and was not bogged down with medical jargon or official medical terminology (which I, personally, wouldn't mind but it wouldn't be for everyone).Dr Richard Shepherd is one of the UK's leading pathologists and has worked on some of the most famous and infamous deaths over the last forty or so years both nationally and internationally.Cases the UK populace will know well are mentioned such as the one of Rachel Nickell, the single mum who was walking on Wimbledon Common with her two-year-old son back in 1992 when she was murdered and raped while her son looked on. Her assailant was caught, arrested and jailed only to be acquitted just a few years later. He turned out not to be the murderer at all. Or Stephen Lawrence, the eighteen-year-old black youth brutally stabbed by five white males back in 1993 merely because of the colour of his skin (only two of the five men have been jailed).Then there are the very famous cases; 9/11, 7/7, the death of Princess Diana and the Bali bombings.On top of these totally immersive cases Dr Shepherd talks of his personal life; his wife and children, his obsession with work and the stresses involved in determining how someone may have died and making sure, in the minutest detail, that what he records and says is absolutely correct.From page one to page four-hundred-and-forty-four the world around me dissolved into nothingness and this book became the only thing in existence. It has quickly been marked as one of my favourites and I am convinced, once you have read it, it will be one of yours too."
298,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7132654-noel-powell,4,"I sort of came upon this book by accident. I had recently read the very funny ""This is going to hurt"" by Adam Kay about the life of a junior gynacoligist. I thought that I had enjoyed the jolly japes so much that I would read another medical autobiography. However this time the fun would be centred around cadavers not lady parts. Boy was I in for a surprise. No farcical comedy here. It is a very serious book. Nonetheless I found myself being drawn in to the cases of infamous deaths through the eyes of the man who cuts up the bodies to find the clues. Thousands of bodies. While fascinating though this career was, it has a heavy price. There is a thread of doom, melancholy and misery through out this book but you feel you have to turn the page. The writer would seem to be an unemotional type to begin but his choice of career and the need to close off mentally sees him being dragged down into PTSD. So you read on for the compelling murder puzzles while also have a sinking feeling. Its like watching disaster from afar. Its fascinating and sad at the same time but you just have to look. I should say it is very well written. It is a very different book from the one I thought I was going to read but I am glad that I have read it all the same."
299,0718182715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89494011-amy,3,"At around 25% into this book I honestly considered DNF'ing because the writing was just not gripping and we were getting more about Shepherd's family life than his actual job. It was honestly a bit boring and there didn't feel like there was any life in the writing. It felt a bit like he'd simply put pen to paper and wrote a shopping list. HOWEVER, I am glad I stuck with it because it got infinitely better as the book went on and especially the last 25% you can tell how passionate he is about his work and the role that he has in death. I really felt like I was able to connect with him more as the book went on, and found myself immersed in his world.I really enjoy the sections of the book that were solely focused on the cases that he has worked on; they were very interesting to me and learning about what his job entails was intriguing. I don't think there was enough of this and thats where this book suffered in my opinion. Shepherd has a tendency to jump rapidly from case to case and the book doesn't flow overly naturally. I think this cold be in part due to the fact that it was written over a period of time and due to the personal experiences he had going on at the time. I don't think he's a natural storyteller and it did show at times.Overall this is clearly a man who is passionate about the work he does and it does show towards the end. An interesting, if not that enjoyable, read. "
