 There are many words a woman in love longs to hear. “I’ll love you forever, darling,” and “Will it be a diamond this year?” are two fine examples. But young lovers take note: above all else, the phrase every girl truly wants to hear is, “Hi, this is Amy from Science Support; I’m dropping off some heads.” 
You have all seen The Producers, right? The version with Zero or Nathan, in the cinema, on TV, on the stage, whatever. Those of you who have not…well…tsk, tsk, tsk, for shame, for shame. Well, there is one scene that pops to mind apropos this book. In the film, the producers of the title have put together a show that is designed to fail. The surprise is on them, though, when their engineered disaster turns out to be a hit. During intermission of the opening performance, to Max and Leo’s absolute horror, they overhear a man saying to his wife, “Honey, I never in a million years thought I'd ever love a show called Springtime For Hitler. One might be forgiven for having similar thoughts about Caitlin Doughty’s sparkling romp through the joys of mortuary science, Smoke Gets in your Eyes. If you were expecting a lifeless look at what most of us consider a dark subject, well, surprise, surprise. Yes we are, and dead-ender Caitlin is happy to help with the cleanup Caitlin Doughty has cooked up a book that is part memoir, part guidebook through the world of what lies beyond, well, the earth-bound part, at least, and part advocacy for new ways of dealing with our remains. Doughty, a Hawaiian native, is a 6-foot Amazon pixie, bubbling over (like some of her clients?) with enthusiasm for the work of seeing people off on their final journey. Her glee is infectious, in a good way. The bulk of the tale is based on her experience working at WestWind Cremation and Burial in Oakland, California, her first gig in the field. She was 23, had had a fascination with death since she was a kid and this seemed a perfectly reasonable place in which to begin what she believed would be her career. Turned out she was right. Caitlin Doughty from her siteSmoke Gets in your Eyes is rich with information not only about contemporary mortuary practices, but on practices in other cultures and on how death was handled in the past. For example, embalming did not come into use in the USA until the Civil War, when the delay in getting the recently deceased from battlefield to home in a non-putrid form presented considerable difficulties. She also looks at the practice of seeing people off at home as opposed to institutional settings. There is a rich lode of intel in here about the origin of church and churchyard burials. I imagine churchgoers of the eras when such practices were still fresh might have been praying for a good stiff wind. No Kibby, no smoke monsters hereDoughty worked primarily in the cremation end of the biz, and offers many juicy details about this increasingly popular exit strategy. But mixing the factual material with her personal experience turns the burners up a notch.
 The first time I peeked in on a cremating body felt outrageously transgressive, even though it was required by Westwind’s protocol. No matter how many heavy-metal album covers you’ve seen, how many Hieronymous Bosch prints of the tortures of Hell, or even the scene in Indiana Jones where the Nazi’s face melts off, you cannot be prepared to view a body being cremated. Seeing a flaming human skull is intense beyond your wildest flights of imagination.
Beyond her paying gig, Doughty has, for some time, been undertaking to run a blog on mortuary practice, The Order of the Good Death, with a focus on greener ways of returning our elements back to the source. (Would it be wrong to think of those who make use of green self disposal as the dearly de-potted?) One tidbit from this stream was meeting with a lady who has devised a death suit with mushroom spores, the better to extract toxins from a decomposing body. I was drooling over the potential for Troma films that might be made from this notion. No, not pizzaOne of life’s great joys is to learn something new while being thoroughly entertained. Smoke Gets in Your Eyes offers a unique compendium of fascinating information about how death is handled, mostly in America. Doughty’s sense of humor is right up my alley. The book is LOL funny and not just occasionally. You may want to make sure you have swallowed your coffee before reading, lest it come flying out your nose. I was very much reminded of the infectious humor of Mary Roach or  Margee Kerr. Doughty is also TED-talk smart. She takes on some very real issues in both the science and economics of death-dealing, offers well-informed critiques of how we handle death today, and suggests some alternatives. If the last face you see is Caitlin Doughty’s something is very, very wrong. The face itself is lovely, but usually by the time she gets her mitts on you should be seeing the pearly gates, that renowned steambath, or nothing at all. Preferably you can see Doughty in one of the many nifty short vids available on her site. You will learn something while being thoroughly charmed. Reading this book won’t kill you, even with laughter, but it will begin to prepare you to look at that event that lies out there, somewhere in the distance for all of us, and point you in a direction that is care and not fear based. If you enjoy learning and laughing Smoke Gets in Your Eyes is dead on.Review posted – 12/11/15Publication date – 10/15/2014 (hc) – 9/28/15 - TPI received this book from the publisher in return for an honest review. Well, not really. I mean they specifically said that there was no obligation to produce a review, so there is no quid pro quo involved, but it does seem the right thing to do, don’tchya think?=============================EXTRA STUFFLinks to the author’s personal, Twitter, Instagram and FB pagesYou  MUST CHECK OUT vids on her site. My favorite is  The Foreskin Wedding Ring of St Catherine . All right, I’m gonna stop you right there. Go ahead. I know you wanna ask. No? Fine. I’ll do it for you, but you know this is what  you were asking yourself. “If she rubs it does it become a bracelet?” Ok? Are ya happy now? Sheesh!If you are uncertain about making a final commitment to reading this book you might want a taste of the product first (That sounds sooooo wrong) Here is an article Doughty wrote about her first experience with death as a kid, from  Fortnightjournal.com. There are several other Doughty articles on this site as well.Another book sample can be found  here, in The AtlanticDoughty offers a nifty list of sites to use for dealing with death, your own (presumably, you know, before) or others.

Like it’s just something that exists in the world! People die and their family takes care of it and that’s it. But WOW was this book eye opening towards the super strange way I view death / burial / cremation. The funeral industry is a BUSINESS? Literally WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ! NOT ME !"

I was SO into it.And Ms. Doughty you have a standing invitation to all of my dinner parties."
6,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,4,"Call me morbid? ....ghastly?.....Bonkers? Right after I finished reading the memoir ""When Breath Becomes Air"", by Paul Kalanithi- a 4th year medical student working at Stanford Hospital ...(only 30 minutes from my house), - who died this year of Lung Cancer.., THIS book arrives in my mail box the SAME day (just 'hours' after I wrote a review for Kalanithi's book) Creepy! AND .....what's even more creepy ... is I don't know who sent me this paper back 'new copy'. Thank You to the Mystery Person!!!!Is somebody trying to send me a message?So... I read it! Apparently, the author, Caitlin Doughty, a fascination with death, is her life's work. The very first sentence made me laugh ( a little anyway)....""A girl always remembers the first corpse she shaves.""Caitlin also says.....""It is the only event in her life more awkward than her first kiss or the loss of her virginity."" OK???? Mary Roach....( I'm thinking)... ""Are you and Caitlin friends"" ....(Mary Roach wrote the morbidly fascinating- oddly fun- engrossing book ""STIFF""). They ' must' know each other ( and I love Mary Roach.... whom I've met twice ...as she lives in The Bay Area) Caitlin also worked the suburban San Francisco's 'Westwind' Crematorium. I can't believe how much I enjoyed reading Caitlin's memoir. ( it's a different take than STIFF)...but like STIFF, there is humor, historical anecdotes about death, body disposal, the death industry, and how things are done behind the scenes. ( GORY DETAILS r-us)) Yuck! ... [DO NOT READ DURING EATING DINNER]...However, I liked Caitlin's human warmth ...( she was real and personable). I also enjoyed her candor about her own struggles within the funeral industry ( her own infatuation and preoccupation- if you will about her own emotional- wired brain) I think two books in a row - ""imagining facing death"" - and ""behind the scenes"" of what happens to the bodies ... Is enough for awhile to say ..,""I've done my Mitzvah"" reading for this month...Worth reading... Yet... mix it up with a good comic book - or an adorable youthful playful children's book, (as I did), to balance you 'chi'! Hugs ... and ""cheers-to-life"", my sweet friends! "
7,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5293536-melki,5,"Ten months into my job at Westwind, I knew death was the life for me. When Caitlin Doughty took a job at a California crematory, she learned more than just how to dispose of dead bodies. The daily exposure to death changed her thinking on the subject and turned her into a warrior fighting the good fight for the good death. While practicing the process of turning a former human into four to seven pounds of grayish ash and bone, Doughty's way of thinking on the subject began to evolve.Corpses keep the living tethered to reality. I had lived my entire life until I began working at Westwood relatively corpse-free. Now I had access to scores of them - stacked in the crematory freezer. They forced me to face my own death and the deaths of those I loved. No matter how much technology may become our master, it takes only a human corpse to toss the anchor off that boat and pull us back down to the firm knowledge that we are glorified animals that eat and shit and are doomed to die. We are all just future corpses.In addition to her philosophical musings, Doughty presents a nice historical overview of death and its many resulting rituals. Particularly interesting was how a book - The American Way of Death - helped popularize cremation in this country. Doughty's relaxed conversational tone, positive attitude and great sense of humor keep a potentially depressing subject from getting too bleak. She offers a unique perspective on the fate that awaits us all.This book made me do a little rethinking of my own. Doughty's mention that to incinerate one body uses as much energy as a 500-mile car trip, made me question if cremation is right for me. And while it was Mary Roach's Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers that first made me give some serious thought to what should happen to my carcass when I'm done using it, THIS book prompted me look up Green Burial options in my state.There aren't many.Hopefully, when I check out in a few decades - fingers crossed, knock on wood - the choices will be bountiful. But it doesn't hurt (too badly) to think about it now. After all, I'm just a (future) dead gal, typing. "
8,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,2,"I saw this title on a few Best Of lists for the year, but I thought it was just OK.Caitlin Doughty worked at a crematory in the San Francisco area. She said she had been both fascinated by and terrified of death since she was a little girl, when she witnessed a child's fatal fall in a shopping mall. This book is a combination of her stories about cremating bodies, her research into the history of death practices around the world, and tales of woe about her love life and attending mortuary school. She also writes about wanting to help educate Americans about death so we aren't so afraid of it. ""We can do our best to push death to the margins, keeping corpses behind stainless-steel doors and tucking the sick and dying in hospital rooms. So masterfully do we hide death, you would almost believe we are the first generation of immortals. But we are not. We are all going to die and we know it. As the great cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker said, 'The idea of death, the fear of it, haunts the human animal like nothing else.' The fear of death is why we build cathedrals, have children, declare war, and watch cat videos online at three a.m. Death drives every creative and destructive impulse we have as human beings. The closer we come to understanding it, the closer we come to understanding ourselves.""This is a book that was more interesting in theory than in practice. Caitlin's writing style is immature, and she relies heavily on pop culture references. If this is your first book about death practices, you might find her stories interesting. If you want to read about grief rituals and bereavement, I recommend ""The Death Class"" by Erika Hayasaki."
9,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12620745-debbie-dj,4,"I think this book gets the award for best opening line.""A girl always remembers the first corpse she shaves."" So, yeah, I was pulled in from the beginning. Caitlin is 23 and lands her first job as a mortician. Why you ask? Well, turns out she is terrified of death. Has been ever since she saw a documentary that depicted death when she was very young. She is obsessed with thoughts of her, her family, and friends demise. The beginning wasted no time in taking me right into the world of the mortician. I got to learn all about what it takes to be embalmed, (OMG) and just how a crematorium works. Yet, this is not the focus of the book. Doughty is on a mission to show how our society has become separated from the natural process of dying. She talks about other cultures, and the rituals they have around death. How we as Americans are becoming more secular and no longer have these rituals, and/or the priest/ spiritual leader in our final moments. It is the doctor now. How our culture is separated from death. She went from thinking it was strange our culture doesn't see dead bodies anymore, to believing this absence is the root cause of so many of our troubles. Death is now seen as a failure of the medical system, so we've cleaned it all up. Everything is designed to mask death. From our obsession with youth, to all the beauty products designed to keep us looking young, even the embalming, done to make us look our very best.This book really has a lot to offer. It's not a heavy read either, in fact, sometimes it's too light. Still, I learned a lot of valuable information. Being exposed to death properly, at an early age is very important. I don't have to be embalmed, or even cremated. Most of all Doughty exposes the real fear of death, and is leading a call to teach people how to take care of their dead like our ancestors before us. Really an excellent read!"
10,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26424937-lori,5,"I think the MacArthur Foundation ought to give Caitlin Doughty a Genius Grant. I've been watching her vlog and reading her blog with fascination for a while, and now this book has taught me a lot and given me more to admire too. She's brilliant, a great writer and I so appreciate her direct, unsparing and frequently funny fact-filled book based on her education and experience working in the death industry as well as her studies of death practices across cultures. I disagree with comparisons to Mary Roach's ""Stiff."" I enjoyed it, but Roach is a journalist whereas Caitlin is a practicing mortician. She has an insider's viewpoint and investment, with deeper and broader knowledge as well as a trove of anecdotes from personally doing many things to many dead bodies.Sure I couldn't read about her loading each body into the cremulator (that name!) then smashing the skull of the deceased with a cremator's shovel before processing the cremains into a fine powder which cumulatively coats her clothes...without thinking of cremated loved ones or my own cremation to come. I only hope the person operating that cremulator is as respectful and devoted to my remains as Caitlin is to all the dead bodies in her care. (But I'm skeptical). Whether she's telling us about purge fluid, which sometimes comes out of the mouth of a corpse and sometimes gets on a person in contact with said corpse or skin slip, when decomposition causes the top layer of the skin to slide right off the body , she writes and speaks of the dead with devotion, affection and the humor of a stand-up comic. This is not for the squeamish, but thanks to Caitlin I'm not nearly as squeamish as I was. I know this because I tested myself using Google and Youtube, though I'm sure I wouldn't do so well with in-person studies.She's full of ideas and I so admire her commitment to The Order of The Good Death, where professionals across specialties work for change in Western society to make death and death practices natural, the way they used to be before the Civil War led to the practice of embalming. Members of The Order want to normalize dead bodies, make them not something to dread and disguise and fill with artificial preservatives. Their commitment is to return death and the idea of it to what it is and should be seen as: the natural and inevitable outcome of life. That's the way it used to be. Bodies were often tended to by loved ones and seeing corpses in different stages of decomposition was a lot more common and the thought of them a lot less frightening. The Order of the Good Death's mission is to take the fright and formaldehyde out of our deaths, use the energy generated by cremulators to power the cremulators and other things, in all sorts of ways to innovate across disciplines. I so admire its aims and especially its founder, Caitlin Doughty, which is why I think her worthy of a MacArthur Grant.I love learning from Caitlin. She makes the harshest things palatable, like the deceased whose head was swelled to the size of a basketball and looked like one too because it was covered with an orange fungus. Her audiences are always made to feel like students, not voyeurs. Her new book, ""Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs: Big Questions From Tiny Mortals about Death"" arrived yesterday. Since there are other books ahead of it I'll probably peek later, because I want to know the answer to the question in the title because I keep imagining my departed darling Annabel Lee chomping on my eyeballs. But I know when Caitlin explains it, no matter the answer I'll be able to deal. And when I get my next cat, wild Ligeia, one of the first things I'll tell her is: hey, do what you have to do."
11,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672661-lois-bujold,5,"An arresting opening line like ""A girl always remembers the first corpse she shaves."" is one any novelist might envy.This is a fascinating memoir of a then-apprentice young mortician who is, I think, quite right in her self-evaluation that her work became, for her, a secular calling. A sometimes painful, sometimes refreshingly honest guided trip behind the scenes of a part of life most of us seldom see -- death is, after all, only a once-in-a-lifetime event -- but will all travel. Yet not experience, so this may be the only preview one may get.Some of her anecdotes stirred up decades-old memories of my hospital-worker days I would rather have left unstirred -- a girl never forgets her first bedsore the size of a dessert plate, I guess. Doughty's work would have begun when ours ended, except for the part about living half a century and most of a continent apart.I don't think I could ever share her secular reverence for corpses, nor her belief in the value of facing them, though I can only be glad, in her line of work, that she possesses it. It's possibly an effect of the way my subculture values the mind over the body. The mind-me I imagine I am is rather disembodied, like the light generated from a lightbulb, or music from an instrument, continuously created then eaten by time. The lightbulb, once broken and not making me anymore, is not something I particularly identify with or care about, apart from a vague hope that it will be disposed of promptly and properly. I want people to remember the light, not the broken bulb. But hey, maybe that's just me...I don't often give five-star reviews to books I wouldn't hurry to read again, but this one earned it. Recommended.Ta, L."
12,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39595324-jay-green,5,"Yes, I finished it on Halloween. Perfect! Except I would have been happy for it to have had another 100 pages to devour. I'm still on a kind of coming-to-terms-with-Dad's-death reading program, and since we followed his wishes and had him cremated, this book seemed like it would offer real insights into that process and help me understand what his remains went through. But it was better than that. Caitlin Doughty offers a down-to-earth, matter-of-fact and everyday approach to death and dying. She doesn't pretend to offer much information on the experience preceding death (how to accompany a dying person in their final days or hours, for instance) or how to cope with grief and grieving, but that isn't really her metier, and I've been able to research elsewhere into those aspects of the death process. What she does provide is a clear and comprehensive account of what crematoria workers do, how they deal with the decomposing body, and how she came round to being a advocate for natural death. I have to confess to a bit of a crush on her after reading this and watching her videos, but it's mostly because she genuinely offers empathy, help, and kindness in relation to a left-field subject in a not-at-all-weird way, and such kindness is a trait that's sorely lacking in this day and age."
13,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57354360-sarah-xoxo,5,"2020 non fiction book 3 out 12 Morbid, hilarious and informative, 'Smoke Gets in Your Eyes' works to break the taboo of death. “A culture that denies death is a barrier to achieving a good death. Overcoming our fears and wild misconceptions about death will be no small task, but we shouldn't forget how quickly other cultural prejudices--racism, sexism, homophobia--have begun to topple in the recent past. It is high time death had its own moment of truth.” This book was addicting, and once I started it, I had to continue through to the end. It included a perfect balance of anecdotes, facts and humour to keep you invested. It was by no means a typical dry statistic filled non-fiction, so if you are wanting to get more into the genre, but worried that it will read like a boring textbook- try this one! It bordered the line between memoir and informative, making it easily accessible and entertaining despite the macabre subject matter. I would also really recommend the audiobook, read by the author herself. Our society seems to think that if we just don't acknowledge death, it won't bother us. We cover our ears, eyes and hearts to the knowledge that one day we will no longer exist. Instead, we focus on our improving technologies, lifespans and medical systems. It was really interesting to see the lengths that we as a society go to, to try and ignore death, or beat it. “It is no surprise that the people trying so frantically to extend our lifespans are almost entirely rich, white men. Men who have lived lives of systematic privilege, and believe that privilege should extend indefinitely.” I particularly loved the look at death rituals from different cultures around the world, as well as our own. Caitlin Doughty really does spare no details, however gruesome. While not for the faint of heart, I would recommend to this book to anyone in the right headspace. Previous to reading this, I didn't think I had been sheltered to the reality of death- but I was shocked by how revolutionary this book was to me. I didn't know so many things, which unbeknownst to me had led to me harbouring a fear of death. Ignorance leads to fear, which is why removing the blindfold and truly being exposed to the truth is invaluable. “Looking mortality straight in the eye is no easy feat. To avoid the exercise, we choose to stay blindfolded, in the dark as to the realities of death and dying. But ignorance is not bliss, only a deeper kind of terror.”"
14,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50893023-johann-jobis89,4,"""A girl always remembers the first corpse she shaves.""Part memoir, part information source on death and death culture, Smoke Gets in Your Eyes provides a uniquely light and humorous insight into what happens to the body after death.As someone who has an intense fear of death and dying, I found this book to be really helpful - Doughty wants to change the dark and negative mindset that surrounds death, as well as clear up some of the misconceptions regarding the funeral industry. I learnt a LOT while reading this one, I kept passing on my little nuggets of information to those around me (I'm sure they were thrilled), whilst also being thoroughly entertained by the stories that Doughty shares.Doughty discusses other cultures and the rituals they have around death, in addition to teaching about the process of embalming and what exactly happens in a crematorium. If you're a fan of Six Feet Under, you'll love this one. I really related to her dark sense of humour and have no doubt I'll pick up more of her books!! A really enjoyable book that I would recommend FOR SURE. 4 stars."
15,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5892196-carole-carole-s-random-life-in-books,5,"This review was also posted at Carole's Random LifeThis was the best little book that I didn't even know that I wanted to read. I have to say that I would have probably never picked this book up for myself. I didn't even know that this book existed until it showed up at my house a couple of weeks ago. My initial impression of the book when I received was lackluster at best. I thought it was an advance copy of a book at first because the cover looks just so unfinished. Nothing about this book screamed ""Read Me"" at first glance. But then I decided to pick it up and my thoughts changed very quickly.Whatever stars lined up on the day this book found its way to my home, I can't say but I am very grateful. This really is the perfect book for me. I have a slight fascination with death. My favorite class in college was Death Education. When the local coroner came to class to give a presentation complete with slides, I was completely impressed. I have never worked in the death industry but my husband actually has delivered caskets part-time for the past couple of years. This book deals with a difficult subject in a way that really pulls the reader in. I think everyone could find something in this book that they would relate to in these pages. I liked that this book made me think and it also made me laugh. I didn't think that this was a sad or depressing book at all which is kind of surprising when you think of the subject matter. I learned a lot from reading this book. There are so many misconceptions regarding death and the funeral industry. I do think that most people really would appreciate this honest look at the subject.Each of the people that are in this book really add to the overall story. Everyone from Caitlin's co-workers to the families who have lost someone they loved really had a story to tell. I liked the parts that featured Caitlin's co-workers because I feel like it takes a special kind of person to want to do this kind of work. People who work in the funeral industry really see people when they are at their worst but they must stay at their best. It has to be incredibly hard to do that day after day. I really appreciated the parts of the book that really let us see how much this kind of work affected the author. I liked the way that this book was written. I was completely engaged in the book from the very beginning. I think it reads almost like one of your friends are telling you a story. Even the more educational sections that gave some history were completely mesmerizing. There was enough lighthearted and funny moments to balance out the sections that were really anything but funny.I would highly recommend to others. I think that this is a topic that we need to know more about and this is an entertaining way to get a peek. This is the first book by Caitlin Doughty that I have read but I would definitely read more of her work in the future. I received a copy of this book from W.W. Norton & Company for the purpose of providing an honest review.Initial ThoughtsI loved this book! This isn't a book that I would have ever picked up for myself but it was a great fit for me."
16,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,4,"Have you ever wondered just what happens to your body when you die? Many people avoid thinking about death altogether, uncomfortable as we are with our own demise and that of those we love. Others have a curiosity that is considered macabre and abnormal in our culture. I fluctuate between the two, leaning more heavily towards the latter. Like the author of this book, I think it is better to learn about what happens when we die in order to become comfortable with death. Or as comfortable as is possible when thinking about how your body will break down into mere atoms, recycled and used for other living things. Most people don't want to die, but no matter what one might want, we're all going to die eventually.... unless those scientists hurry up and figure out how to grant us all immortality. (What the heck is taking them so long anyway??!)Smoke Gets in Your Eyes: And Other Lessons from the Crematory is part memoir, part history and exploration of death practices in different cultures. Caitlin Doughty relates how she became terrified of death when, as a young child, she sees another child die. As an adult, she decides to confront her fears head on and goes to work in the funeral industry. She gets a job at a crematorium and this is mostly what the book is about, her experiences there. It is both disgusting and interesting to read about the process of cremation. She also tells us about embalming (which I find much more disgusting than cremation!). Written with the same acerbic wit that so delighted me in her more recent book From Here to Eternity: Traveling the World to Find the Good Death, Ms. Doughty makes death accessible in a way that not many people can do. There are some parts that left me squeamish and even nauseated at one point ( like when bucketfuls of liquefied fat escaped from the oven, pouring all over the floor), but for the most part it's simply interesting. I learned quite a lot from this book which more than makes up for any ick factor. Fans of the macabre will enjoy this book but so will many others. If you like the writing style of Mary Roach, you will appreciate that of Caitlin Doughty's as well. 
“Death might appear to destroy the meaning in our lives, but in fact it is the very source of our creativity. As Kafka said, “The meaning of life is that it ends.” Death is the engine that keeps us running, giving us the motivation to achieve, learn, love, and create.”

It was difficult for me to describe this book to friends who asked what I was currently reading, as most would give me a funny look when I said it is about a woman who worked at a crematory. However, I can say with great confidence that Ms. Doughty has written one of the most interesting, thought-provoking pieces I have read in a very long time. She poses many questions and notions about death, and does something not many would dare toe the line to do -- ask why we treat death and the process of dying the way we do in our country. Naturally, people tend to fear death, however death can be an incredibly moving experience for those of us left in its wake. Having lost both parents, my siblings and I might have a different outlook on it than some others who have not experienced such loss. Ms. Doughty's work hit a nerve for me in this regard -- death is a devastating loss to the living, but can be a celebration of peace and freedom to those who have died. I highly recommend this title to anyone who enjoys nonfiction works that can inspire deeper-level thinking and personal exploration.(ARC obtained at Book Expo of America convention.

18,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28323108-a-rather-bookish,4,"""Smoke gets in your eyes, and other lessons from the crematorium"" is partly a memoir and also partly tells us the history behind death customs. Doughty is a mortician, and has a remarkably positive attitude towards death, and she questions the need for change in the way people view death and mortality in general. I found this all incredibly morbid, but it was really very interesting.The subject matter contained within this book is gruesome and abrupt. If one is pretty squeamish, then maybe give it a miss, as Doughty goes into terrific detail of life working in a crematory. She seems to be very honest with her feelings and opinions, but not in slightest bit disrespectful when she does so. She tell us about the first time she had to shave a male corpse or the first time she came into contact with a decomposing corpse. I think, personally, Doughty tells us the gruesome and difficult to prosess details, not to shock, but to enable her readers to feel more comfortable when it comes to discussing death. I feel she did that amicably. I found this book to be thought provoking, interesting and even funny, at times, and I'd certainly recommend it. "
19,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1809697-darlene,4,"""The meaning of life is that it ends."" -KafkaThis book, Smoke Gets in Your Eyes: And Other Lessons from the Crematory is difficult to characterize. It's part memoir and part history of death customs; but it is also an advocacy for a much needed change in the way our society views death, the deceased and our own mortality. The author, Caitlin Doughty, describes herself as a 'death-positive' mortician. She also blogs about issues and attitudes regarding mortality and she has a web series called 'Ask a Mortician'. Caitlin Doughty explains that she has always had a complicated relationship with death. From the time she realized that the fate of human beings was death, she battled warring feelings of fear and curiosity. This book really is a result of her long emotional journey. She describes that, as a child, she witnessed a bizarre accidental death of a young girl at a shopping mall and this death has always stayed with her. So at the age of 23, with her newly minted degree in medieval history in hand, Caitlin Doughty decided to explore death in a more 'up close and personal' way. She got a job as crematory operator at Westwind Cremation and Burial mortuary in Oakland, California and her experiences there were another step in her journey to make sense of her personal feelings about her own mortality and also to explain the way Americans experience death.Although the subject matter of this book may seem morbid and gruesome, I found Ms. Doughty's writing engaging, humorous and not at all grim. Certainly, if you are squeamish, then this book may not be for you because Ms. Doughty DOES describe in great detail (although as tastefully as possible) her experiences working in a crematory. She discusses her first time shaving a corpse to prepare him for a family viewing before cremation and all the emotions engaging in that very intimate act evoked in her. She relates her duty of keeping watch of the body inside the cremation chamber and the shock she felt when she witnessed a flaming, glowing skull. And she describes being repulsed and curious about viewing a corpse with the blackened skin of advanced decomposition and a thick, spidery white mold covering the face. All of her descriptions are startling and arouse feelings of revulsion but Ms. Doughty is never disrespectful in her writing. Instead, she is matter-of-fact and entertaining and you can't help but feel she is regarding you knowingly.. as if she feels sympathy for her readers and their reactions. It's apparent that Ms. Doughty's motive in providing the realistic and often ghastly details of death is not to shock or disturb; rather, I believe she is being intentionally provocative, hoping her readers will become familiar, if not entirely comfortable, with the reality facing all living beings.... we all will die. She has become painfully aware through her work in the funeral industry, that many people have become quite separated and isolated from death and that has resulted in a culture that is full of fear, misconceptions and often in total denial of their own mortality. In order to understand how society has become so distant from the thoughts and emotions regarding mortality, Ms. Doughty provides a kind of history of death practices in the United States. This history illustrates that our emotional isolation from death is a direct result of being PHYSICALLY separated from the practices of caring for the deceased. Death practices in America were constant for hundreds of years. When a person died, the family of the deceased (mostly women) took charge of preparing the body for burial. The family members would wash the body, wrap it in a shroud and lay it out in the home for several days, keeping a constant vigil over the body because of a belief that the corpse might awaken. Meanwhile, other family members or a local cabinetmaker would assemble a plain wooden coffin and the body would then be placed in the ground. The tradition of the family caring for their dead was the norm until the Civil War. It was the Civil War which started the shift in America's death rituals. Because of the massive casualties incurred during the war, there was a need to devise a new way to transport the large number of dead soldiers back got their families. This need led to the development of various embalming fluids which could be sued to preserve the dead for their train rides home, often in the extreme summer heat of the American south. This technique of embalming the dead caught on and although initially, these 'undertakers' were not the medical professionals they are considered today, the death industry became quite lucrative.. creating great wealth until the early 1960s. It was the period from the turn of the twentieth century until the 1960s that death rituals went from being performed in homes to being taken care of by 'professionals' providing more and more elaborate funerals, fancy coffins and extravagant flower arrangements. And of course, more people began dying in hospitals than at home. These societal changes led to changes in how we thought of (or rather didn't think of at all) of the deceased. Family members were isolated from their beloved deceased for the first time in history. Although the extravagant funerals seem to be a thing of the past and there has been an increase in cremations in recent years, families are still very much left out of the death process. This removal of the family from this last phase of life is part of what Caitlin Doughty is determined to change... to bring the idea of a 'good death' back to families where she feels it belongs. Through her years at Westwind Cremation and Burial; her extensive research into the history of America's death rituals and the death rituals from cultures around the world and her subsequent training in mortuary school, Caitlin Doughty, formed the educated opinion that America needs to change its relationship with death... how we view our own deaths and how we care for the dead. She concluded that when death became 'big business' and people began making a great deal of money off of the deceased and their families, a shift began to occur in Americans' thinking about death and mortality and people began to be pushed out of the end of life care of their family members. She writes... ""We can wander further into the death dystopia, denying that we will die and hiding dead bodies from our sight. Making that choice means we will continue to be terrified and ignorant of death..."" Ms. Doughty advocates for better laws at all levels of government.. local, state and federal.. so that people might be encouraged to experiment with and pursue different death customs and rituals... such as natural burials, where bodies can be laid out in open areas so that nature can consume the bodies or open-air funeral pyres. In the end, Ms. Doughty believes that connecting emotionally with our own mortality and participating in meaningful death rituals are important for the LIVING... after all, the dead no longer require anything of us. Replacing the myths and superstitions regarding death and the deceased with information and facts won't take the sting out of death but perhaps a bit of knowledge combined with meaningful rituals can provide comfort and acceptance. This book is an honest, funny and thought-provoking look at a subject that is relevant to all of us and I highly recommend it!A YouTube video from Caitlin Doughty's first episode of her web series 'Ask a Mortician':https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTCg6..."
20,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent,4,"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes is the story of Caitlin Doughty's ruminations on death and dying interspersed with her own journey from death touched little girl to licensed mortician.My wife and I are big fans of Caitlin Doughty's Ask a Mortician series on Youtube and I bought this for my wife, who gave it to me as a reading assignment upon her completion.Caitlin's writing has a funny yet respectful tone, much like her Youtube series. She details death practices and beliefs from around the world but the really interesting bits where about Caitlin herself. The funny tone makes a topic a lot of people find distasteful easy to digest and I kinda wish she'd try her hand at writing some crematorium based mysteries or something.Raised in Hawaii, Caitlin saw a little girl fall from an escalator and die in a mall when she was a kid, forever changing the trajectory of her life. From there, she went from goth to crematory operator to mortuary school, pondering death the whole way. There are darkly humorous stories, like molten fat gushing out of a cremation machine like something in a Three Stooges short, to poignant moments like Caitlin having to cremate a box of babies from the local hospital. She also pulls back the black curtain shrouding the funeral industry, an industry full of lies and pressure to upsell. Shady shit.If you've been entertained by Caitlin's Ask a Mortician videos, this is a must read. Four out of five cremulators."
21,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/188447-jessica-jeffers,5,"I’ve had more first-hand experience with death than just about anyone else I know in my age group. By the time I hit thirty, I’d lost three grandparents (five, if you let me count my high-school boyfriend’s grandparents; they lived with his family), a mother, two high-school friends, a former roommate, an uncle, a dozen great aunts and uncles, three dogs, and a small army of cats. I briefly considered becoming a grief therapist before realizing I was just too misanthropic to pursue graduate studies in counseling. So in some ways I am both less afraid and more afraid of death than many of my peers. I feel like I think about it as a realistic possibility (as opposed to a vague, scary, distant concept) more than most people I know. I wasn’t familiar with Caitlin Doughty’s work before I picked up her book -- I’d heard her name but had never perused her video series or Jezebel articles -- but I’m interested enough in the grieving process and familiar enough with death that I thought I would enjoy this. And I actually enjoyed it quite a bit; I read the whole thing in a single day. It sounds to me like Caitlin applied for a job in a crematory because she A) has the kind of darkish personality that leads to a fascination with that kind of thing and B) had a kind of useless B.A. in medieval studies. She spent a year as a crematory operator in San Francisco before pursuing licensure as a mortician and becoming the death-awareness advocate she is today. This book is chock-full of interesting facts about the death industry (part of the reason Americans started embalming the dead was because the number of Civil War casualties was too many to deal with before the smell became unbearable for anyone tasked with transporting them) and the rituals performed by other cultures (a tribe in Brazil that was forced to give up their cannibalistic traditions). Caitlin talks a lot about the kinds of activities that she performed on a regular basis and how those things shaped her views on life and death: transporting deceased people, preparing their bodies for a final viewing, handling unclaimed remains, and dismissing the general public’s misconceptions of her job. Even the science of how cremation works was incredibly interesting, such as how the day is scheduled according to the size of the bodies.I was a little disappointed that she kind of speeds through her time in mortuary school because, by that time, she had already decided that she disagreed with the positions of academic morticians. It was a combination of her time at the crematory and what morticians were being taught that drove her to start her “Ask a Mortician” video series and The Order of the Good Death, which advocates for more open, natural approaches to both death preparation (let’s talk about our final wishes more) and burial practices (which she believes sanitizes death to a point where we fear it too much to process it in a healthy way). This book obviously handles some things that might be upsetting to some people, but Caitlin’s argument is essentially that we let death upset us too much. It’s one thing to grieve and to worry that our lives will be cut short before we’ve fulfilled our goals, but it’s another thing to try to slow down the natural aging process in an attempt to avoid dealing with death entirely. Her stories aren’t meant to shock so much as demonstrate how normal this whole thing is. I enjoyed her writing style, which is conversational and engaging, and I feel like there’s a lot about this book that’s going to stick with me. Very highly recommended. "

23,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2905339-bark,5,"“A girl always remembers the first corpse she shaves.”I sometimes think I’ve missed my life’s true calling. That of being a mortuary worker. But after reading this book I’m not so sure. I always thought the idea of working with people who didn’t talk back was a nice one, you know? No office politics, no grumpy personalities to tip-toe around, no one stealing your lunch and there’s never a lack of business. Sounds like bliss to me. Until I read this book which shattered those daydreams. There are some unsavory, heartbreaking and infuriating parts of the job that I never considered like . . .Incinerating BabiesGushing molten fatCheap ass relativesMoving heavy bodies into the incinerator by yourself Heads. Yep. Just the heads.But then again, no job is perfect, right?Caitlin Doughty captures her experiences while working at a mortuary and later going to school to make it official, with humor, insight and horror. I loved every captivating word. She has an extremely fanciful imagination and morbid wit that keeps you listening even when things get really dark or really disgusting and believe me they get disgusting!She delves deep into the history of death rituals and how it all evolved into the system currently in place today. She doesn’t pull any punches and explains how embalming, though once a necessity on the battlefield, has morphed into nothing more than a money maker for the death industry. Fascinating! I always wondered why bodies weren’t buried naturally and given back to the earth and now I know the reason and it’s pretty damn depressing. Doughty narrates this audiobook and she does a fantastic job. She knows her material best, after all, and her voice is clear and pleasant to listen to. She adds humor in all the right spots and it never feels forced. She has a strong grasp on the toll that being surrounded by death brings on those who deal with it day in and day out. She and her co-workers look at the world a little differently than most folks. I guess it’s hard not to when you face down death and deal with the aftermath every day. Death happens to everyone sooner or later and there’s no point living your life fearful of it coming for you. And it is coming for you! “We are just future corpses.”If you’re a morbid sort such as I, I highly recommend this book to you."
24,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5160409-jenny,3,"Death should be known. Known as a difficult mental, physical, and emotional process, respected and feared for what it is.Recently I've been thinking about how little I talk about death—with my friends, family, even within the confines of my own head. As a result, I have such little language with which to express my feelings about death and loss, grief and mourning. I don't know what to say to a friend coping with the loss of their brother. I have no clue how to broach the subject of my grandpa's premature death with my mom. I want to comfort the people I love... and I simply don't even know where to begin.This book, touching on our culture's death anxiety and denial of mortality, reminds me once again how important it is to have these conversations.Smoke Gets in Your Eyes talks both historical and modern incarnations of the death industry: embalming, cremation, death rituals (be it cannibalism, professional mourners, or devouring by vulture), even our squeamish repudiation of decomposition. Doughty describes shaving her first corpse, and picking up bodies from homes and babies from hospital morgues. Anecdotes, historical facts, and scholarly readings interweave. I didn’t care much for the latter (I went into this expecting a memoir, not so much an academic paper), but I did very much enjoy the personal nature and dark humour of the former. It discusses the clinical distance at which we hold ourselves from death, the ways in which dying has become marketable to consumers—even so far as to trademark “dignity.” Doughty argues that we as a culture have become so removed from a process natural and integral to us, death, that we don't know what to do with ourselves when the time arises. We allow the bodies of our loved ones to be handled by strangers with industrial machinery, in processes that are invasive and environmentally unsustainable. Another thing that struck me as I read (and not for the first time) was the prevalence of fatphobia, even in the death industry. Even within the pages of this book. It's really gross how normalized this is. 
Bottom line:
 I thought that parts of this book were SO interesting and important, especially its consideration of alternative death and funerals. And above all, championing having these conversations in the first place."
25,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6449756-sonja-arlow,5,"My fascination with the macabre and death is perhaps a case of staring at the boogeyman till he loses its power over me.This book gave me the opportunity to stare very hard!Part memoir, part research and full of the right intentions this book covers a range of death related topics:1)	Death rituals of other cultures and just how skewed the Western worlds desire to detach itself so completely from death and any reminder of its own mortality2)	Death through he ages – from medieval times to now3)	Comparing Egyptian embalming (which had a very specific religious meaning) to modern day embalming. Embalming in today’s world has zero cultural value yet it’s the backbone of America’s billion dollar funeral industry4)	A glimpse into the politics in the funeral industry of the USA5)	Our obsession to cheat death and live forever6)	Even the impact of our ever growing geriatric populationUnlike Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers which is more of a laugh a minute type of book, this one handles the subject with a bit more compassion even though a healthy dose of humor is also present. But be warned, there are one or two sections where you really need to put your food down and NOT EAT while reading. Trust me on this!The writing is not bad for someone who does not make a living off of it but its no literary masterpiece and overall is around a 4 star rating. However what the author is trying to do with this book and her very cheesy You Tube videos, is bring education and demystification to us, a culture that will do everything we can to ignore our own mortality. For that effort she gets my full 5 star rating.Highly recommended!!"
26,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33447134-book-riot-community,0,"A little bit morbid, a little bit gross, a whole lot empowering. That’s basically the only way I can describe this book. Caitlin Doughty has been obsessed with death her whole life, so it’s only natural she goes to work at a crematory. In her tales, she busts a lot of myths about the death industry, like, no, crematories don’t dump the day’s worth of bodies in and scoop out bits of ash for the families’ urns afterward. At least, reputable ones don’t. She ends on a philosophical look at life and death, how our culture views death, and how we can change that. It’s just the book I needed this month.– Ashley Holstromfrom The Best Books We Read In April: http://bookriot.com/2016/04/29/riot-r..."
27,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1971718-b-rule,3,"This is a quick read and a relatively light, frothy take on a dark subject. Doughty adopts the authorial persona of ""cheerful goth"" which largely works for her approach, combining anecdotal accounts of her time in the death industry with repeated polemics to bring death back into our daily awareness through proximity to bodies and decay, a la her ""Order of the Good Death."" There are some weird tonal shifts that I think may be evidence of clumsy editing (e.g., a single chapter digression about her love for a friend named Luke does tie back thematically in a strained way, but the concluding tossed off aside about a hunky teenager she beds as a rebound is a weird touch in a book that otherwise skims the surface of her intimate interpersonal interactions). The biggest problem with her narrative is the astounding lack of progress that it shows. She talks all of the time about her philosophy of death and treats it as fully formed from basically before she started working at her first crematory, but then repeatedly violates her own principles without any rationale. For instance, she decries the professionalization and normalization of embalming, yet decides to go to mortuary school to learn the trade. She believes in the importance of keeping the dead in the home and avoiding the masks of embalming to conceal death, yet runs her own grandmother through the death industry machine in its most disneyfied and obtrusive forms. Uh, what? Either she's deeply lacking in self-awareness, or more charitably, has bungled the timing of her story and is unable to imaginatively place herself back in the mental space she inhabited before this became a personal crusade. If she only lately came to her current position through these traumatic and formative experiences, you have an interesting memoir of her journey to death activist. As it stands, you have the story of a funny but slightly airheaded young woman who is estranged from her own espoused doctrines. Doughty seems like too smart of an author for the latter to be true, so I will simply assume she was not given adequate editorial assistance to tell her story in the gripping manner it deserves. That said, this is written in a breezy, slightly humorous, and winkingly irreverent way that definitely will appeal to fans of Mary Roach. I expected more of a literary memoir (partially judging the book by its cover) but this is pure bubblegum. Sure, she tosses in a lot of literary references about death, but the book's true nature is decidedly more pop. There's nothing wrong with a little bubblegum sometimes."
28,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34744063-captive-audience,1,"Is it like a thing that if you want to work in a death industry and write a book, you have to be a judgemental asshole? Around the time I finally gave up on trying to get through Judy Melinek's Working Stiff (angry review here, I read an enthusiastic discussion about this book and what an interesting book it is and what a great person the author seems like. I'm not quite halfway through and after reading some disjointed stories about the author that seem to spend as much time talking about her life and not the crematory, I'm now reading her thoughts on people who order low cost internet cremation. Apparently despite all her insinuations about how cool she is with other belief systems and ways of grieving (she spends time talking about how cannibalism of a corpse is cool, because it's based on a belief), this is just too much, because she is now devoting part of her book to talking about how it's not okay for people to choose low-cost internet cremation with no human interaction. Why? Because... reasons? I don't know, but she decided to pick on the family of a dead 9 year old girl for her example. Because clearly, if you've just lost your 9 year old, you damn well *better* behave in a way that Caitlin thinks is 'right', never mind any of the many many reasons I can think of for why someone would go the low cost internet route. I mean let's see, off the top of my head:- they may be poor and this is the best price they could find. Imagine *having* to bargain shop for the process of dealing with your newly dead little girl's remains. Yeah, those assholes.- they may not want to be around people right now. I mean, she just spent a chapter talking about a Chinese family that responds to death in a certain way, but apparently it's only cool if it's something she likes, because feeling the need to *not* talk to strangers about setting your newly dead little girl's body on fire and then handing them back a box full of charred dead daughter - as I said, those *assholes*, right?- okay, long shot here, but maybe they called the in-person business she works for and dealt with her and were turned off by her personality and didn't want to meet more people like her, and decided ""fuck it, internet this shit.""I suppose it's clear that I'm annoyed. As an introvert who hates showing emotion in front of *anyone*, but particularly strangers, I have no idea how I'm going to cope with the deaths of my parents. I have a sneaking suspicion I might not even be able to handle going to their funerals. And yeah, that's going to cause some shit to go down, but after considering it a long time, I've decided that my way of mourning - shutting myself in and dealing with the emotions alone until I can get through them - is no less valid than the way of mourning that involves dressing up and eating egg salad sandwiches and trying to find something to say about the deceased that the last three speakers didn't already say. Or eating the flesh of the dead. Or hiring professional mourners. Whatever. What I'm saying is, this lady's attitude offends me on both a personal and a general level.I probably should have been forewarned by her weird snark talking about a parent naming their kid Caitlin but spelling it KateLynne. Weirdly petty at the best of times, this came in the midst of her trying to come off as compassionate by talking about cremating stillborns, and how it was sadder when they came with full names than just ""Baby Johnson"" because it meant the parents were ""ready [...] for them to be born and become a part of the family."" Sadder unless you're the kind of person to name your kid something ""terrible"" (her word) like ""KateLynne"", apparently. Christ. (And I won't even bother going into the question of why not having chosen a baby's name before it was born somehow means you're not as invested in your baby, because that question raises itself just fine.)"

Caitlin Doughty, at the age of 23, has produced an impressive, well researched commentary on how we as a society perceive death, talk (or not talk) about death, and view the body and what happens post-mortem. She brings the death industry to light as well as the options available for burial or cremation. She speaks frankly and does not gloss over details that some may find distasteful. This is a book written by someone who has spent a lot of time ruminating over what makes a good death and what should happen with the body. She has worked in various facets of the death industry, most notably a crematory and has attended mortuary school.Admittedly, I approached this book with some level of apprehension, presupposing that a book about cremation would be awfully dull. Yet, I was pleasantly surprised at the level of wit and humor sprinkled within such a dark and morbid topic. The author is wise well beyond her years. The fact that she can discuss these topics and make them so riveting, compelling, and in some cases, downright laughable make this book not only a super important read, but a highly enjoyable one.I am an emergency medicine physician. I see dead people often. One of the greatest gifts I can give a patient and family, is a death with dignity. Too often, patients come through the ER, without a hope of surviving a tragic accident or disease, yet everything is done to try. The more humane option in my opinion is to speak to the family about the prognosis and how much they want done. These conversations can lead to a much more peaceful end of life, and lead to a much more gratifying experience by all involved (nurse, physicians, family and loved ones). Caitlin speaks to the increasingly ever-aging population; the increasing physician-shortage, especially in the area of geriatrics; and the increasing need for care-givers for the elderly. These are critically important topics which need increased awareness and discussion to be held on many levels. Caitlin speaks about the need for people to think about their own mortality and what they would like to happen with their bodies after their death. It is a huge burden to families and loved ones, emotionally and financially, to know what to do these circumstances when the wishes of the deceased are unknown. This is a book that everyone should read. It is a book that will hopefully change misconceptions about death and encourage more conversations. Death should not be such a mysterious process.For pictures, discussion questions, links, please visit: http://www.book-chatter.com/?p=415"

Smoke Gets in Your Eyes is technically a memoir, but its many historical anecdotes and tidbits make it feel like it fits in well with the subgenre. It tackles some big themes: our uncomfortable feelings about death, our misconceptions on what happens to us after we die, our unnecessary fears, our necessary fears, and the plain weird things that we believe when it comes to dead bodies. These big themes and graphic stories are wrapped up in a truly hilarious narrative voice. I loved reading the author's journey into this world of the dead, and found myself laughing several times in the midst of chapters that on the surface, should NOT have been funny. (But they were!)
Disclaimer:
 This is definitely a book that will only appeal to a small group of people. It includes many stories of real things that happened in the crematory—and those real things are described in real detail. Please don't read this book if you're squeamish, or think the humor will outweigh the grit—it doesn't, it just adds to it."

She takes us on a journey behind the scenes of the funeral business exposing questionable practices and laws regarding remains. She provides a cultural history of death practices around the world. The rituals of death are not always pretty but this reader found them fascinating.

32,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18562856-puck,3," “Today, not being forced to see corpses is a privilege of the developed world.” 3 stars. With humor, compassion, and interesting facts about death-culture, Caitlin Doughty takes us with her into the crematorium. We learn about the embalming process, what happens to a body in a cremation oven, and why make-up on a corpse is more important than you think. True, reading vivid descriptions of embalmed bodies, cut-off heads, and burned body fat takes some getting used to – squeezy people should better stay away from this book – but Doughty always manages to see the beauty or the funny awkwardness of the (gory) situation. Maybe you’re not a fan of morbid stories, but I think many will laugh about Caitlin having to deal with odd corpses or handle the strange requests of the mourners. 
 “A girl always remembers the first corpse she shaves. It is the only event in her life more awkward than her first kiss or the loss of her virginity. The hands of time will never move quite so slowly as when you are standing over the dead body of an elderly man with a pink plastic razor in your hand.” 
Sprinkled through her descriptions of her job as a mortician are short pieces of information about the history of funerals, (American) death-culture, and the different death practices all around the world. It’s not a lot of information – she talks more on this subject in her newest book – but it might spark your interest to research these subjects yourself. So this is an entertaining and enlighting memoir about working in a crematorium, but unlike the smell of a decaying body, isn’t very memorable."

I was sorely disappointed. My biggest issue is that it can't quite make up its mind what it wants to be. Is it a serious look at America's funeral industry? Is it a quirky memoir? An insightful study of the author's grappling with her own mortality? In trying to do too many things it fails at all of them. If you're the sort who would pick up a book like this to start, then it's probably not going to tell you anything you haven't already read anywhere else or thought of on your own. It's very entry level. I suppose I was expecting something like Stiff by Mary Roach, but more focused on mortuary practices. Instead I got mostly stories about how, like, toootally embarrassing it is to pick up bodies from the hospital morgue. You can almost hear Doughty snapping her gum in places. But oddly, the humor often felt forced, as if an editor wanted it to just be more ~*fun~*. Equally forced feeling were the bits where romance was involved. I get that this moment in the book was a catalyst, but it either should have been explored in more depth or not at all. Which is sort of how I felt about the whole book, really. More depth or not at all. It's not a great memoir. It's not a good history. It's not much of an expose. It's sort of just not much of anything. But at least it's a fast read.  "
34,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5464046-porshajo,4,"Focus is hard for me these days, as is probably for most. I haven't been able to get into books but still must read. It's a necessity. So when I keep trying book after book I know I need to go to an author that I have enjoyed in the past. Yup, I turned to Caitlin Doughtry. Well, you might think....but it's a book about death and a crematory. But it was just what I needed. I flew through this one and happy I picked it up.Caitlin Doughty begins her first job in a crematory, you can say, after a very long time with a peculiar interest in death. She talks in detail of cremating bodies. Both of the old, the young, the babies, the sick, the heavy, and more. This is not a read for everyone. If you are a bit squeamish or don't want to hear about death, in detail, this might not be for you. I read another of this authors books, her second, and really enjoyed (such a strange word to use when discussing death) the way she told her story. In this one, she discussed the culture of death around the world. This one being her first book, she starts at the beginning. You hear her story of how she became interested in death and learning as much about it, her desire to understand, and wanting to open her own place.I listened to this one via audio which is narrated by the author. She has an ease about herself where you feel it's just like someone talking to you, telling you about themselves. I actually found myself doing small things in the kitchen just so I could continue to listen to more (I always listen to audios in the kitchen). I did warn my husband though of what I would be listening to. He didn't seem to be bothered by it. FWIW, he only flips out when I listen to Harry Potter. Ha! Overall, I'm very happy to finally get to this one and it allowed me to concentrate on the narration, and not world events."

She also is hilarious! Then I read her book 'Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs ' and had to have more!This book is about her time when she first starts into the business, as a trainee.

36,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1134433-mark,5,"Did you ever read the first line of a book to see if it grabbed you? Well, this odd memoir grabbed me from the first sentence and wouldn't let go until the end of the source notes. Most of us probably hold at least a little bit of morbid curiosity about what goes on behind the doors at your local crematorium. Your curiosity will be more than satisfied by Ms. Doughty's account of her years as a burgeoning mortician. In addition to details such as how they keep those darn eyelids closed during the funeral, Doughty educates us on death rituals from around the world and obscure funeral laws. There was a day when the families of the dead were responsible for preparing the bodies for burial, but -- with the advent of the funeral business -- our society has become detached from the reality of death, to the point of denial. Doughty seeks to reconnect us with the very last page of the last chapter in our book of life. "
37,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50066399-diane-in-australia,4,"I really liked this book. I totally agree with the author that society needs a very deep, very honest re-think of how we approach death, and how we deal with our dead bodies. Our current 'norm' of embalming/burial, or cremation, wasn't always the norm.We are woefully ignorant of what the law actually does require regarding a dead body ... less than you probably assume. Death used to be handled by the family, in the home, and had more significance.You can now order a cremation online ... yep, you never have to talk to a real person, you never have to see the dead body ... someone else picks up the body, takes it to the crematorium, scoops up the ashes afterwards, and mails them to you ... if you want them.I like the author's writing style, and think she did a great job with this book. I enjoyed it. I'm even going to look her up online, and keep reading her posts there.4 Stars = It gave me much food for thought."
38,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,4,"(3.5) Caitlin Doughty, a funeral director in her early thirties, is on a mission. Her goal? Nothing less than completely changing how we think about death and the customs surrounding it. Her odyssey through the death industry began when she was 23 and started working at suburban San Francisco’s Westwind Crematorium. She had spent her first 18 years in Hawaii and saw her first dead body at age eight when she went to a Halloween costume contest at the mall and saw a little girl plummet 30 feet over a railing. In another century, she reflects, it would have been rare for a child to go that long before seeing a corpse; nineteenth-century tots might have experienced the death of multiple siblings, if not a parent.“Today, not being forced to see corpses is a privilege of the developed world,” she writes. And if we do see a dead body, it will have been so prettified by mortuary workers that it might bear little resemblance to how the person looked in life. Here Doughty reveals all the tricks of the American trade – from embalming (a post-Civil War development) and heavy-duty makeup to gluing eyes closed and sewing mouths shut – that give the dead that peaceful, lifelike look we like to see at wakes. Compare our squeamishness with the openness of various Asian countries, where one might see dozens of corpses floating down the Ganges or Buddhist monks meditating on a decomposing corpse as a memento mori.Doughty is in a somewhat awkward position: she is part of the very American death industry she is criticizing – those “professionals whose job was not ritual but obfuscation, hiding the truths of what bodies are and what bodies do.” Although she reveled in her work at the crematorium despite its occasional gruesomeness and seems to believe cremation is an efficient and responsible choice for body disposal, she also worries that it might be a further sign of people’s determination to keep bodies out of sight and out of mind. As anthropologist Geoffrey Gorer noted, “In many cases, it would appear, cremation is chosen because it is felt to get rid of the dead more completely and finally than does burial.”Could cremation be noble instead? Doughty traces its origins to ancient Roman funeral pyres, as different as could be from the enclosed, clinical environment of a modern crematorium. Two factors led directly to cremation becoming increasingly accepted and popular after the 1960s. One was Jessica Mitford’s book The American Way of Death (1961), which mocked the same Los Angeles area cemetery Evelyn Waugh does in The Loved One, Forest Lawn. The other was Pope Paul VI overturning the Catholic Church’s ban on cremation in 1963. Doughty quotes George Bernard Shaw’s rapturous account of his mother’s cremation in 1913 as proof that it can be not only natural, but even aesthetically pleasing:And behold! The feet burst miraculously into streaming ribbons of garnet colored lovely flame, smokeless and eager, like Pentecostal tongues, and as the whole coffin passed in it sprang into flame all over, and my mother became that beautiful fire.It is rare, however – and, for the workers, nerve-racking – to have witnesses at a cremation. For the most part Westwind worked like a factory, cremating six bodies per weekday. Doughty experienced all sides of the work: collecting dead fetuses from hospitals for free cremation, shaving adult corpses before burning, enduring the stench of decomposing flesh, and taking delivery of a box of heads whose bodies were donated to science. She is largely unsentimental about it all; who is this fairytale witch who speaks of “tossing” babies into the oven and grinding their little bones?“Handmaiden to the underworld,” she describes herself, and given her medieval history degree and Goth-lite looks, you can see that a certain macabre cast of mind is necessary for this line of work. She also has a good ear for arrestingly witty one-liners; my favorite was “As a general rule, if anyone ever asks you to put stockings on a ninety-year-old deceased Romanian woman with edema, your answer should be no.”Still, Doughty recognizes the almost unbearable sadness of many of the cases the crematorium sees – the young man who traveled to California from Washington just to stand in the path of a train, the “floaters” found in the ocean, the elderly with oozing bed sores, and the homeless folk of Los Angeles who were cremated and dumped in a mass grave after they were used for embalming practice at her mortuary school. She even considered committing suicide herself on a lonely trip out to a redwood forest.What has kept her going is the desire to combat misconceptions and superstitions about the dead. As she realized after a potentially serious car accident on the freeway, she has lost her own fear of death, and she wants to help others do the same. This will require getting people talking about death, something she is doing through her online community Order of the Good Death and her Ask a Mortician YouTube videos. She would also like to see people having involvement with dead bodies again, as they did in previous centuries, perhaps by washing their dead relatives or keeping them at home before the funeral rather than having them taken away. “It is never too early to start thinking about your own death and the deaths of those you love.” This is not morbid; it’s just planning ahead for an inevitable experience. “We can wander further into the death dystopia, denying that we will die and hiding dead bodies from our sight. Making that choice means we will continue to be terrified and ignorant of death, and the huge role it plays in how we live our lives.”The sections of personal anecdote in this book are better than those based on anthropological research – which is not woven in entirely naturally. Ultimately, it’s a little unclear exactly how Doughty plans to change things. She speaks of designing her own welcoming crematorium, an open, airy space that doesn’t suggest a death factory. But it’s enough that she’s part of a movement in the right direction, and beneath her wry tone her passion is clear.(Originally published with images at my blog, Bookish Beck.)Further reading suggestions: For more on how people are revolutionizing how we think about death, I highly recommend Anne Karpf’s book for the School of Life, How to Age. Other death-themed reads I have particularly enjoyed are The Undertaking by Thomas Lynch, The Removers by Andrew Meredith, and A Tour of Bones by Denise Inge. Less effective as a memoir but still interesting for its view of the funeral home business is The Undertaker’s Daughter by Kate Mayfield.Note: I was originally going to review this book for a British website, so I received a free copy of the UK edition from Canongate. Doughty inserts British statistics and information to increase the book’s relevance to a new audience. She also astutely notes that British funerals minimize interaction with a dead body, something I have certainly found true in the two cremations I have attended in England. The Irish are famous for their wakes, but the British do not have this custom. In fact, when we attended my brother-in-law’s viewing and funeral in America earlier this year, it was the first time my husband (aged 31) had seen a dead body. Although I can see Doughty’s point about a prettified corpse not being representative of what the dead ‘should’ look like, I must also say that the funeral home had done a fantastic job of making him look happy and at peace, like he was sleeping and having pleasant dreams. He certainly didn’t look like a man who had suffered the ravages of brain cancer for four years. The same was not true for my ninety-something grandmother, however, who was nearly unrecognizable."
39,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17703155-melissa-chung,5,"What an extremely well written and informative look on death and the behind the scenes of cremation and burial. This is Caitlin Doughty's autobiographical account on starting her life in the death business. Going from a lonely cremation operator to licensed mortician. Loved her sense of humor and was delighted in her unending NEED to make death less of an unknown. Fighting to bring mortality to the forefront and to squash the misinformation surrounding death in general from cremation to burial and everything in between.There is a list toward the end of the book from a paper written in 1961, from the 'Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology' that gives seven reasons humans fear death.1. Death would cause grief to relatives and friends. (one of my biggest fears!)2. Plans and projects would come to an end. (my tremendous TBR pile would be left unread) 3. The process of dying might be painful. (Yep that hits home)4. One can no longer have any experiences. (Again look back up at number two)5. No longer be able to care for dependents. (As a mother this is all I think about)6. Afraid of what might happen if there is a life after death. (that would be cool)7. Afraid of what might happen to the body after death. (meh don't care)I absolutely loved this nonfiction. It just makes sense all around. I've always been okay with death in general. I'm not afraid of dying per say, but I would be sad to make others sad. As for what I would want when I die? Definitely cremation with my ashes buried to plant a tree."
40,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,5,"Caitlin Doughty is doing great work to educate the public about all aspects of death. In Smoke Gets in Your Eyes, Doughty tells the story of the childhood event that first sparked her fascination with death, her experience working as a crematory operator, and her foray into mortuary science education that would eventually allow her to start a mortuary business in Los Angeles. Along the way, there's much to learn about how bodies are prepared for viewings, how they are transported, what happens to the bodies of the unhoused, the process of cremation, and many other fine details most people don't know anything about. Doughty approaches death with openness, honesty, and just the right blend of humor and vulnerability to humanize the subject. While there are many descriptions of decaying bodies and stories that will gross out readers, the overall lessons are clear: the decomposition process is natural, dead bodies aren't harmful, death should not be ignored or hidden, families should be more involved in the handling of their loved ones, and embalming and rigid burial structures are almost always unnecessary. Doughty advocates for the good death: an exit from life that is demystified, planned for, minimally painful, and strengthens family bonds. It all starts with a culture that destigmatizes death and sees it as a natural part of life: the very part that gives our limited time on Earth focus and meaning. Caitlin Doughty is doing so much to contribute to that culture, and I can't recommend this book (and From Here to Eternity) enough. She also has a YouTube series called ""Ask a Mortician"".I had originally purchased this as an ebook, but then added on the audio as ""whisper sync"" so I could listen to it in the car. Doughty's narration is so good that I ended up listening to the entire thing."
41,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260116-janb,4,"The author is the founder of ""The Order of the Good Death"" and has a video series, ""Ask A Mortician"". Drawing on her experiences when she worked in a crematory, Doughty examines the funeral industry and our society's tendency to sanitize the process, and contrasts it with the practices and rites of other cultures. In the past, families prepared a loved one’s body for burial and the wake was held at home. To our own detriment, modern society has sanitized this process with the advent of the funeral business, leading to a denial and fear of death. Doughty's light and breezy tone, a little bit of wackiness, and her humor saved the book from being depressing, but she's adamant about the need for families to honor their dead in a way that is meaningful for them. Ultimately, reading this book made me examine my own feelings about the subject and to hopefully plan accordingly."
42,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2183291-erin-lee,5,"It's kind of weird that in our culture, we'll talk endlessly about what might or might not happen to our souls after we die, but it's considered morbid or impolite to discuss what happens to our bodies when we die. If you're concerned about where your trash goes, or whether or not you can recycle that plastic salad container, maybe spare a thought or two to how you want your body disposed of when you're done with it. I saw the author speak at a panel at a library conference, and I knew her book would be for me. I'm glad someone's working as hard as she is to remove the stigma from death as a conversation topic and empowering people to engage with the dying process in a healthy way. This book is informative, thought-provoking, and an enjoyable read. Lots of good stuff in here about cultural rituals surrounding death, and corrections to the misinformation out there about bodies. "
43,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70492479-mara,5,"4.5 stars - this is an exemplary vocational memoir that incorporates interesting, more traditional non-fiction type passages that teach you about the author's industry (in this case, what it's like being a mortician on a day to day basis) alongside genuine personal insight. Not for the squeamish, but I absolutely loved this. Ask A Mortician was a really important series for me in processing my father's illness, and now that I'm about 6 months out from his passing, this was the right book to reflect on his actual death. Highly recommended"
44,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20608600-laura,4,"Societally, death simultaneously intrigues and terrifies us; it is an ever present aspect in our lives and perhaps the one certainty we can all expect to encounter. This is an interesting, sensitively written account of how a young woman in her twenties finds herself caring for the dead whilst working within the walls of a Californian crematorium. The author writes with a hefty dose of dark humour (really, is there any other kind suitable in this line of work?) but still maintains her compassion for the dead and their families. Although she poses little thought into the afterlife (if any), she considers the religious and cultural implications of death and the dying process. On a personal note, in my working life as a nurse, I have had my fair share of encounters with death. However, the journey ends for me when I have sufficiently cared for the patient and their relatives and transferred the deceased to the hospital mortuary. It was fascinating to get a glimpse of what happens next.Some of the book makes for uncomfortable reading, particularly descriptions of dead children and the decaying process. Some readers may wish to approach with caution.Above all perhaps the greatest lesson the reader takes from this book is the importance of communicating wishes with loved ones. The author suggests this doesn't have to be a morbid process, but rather an informative one. With millions of people dying everyday, it is the least we can do to prevent unnecessary worry once we have passed. "

Oh, my adventurous life!I never got bored reading this and read it straight through (I usually take a week or more getting through most non-fiction / biographies). There may have been some gory and graphic details, but overall I found it a very easy and educational read. I'll be wandering into more far corners! "
46,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,3,"This book provides a thorough description of bodily death and decomposition. Death is part of life. But it has been mostly hidden from our lives by modern western culture. So the material from this book is bitter medicine for most readers unaccustomed to these details. It's an unpleasant subject, but the reader is wiser for having read it.The book is structured around the author's memoir of her several years working in the funeral business (i.e. body disposal business). This experience included time working in a crematory, attending mortuary school, and then post-school employment as a body transporter and funeral arrangements planner. Her story includes an episode in which she considered the option of suicide.I understand the author's comments about modern embalming practices to be generally negative. Though she's not overly preachy about anything. She simply tells it like it is, and when it's all said and done a quick unembalmed bury or cremation sure sounds preferable--at least more natural.It's hard to think of any aspect of death and decomposition that's not fully explored by this book. It's a book I would never read on my own initiative. However, this book was selected by a book group I sometimes attend, and I figured the book's gruesome message probably will keep the number of attendees low. So I believe it my duty to up the body count. (pun intended)"
47,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6450088-tania,3,"Death drives every creative and destructive impulse we have as human beings. The closer we come to understanding it, the closer we come to understanding ourselves.I struggled with this book. It was very interesting and I especially found the idea that most of us are not in touch with our mortality and that we try and avoid death and everything related to it at all cost thought-provoking. On the down side I couldn't figure out if it was supposed to be a memoir or not, and it felt a bit like the book was all over the show - telling you a bit about this, then jumping to something else etc. I do however admire her absolute passion! If all of us puts this much energy into our interests, the world would be a very different place."

It's one of those books I want to hand to everyone and truly think everyone should read it, especially if you have a fear of death, but even if you think you don't. Our society's relationship to death isn't healthy or helpful. And this book does have humor along the way. I can't state how important I believe this book is.

I highly recommend this book of social science, though, fair warning, it isn't for the faint of heart. There's so much to learn and take into consideration. By the way, Svengoolie even gets a mention (!) in the final chapter as a suggestion for the author's web series to be paired up with a classic horror movie. I like her series as it is, but to be honest I'd totally watch her in a show like that!

If there is no index, the book will probably be too generic at best and a memoir (which future Joanna will remember she finds completely uninteresting) at worst. This was both of those things. I found one thing interesting: the name of an Albuquerque artist who occasionally uses corpse parts in his art (so awesome), so I'm grateful for that. But it is too generic, with a sort of bloggy tone that would be better suited for well, a blog, where a cheerful conversational tone actually might facilitate, well, a conversation. Or one of those internet-comment-rage-arguments, haha. Will goodreads provide?I found myself wanting to argue with her pretty often, actually. Like... the book felt like talking points strung together without much reason. Like, random fact-dropping. Like they were mentioned more like cultural shibboleths than to add heft and consistency to her arguments. Like... hating on Disney and Thomas Kincaid, hating on pressuring grieving families to buy expensive coffins but like... I felt some pressure from her to opt for a green funeral or whatever she's finds acceptable. Families washing bodies and covering them with flowers and burying them in a nature, I guess. Yeah, I know! as if she's figured out what the ritual should be for American death, when she doesn't take other people's opinions and desires into consideration, not when it doesn't line up with hers. What's wrong with ordering a cremation online and getting the ashes mailed to you? Different strokes and all that. Seems like to explain her beliefs she basically goes, ""Well it just doesn't seem right to me, and look what other cultures do!"" as if that was convincing, when she barely passes a superficial level of engagement with the topic of death and death rituals. Whatever, I'm so hardcore donate my body to science for facelifts (something I had already known was something that possibly happened to donated bodies for years. we must have read the same book). Oh! and hoping that her fellow mortuary students don't say, ""I just really want to help people"" (because, how laaaame, right?) but like, isn't that basically what she wants to do and has been writing about for the entire book? Yeah, and uh going to mortuary school and enjoying the privileges and education that provides but only to like, take it down from the inside, maaaaaan, she's not square! Oh, and feeling sorry for herself after a man she liked left her (which is totally valid) but like, writing a paragraph as if her feelings of entitlement to his person was something that society made her feel? Because Disney princesses get princes? And that fucked her up enough to contemplate suicide? Um. TBH I don't really understand what she wants. And... I really, really don't care.

Smoke Gets In Your Eyes: And Other Lessons from the Crematory brings us on a journey to the Crematory and delves into the wonders of the death industry, specifically in America. We are graced with vivid imagery of what happens to a body when in a crematory oven, embalming process and desairology. Caitlin Doughty takes a humourous and a light take on a rather dark subject. It has the perfect balance of anecdotes and facts about the death industry. Sure, it is definitely morbid and anyone that feels queasy at the thought of peeling skin, cut-off heads and overflowing human fats may want to steer clear of this book. ThoughtsHonestly, I went into this book with an open mind and was rather interested in the topic of death. I came out of it uninterested. I blame it on myself and my own preferences but I felt like her writing was not it for me. It felt immature. In my opinion, she tries to include too many things and thus, the downfall of her book for me. It felt like a light-hearted memoir at times, then it was trying to bring up a serious conversation and a look inside America's death industry, then it suddenly has some romance that weaves its way through? I understand it is a memoir and she can talk about whatever she wants but some parts just felt off to me. Her humour felt forced to me, which is ironic because that is what most people praise this book for, taking a quirky take on something that is so heavy. I don't know, I really think it is just my reading preference but nonetheless I did enjoy parts of the book but I was just disappointed."
56,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17595751-aphrodite,3,"very interesting read about the american funeral services and the death industry. it was humorous and informative. my favorite part was the pieces of historical death practices across cultures she was able to implement into the memoir. overall, I enjoyed my listening experience but at the end of the day it’s still a nonfiction that isn’t my preferred genre (on a memoir-nonfic scale I would highly recommend if it interests you) "
57,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3414960-traci,4,"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes: And Other Lessons from the Crematory was a quick and very interesting read. I suppose I was initially drawn to it due to my recent fascination with death-related books (including Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End, Mortality, Ordinary Medicine: Extraordinary Treatments, Longer Lives, and Where to Draw the Line, and Inside the Obriens). While the subject of the book was serious, the author, Caitlin Doughty, managed to make it humorous at the same time. Doughty details her work in the American funeral industry over a period of 6 years, beginning with her very first job in a crematory in her early twenties, and continuing through mortuary school and subsequent jobs in the funeral business. Her ultimate goal is to enlighten people about all of their options, rather than just relying on what has become the socially acceptable norm of embalming and traditional burial or cremation. In the final chapter, Doughty also examines what she calls ""the good death."" She states:  The good death means dying while I still have my mind sharp and aware; it also means dying without having to endure large amounts of suffering and pain. The good death means accepting death as inevitable, and not fighting it when the time comes.She goes on to state: We do not (and will not) have the resources to properly care for our increasing elderly population, yet we insist on medical intervention to keep them alive. To allow them to die would signal the failure of our supposedly infallible modern medical system.If you are at all squeamish about bodily functions, or what happens to bodies after death, this probably wouldn't be the book for you! However, if you want a realistic portrayal of death and the death industry (funerals, embalming, cremation, and other alternatives), as well as thoughtful insights as to how the process could be improved, then I would highly recommend. It may sound depressing and morbid, but I think that especially due to an aging society, books such as this are much needed. At some point, I continue to be hopeful that at some point, there will be much more emphasis on quality of life rather than simply quantity."
58,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1607230-shelleyrae-at-book-d-out,5,"I've already informed my family that when I die I want what is left of my body (I'm a registered organ donor) to be delivered directly to the crematorium - there is to be no coffin, no viewing, no funeral service, and afterwards they are welcome to do whatever they like with my ashes, whether that be keep them, scatter them or inter them in a wall. To me this seem practical, and is as much thought as I have given to the inevitably of my death. Few people like to dwell on the fate of their 'mortal coil', but Caitlin Doughty has always had a morbid fascination with death, reinforced when, as a child, she witnessed a toddler plunge three stories to her death in a shopping mall. At twenty three, with a degree in Medieval Studies, she secured a job as a crematory operator at Westwind Cremation and Burial, confronting her curiousity and concerns head on.In Smoke Gets in Your Eyes Doughty blends the tales of her experiences at Westwind, and later as a licensed mortician, with a brief historical and cultural overview of death rituals, and her philosophical musings. She feels strongly that modern day western society is too removed from the processes of death and is an advocate for 'death awareness' - working to redefine culture’s relationship to mortality, grief, and death customs. To this end she co founded The Order of the Good Death and hosts a YouTube series called Ask a Mortician, and the thrust of this book asks the reader to consider their end of life choices, before it is too late.I applaud Doughty for attempting to engage the interest of a squeamish mainstream. Written with humour, respect and real passion for her subject, Smoke Gets In Your Eyes is an informative and thought provoking read.""Death drives every creative and destructive impulse we have as human beings. The closer we come to understanding it, the closer we come to understanding ourselves."""
59,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2360940-evan,4,"I had been an avid reader of Doughty's ""Ask a Mortician"" series on Jezebel when one of my students told me she wanted to be a mortician. ""I've got just the person to read,"" I had replied, sending her to Jez. Then, via the Twitter feed, I learned that a book was forthcoming. To be honest (with myself, since no one else reads my reviews), I had some misgivings about reading this book, but I'm glad I did. The first time I read the phrase ""death denial"" in an ""Ask..."" blog post, I was basically convinced that Doughty's basic thesis is bang-on accurate. Our culture (twenty and twenty-first century America) does not deal rationally with death, any more than it (irrationally) deals with life. Though these times of economic and political difficulty have sparked at least some conversation about inequality and living well (sustainably, happily, peacefully, whatever), it seems like a frank stare at death should go hand in hand with our cultural soul-searching.That said, at the age of 28, I am no more ready or willing to actually die than I was yesterday before I began the book. In fact, the friend who introduced me to Goodreads five years ago died suddenly at the YMCA on an exercise bike, attempting to stave off that exact heart attack through a vigorous life of cheer and god health. His account is still extant, and it crosses my screen from time to time. After this read, I'm reminded now to plan carefully, speak deliberately, live purposely, and be thankful for the people who surround me. When the day inevitably comes, hopefully I won't cost too much or traumatize my survivors, and for that, I have this book to thank."

“Accepting death doesn't mean you won't be devastated when someone you love dies. It means you will be able to focus on your grief, unburdened by bigger existential questions like, ""Why do people die?"" and ""Why is this happening to me?"" Death isn't happening to you. Death is happening to us all.”
 ― Caitlin Doughty, Smoke Gets in Your Eyes: And Other Lessons from the CrematoryYou know what, as someone who has spent most of her young life fearing the inevitability that is death, I needed this book. The way that Caitlin discussed the North American culture surrounding dying and outlines what happens to a body after it is picked up by the morticians is oddly comforting. I think western society spends so much time attempting to push death and unpleasantness away that we end up doing more harm than good, and it is refreshing to have organizations like the Order of the Good Death working to change public perception and reminding people that like birth, death is an inevitable and natural part of being a living organism. I will almost certainly listen to this book again in the future."
61,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish,4,"Caitlin Doughty helped me. At first, I don’t mind saying, she repulsed me with her (what I thought initially) childish and macabre sense of humor. What happened over the course of reading this book is that I became informed--reminded and informed--about the ""responsible exposure to decomposition"" which we as a culture are so good at hiding, denying, refusing. If I never completely relaxed, I think that is quite normal. But she really earned her $24.95 for the price of the book. That’s a lot of teaching going on. I don’t want to be responsible for the shock readers might feel who stumbled onto this review by accident. This book is about the crematory industry and death. It is useful, but if that is not what you came for, don’t read this book nor this review.(view spoiler)[Caitlin Doughty reminds me of the little minx Lauren Ambrose that played in the TV serial Six Feet Under. They look nothing alike. It is a personality thing…and the subject matter, of course. I thought I would just skim this because I was having difficulty entering into the humor of this book, but I found myself learning things…slowing down…nodding my head…reading aloud to family…and laughing, against my will, at some of the scenes Doughty conjured in my head. Doughty makes an awful lot of sense. She is a licensed mortician, youngish. She worked in a crematory at the beginning of her career, after obtaining a degree in Medieval Studies. She’d done her thesis on medieval witches accused of roasting dead infants and grinding their bones. ""A year later I found myself literally roasting dead infants and grinding their bones….[those witches] were burned alive at the stake. I, on the other hand, …was thanked by the poor parents for my care and concern. Things change."" See what I mean about her sense of humor?Anyway, what I learned was extremely useful. She relates the story of a woman who said that her mother died ""unexpectedly"" after hospice care for six months. Doughty didn’t buy it:""When a young person dies unexpectedly, the family will likely face what [Jessica] Mitford called the 'necessity of buying a product of which they are totally ignorant.' The sudden death of a young person is a horrible tragedy. In their sorrow the family should not have to worry that a funeral home would take advantage and upsell them to a more expensive casket or funeral-service package. But anyone who works in the death industry can readily tell you that a slim minority of cases involves the sudden death of a young person. Most deaths come after long, significant diseases or very lengthy lives…why [someone would] not look up the best funeral homes in the area, compare prices, ask friends and family, figure out what’s legal, or most important, talk to her mother about what she herself wanted when she died? …Refusing to talk about it and then calling it 'unexpected' is not an acceptable excuse."" Doughty does the work of sharing the history of the business of funeral homes with us: How it developed into a huge industry in the United States as opposed to cremation, and how Jessica Mitford—yes, that Jessica Mitford—almost single-handedly turned public opinion around with her book, The American Way of Death, published in 1963, the same year Pope Pius VI overturned the ban on cremation for Catholics.Cremation is still the lesser-used option, but there is a movement afoot now to take back the business of dying with home wakes and 'natural burials' in bucolic settings. Doughty does address the latter option, saying that she’s decided on a natural burial for herself. ""Not only is a natural burial by far the most ecologically sound way to perish, it doubles down on the fear of fragmentation and loss of control. Making the choice to be naturally buried says, 'Not only am I aware that I’m a helpless, fragmented mass of organic matter, I celebrate it. Vive la decay!'"" A website she doesn’t mention gives the range of options for those who want a modicum of control, from home wakes to natural burial: WBUR Radio piece with links. After hearing Doughty’s stories and watching some of her YouTube video series, and knowing that she hints at times to prefer being torn apart by buzzards on a hilltop in Tibet rather than be cremated, one just has to think…about death: what it is and how it affects us.Doughty may be irreverent, but she’s earned it. She earns our forgiveness with her admission: ""Everything I was learning at Westwind I wanted to shout from the rooftops. The daily reminders of death cast each day in more vivid tones…my work at Westwind had given me access to emotions I didn’t know I was capable of. I would start laughing or crying at the drop of a damn hat…[my] emotional range was blasted apart, allowing for ecstasy and despair like I had never experienced…I went from thinking it was strange that we don’t see any dead bodies anymore to believe their absence was the root cause of major problems in the modern world. Corpses keep the living tethered to reality."" Doughty quotes the social critic Camille Paglia: ""Human beings are not nature’s favorites. We are merely one of a multitude of species upon which nature indiscriminately exerts its force.""Irresistibly, Doughty shares the original Hans Christian Anderson story of ""The Little Mermaid,"" to go with her vignette about growing up in Hawai’i. Kids’ story ""The Little Mermaid"" is not, despite Disney’s re-creation of the fable in film, and adults reading it in 1836 when it was published would learn not to complain about their lot in life because things could be a whole lot worse.She tells us about the wide menacing smile of a skull. ""It was unnerving to think this same deranged grin lurks just beneath the flesh of everyone’s face, the frowning, the crying, even the dying."" And she tells us that ""Buddhist monks hoping to detach themselves from lust and curb their desire for permanence would meditate on the form of a rotting corpse.""Yes, she can be gruesome, but what she managed to do is keep my skittering mind focused on the issue of death for a couple hours, for a day. Who wants to think about this? Nobody. But it is a truth, and frankly, like Doughty, I would always have preferred to have been initiated into the secrets of reality than told as a child that there really is “a happy ending.” It keeps things real, and it keeps us focused, and it keeps us striving. Because, darn it, the scythe is at the door.  (hide spoiler)]"

You can’t read this book without thinking about our culture's unhelpful attitudes about death and dying, and your own mortality — but definitely not in a morbid manner. Reading this book is like spending many pleasant hours with a smart, quick-witted friend. Thank you, Grace. You were 100% right."

For those of ye who are new to me log, a word: though this log’s focus is on sci-fi, fantasy, and young adult, this Captain does have broader reading tastes. Occasionally, I will share some novels that I enjoyed that are off the charts (a non sci-fi, fantasy, or young adult novel), as it were. So today I bring ye:smoke gets in your eyes: and other lessons from the crematorium (Caitlin Doughty)Death. Decay. Ashes. Topics that don't naturally bring light-hearted fuzzy feelings to the masses. In fact, most folks avoid the topic whenever possible. In America, in particular, many people seem to think that if ye talk about death then Death may hear those thoughts and come knocking. It is a topic that many people avoid altogether. I wouldn't be surprised if some of me crew skipped this post after readin' the full title of the book.Seriously though, dealing with death is important. I genuinely believe that end of life should be discussed early and planned for as best one can. And then those discussions and plans should be updated as one's life progresses. I worked as a paralegal for a time. It is not easy having to go into a hospital in someone's final days and try to get paperwork together. Or worse yet when there is nothing in place and grieving and planning take place concurrently. Also I feel strongly that a person has a right to have their wishes followed in regards to end of life. Imagine being witness to fighting over whether the plug should be pulled or if there should be a burial or cremation. These experiences have led me to be more open to talking about death and planning.Naturally, I don't know much about the practice of dying. The first book I read to gain more insight was called stiff by Mary Roach. This dealt with the science of death and discussed what happens to cadavers when we die. It was both eye-opening and even funny in parts (while still being respectful overall). I highly recommend it.So then I picked up this book to learn more about the crematorium. This book is also funny in parts and very detailed. And gross. That cannot be escaped. But the information was fascinating and detailed. The author is passionate about her subject and her commentary was thought-provoking. I loved getting more insight into this billion dollar industry and seeing some of the ""tricks of the trade."" I will be reading her newest book for sure.Ultimately these two books have opened dialogues about death culture and led to further examinations about me own thoughts about me personal end of life wishes and care. I highly recommend them to me crew. Also if me readers know of any other interesting books on the subject, please share below.Side note: Everyone, regardless of age, should have a written Will and advanced medical directive! The laws vary by state and it is really best to use a lawyer who practices estate and/or elder law.

65,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1130517-ingrid,5,"[Full Disclosure: The author and I are best friends and plan to be in each other's weddings (I'm assuming) because one time I sent her an email and she replied personally!]I was going to start off by warning you that this book is not for the squeamish-at-heart but then I realized that, since Doughty's whole mission is to convince us that we need to conquer this societal squeamishness surrounding death and decay, it's really all you wimps who need to read it most. It's no big secret that America is in death denial. When was the last time any of us saw a dead body, much less a corpse that hasn't been given a major makeover with embalming fluids, eyeball spikes (EYEBALL SPIKES!), and stage makeup? Other cultures, and in fact our own culture up until the last century or so, tend to approach death more honestly, with rituals that provide true closure. They wash the bodies, dress the bodies, keep the body in their homes -- even in some case consume the bodies.Doughty is not encouraging us to eat our deceased here, but she does urge us to break from the mainstream funeral industry and try for what she terms a ""Good Death"": one that we have prepared for well in advance, having been honest and direct about the fact that, yes, it's comin' for us. It's going to happen, so don't be caught unawares like the woman Doughty writes about in one anecdote who, while signing the cremation papers, cried, ""It just came out of the blue! Mom had only been in hospice care for 6 months!"" What exactly Doughty wants us to do to participate in this death revolution is a little vague, but I gave this 5 stars anyways because I feel like the topic is so important, and so often ignored. We are afraid of death and our natural inclination is to ignore it, frantically filling our lives with love and sex and art in an attempt to forget about it or cheat it, but this approach only hurts us. Thinking about death prepares us for it, and it frees us to live more fully while we are still living, and it helps us process our mourning in a healthier way. Read more about Doughty's mission by Googling ""The Order of the Good Death"" or watching some of her hilarious webseries, ""Ask a Mortician.""I highly recommend this one, and not just because Doughty and I are like *this.* [A real disclaimer, despite the fact that we are all completely okay with death now and revel in decay: Don't necessarily read this book while you're eating oatmeal, as I did, because Doughty does not believe in mincing words. If she's retelling an incident in which a corpse showed up at her crematorium with green mold and its skin falling off and an eyeball popped out, she'll describe it in stomach-turning detail. Did you know some of us will turn ORANGE when we die?!] "
66,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3932962-barbara-the-bibliophage,4,"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes & Other Lessons from the Crematory is an examination of death and the so-called death industry from Caitlin Doughty. By death industry she means how funeral homes, mortuaries, crematories, medical facilities and government agencies like coroners handle death.It’s also a memoir, because she sought out a career in the industry. In the process, she also became a compassionate advocate for a death experience that’s quite different from what we Americans consider to be typical. She’s a bit of a rebel!So, you need to be okay with some gritty truths if you pick up this book. Doughty discusses what it’s like—in detail—to be a crematory technician. After a mostly typical childhood and an undergrad degree in medieval history, she sought out this job. She wanted to understand more about death and how it’s both treated emotionally and handled practically.And learn she did. How is a body prepared for cremation? What kind of options are available to families making this choice? Doughty exposes the false legends, such as timing of decomposition. And also discusses what she calls “the good death,” which is more a conversation about the emotional aspects of death. In the process, she explains the evolution and history of the death industry in the United States and, to some extent, in Western Europe.My conclusionsSmoke Gets in Your Eyes is alternately fascinating, funny, and thought provoking. I’m planning to read her second book without much delay. Doughty has an engaging writing style and isn’t afraid to tell hard truths. I listened to her narration of the audiobook. I’m not typically a fan of author narration, but she does a bang up job.If your life hasn’t been touched by death recently, this might be good preparation for the time when it will. For me, it was the opposite. I’m wishing I’d read this earlier. Because in the last five years, twelve people in our extended family have died. We were closer to some than others. Out of all of those, I could only have implemented Doughty’s advice for the one death. But I think I would have. And I’ll remember her words for the future.Grab up this book if you want a frank discussion of the decisions family members must make when a loved one dies. Or if you’d like some history about how funeral and mortuary services evolved in America. It’s a plus if you’ve been told you have a morbid sense of humor.You'll find more reviews of books like this in the Learn section of my book blog, TheBibliophage.com."

And if you are afraid, perhaps even more importantly, this book is for you.The author has always been interested in death, not necessarily making her the most popular kid on the school playground. So it was only natural that she got a job in a crematory, and she shares her experiences with anyone willing to read about them.Sure, some of this book may seem ghoulish. The author pulls no punches in describing bodies in various states of decay, funeral preparation practices, some of the secrets of the funereal business.Still, she does it with great respect and insight. I never felt that she was writing this book to titillate her readers. She has a mission. She wants to replace the overly sanitized American way of dealing with corpses with a more natural, less fearful way. She wants people to be able to accept that death happens to all of us, not in some morbid obsession, but as a natural progression of life. And she makes her points beautifully.She even writes about suicide. She is amazingly nonjudgmental, even about suicide, but is judgmental about the way some choose to commit suicide.There is quite a bit of information about rituals around the world and ages, and the reasons for those rituals. There is some small humor, but not at the expense of the bodies she cares for. And there is lots of information about cremation and embalming, little details that most of us don't know and some of us would rather not find out.The writing is solid, concise, not flowery or euphemistic. Not terribly long ago, I read a memoir about a young woman who worked in a mortuary: Nine Years Under. And I really disliked that book. The humor was too often cruel, the young woman was flippant, disrespectful, and showed a lack of compassion. It left a bad taste in my mouthThis book is everything that one was not, and I am very glad I've read it.I was given an advance readers copy of this book for review, so the quote may have changed in the published edition."
68,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/286958-loren,4,"If you like Ask a Mortician, you will appreciate the humor and empathy of Doughty's memoir of how she became one of the most vocal proponents of taking control of your loved ones' bodies after they stop using them. Her story is a work in progress. She starts with an accidental death she witnessed while a child that terrified her for years, then talks about the funerals she attended growing up. She covers every aspect of working at a crematory -- collecting bodies from homes and hospitals, cremating premature babies, family send-offs -- amused at her own horror and discomfort as she tries to find her place at the end of these lives. She faces down suicidal thoughts and handles the arrangements for her own family members, enrolls in mortuary school, and arrives at the end of the book more certain than ever that our culture must change to be more hands-on with death.The reason I'm deducting a star is because Caitlin doesn't really offer a solution. She would like to open a mortuary in LA where families could wash and dress and care for their own dead, but the business doesn't exist yet -- and she may have made too good a case for why it isn't necessary for families to turn to professionals in the end times. The lack of resolution doesn't invalidate her arguments, but it does sort of leaving everything hanging.I recommend the book, particularly if you haven't yet read much in the modern death library. It's a great place to start the conversation about death."
69,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21372390-wayne-barrett,4,"Interesting and humorous piece. Most of the humor happens in the beginning when she is stumbling through her first experiences working in a mortuary. I would say she is also stumbling through her own questions of life and death and in the beginning could be a little light-hearted about it, but as her experience in the industry grows and her grasp of her own mortality grows, the humor slips away and we find her in a much more serious state of mind. I knew many of the facts she introduced here, unfortunately because I have had to go through it, but there is still a lot of very detailed info contained here that might give many readers a reason to rethink their plans. Or in the case of many who don't want to think of it, period, a dose of reality that zero percent of us will be able to avoid. And that is: we all gonna die. I have learned through personal experience that even if you are not cremated, you are not required to be embalmed. The only stipulation is that if you are not embalmed they will not allow an open casket. I do know that I will not be embalmed, and even though I have nothing against cremation, I would like a natural burial, if possible. I shouldn't have to give this warning, because, after all, this book is about mortuaries and dead people, but I will warn the reader anyway; there are some graphic, horrid details within these pages. If you can handle it, this is a very good read. "
70,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5899019-ashley-h,1,"Good stories, but author is insufferable as a writer, and probably as a person as well. Tries very hard to be funny and is very much so not. On one page she insists we need to make our death wishes clear, and on the next then discusses how her family kept her brain damaged grandmother alive for 4 years, even though the grandmother had said ""don't let me ever get like that"" - thus acting counter to her wishes Then, the kicker - author goes on about how we as a society need to take more ownership over death, be more involved, have home funerals, etc., which I agree with. But she also points out the rapidly riding aging population, who often end up in nursing homes with sub par care. Does the author also think we should care for our aging relatives at home? Apparently not. Her grandmother was put in a home and then I had read about the author's guilt over how she didn't insist the family keep the body at home until it was cremated. So apparently we need to take more ownership of the dead, but the elderly still belong in nursing homes - classy. Maybe that's because it's a lot easy to pay attention to a dead relative for a few days rather than provide loving care for years. It's also not as hip and cool, I get it, but you're still a hypocrite. "
71,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22435546-julie,4,"I have always had a bit of morbid curiosity in me. So when I discovered this book I knew that I had to pick it up. I must say, I was not disappointed. Caitlyn's writing was so easy to read and connect with, that I found that I had a hard time putting this book down once I picked it up. She really makes you take a long hard look at a pretty hard to talk about subject. How we deal with death and how we care for our deceased. How our cultures practices compare to other cultures and how disconnected we have come from this aspect of life. She takes this very heavy subject matter and makes it easily digestible as well as putting in some comedic relief. It's been a while since I have read a book that made me feel such a wide range of emotions. I teared up in parts and literally laughed out loud at many others. I REALLY enjoyed this book, and it gave me so much to think about. I am no stranger to death...having worked as a geriatric/hospice nurse for a few years now. But I must say this made me think about things differently and I now have so many more questions and things to contemplate. This will for sure be a book that sticks with me, and I would HIGHLY recommend it!"
72,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35924884-kaila,5,"4.5/5 starsThis was truly wonderful. Not only was it the most informative book I’ve ever read, it also had me cracking up. The writing was just so damn witty and quirky, I was addicted to every word. I also learnt so much about the death industry that I would have never have known about if I hadn’t picked up this book. This memoir was the perfect mix between enlightening, interesting anecdotes and snippets into the life of someone who works in the funeral industry. I loved this book so damn much and have fallen in love with Caitlin Doughty’s voice. Before reading this book I didn’t know she had a YouTube channel but now, I have binged so many of her videos. I know a book that goes into the gritty and morbid details about cremation, embalming and the like isn’t for everyone, but it is definitely for me. The author has made me so interested about a topic and industry that I never thought I would be interested about and has made me ask myself so many questions. I will read absolutely everything this author writes. I will reiterate, this book is fantastic and I recommend it to everyone, even those who are wary about the subject matter."
73,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,4,"I first encountered Caitlin Doughty on her YouTube channel, Ask a Mortician. She really is a mortician and has a passion for all things death related. She seems compassionate and dedicated to her job, but does not let it shadow or dim down the fact that death does not have to be a grim, horrible experience. This book is about her beginnings in the death industry, as a crematorium operator in the US. Her writing style is subliminally (and sometimes outright) funny, which I'm guessing is necessary in order for her to cope with her job, but she offers plenty of information about the practices of cremation, embalming, funeral displaying and so on. More than anything, she points out that a result of the modern era is that the Western society is completely detached from death, both the process of dying and what happens after it. This she considers detrimental, and I tend to agree with her - the sanitization of our lives means we are severely uncomfortable at the notion of a dead body. All in all, I totally recommend this read for those interested in the subject."

We need to move past the hiding of death to something, maybe no less painful, but more respectful.   *Further words of reflection may follow* "
75,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4737997-ace,1,the callousness in which doughty writes about many aspects of her job is a poor reflection upon the death care industry and the individuals who serve families honestly and carefully.

Frankly, the thumbnail looked like click-bait so I avoided it for weeks. But, up it would pop again, and again, and again. When one appeared with the title “The Lake That Never Gives Up Her Dead” I finally clicked and was astonished to find an informative, very non sensationalized, and entertaining video that I was so impressed by, I then consumed the “Ask a Mortician” channel for weeks. Now, instead of wondering why YouTube recommended the channel, I wondered why did it only recommend it to me NOW? Because the channel’s creator, a mortician and funeral home owner, Caitlin Doughty, has been making videos for SEVEN years and written three books on death.So, upon realizing Doughty was a published author, I rushed to Scribd and was incredibly happy to find that all three of her books were available as audiobooks presented by Caitlin herself. “Smoke Gets In Your Eyes: And Other Lessons From the Crematory” is Doughty’s first book and gives us the story of her real-life journey into the death industry, how she evolved over time, and turned her fears of death into death acceptance and death rites (and rights) advocacy.Doughty seemingly does the impossible. She takes one of the most somber topics and makes it fun and informative. Where it would be easy to sensationalize death and come across as tacky, she does the opposite. Doughty makes death accessible, pulling back the curtain on the industry and the death process itself. But, while doing so, she somehow makes death comfortable and common; something easy to have a conversation about. And, adding to it, she’s entertaining and brings a certain amount of gallows humor that I’m completely charmed by. Caitlin is an educator and true storyteller, one that makes every chapter poignant yet entertaining.As someone who is pretty squeamish and runs from all things death, I can’t recommend this book or Caitlin Doughty’s YouTube channel enough. Especially at these times, when death is very much in our faces, it is an exceptional remedy to soothe anxieties and help us formulate plans while giving us a chuckle."

For me, the narrative is a lot like when you go on vacation and all this ridiculous shit happens (I don’t want to hear about your perfect vacation. The vacation from hell is way more interesting). This book is what it is BECAUSE it highlights a less than glamorous job, and what happens when things go wrong at that kind of job. But I also think the best part is the way Doughty explores different cultural traditions for how we bury our dead. What caused us to go from taking pictures of the deceased (Victorian era) to purchasing an Internet cremation (present day)? Death is so unpleasant, of course we want to hide it, but it’s also interesting to think about the fact that our current “traditions” may not be traditions at all, and it wasn’t so long ago that death was a part of everyday life for many people (in some parts of the world it still is).My least favorite parts about this book were the author’s anecdotes about her personal life. The point at which she decides to go into some redwood trees to die seemed misplaced, or didn’t answer the questions for me as to why she wanted to die? I’m not sure how to describe it. The vague way that she wrote about it without having exhibited any thoughts of suicide leading up to (or after) just left me feeling confused and worried for her. Likewise, when she writes her letter to Luke describing her feelings for him and he’s basically like “k, bye” that was it? They just never talked again? It didn’t change anything about the way she interacted with others or trusted them with her thoughts? There were many parts where I felt I was left hanging and I just wish the focus on what she was trying to convey had been more clear.Anyway, I definitely don’t want to work in a crematory, but it was interesting to find out what goes on in there.See more of my reviews: Blog // Instagram"

80,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3191101-j,2,"Gritty in the wrong ways. I’m not squeamish about death but I find the author’s lifestyle and perspectives unpleasant. I know several people in the funeral home business and they are all relatively normal - unlike this author. She is an educated woman who moves in with a lesbian roommate in a seedy part of San Francisco and enters mortuary work for the fun of it. She also pointedly mentions her steel toed shoes just to complete the picture.She is gleeful at the idea of encountering a ""real"" dead body and doesn’t have normal human reactions to death and dying. She doesn’t seem particularly compassionate to the living or respectful of the dead. She seems to be involved in cremation for her own personal pleasure, rather than because it is an important service for others. She is not someone I would want handling a loved one.The author’s perspective is also questionable. She seems to want her life to be edgy and alternative and paints it that way - even when it is not. For example, she casually mentions that her “lesbian” roommate is heartbroken over a man. Similarly, she seems to over sensualize the grittiness of death and cremation. Most folks in the field usually report that they just get use to it after a while; but they are still more respectful toward the dead than this author!The author clearly sees herself as an intellectual (versus an old-fashioned creep or psychopath) but the writing doesn’t reflect that. The writing was easy enough to read, but not particularly witty or intellectual. She also occasionally swears in the text - a real sign of literary genius.This was sold to me as a collection of short stories about working in a funeral home. There are chapters which relate to certain ideas or thoughts, but not true short stories with independent plots."

82,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12652967-leanne-beauty-the-book-dragon,4,"Non-fiction about our mortality with death. We're obsessed with everything surrounding death but when it comes to our actual death or those we are closest with we high tail it out if there, avoid and refuse to accept it all happens eventually to us all. This is taken from the POV of a Mortician through her years and experiences in The Death Industry. Her experiences with wanting to bring it all out in the open, no more hiding the bitter truth. No masking it, but bringing facts from various cultures, historical periods and religions throughout the years to show similarities as well teach us that we all have a different view on death. What helps us accept it. What makes us a good or bad person. We're all equal in the end. With it she drops morbid humour. This has been an easier read than I was expecting as someone who doesn't read non-fiction very often unless it's in a topic that interests me. I have thought about going into The Funeral Industry for a couple years now and this opened my mind to how it actually is. Good and bad. For instance I didn't know how embalming was performed or that you have to rake the ashes after performing a cremation to make sure there aren't any bone fragments left/if you do, they have to be ground up. These things I would never have learnt until I went to school for it and questioned whether I wanted to spend countless amounts of money for it, only to realize it wasn't for me. Which thankfully I still am thinking about going into. This is a mind opener, for those who are interested in the Funeral Industry, have a fond love for learning about death or experiencing existential crises on the regular. Which lead to long upscaled debates with family. Science debates are a norm for my family to be honest though. "
83,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/290848-john,4,"I considered giving this one five stars, but honestly felt the last part was ""coasting"" rather than holding my interest. What worked for me is that it was an inside look at the funeral industry from the point-of-view of a staffer, rather than a funeral director. The crematorium machine oprerator position is technically an unskilled, assembly line one; in the last part she refers to a crematorium that runs continuously shoveling 'em in and raking 'em out around the clock. The author was lucky that her place in San Francisco was smaller with character to it. Her colleague who collected the bodies felt he was too boring to be featured in a book, but she made him out to be a really interesting guy; I suspect he may autistic. Her boss lacked people skills, but even before he gave her the first serious compliment, somewhat late in the story, it was clear he valued her. I was truly able to picture the events as described. As a sample, for those who haven't read it yet, she has a dress ruined from being splashed with molten human fat - from a malfunction, NOT a regular occurance!Caitlin doesn't talk about her personal life as much as I was expecting; I found the references to her family back in Hawaii generally quite relevant. However ... very little shocks me, but she managed it once in that regard. I guess I'd say I was disappointed that the best she could do in terms of job offers after mortuary school was as a driver. She blames this on industry sexism, and who am I to judge that call?Bottom line: I found the book well written, interesting and informative (educational). "

I've never even seen a dead body irl. so this book was a curious choice to pick up but I felt like it would be good for me and maybe help me comprehend and accept such a natural part of life.I learned about this title in a podcast with the author and although she was extremely funny and light, I wasn't really expecting it the book to be too. but it was, and so much. the reading experience was just delightful. I laughed out loud so many times, and I never thought I would say this about a book on such a sad topic. but that wasn't just it. the author's experiences and opinions were enlightening and educational. shout out to the mention of one of Portugal's most romantic/sad love stories, D. Pedro and Inês de Castro. I smiled like a fool.I'm still afraid of dying and seeing the ones around me dead but I definitely feel more encouraged to start thinking about death rationally and maybe even accept it.full review here: https://catshelf.wordpress.com/2016/0..."
85,0393351904,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26652584-cee-cat,5,"I'm a huge fan of Caitlin and her Ask a Mortician videos. While I was reading the advance (thanks Edelweiss) I was hearing it in her voice (like I'm a super fan. Really.) This was just as funny and informative as her videos are. Some of the stories I was already familiar with, and I'm excited for others to read them. (I know some people are apprehensive to google anything remotely related to ""morticians."" To do a youtube search would be insane by some standards.) My friends now know me to be very ""pro-death-acceptance"" and my family has had open discussions about how we would handle a death in the family and what our personal preferences would be. I really recommend this book for everyone. Yay Caitlin! Death acceptance! "

From her start as a 23 year old in a small crematorium and encountering the task of shaving her first corpse to gritting her teeth through mortuary school, what could be a grim read is shot through with humour and warmth. A surprisingly entertaining and informative read."
