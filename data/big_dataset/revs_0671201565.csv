0,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2071664-thomas-freeman,4,"I really enjoyed the explanations given in this book. The author is Einstien but the writing is Infeld. He worked very closely with Einstien.They begin with basic mechanics and work their way through field physics, special and general relativity and then finally to quantum mechanics. All of this is done without mathematic equations. It is all explained through analogies, theories and explanation or real world experiments. It is a very interesting read if for no other reason than to see the development of the theories and how their minds made each transition.I have a personal interest in these areas but no actual education. I really like a book like this that makes it much more understandable to the average Joe.Unfortunately it is dated at this point. There has been many further advancements in both quantum physics and in planetary. They do an excellent job of laying a foundation for further study. This is probably a good book to read before reading Stephen Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time."""

Written in 1938, apparently more by Infeld than by Einstein, it is exceedingly proper and therefore delightful, as well as thorough. It is a beautiful book, very clear and precise, and should be read by all armchair physicists with a serious hankering to understand relativity theory, as well as the importance of the quantum theory. "
2,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16624009-mengsen-zhang,5,"Absolutely awesome! In my mind, this book is more about psychology or cognition rather than physics. I love books whose plots are connected by logic rather than irrelevant story telling. More precisely, this book is about how human ""create"" knowledge and the nature of reality. There is in fact no force, no field, no charge. All we have is motion, along with, at best, the tendency of motion. The ""scientific"" concepts are artificially created to, and only to, classify unrelated events that only make sense to your corner case reference system. It is not knowledge itself but only the form of evolution of knowledge can give us a hit of reality. well..that's just my interpretation..maybe I'm wrong but this is definitely the book you have to read if you're desperate to understand physics or mind..or are they different? :P "
3,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,4,"Einstein-Infeld (an Einstein associate) trace the transition, forced by findings in the late 19th and early 20th century, between classical physics and modern physics that challenged the Newtonian explanation of the world. Newton, the authors state, was not so much replaced as he was incorporated into a higher-level, more encompassing paradigm.In a way, the transition was fueled by Hegelian-like contradictions along several lines. The wave nature of particles (photons, electrons) was at odds with an atomic (hard, substantive, point-like particles) view of matter. Rather than seamless movement, energy was seen (with Planck, then Einstein) to come in discrete chunks of energy, energy packets (quanta), that moved in jump-like fashion from one level to another. Then, with Einstein (1905), matter and energy came to be seen as interconvertible entities. Matter contained energy and energy had a particle (quantum, albeit massless) nature. With the quantum world coming of age, Newton’s easy-to-grasp notions of causality (atoms in motion, hitting each other with straight-line effects) had to be replaced at the quantum level with probabilistic causality. Predictions no longer pertained to individual particles but only held true for some gross collection of particles. From these emergent findings, Einstein and others concluded that the Newtonian model that separated matter and energy (1) had to be replaced with a quantum model that united them. Matter was concentrated energy; energy was extremely diluted matter (to the point of masslessness at the speed of light) per Einstein’s E=MC2 formulation that used the square of the speed of light (pure energy) as the conversion factor (equivalence for matter). (2) At the sub-atomic level, particles convert to energy and vice versa, which explains energy’s dual (particle-wave nature) via quantum jumps, and that all of this took place in a field (a cloud) of interactions rather than in a one-to-one cause-and-effect way. Quantum physics, the authors say, formulates laws of crowds, not individuals. Behavior is not that of bodies but rather it is something that exists between them - “the field.” How this description - this addition to and incorporation of the Newtonian paradigm - relates to Einstein’s relativity theory is not clear to me. It has something to do with the nature (and speed) of light, which is energy void of mass and that lies on the non-mass pole of the energy continuum, and the deductions from this that lead Einstein to conclude that time as well as space cannot have an absolute, fixed standing. And it has something to do with the nature of gravitational mass that attracts lesser bodies. Such masses are also resisted by inertial mass, and the more massive a body is, the more resistance it provides. These countervailing forces are not just mass. That mass is really energy (“add more energy, more mass; more attraction, and more resistance”). It is as if the authors are saying that the relationship between two masses occurs, similar to what happens at the atomic and sub-atomic level, as a (gravitational) field. As at the microlevel where a field operates locally at the speed of light, the exchange between two mass bodies at the macrolevel is mediated by energy operating at the speed of light. (3) And, interestingly, the relative masses plus the square of the distance that affects attraction-resistance seems to almost operate by quantum jumps.Einstein and Infeld’s attempt to unite relativity with the quantum world is focused on the field concept (matter operating as energy). Here, their central idea is rich: “Can we think of matter and field as two distinct and different realities?...Before we learned about the relativity theory we could have tried to answer this question in the following way: matter has mass whereas field has not. Field represents energy, matter represents mass. But we already know that such an answer is insufficient in view of the further knowledge gained. From the relativity theory we know that matter represents vast stores of energy and that energy represents matter.”“From the relativity theory we know that matter represents vast stores of energy and that energy represents matter. We cannot, in this way, distinguish qualitatively between matter and field, since the distinction between mass and energy is not a qualitative one. By far the greatest part of energy is concentrated in matter; but the field surrounding the particle also represents energy, though in an incomparably smaller quantity. We could therefore say: Matter is where the concentration of energy is great, field where the concentration of energy is small. But if this is the case, then the difference between matter and field is a quantitative rather than a qualitative one.”“We cannot build physics on the basis of the matter-concept alone. But the division into matter and field is, after the recognition of the equivalence of mass and energy, something artificial and not clearly defined. Could we not reject the concept of matter and build a pure field physics? What impresses our senses as matter is really a great concentration of energy into a comparatively small space. We could regard matter as the regions in space where the field is extremely strong. In this way a new philosophical background could be created.”If the authors are proposing a “pure field physics,” does their last quote suggest that in one fundamental sense Einstein’s famous energy-mass equivalence formulation is misleading: There are not two basic cosmic substances but one, energy, which comes in many different forms of matter that jump into and out of concentrated form.There are a couple of other large questions that leap out of this book. First, Newton’s laws of motion state that a body moves in a straight line (or remains at rest) unless acted upon (accelerated) by an external force. At the macro level, Einstein has large cosmic masses depressing space-time. Though the discussion of Einstein’s theory often states that he didn’t see gravity as a force (4), this depression of space-time does create movement of matter and masses across the cosmos. Why does a body move in a straight line until it is acted upon, which always seems to be the case with gravitational effects? Answers to this question seem either non-existent or implied. At the subatomic and atomic level, energy radiates outward as light (electro-magentic spectrum). But what about large concentrations of energy, as mass-matter moving through space? Why do they, in theory and before gravitational effects, move in a straight (or, per Newton, “right”) line?Second, Einstein-Leopold’s discussion of the equivalence between gravitational and inertial mass was particularly interesting. Gravity is one of the four forces, but it is touted as an attractive force only (two bodies attract each other) and it is distinctly not a repelling force as is with electro-magnetism. While gravity does not repel, it does via inertial mass, “resist” and, thereby, the notion that all energy-matter interactions involve some form of both attraction and resistance is retained. (5) This in turn leads to the balancing of energy differentials and equilibrium (until upset by external forces, whether self-propelled or other-directed), and equilibrium is, of sorts, “zero.” (6) Zero might be the basic cosmic concept - it is nothing yet it is everything. Or, it might be some sort of idle philosophical speculation: It may be something, or nothing. (7) (1) “Classical physics introduced two substances: matter and energy. The first had weight, but the second was weightless. In classical physics we had two conservation laws: one for matter, the other for energy. We have already asked whether modern physics still holds this view of two substances and the two conservation laws. The answer is: ‘No.’ According to the theory of relativity, there is no essential distinction between mass and energy. Energy has mass and mass represents energy. Instead of two conservation laws we have only one, that of mass-energy.” Interestingly, the authors write, “In its own Newton’s time the concept of energy did not exist.” Newton thought of light as weightless corpuscles and each “color preserved its own substance character. Later, when the concept of energy was created and it was recognized that light carries energy, no one thought of applying these concepts to the corpuscular theory of light. Newton’s theory was dead and, until our own century, its revival was not taken seriously.”(2) In discussing the problem in asserting that mass and energy were equivalent, Einstein and Infeld refer to “the very small rate of exchange between matter and energy. Compared to mass, energy is like a depreciated currency compared to one of high value….Energy was regarded as weightless for so long simply because the mass which it represents is so small.” This statement does, however, raise a question about the masslessness of energy - if energy has weight, however diluted, would it have mass, however diluted? (3) “Maxwell’s equations” pertaining to the electro-magnetic field, Einstein and Infeld write, “connect events which happen here and now with events which will happen a little later in the immediate vicinity. They are the laws describing the changes of the electromagnetic field. Our new gravitational equations are also structure laws describing the changes of the gravitational field.” “The theoretical discovery of an electromagnetic wave spreading with the speed of light,” the authors add, “is one of the greatest achievements in the history of science.” Add the speed of light to field interactions, and the gravitational effects across vast spaces and time can be understood.(4) Einstein-Infeld do say that large bodies show that a “force is directed toward the sun; this means the force is an attraction.” (5) “Gravitational and inertial mass are equal,” the authors state (adding that “this identity of inertial and gravitational mass was fundamental for the formulation of the theory of relativity”). And, “all energy resists changes in motion.” Add more energy, and there is more resistance. But unlike classical physics that saw inertial resistance in terms of mass only, Einstein’s relativity theory has velocity adding to the resistance effect. Velocity adds (kinetic) energy so that a moving body has both mass and kinetic energy and it resists change of velocity more strongly than the resting body, and “the resistance becomes infinitely great as velocity approaches that of light.” The definitional difference between “repel” (drive away, almost like a counter-attack) and “resist” (withstand, or defend), is interesting. Regarding the equivalence between gravitational and accelerating effects, the authors seem to not only describe that there is space contraction and the slowing of time that happens as an object approaches the speed of light but also, unlike other writers, explain physically why this is so: The faster an object moves (accelerates), there is a compression-contraction of an object in the direction of the movement that shortens length and (the “rhythm of a clock keeping) time.(6) Is “Zero” related to the law of conservation? “In a closed system, one isolated from external influences,” energy is conserved. And, “If we regard the whole universe as a closed system we can proudly announce with the physicists of the nineteenth century that the energy of the universe is invariant, that no part of it can ever be created or destroyed.” Cosmic rhythms move energy around (and manifested in different forms), but if the overall amount of energy is the same, there is neither more nor less, which is zero.(7) My favorite quote from this book: “Philosophical generalizations,” the authors write, “must be founded on scientific results.”"
4,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,5,"Einstein has a reputation not only as a physicist, but as a humanitarian. The clarity and style of this book reinforces the reputation.Slowly, carefully and with great concern that the reader not be left behind, Einstein and his co-author tell what could be a bewildering tale by demonstrating how the science of the physical relationship of things evolved.It did so for the reason that all science evolves: questions, in being answered, pose further questions. The pursuit of the unknown, with the necessary condition that it be followed regardless of the danger it poses to accepted thought, takes the mind onward, but at the expense of the familiar.This is THE reason for conflict between science and religion. The former says - I want to know the truth, regardless of the effect on what I believe to be true. The latter says - I know what I believe, it is the truth and I don't need to know more. Science is impatiently looking forward, religion is at rest and content. Science finds mystery intolerable, religion treasures it.Without a single mathematical equation, Einstein presents the established thought about the relationship between things from the time of Galileo up to quantum mechanics at the time the book was written in 1938. He demonstrates why each view of the world was so convincing.It made so much sense early on to think that the world was made up of particles that simply interacted with each other by force. Newton showed that some object would remain motionless unless it was acted on by another, moving object. The apple and the moon worked under the same assumption.All was well but light presented a problem. We know that sound passes by way of pressure through a medium, air, from the source to our ear. Take away air and there is no sound. So how can we see? What is the medium through which light passes to reach our eyes? It was assumed that all of space was filled with ""ether"" through which light, like sound in air, passed.Science, while loving to find a mystery, hates it's persistence, so the presence of ether was something that demanded experiments to prove. In following the pursuit of ether, Einstein is at his best explaining the concept and exactly why it was thought necessary, referring back to sound and even further back to objects subject to forces acting on them.Throughout the book, the theory of relativity is never far from view. The whole body of science up to the introduction of relatively assumed a fixed reference for all of creation. A straight line could be continued in one direction forever. You and I could always agree on the speed of an object, like a train, even if I were watching the train and you were traveling on it. Every point on earth and every planet could be imagined in three dimensions at a specific time. The universe was an elaborate mechanism that ran like a clockwork.What Einstein discovered is that there is only one thing fixed, the speed of light. This became the standard to which all other references must bend. Time could almost stop, the length of a piece of pipe could lengthen or shorten, an object could change its mass, all of these relative to the speed of light, constant everywhere and for all observers.Relativity, standing firm under all tests designed to disprove it, has upended our confidence in our senses. Though relativity doesn't forbid, in fact, confirms the world of our daily experience, it resolutely rejects the application of daily experience to the larger reality. Mass and energy are interchangeable, the force of gravity and the force of acceleration are identical, light is both a particle of energy, the photon, and an electromagnetic field.From being the center of the universe, man has been successively diminished, first in our place among the stars and now in our confidence that what we know from sensation is absolute. Only in the abstract world of mathematics can we continue the pursuit of truth, but in that lies the rescue of our worth. Only we can know the truth, all else stands dumb in an uncomprehending universe. Small potatoes, yes, but small potatoes that think!Einstein had the determination to push beyond the accepted, yet even he was challenged by quantum weirdness. Others have taken up where he left off. This book will pull you along to an understanding not just of relativity, but of the reason science holds such allure.After you've read this book, I highly recommend to you Max Tegmark's ""Our Mathematical Universe"", which I have also reviewed. Tegmark takes Einstein's relativity and runs with its implications beyond the known universe known to astronomy."
5,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2829660-steve-bolin,4,"Interesting book. Most of it was written by Leopold Infeld who was a colleague of Einstein and a fellow refugee from Europe. Infeld could not get a permanent appointment at Princeton due to a bitter rivalry within the Physics department so he came up with the idea of writing a popular, non mathematical monograph explaining the history of physics. Einstein readily agreed and this allowed Infeld to obtain a secure source of funding. Einstein's name appears first only because his was the better known of the two.Infeld tried to compare the evolution of physics to a detective novel where one follows ""clews"" to arrive at the hidden truths. The first half of the book deals with the rise and fall of classical mechanistic physics starting and the last half with relativistic and quantum physics. Since the book was written in the 30s it does not contain any of the newer theories on such things as string theory, multiverses etc. I do not miss these as they are not supporeted by ""clews"" at the present time and while they are attempts to build on and unify Einsteins fundamental explanations of the construction and working of the universe they are not verifiable at this time by any experimental techniques and remain solely in the realm of mathematical hypothesis."
6,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8888352-kinan-diraneyya,4,"The book presents very good explanation of how our understanding of physics changed since the 18th century; although, unlike what you expect from a book discussing the evolution of a certain topic, this one doesn't actually pay that much attention to names and debates, instead, it goes about experiments in an abstract manner, to a point where you can't be sure if one particular experiments was actually attempted or if the whole thing was purely hypothetical.This is one of those books that almost contain zero equations, and it succeeds, like many of these books, in communicating most of the ideas, but not all of the ideas. Things I knew in advance were notably easier to understand than those that I didn't. Lorentz transformation in particular were very hazy, despite understanding the facts, there was no way I would understand the actual theory solely from this book, the following youtube link is a good (and in fact a great video) example of a better way to explain the matter:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh0pY...Another downside to reading this book (and generally any book written by one of the great revolutionary scientists) is the fact that it is outdated. As far as I know, the base of physics from that time still holds today, but the way we look at it changed, new evidence was presented, huge scale experiments were performed. Reading a book written by Einstein is undoubtedly cool, but there is no reason to read a book published 100 years ago when you have rocket scientists writing books including everything this one contains and more.But this is a very small book after all, and for its size (and age) it certainly is good, I would recommend respecting it and putting somewhere visible on your shelf while you read a modern and more comprehensive book about physics."
7,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23748469-krollo,5,"This book is a pretty good explanation of the history of physics, from Galileo to quantum theory. It is set out in a fairly comprehensible manner, and there are a lot of analogies used. This isn't going to help you much with exams but it's a great way to get your head round the overall structure of physics."
8,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59767896-erdogan-cicek,3,The book is briefly and clearly explains the transition of the physical phenomenas from classical to modern area and why we should think so in order to improve our way of vision..
9,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4424141-michael,4,"I first picked this book up thinking that it would provide a broad overview of the entire history of Physics. I really wanted Einstein's take on Aristotle, Lucretius and maybe even the pre-Socratics in a sweeping history of scientific thought. On this account, I was sorely disappointed. Einstein summarily dismisses all physics prior to Galileo, and I almost summarily dismissed the book as a result. It sat on my shelf for about two years until I recently picked it up thinking I needed a new way of seeing the world after having immersed myself in historical and cultural studies over the last few months. I am glad I picked it up again. This is a really good book. It is not only good because Einstein is a master at explaining complicated physics in a way that a layman like I am can understand; the book is also good because Einstein gives a compelling portrayal of the creativity, thought experiments and testing involved in a scientific approach to reasoning. It is this latter part that I greatly enjoyed. Essentially, as Einstein explains it, modern Physics is a way of looking at problems, testing them and resolving them through scientific theory. However, each time scientific theory solves a problem, it creates a new set of problems that furthers scientific inquiry. As a result, mechanical physics gives way to field theory which gives way to relativity which leads us to quantum mechanics. In each step of this intellectual journey, some ideas are discarded by the new theory, but others are more fully explained and understood. It is an exciting process, and in the book's portrayal I really came to appreciate the perspective and the discipline of scientific reasoning. This is a great book for anyone whose interest in pop culture science has lead them to pick up Greene's Elegant Universe and similar popular explanations of physics and science. "
10,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/351989-eli,5,"An accessible, straightforward journey through the rise and fall of various theories at the heart of physics, from Newton's time to the early 20th century era of Einstein and Infeld. Although ""rise and fall"" is not quite accurate; the authors stress that new theories tend to broaden the scope of the old theories rather than upending them entirely. Thus, for example, today we freely make use of Newtonian mechanics when dealing with non-relativistic speeds, or use Maxwell's equations when the electromagnetic field in question is large enough to obscure small-scale quantum effects.This is a popular science book, and an extremely good one. The authors make heavy use of analogy and thought experiment, ideally chosen for both easy understanding and the way they accurately crystallize difficult concepts. Even if the reader has a firm grasp of the history of physics, this quick read also offers itself up to would-be science educators as the epitome of good pedagogy."
11,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2909483-paparas,4,"This book offers two things:1. A summary of physics, from classical mechanics, to field theory, general relativity and quantum theory (as it was understood in 1938 when the book was first published). The presentation is oriented towards laymen and avoids using any mathematical formulas. The explanations of the basic ideas of physics are marvelously clear and straightforward. However, the self-imposed strict avoidance of math, although probably appealing to the wide audience, sometimes resulted in vagueness that left me unsatisfied. 2. A pioneering glimpse into a new epistemology that was later expanded by Thomas Kuhn into his famous theory of scientific revolutions via paradigm shift. Indeed the basic ideas of that theory are clearly presented here by Einstein and Infeld almost a quarter-century before Kuhn's seminal ""The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"" was published."

14,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,4,"The book started with the classic mechanics view and progresses to newer physics and why they are needed to explain newer phenomena the classic view fails to explain satisfactorily. You can tell Einstein had something to do with the book as the discussion on both special and general relativity are a master of clarity and insight. Unfortunately, the book falls short in two respects. The first is that it’s very verbose in a lot of places. Blame it on Infield — it’s not Einstein’s style. The second is a common issue for science popularization books, they seem to be always targeting too general of an audience. There is never a single equation as if that will immediately turn people off. And they stop at the point when things just start to get *really* interesting: there is a brilliant and concise piece of argument that to satisfy special relativity, we can not be living in a Euclidean geometry. But the is no follow up on what geometry we are in. I know it’s supposed to be hard to explain to laymen, but shouldn’t it be at least attempted?"
15,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55039073-luis-espinoza,5,"This is so far the most legible introduction/explanation of the development of physical theories I have read so far. The vocabulary is considerably simple and the illustrations are clear enough to make the basic concepts approachable for someone with no formal studies in the area like me. The book has no mathematical explanations, and Einstein says that in doing so he is sacrificing precision, and this is surely true, however the point of the book is not to present a precise understanding of physics concepts (and their corresponding mathematical formulas) but to present in simple form the different theories from mechanical physics to quantum physics, and how they relate to each other. Only the last then pages regarding quantum physics get a little blurry, mostly because he is presenting in hypothetical form aspects that, as far as I´ve read, have already been settled. He also states when introducing quantum physics that the statistical nature of the area has more to do with our lack of tools to understand it better (or more precisely) and not because there is an actual statistical nature to it. I don´t know if this is so, I´ve read somewhere else that this is an aspect where Einstein got it wrong, however I don’t think this makes his presentation of the subject lacking in any way."
16,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52894015-antoine-patt,4,"Einstein, through this book, unfolds the intricated lines of ideas that forged what is today's physics understanding. It gives a rather clear insight of why people put their faith and reason in some theories, and casted shadows of disapprovement on others. But the most interesting in my opinion is to learn more about the tipping points before each thought revolution. Those periods were highly tensed from the intellectual point of view. They reflect how difficult it can be for new and counterintuitive ideas to take root. This is directly related to how we, beings of subjectivity, construct our mental vision of the world and its laws. It is quite easy to take for granted a way of understanding any thing about and within the universe. Taking the step back from what we know, or believe to know, and take a hard look to determine the limits of our knowledge is one of the hardest and most important aspects of science.That is why I enjoyed reading this book.On another note, it doesn't include equations or technical concepts so it is a suitable reading for non professional scientists."

32,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7856900-julieta,5,One of my favourite books. I love the way they organized the content. 
33,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2158568-josh-utterback,2,"Very outdated. Probably very good for laymen when it was written, but is overly basic today."
34,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20587215-harsh-bhatia,4,"Great book. A scientific reader will find it a little too simplified. Nevertheless, it provides the chronological development of ideas and the causality between them."
35,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24297378-tu-n-tony,5,this book is pretty good for me
36,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41029805-amiya-mishra,5,One of the best non-mathematical physics book I have ever read
37,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36775560-richard-joya,3,Archaic but a good way to get a better understanding of physics.

39,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39046103-bogdan-balostin,4,"I cannot give this book a higher rating just because it was written in the past and so it doesn't cover almost anything regarding quantum physics, except the very basics (what is a quanta).I also cannot freely recommend it to everyone without even a little slight interest in physics or reality. It's not a philosophy or poetic book trying to tell you stories about physics in everyday life. It is a physics book, albeit one without any kind of math, and hence only the ideas and the flow of ideas are presented. Even so, they are pretty complicated to follow (and I have a degree in physics, that I don't use). Nevertheless, I would recommend it to everyone intend on studying physics or while studying physics. When you try to study in-depth, you forget how everything comes together, and especially concerning the field theory and the relativity theory, this book does a good job of explaining them.On the other hand, I had all sorts of feelings concerning the reality that I wished I would have while studying physics. My studies consisted of lots of maths and description of physical phenomena without a clear understanding of the ideas behind them (that was the teaching style).This book finally made it clear that everything we think about reality is not real, but science is an invention of the human mind, to explain reality. It means if something contradicts our current explanations, we don't deny the fact and stick to our ""beliefs"". Instead, we try to change our concepts through lots of effort and creativity. It always paid off. Matter, waves, energy, they don't exist, everything is just a story in human minds. We have the power to give names to everything in reality (i.e. chair, sky, earth, human, love, etc) even though they are absolute reality.In its quest to explain everything, so does science give names to particles and waves and energy, but they are only part of our perceived reality. Every new concept brings us closer to the truth. And this book prove this brilliantly by its very existence. It is outdated in the overall understanding of science but it will always be a beacon of the true scientific method. "
40,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9187382-akshay,5,"I needed an accessible way to explain Relativity for a principles of science course and chanced upon this text while going over Einstein's wiki page. It was quite a gem of a discovery as I ended up reading most of the book and it proved handy to explain the development of ideas in physics!It's neatly divided into four parts — the rise of the mechanical view, it's decline, field & relativity, and quanta. Each part starts with formulating the natural phenomena at hand and gives a narrative of the primary approach that was used to address it. For instance, the first chapter starts with Aristotle's conception of motion that was prevalent in Europe for over a thousand years, which was ultimately shown to be incorrect with the emergence of the concept of inertia through Galilean (and later Newtonian) science.Although a book intended for a non-technical audience, Einstein & Infeld don't dumb it down as popular science books/youtube videos would these days — instead they ensure that the richness of the ideas and the soundness of the concepts powering the development of theory is properly explicated through relevant examples, powerful thought experiments and solid explanations. The philosopher of science in Einstein comes forth as he is frequently takes a step back in the text to addresses the basic approach of science and the way it tries to solve the fundamental questions that nature posits. He oftentimes discusses the implications that the development of the concept/theory yields and how it serves to unsettle the accepted views at the time, thus pushing the frontiers of science forward.I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get a firmer grasp on the theoretical development of ideas in physics without being concerned about the mathematics behind it, which truly, comes after the conception of the theory, as Einstein presciently puts it!"
41,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3271015-anand,5,"Has possibly the best preface I've ever read. It goes over the rise of classical mechanics under Newton, the decline of classical mechanics during the 19th century, and the rise of the new branches of physics: quantum mechanics and relativity, that Einstein and Infeld were in the midst of while they were writing this. I'd recommend this to just about anyone, but especially someone in my position: Someone who's interested in physics and will soon study it intensely, but is first reading some lighter books to get a feel of WHY they should like physics.  I would also recommend that you read this book (and books like it) if you WANT to like physics, but just don't know why you should. I could rant about how physics being taught the wrong way in the American public school education system is a great contributor to this, but I won't. "
42,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54560274-jim-davis,1,I gave up on this book. i agree that it doesn't feel like Einstein's way of writing and is probably more Infeld. I have read other stuff written by Einstein and found it easier to understand. Einstein's description of the thought experiments he used to begin his investigation of a scientific phenomena always made the end results make more sense. The explanations in this book never seemed clear to me even though they were often very long and seemed to be trying excruciatingly hard to stay at the level an average person might understand and didn't like like they were coming directly from Einstein.
43,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105179100-jitesh-seth,4,"This book should be in the syllabus in senior school. Same topics covered but this helps bring all concepts in a coherent narrative, with the philosophical backing thrown in, which is mostly missed out by school and even university students. All this without writing a single equation. Definitely more accessible than a book like A Brief History of Time. Loved it."
44,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25352440-mohammad-tanviruzzaman,5,"Authors trace the development of important physical ideas without inserting distracting historical asides. There are three overarching concepts: (1) Rise and fall of Mechanical view (2) Rise of Field view (3) Rise of Quantum and Probability view. The approach is that of a logician--clarifying what is an assumption, convention, experimental fact, or conclusion-- yet being delightful. It feels like starting at the first principle (Galileo's law of inertia) and let the topics grow naturally from there. The book was written in 1938. Subtracting twenty years to account for the usual chaos present in state of the art (shows up in the last few pages), the authors have covered about three hundred years of development from Galileo to ~1918. Although a hundred years of rapid development happened since, it is already a big help."
45,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64328181-shubhanshu,5,Written in simple and lucid manner and defining some of intrigue concepts layman's terms. Recommended to all physics lover.
46,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7999663-ruchi-chaube,3,A novice or a layman would marvel the book for its simplicity in the presentation of the complicated physical phenomenon. This book is definitely a masterpiece for a beginner who is learning physics. As Einstein himself followed the science of deduction so has he approaced the same in the presentation of the physical facts in this book. You will see a glimpse of it as you read through this book. The book would turn out to be not so gripping if you're already familiar with some of the physical facts. But I would defintely recommend this book to others.
47,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1672395-arrion-j,3,"Is reality real? Sounds funny but think about it, is reality real? My reality is not your reality is not Joe Shmoe's reality so how do we know how to respond to others? Do we go along with the median or general societal norms or do we dare diverge and suffer the consequenses of such? I believe the study of motion will better help to give the illusion of remaining congruent with socioty, while somewhat controling my soroundings, who's force will push society to be congruent with me."
48,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6265174-erickson,5,"Very good expository by Einstein himself on his own take on classical physics as well as his own theory of relativity. The depiction is nearly so simple that a person who has not quite seen physics before would be able to understand the gist of what he is trying to say. The exposition is sufficiently detailed qualitatively, with intention to forgo all quantitative explanations, and I believe he did that without loss of any generality."
49,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28902492-austin-wright-pettibone,5,"Great complement to introductory physics courses, or to non-scientists interested in learning about the psychology of physics. In traditional Einstein fashion, the explanations are clear, guiding, and informative: the authors make sure never to leave their reader behind, carefully building explanations in order to bring popular audiences along. I've recommended this book to many a friend looking to understand the motivation behind early physical research."
50,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41854820-arman,5,"A very interesting reading, especially for those who want to have an overall idea about greatest theories and most essential concepts of physics from classics to field and electromagnetism then relativity and quantum. It shares many moments of why and how, for example why even a relativity theory is needed, how they tried to solve which problems that end up having a new theory which is the most important to know before studying anything, specially natural sciences like PHYSICS."
51,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/353587-ethan,5,"Leopold Infeld mostly wrote the book. Einstein essentially added his name and editorial input to his friend's project, otherwise it wouldn't have been published so widely. It's a good thing, too, because Infeld writes much better than Einstein. The 1938 language notwithstanding, this is about as good an introduction to twentieth century physics as exists."
52,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5956366-jenna-spencer,3,They stated right at the beginning of the book that they would stear clear of math so that this book could be read and understood by all. I think it would have been more helpful to have the math in it. Over all it is a really well written and organized book. 
53,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21573092-ulrich-utiger,3,"Einstein tries here to vulgarize his concepts without using any mathematics. As it is with all vulgarizing material, this creates more confusion than anything else. I prefer his theories with the mathematics involved."
54,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2187201-doug,5,This book did a good job of explaining modern physics and how it evolved on a conceptual basis. No heavy math to cause sleepless nights or frustration. Just the authors presenting thought experiments and analogous to explain how we got where we are in physics and where we might go next.
55,0671201565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16362429-vance-j,4,Really interesting to read this book 50 years (+) after it was first written. A simple introduction to the move from classical to modern physics. This will help fill in some of the gaps for those who are challenged by understanding the differences.
