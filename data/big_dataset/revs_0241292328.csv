0,0241292328,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,3,"Carlos Magdalena is passionate about the protection of plant species – 1 in 5 plants is currently in danger of extinction. He grew up the son of a florist in northern Spain, where Franco had logged ancient forests and eliminated most “non-profitable” wildlife, and his childhood interest in natural history grew into a fervor for conservation. After moving to England at age 28, he underwent rigorous training at England’s Kew Gardens to earn a horticultural diploma while working as a plant propagator. His initial focus was on the café marron plant from Rodrigues Island in the Indian Ocean, a place where biodiversity is critically threatened by invasive species and traditional medicine. Magdalena was part of a project to grow café marron cuttings at Kew and then return seeds to the wild in 2007 and 2010. However, his first love was waterlilies, so he also cultivated Australian varieties at Kew. His travels also took him to the Amazon, Peru and Australia – a set of experiences that grows a bit repetitive. An epilogue offers ideas of how you can help combat plant extinctions, and there’s a helpful glossary too. I especially liked the botanical illustrations. However, I think you have to be really, really interested in plants to get more out of this, and I was disappointed to learn at the very end that Magdalena had a ghostwriter – I would have preferred it if that fact was disclosed up front.A few lines I liked:“Grafting is horticultural sleight of hand.”“Destroy one species and you give yourself permission to destroy them all.”“The world of plants is full of surprises.”“Anyone can be a plant messiah. You only need to have a spark of interest.”"

His passion for plants is inspirational, even if I can't get shit to grow in my own garden. (But also, I really love Kew and any horticultural garden. I highly suggest visiting your local one.)"
2,0241292328,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40928988-kim,5,"This book was a better read than most of the fiction I've read lately. The author's anecdotal stories are quite thrilling at times. The reader finds themselves wondering ""will it propagate??"" As the author yet again attempts to revive a plant thought to be already or near extinct. I found myself reading some of these stories out loud to people and everyone was enchanted by them. While reading this I took the time to look up most of the plants mentioned and did quite a bit of research into each. It's great to learn something new. "
3,0241292328,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,3,"Studying the Silent Extinction of Rare PlantsIn ecology, extinction refers to termination of an organism or of a group of organisms. The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the last individual of the species, and the ability to breed and recover may have been lost before this point. This term is generally used with animal extinction, but there are very few ecologists who study plant extinction. In this book, environmental biologist Carlos Magdalena describes his studies across to understand how plant extinction are taking place, and how we can fix this silent extinction. The factors contributing to their disappearance are varied and complex, but the consequences of their loss are immeasurable. The author explores the principle factors for extinction. In almost all cases changes brought about in the environment by humans; through deforestation, breaking the natural balance with the introduction non-native species of animals, and global warming.Some of the interesting examples from this book includes; The jellyfish tree, is a critically endangered and endemic to the island of Seychelles. It has been suggested that these trees have been lost from the natural habitat of moist forests through competition with other species and climate change. Roussea simplex is native of Mauritius in Indian Ocean, where it grows in mountain forests. The flowers of Roussea produce copious amounts of nectar and are pollinated only by the blue-tailed day gecko. The fruit secretes a gelatinous substance that contains the minute seeds. The blue-tailed gecko licks up this secretion and disperses the seeds in its droppings. But a small ant introduced to Mauritius by colonists invades the flowers of Roussea and cover with clay to protect themselves. The ants sting blue-tailed day gecko from drinking the pollen and thus stopping pollination process. Trochetia boutoniana also known by its native Creole name Boucle d'Oreille is a shrub close to extinction, because the monkeys introduced into its natural habitat feed on plants blossom buds that effectively eliminated this plant species.The book is not accompanied by illustrations or the photographs of plants becoming extinct in natural habitats. On the lesser side of science, I find the title of this book is somewhat outlandish, after all no one used this term for other renowned ecologists and environmental biologists. "

He details his experiences in various tropical regions to explore and attempt to save indigenous plant life of these areas. The writing is not always great, but his passion for his subject shines through. His knowledge, commitment to preserving biodiversity, and uncanny intuition in working with plant life is admirable and inspiring."

I blitzed through it over the long holiday weekend here and it was such a well-paced and exciting read. So far it is going down as the best non-fiction I've read this year. I could relate to so many of the topics, relating to the epiphytes of Florida. My husband stumbled across an orchid about 10 years ago that hadn't been seen in about 30 years. There's a very active plant community looking for extirpated plants in that region of the US and a movement to reintroduce species that have been missing since the collecting and logging days. So, every story Carlos told I could just imagine it was in Florida instead of the far-off tropical places he visited. Let's all cure some plant blindness!"

7,0241292328,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,This book tells of endangered plants with an inexhaustible exuberance that is absolutely catching. This self taught naturalist got accepted to study horticulture at the honorable institute of Kew and has put his expertise to good use since by saving several endangered species. Definitely recommended! 
8,0241292328,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66412577-elizabeth,5,"An excellent book for conservationists the world over! As a person who has worked in conservation and education I can say this is a really important book to read. We often hear of helping the tigers or saving the polar bears. But who is going to save the worlds loneliest palm tree? Who will be there to mourn the last Bory's Coral Tree? Mountain flowers that rely on geckoes as its sole pollinators and trees claimed by all to be living dead. This is a collection of stories about the people who will save these plants and preserve special, beautiful, and vital parts of the worlds ecosystems. These are the people who send seeds to the famous seed bank in the arctic. This is a book about saving the world. One special plant at a time. This is a very Important book. "
9,0241292328,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33224729-shaun,4,"I received a free copy of this book through a Goodreads First Reads Giveaway.A journey with Carlos Magdalena across the world as he attempts to save endangered plants from extinction. You'll be taken from South America to Africa to Australia to small, remote islands in the Pacific. Some tales are amazing, some funny, some heartbreaking. Magdalena is obviously quite passionate about plants (water lilies in particular) and it comes through in his writing. He's also quite passionate about the environment as a whole and the impact is it having on the plants of the world. His passion spills out on every adventure and page of the book. Professional and amateur horticulturists seem to be the main target of this book, but it is still readable to the layperson (like myself). However, Magdalena chooses to use the Latin names of all the plants he encounters, which can get a bit hard to follow sometimes when he's comparing one to many others numerous times. That may be scientifically correct, but it's a bit difficult for this layman. I was also disappointed there were no illustrations or photographs of the plants discussed. If so passionate, why no photos? There are illustrations at the end of every chapter, but it's of different parts of the same plant. Photographs and illustrations of the plants throughout the book would have been very welcomed. Overall, it was an area I had no real knowledge about going in, and I came out knowing more about the rare plant world. The writing can be tedious, but is interesting nonetheless. "

A lovely juxtaposition, and a nicely accomplished autobiography."
11,0241292328,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5855603-darrin,5,"I started this book with a bit of trepidation. The title gave me pause because I thought the book would be all about the self-aggrandizement of the author but it turned out not to be that way at all.It is written in an open, easy-to-read style that kept my interest the whole time and made me want to go to the internet to look at the areas of the countries he visited and look at the flowers the author was describing.I have always thought of Kew Botanical Gardens as simply a massive garden for the royalty of England...boy was I wrong. I quickly realized what an important role Kew has in preserving rare plant species and how involved they are all over the world in seeking to preserve environments, help local peoples learn to cultivate locally important trees and plants, and preserve rare species there at Kew Gardens.It is also a call to action to stop the madness and environmental destruction happening all over the world right now. This is probably one of the most important insights this book gives the reader.I would like to thank the author, Carlos Magdalena, and Doubleday, Penguin Random House LLC for providing me with a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. I hope everyone gets a chance to read it."

14,0241292328,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21539577-virginia-arthur,5,"By the time I was ten, I was announcing to my sub-urbanized family that I was going to be a botanist when I grew up leaving them baffled as hell; it's not like we grew plants, ran a farm, lived in the country though we kind of...?Ours was the first street of what would become a giant new mini-city. Every day was spent watching some part of the original farm get bulldozed, destroyed; every day was a topographic adventure meaning where it was flat on Tuesday, a giant new 'mountain' appeared 'out of nowhere' on Wednesday, the result of which was utter fury on my part that all the wildlife and plants I wandered around looking at that I knew were extraordinary examples of native flora and fauna, could be killed--had no rights at all. I did become a professional botanist and hold two degrees, one in multidisciplinary Field Biology, and a Masters in Plant Ecology/Botany. I have spent nearly my entire career as a rare plant botanist including for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. I still work as a freelance biologist/botanist. I won this book in a Goodreads Giveaway which kind of blew my mind because of all the books I sign up for, I really really wanted this one. Things never really work out for me like this so it was almost with hands shaking, I opened this book, the topic so close to my soul, my life experience (though none of my field work has been in the regions the author covers; I wish!), I wasn't sure I could take it.Carlos Magdalena (46) is the Tropical Senior Botanical Horticulturist (he started as an intern) at the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. The book is about his life, growing up in Northern Spain, and how his passion for plants came on naturally and early (like mine). The book covers his botanical adventures in Mauritius, Australia, Bolivia, Peru, and also at Kew. The book is incredibly informative regarding the botany of the regions he explores (though there are no drawings/photos of any of the plants aside from one which may be intentional to prevent poaching) and covers botanical propagation methods/“magic”, per all odds against him sometimes (only three seeds left!). It is also a mystery and adventure story both in his travels and in studies about human nature, 'issues' I also ran into while trying to propagate/preserve rare plants. The cafe marron plant of Rodrigues Island (Indian Ocean) is profoundly endangered in its native habitat and efforts to grow it at Kew are not going well. Magdalena describes discovering one fruit, a miraculous discovery. He tries to grow the seeds, difficult. He starts having some success then one day a co-worker informs him one of the fruiting branches of this rare jewel is gone—someone had clipped it for a class.In another case when he goes to visit a ""protected plant"", “rather than being treasured and pampered like royalty, the tree and its surroundings were in an appalling state.”One of the most, I'm sorry, sadly hilarious tales he tells is of the “loneliest palm tree on the planet.” A severely endangered palm (all the Latin names are in the book, fyi) that grows in Mauritius. I will just let him tell you:“...one of the garden laborers (was) chewing heartily and spitting husks on to a polythene bag. “Where did you get those seeds you are eating?” (Magdalena asked him)“...we like to eat palm seeds. I have never eaten this species before,” he (the laborer) replied.”(This is a staff person of the National Parks and Conservation Service...eating the seeds of this rare palm). One of the tree species he tries to save is endangered because it makes for great chicken barbecue. Not kidding. Like Magdalena, I was also stunned and horrified by these conservation horror stories—complete screw ups, apathy, ignorance on the part of the humans that are supposed to care (conservation agencies, etc.). It is also very funny including recounting field experiences (my own inspiring my novel, Birdbrain) as when they discover a rare tree while doing field surveys and they cannot reach the ever critical fruits--they need a ladder but who hauls around a ladder when hiking? So they make a human ladder, “the stockiest guy at the bottom” and no worries that they are on the edge of a 300 foot drop-off ! (No spoilers here!). I also laughed regarding screaming to stop when he saw something and ""grab and go"" collecting. Maybe botanists are lucky to still be alive with these antics...a steep scree chute in Alaska with my name on it, life passing before my eyes, helicopter waiting, and all for Cryptantha shackletteana that I didn't even find. Probably not even a recognized species anymore...Magdalena also makes the connection between rare plants and the rest of the ecosystem that depends on them, like the giant tortoises of Mauritius: “what the tortoises are doing is effectively hoovering up the weeds, fertilizing the native plants with their poo, and dispersing their seeds. The native species are returning; it is creating mico-Mauritius out of Mauritius.” Then there is the largest hummingbird in the world in Peru of course dependent on a rare bromeliad. He includes conservation stories for his true loves, the lotus's (and yes, he discusses Victoria amazonica that we all saw at the nearest botanical garden when he were nine and if you were like me, you got in trouble for trying to stand on it). His love for the lotus's takes him all over the world. His description of the Nazca Plains of Peru was nothing less than riveting (or I am just a complete and total plant nerd). The red desert or weathered stones and sand (“how I imagine Mars”) is interrupted by ripples in the sand except they're not---they are lines of Tillandsias (“air carnations”), hundreds of them and they are older than Methuselah of California. They also find something else stunning, but I will leave you to read about it. Despite the screw-ups, what one notices is how much many of these regions DO care about their native plants while the United States has next to nothing for a national botanical program, not understanding that native plants preserve America's history as much and more significantly than any historical building. I was the only botanist for the entire state of Alaska. Many state and federal resources agencies do not even have a single botanist on staff and if they do, they are often given other assignments having nothing to do with plants. In California where I live, native plants have been absolutely demonized as the cause of catastrophic wildfires. It is now commonplace to see someone, including public agencies and yes, “conservancies”, cutting their oaks down, bulldozing out their “brush” (native chaparral), or blasting an area with herbicides, all in the name of “fire safety” (which Magdalena mentions as happening where he grew up) and never mind that many of these areas have and will continue to burn to the ground anyway, everyone conveniently forgetting that our HOUSES are made of the same thing as the trees they decimate—wood, and the houses are the real fuel on the landscape, setting one another on fire. It's easier to blame it all on manzanita plus plants can't talk. So in this way, Magdalena's book is also an indictment: “We destroy rainforests to plant crops in soil that can't support them. Without thought of what treasures the forests might hold, we drive flora and fauna to critically endangered levels and even extinction. During exploration and colonial expansion, we introduced goats to islands where the duly grazed the unique and delicate native flora until there was none left, removing the “green glue” that stabilized the soil and causing erosion problems that washed entire islands away. We introduced invasive weeds; a stifling, creeping death, smothering the local flora in a sinister form of botanical colonialism. Every day we build houses on agricultural land, laying endless miles of lifeless, white-lined tarmac over what were once wild, flowery meadows, blocking our minds to the consequences. It's a display of “plant blindness” of epidemic proportions. With the destruction of plants, we destroy the fauna too. Bird, mammal, and insect species—all gone forever. We rarely even think about what we're doing, and when we occasionally do, we still don't fully understand the consequences. We have moved away from millennia of direct contact with plants; since the Industrial Revolution the majority of the population in developed nation have never worked wit them and rarely communed with them. In the shift from the countryside to the city, we have lost our direct link with plants."" (All the while they continue to produce oxygen “for us”, an abusive relationship if I ever heard of one, my comment).“Plants can't speak, plead their case...they can't write. They need someone to do it for them...and I am that person.”“It was like an ethnic cleansing of nature.”“I am always in standby mode. Conservationists can never relax.” “Plants were under threat of extinction, so I needed to be there.”No one that is not a field biologist can really understand what it is like to go out into the world to document nature, if not already destroyed, likely to BE destroyed. Heartbreak is an occupational hazard of being a field biologist. So it was refreshing to read a book about this but also Magdalena's passion is inspiring, especially for a jaded soul like me (lost a lot more than won or just look around). The books I really love go into the nightstand next to my bed. I keep them close. The Plant Messiah will go into my nightstand, close to me because it's close to my heart. I loved this book and I am heartened that people like Carlos Magdalena are in my world."
15,0241292328,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6560108-nostalgia-reader,3,"3.5 stars.Any subtitle that mentions searching for rare species immediately draws me in, so I automatically clicked the request button when I saw this on NetGalley.I was expecting this to be more of a pure non-fiction book about various efforts to save various rare plant species, but instead it was a memoir about Magdalena's own travels and efforts to save some specific species. I enjoyed the memoir aspect of it, as Magdalena has an easy to read style and some amusing stories, but I also was a tad disappointed that it was wasn't a compilation of stories about a wider variety of plants. However, it didn't detract from my enjoyment of this book at all!Magdalena is obviously very passionate about plants, and this shows throughout the book. His enthusiasm for helping to propagate rare plants shines through in his writing style--it was a bit frantically written at times, but the narrative of it remained easy to follow throughout. It was a bit overwhelming with all the Latin names thrown around, and no pictures to reference to see some of the nuanced differences between plants. However, because each chapter focused on one specific species of plant, it wasn't too overwhelming.I do hope that the final version will have some pictures of some of the plants and places mentioned, as it would make comprehending some of the nuanced differences in species and sub-species easier.I'd highly recommend this book to people who are passionate about gardening and botany--the more you know about plants, the more you'll likely enjoy it! It's also a good read for someone like me, who appreciates plants and botany, but isn't a hobbyist or expert in plant-life.Thank you to NetGalley for providing me with a free copy to review!(Cross posted on my blog.)"

I thoroughly enjoyed this adventurous jaunt through Magdalena's wild, somewhat obsessive, species-saving world. I'm a hobby gardener, so his enthusiasm hits home. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is into botanizing (you know who you are) or anyone who cares about plants and the natural world. Keep Google handy as he's a name dropper (Nymphaea thermarum, anyone?). ;)Thanks to NetGalley and Doubleday Books for the ARC. All views are my own."

19,0241292328,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47323871-sid-nuncius,4,"This is an important book which makes vital points about plant conservation. It is in may ways interesting and informative, but I did have my reservations about the way in which Carlos Magdalena presents his work and his message.Magdalena has been a botanical horticulturalist at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew for many years. This means that he has received the best training and experience available in his field, and it is evident that he really knows what he is talking about. He is genuinely deeply concerned with plant conservation and driven to do all he can about it. This has given rise among colleagues to his slightly tongue-in-cheek title of The Plant Messiah, and in this book he tells us about how his upbringing led him eventually to Kew and about some of his inspiring work in rescuing endangered species. He makes the detail of the work very interesting - even minutiae of the techniques of propagation and grafting for example - and his world-wide forays to save plants from extinction in the face of ignorance, greed, political intransigence and the like are also a fascinating read.I did react rather against the general tone of the book, though. I want to be clear that I unreservedly support what Magdalena is doing and I admire his untiring and sincere efforts. I am rather less admiring of the somewhat egocentric narrative here and the way in which he seems to have taken the Messiah tag a little too seriously. I had a strong sense of his always trying to show us that he cares more than anybody else and has insights which others are too obtuse to see. It is noticeable how infrequently he uses the pronoun ""we""; when there is brilliance or success it is ""I,"" but errors are generally by ""people."" Science is a collaborative effort, and a little more humility and recognition of that would be welcome. Magdalena also sometimes allows his passion to outstrip reasoning; for example, he says ""Destroy one species and you give yourself permission to destroy them all."" Well, no, Carlos – you don't. You may make it slightly easier to destroy some others, but that's not the same thing at all. There's quite a lot of this sort of exaggerated rhetoric, which for me weakens rather than strengthens his case.I have given this book four stars because its message is so important and there is a good deal of real interest to be found here. I repeat, I think what Carlos Magdalena is doing is admirable and vitally important – but I find spending time in his company can be hard going in places.(I received an ARC via Netgalley.)"

21,0241292328,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1030319-coral,3,"Somewhat like an Indiana Jones of the botany world, Magdalena obviously has tremendous passion for his work, for discovering species and ensuring their preservation, and for sharing his love of plants with others. What bothers me, though, is the fact that there is a ghost writer that is not mentioned anywhere other than a thank you in the acknowledgements at the very end of the book. That just doesn't sit right with me - it feels like a deliberate attempt to pull the wool over people's eyes. I probably would have rated this higher if it wasn't for that."

24,0241292328,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2050909-tonstant-weader,4,"Carlos Magdalena is a botanist working at Kew Gardens whose success in propagating and saving near-extinct plants earned him the sobriquet The Plant Messiah. It is a fitting nickname as he has a messianic determination to capture the seeds and cuttings to safeguard the future of plants on the edge of extinction–even going so far as to wade into waters with crocodiles, piranhas, and snakes.The Plant Messiah is a fun and informative blend of action, adventure, and information. Much of his adventures seem a bit by the seat-of-his-pants, glimpsing blooms from his vehicle, asking his guides to stop here and there. There’s a bit of that in his experiments in propagating, too, trying different methods. The way he describes his process can sound like guesswork, but only if you think someone with years of experience and expertise is guessing.I enjoyed The Plant Messiah a lot. He is a happy writer who loves his work and his enthusiasm bubbles up from every page. The book is full of adventures and fascinating information about plants and what is happening in the plant world. It’s fascinating to learn that a plant once believed extinct was found by a student on a roadside for a school assignment. My favorite parts were the many different ways plants can be pollinated. So tricky, so varied, it’s simply amazing.Perhaps as a messiah, Magdalena is less people-oriented, so the other folks who are on these adventures are not even one-dimensional. This is his adventure. That also led to a misjudgment his editors should have caught and removed. Traveling in Peru, he is offered some human relics from an ancient burial ground and remarks grave-robbers in Peru would sell you anything even their grandmother. You know what, grave-robbers everywhere will sell you anything.

The author's enthusiasm, while at times bombastic, is infectious. He writes in a manner that is scientific, but still accessible.

26,0241292328,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1702050-fox,4,"I received this book for free through the GoodReads first-reads program in exchange for an honest review. The Plant Messiah is part biography, part short stories, and all call to the world to be more plant-conscious.  Carlos Magdalena makes an impassioned plea through the pages of the book for us all to do our part to increase the biodiversity of the world itself, cultivate the endangered plants and trees of our locales in our own gardens, and in general celebrate the natural biodiversity around us rather than homogenize our own areas with non-natives and non-native invasives simply for the sake of it all. Carlos Magdalena, affectionately called The Plant Messiah, is employed by the Botanical Garden at Kew. He spends his days collecting, propagating, and solving the mysteries of the various critically endangered plants of the world. While he has done much to help cultivate previously 'hopeless' plants and even discovered new species, his tone throughout the book remains humble and he remains far more passionate about teaching others than simply stroking his own ego.This book does a good job of explaining the importance of saving every plant we can, of unlocking the secrets of the rare and unusual and better understanding the ordinary. Carlos explains how the way plants have changed can help us understand our own world and what is happening in it, and how the ordinary person is indeed the most valuable asset in the fight against further extinctions. "
27,0241292328,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5070255-laura,5,"I read this book very slowly, one chapter at the time, in the time it took me to read this book I have also read several fiction books but those books have 3 or 4 stars and this has 5. I very rarely give 5 stars. Carlos Magdalena works at Kew Gardens (the way he got the job shows that if immigrations laws were to change, Britain would lose out great talents like him). He is an expert conservationist and an expert in tropical plants and waterlilies. Most of the book is about his attempts at saving one species or another of rare plants and that is fascinating, Carlos Magdalena gives us lots of information, sometimes with a bit of humour, not only on plants but also on zoology, history and so on. It helps that I am a Friend of Kew Gardens which I visit quite often, so it was particularly interesting to read what happens behind closed doors. But the book is also a call to action for all of us. We only have a planet and we are destroying or at best we don't seem to care about it. Plants feeds us, gives us material for our clothes and other objects but they also heal us and provide the habitat and eco-system for many creatures. Basically we can't live without plants. Each plants that becomes extinct is gone forever and might have provided a cure or a solution to a disease or problem in the future. I don't know if Carlos Magdalena is a messiah but it seems obvious that he is extremely passionate and has a lot of knowledge and a strong message. If you are interested in nature or conservation read this book, but it would be good if those people who are not interested in conservation read it.I was given this book by NetGalley in exchange for a honest review.

Carlos describes coming from a family that encouraged exploration, as well as respect and caretaking for the plants and animals of Asturias in Northern Spain. When wanderlust overtook him at 28, he travelled to London where a trip to the Royal Botanic Gardens of Kew changed his world. Their efforts to save highly endangered plants mirrored his passion for caring for the land back in Asturias. He has an energetic, driven personality that comes through in his recounts of his intense Kew education in the greenhouses and beyond. Most of the book recounts his journeys to save seeds or cuttings of rare plants found in the islands of the Republic of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, Amazon backwaters in Peru, and many other far flung locations. He’s a great storyteller and has set up each chapter as if he has to solve a puzzle with life or death stakes, how do these rare plants produce fruit, seed, and ultimately a new plant? He includes simple overviews of the science behind his a-ha moments, so even if you don’t have a botanical background you come away with an understanding for how these mysteries were solved. His passion for plants is infectious and it carries through in his writing, the stories are often zany and move quickly and you’re left feeling that we need many more people with the drive and desire of this plant messiah.

Author Carlos Magdalena has a mission to share with us about the world and ecology, and the meaning of the book is not sacrificed for this quest. Rather, the book aligns well with descriptions of Magdalena's work and the moral direction he has taken with what we does.This is a rare instance where we have an entertaining book that also happens to reach out and educate. A lovely juxtaposition, and a nicely accomplished autobiography."

He talked a little bit about the impact that colonialism had on the decimation of the lands, but I felt like he could have gone a lot deeper. Also, I think he missed an opportunity to discuss the intersectionality of njustice - the link between the ability to dehumanize, enslave, or destroy a people and the ability to colonize and destroy the land."

33,0241292328,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21215216-sea,2,"Okay, first of all: I‘m a huge plant nerd and botany has always been one of my favorite things while studying biology. This book was promising because the author, Carlos Magdalena, is so excited by plants that he devoted his life to saving them. So far, so good. But I had so many issues with this book.Even though it manages to write species names in italics – which many books don’t do and which drives me mad every time I see it – there are so many flaws. First, the botanical drawings here and there. It’s nice, yes, but those don’t have to do with the plants earlier talked about in a chapter. For example, there is an orchid at the end of a chapter about the café marron? Why? That doesn’t make sense. Then, these drawings aren’t even labelled. Why would you do that? It just doesn’t. make. sense. I can just imagine an editor that just didn’t have a clue about botany and thought: “Well, it’s a plant so let’s include it!”Oh, and don’t get me started on the editing. This book seemed so unorganized. Quite a lot of it is about the endemic plant world of Mauritius. Which is great and interesting because it has so many endemic plants and a lot of them are on the verge of extinction. But the chapters didn’t make sense to me – as did the titles of them. It just didn’t work because in each chapter the author changed plants and I felt like it would have been better to organize it by plant, you know? Kind of like this:Location APlant A – some other title to add informationIt’s found hereIt’s on the verge of extinction becauseI tried thisIt ended like thisThat’s all that should have been done in order to get the book organized.Then there’s the issue I had with the plants and the photos included in the book. There are photos, yes, and some of them are of the plants Magdalena helped. But there is no mention in the text, and you have to flip to the photos to search for the right plant and to either find a photo or not. Why haven’t they just added a simple “see photo x in the photo section”? This way you have to look for it yourself and can’t be sure whether it just isn’t there or you’ve been to clumsy to find it. And why not include a map of the places you talk about? There were so many mentions of important places and the geography that I just wanted to see where exactly they were. But okay, that’s just my preference and I can accept the fact that they didn’t think it necessary.And the terminology. Yes, there is a glossary but some of the terms just aren’t explained and for me, with a background in biology, it was okay, but I can only imagine that other people would struggle and either have to google all the time or just shrug it away and continue without understanding the terms. If the anatomy of a flower is so important – because he frequently talks about what worked and what didn’t when trying to pollinate – why not include a small chapter with a diagram or two just to get people on the same level? Again, I didn’t struggle as much but since this book seems to be aimed at laymen, I didn’t get why that wasn’t there.Oh, and why wasn’t it mentioned that Magdalena didn’t even write the book? It kind of felt like fraud to find out in the second to last paragraph in the acknowledgments. That’s not o-fucking-kay.So, yes, I wanted to love this book but there were so many issues with it that I just couldn’t. It’s a shame because it holds so much potential, but it was executed so poorly."

36,0241292328,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60947705-rmazin,4,"Carlos Magdalena is the plant messiah. His mission is one of plant advocacy and rescue. As a horticulturist and botanist at Kew Gardens. But he is not only found there. More frequently, Carlos travels the world in search of rare plants, restoring plant ecosystems and trying to get humans to work within the framework of the environment for the betterment of our planet. While most people see a single plant, Carlos sees the whole ecosystem that either supports it or destroys it. He seeks to educate and change what we are doing to our world, whether it is a large project or perhaps something a hobbyist can grow in a backyard.The Plant Messiah begins as a memoir showing how environment and family in Spain influenced Carlos. Then through his instincts, skills, determination and education he transforms himself into a knowledgeable and innovative advocate of the natural world. He is ready to risk time, and himself to pursue plants in many inhospitable situations.The book is exciting, amusing and informative. Since I had an ARC on my Kindle from Netgalley, I read the book slowly. That is because there weren’t any pictures in this format. So with my Kindle opened to the text, and my Ipad researching the images of the Latin plant names, I could see what Carlos was seeing. Yes, it took longer to read but it was still enjoyable. And sometimes, having lived on the East Coast and Southwest deserts, I was able to recognize similar plant life – major coup!Recommended and thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for the opportunity to read this book."
37,0241292328,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31761481-pia-cortez,3,"Learning about Magdalena’s journey from his childhood to being the Tropical Senior Botanical Horticulturist at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew is nothing short of inspiring. I’ve come across this lesson many times throughout my reading life, something that Magdalena himself abided by: you have to trust your obsessions. And this he did, in every aspect of his life’s work.After first securing an internship at the Kew, Magdalena continued his childhood passion in full force:[“Plants, people, possibilities” was Kew’s motto at the time, and a perfect summary of what the place is all about.The greatest responsibility of all was looking after the plants with a red dot on their labels, indicating they were endangered. I had to collect seeds from these plants regularly for storage in the seed bank, as they were so rare in cultivation. It was vital they survived. This was not the kind of collection you would find in any garden; these were rare and precious plants.]But beyond his work as a botanist, horticulturist and conservationist, there’s something about the world’s rarest and endangered species that called specifically to Magdalena. When he first found out about the cafe marron plant (Ramosmania rodriguesi), the last plant of its kind left in the world, he engaged in a profound mission to save and cultivate it.Magdalena also harbored an intense love for waterlilies, and when he got a chance to cultivate a rare species called Nymphaea thermarum which only grows in hot springs, he went to the task. Impossible was something he didn’t believe in, as he set out to put on his magic–which is really a lot of trial and error, a lot of consistent work. He became successful in this pursuit, so much so that he even wrote a “Nymphaea thermarum recipe” for the International Waterlily and Water Gardening Society.To read the full review, check out my post here: https://libromance.com/2018/06/02/a-r..."
38,0241292328,http://goodreads.com/user/show/301240-patty,3,"Nonfiction about Magdalena's life as a botanist at Kew Gardens, London. Magdalena is particularly devoted to preventing the extinction of plants – which sadly tend to get less media attention than endangered animals – specializing in figuring out how to get them to flower, how to turn the flowers into seeds, how to convince the seeds to grow, and, to complete the cycle, how to keep the seedlings alive long enough for them to flower. It's a far more complicated, mysterious, and nerve-wracking process than it seems! Another speciality of Magdalena's are waterlilies, so the books includes stories about many species, from the gigantic Victoria amazonica to the world's tiniest, Nymphaea thermarum, which is super adorable and I want one for myself. If only it wasn't, you know, critically endangered. So definitely an interesting topic. However, it didn't have my favorite execution. I personally prefer science nonfiction to lean heavily towards interesting botany facts and touch lightly or not at all on the scientists' personal life and experiences. The Plant Messiah had a lot about Magdalena's childhood, family, and personality, which... sorry, but I'm not reading this book to learn about him. The writing style itself is also fairly simplistic, which I suspect means The Plant Messiah will disappear from our cultural memory quite quickly. Still, if you enjoy reading about plants, it's well worth checking out!"
39,0241292328,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26823956-kaitlyn,4,"I won an ARC of this book through a Goodreads giveaway; all thoughts and ratings are my own. This is one of my favorite books I've read recently. I haven't read many books about rare plants or botany, but this was still understandable to me. I really loved the section dealing with South American plants. If I was just judging that book on that section, it would have been a 5 star book, especially the portions where he talked about how local populations were dealing with the deforestation and other threats to the native plants there. The sections where he talked about trying to figure out how to breed different endangered plants and the work (and occasionally luck) that goes into figuring out the exact mechanisms by which they breed were also fascinating. So why is it 4 stars instead of 5? There were a few sections were he talked too much about himself and things not entirely related to plants for my tastes. I understand it's a memoir, but I really could have done without the references to what his teachers thought about him as a boy and other similar aspects. They didn't add anything to the main purpose of the book. Overall, I would recommend this book to just about anyone - it's not written in obscure language, there's enough human interest to keep those not entirely fascinated by plants reading, and the sections dealing with figuring out how to breed plants or finding specimens of endangered plants are fascinating."

I am so impressed by Mr. Magdalena’s illustrious career. His ‘Plant Messiah’ nickname is well deserved. Over the last two decades, he has been saving endangered plants around the world. I was particularly taken by the urgency with which he swoops in to make his rescues. Often, Mr. Magdalena finds himself in precarious situations while doing so. . I got thoroughly lost in his adventures in Peru and Australia. His message to us is clear. We need to wake up and take better care of our planet. Plants, do indeed, form the basis of our ecosystems and we need to learn more sustainable ways to engage with our environment. His ability to teach others is one of his most valuable assets. Through his teachings, we can all learn to be greener and help to make the world a better place for future generations. IT’S URGENT! Over the years, I have become more and more passionate about being greener. This memoir further fueled my passion. It was a refreshing read in a difficult time for our environmental laws and protections.

41,0241292328,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102009253-ben,3,"A mix of memoir, travelogue and botanic history, this is a very interesting book that unfortunately promises a bit more than it actually delivers.The highlights of the book, in particular the first chapter and Peruvian chapter, mix all three styles in a way that makes quite niche botanic work understandable and interesting. There are some great passages showcasing the importance of conserving rare plants, and some fascinating facts about interactions between plants, animals and weather systems throughout the world.There is more often, though, a confused structure where facts and anecdotes combine without giving a clear direction - more a collection of interesting thoughts that don't quite explain their relevance. There's also a lot of plant-naming that requires the reader to have prior knowledge or stop to google what things look like, which is a shame if this is a book aimed at newbies as well as interested botanists.The book opens and closes with quite a grand ambition to inspire more people to conquer ""plant blindness"" and see the value of plantlife in the same way other parts of the natural world are cherished. Carlos is obviously a passionate, skilled and knowledgeable advocate for this, but the book left me with the feeling of a missed opportunity to make new converts."

In this book he takes us to the Spain of his childhood, his time as a students at Kew, Rodrigues Island, Mauritius, Peru, Australia, and Bolivia. In each place he works in different climates, with different people, and different plants. His goal with all, though, is to collect and save seeds to grow more plants and to store in a seed bank.Though I think his job sounds great, it is not all adventure. He does touch on the frustrations of finding the secrets to different species' germination, and on the library research and professional relationships that help him find the keys to success.

It is like finding a library where the books are written in Chinese, then taking someone to visit who can read only English and Spanish to decide which books are relevant. Or perhaps going into that library and burning the books based on whether you like the cover or not. My feeling is that all plants have not one but many uses. Perhaps they are not useful at the moment, but they may have been in the past and possibly will be again. We must not let them die out, for the sake of future generations who may need them to survive. Furthermore, when you lose one species, there are dire consequences for everything else that depends on it--insects, birds, and mammals, including humans. These are ecosystems, they need one another.

The subject matter might be a hard sell because it is very botanical and specific. The author travels around the world, finding species that are down to the last few specimens, often the very last living specimen. He then works to harvest seed and propagate the plants for reintroduction. It is a very hopeful read because the author continually saves plants from the brink of extinction. Definitely a little on the repetitive side as you get deeper into the book: found an endangered plant, had a hard time getting it to reproduce, figured it out, saved the plant! And so on. It was also written using a ghost-writer… He is a native Spanish speaker from Spain, and writing/journalism is not his profession at all, so it makes sense that he would enlist the help of a professional, but it's a little bit of a turn-off..."

There were times where I felt like the plot was a bit disjointed and jumped around a lot making it somewhat hard to follow but I really enjoyed reading about all of the different plants and locations that the author has worked and how his work has benefited rare and endangered plants. I also was inspired to know that he had little formal training in horticulture before starting out his career in the field.My only complaint is that there were a couple of places where the author mentions the height of geographic features/mountains and I think he used miles instead of meters or feet. Hopefully that could be corrected before the final version is printed.

It was very interesting to learn about the process of conserving plants and the places Carlos travelled to provide support. Reading this book you can really see how much passion Carlos has for this work and plants in general. He also does a wonderful job of making it easy for the layperson to understand all the science, which I consider a huge feat.Pick this up if you like science and want to hear what it's like to be horticulturist traveling the worlds to preserve plants."

Carlos is clearly an amazing horticulturist, and he really makes sure you know that through this book. I didn’t expect so much of this book to be about him talking about how amazing he is, but I should’ve known as he calls himself the plant messiah. I was thinking this would be a little more educational and a little more exciting as far as his adventures went, but again, he was just talking about his adventures in a “look how great I am and what I did” stand point. It was a hard read to get through, but I did learn a little bit about water lilies and some parts were okay. I almost wanted to stop after the first ~100 pages of his life story about how he didn’t go to college but is still amazing."

While the majority of the text flies with humorous ease, the last third becomes more dry and loses the joyousness and the depth so prevalent in the beginning.

I found the adventure stories interesting but the descriptions of all the plants & their ""Latin"" names tedious. The book could have done with some more illustrations/pictures & some maps so we could see where the author was going. Interestingly at the end of the book he has a list of three items that need to be changed to save the plants from extinction. The first one is to stop burning fossil fuels. Carlos does not appear to see the irony - he has just spent the whole book jetting & driving around the world collecting all these precious plants. Perhaps he could start by reducing his own fossil fuel dependency before lecturing us on how to do it."

I loved his enthusiasm for preservation, his insights on plant culture, and how I was still able to understand his work without being a botanist myself. I will say that this book is for people who are already passionate about nature conservation. He doesn't talk a ton about the politics of it, but he does have a great perspective on how it works and the failings of the conservation world as it is.I would not recommend this to anyone who isn't already a nature lover."

I started hiking with my family more, start a garden, and then I found this book. Magdalena reminded me of when I was a kid, holding on to my career goal of saving every endangered animal in the world. The great thing about this book is that the author wants us to believe that we can all work to save endangered species still, and that it's going to take a group effort to save our planet. It's a really good book that I'd suggest to everyone I know."

Until I read this book I had not thought about plants that are endangered. After reading it I want to save all the endangered plants I can. I had also never heard of kew botanical garden before I read this book. It was fun to read about the endangered plants that the author worked on. The book is definitely a page turner. I liked learning about water lilies. I thought the book was well written. The books makes me want to become a botanist so I can know as much about plants as there is to know.

From the book:If it was up to just one person to decide how the treat the earth, only a fool would allow this to happen, yet collectively humanity behaves like a headless chicken.So what can we do? There are many things to choose from, but here are my top three:1. Stop burning fossil fuels.2. Keep population growth at a sustainable level. 3. Harness the power of plants. So, let's get on it people and drag leadership along with us kicking and screaming and clutching their purses all the way. "

My only grip was with the writing style. It was a little choppy and didn't flow very well. However! I understand that Magdalena is A) Spanish and B) a botanist. He was sharing his passion for plants in a writing format he may not use often in his work, so I am absolutely fine with cutting the writing some slack.Definitely read this if you are interested in conservation, botanic gardens, or just cool plants!"

It did not effect my review, however!This was a good, readable jaunt into the world of “special” plants. And by the end of the story you recognize that it’s not just the rarity of some of these plants that makes them special, but their detailed lives and unique relationship with their worlds. I did come away appreciating the everyday plants in my life a little more...The only thing I can think would make this better was more pictures! In color, perhaps?"

While covering a variety of tropical species all over the world, it remained focused on its message about the importance of plant conservation, a clear passion for the author. Roy McMillan, the audio book narrator, did an excellent job. However, I did frequently wish there was a way to see pictures of the many beautiful and interesting flowering plants that were described.
