0,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13614926-caidyn-he-him-his,2,"This review and others can be found on BW Book Reviews.2.5/5The reason I picked this book up was because it reminded me of A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson. That book was about the known universe and the scientists behind it. Literally, chock full of hilarious anecdotes about the scientists who created/discovered things that was presented in an easy and humorous way. However, this book is about what we don't know. About how the more answers we have, the more questions crop up and the more that we realize we have no clue. The authors of this repeatedly emphasized that we know, about, 5% of the universe. That's it.So, as I said, this book is meant to be humorous. Well, it is. Definitely is. There were times that I smiled or snorted about something that they said. It was brilliantly adapted, too. Since I listened to this book, I can review only that. But, I know that this book was highly visual and probably completely full of comics. It brought some of those aspects into it with sound effects.However (shouldn't you expect that from me?) I found it grating after a while. The jokes were all the same, one of the things that I dislike most about books categorized as humor. I get tired of the same jokes over and over again. Usually, I try putting those books down for a bit then trying again only to find the humor still annoys me. That was the problem with this book for me. It expected itself to be funny when I simply didn't find it to be after a while.As for the content, it was super interesting. Black holes, dark matter, energy, gravity. Typically, I always sign myself up for books like that. But, the humor distracted me. When the authors really buckled down and didn't explain things with humor, I paid so much attention to it. If there was humor, I just spaced out.This book definitely has a good premise, but a bad carry out."
1,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20266331-tsedai,4,"If you like your physics with a side of dad-joke level puns, then this is totally the book for you. It's a fun romp through some of the wilder aspects of physics, though if you've got a fairly high level of understanding to start with then this book might feel like something of a review. For those who don't know physics at all, I'd worry that they might not be able to distinguish some of the punnier jokes, but I think most people should be able to parse it out. Overall a fun read to get you thinking, with lots of interesting concepts. I highly recommend reading it in conjunction with The Three Body Problem by Cixin Liu because a lot of the crazier topics have a fair bit of overlap."
2,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4729639-krista,4," On the inside flyleaf of We Have No Idea, it states:Armed with their popular infographics, cartoons, and unusually entertaining and lucid explanations of science, (Jorge Cham and Daniel Whiteson) give us the best answers currently available for a lot of questions that are still perplexing scientists, including:• Why does the universe have a speed limit?• Why aren't we all made of antimatter?• What (or who) is attacking the Earth with tiny, superfast particles?• What is dark matter, and why does it keep ignoring us?And after finishing the book, I can't help but observe that these four particular questions are among the many that the authors are unable to answer: We simply don't know. They don't give us many answers at all, but they do ask a fascinating string of questions that are revelatory in their unanswerability. The science here is easy to understand (all anecdotal, no math) but I could have done without the unending puns and quips (especially annoying when 95% of 129 footnotes are distractingly lame jokes; I would have skipped them all if it weren't for the 5% that were relevant). As I was reading I kept wondering, ""Are the jokes ruining this for me?"", but I guess they did serve to keep everything easy and accessible: this is pop-science-light; appropriate for a lay-reader like me but unlikely to be of use for the scientifically trained out there.I do read some science books, but there's a lot in We Have No Idea that I haven't heard before. As that bar chart attempts to illustrate, the matter that we are able to describe and interact with only comprises 5% of the “stuff” of the universe. We know that dark matter makes up another 27%, but while we can observe its effects on a cosmological scale, we can't see it or understand what it is. That leaves a whopping 68% made up of dark energy – something we can neither observe or understand but which we know must exist because it explains the present-day expansion of the universe (which is why it's called “energy”, even if it's not energy as we would know it) and every mathematical proof confirms that there's 68% of something missing from our observation-based models. When I went to high school, there was a whole gang of subatomic particles that seem to have become irrelevant: We now know that everything we observe is made up of only electrons, up quarks, and down quarks; and while there are nine other subatomic particles, they're weird and we don't know what they do. I thought I understood the concept of mass, but it's weird, too:
• It's weird because the mass of something is not just the mass of the stuff inside it. Mass also includes the energy that binds the stuff together. And we don't know why that is.• It's weird because mass is actually like a label or a charge (it's not really “stuff”), and we don't know why some particles have it (or feel the Higgs field) and others don't.• And it's weird because mass is exactly the same whether you measure it via inertia or gravity. And we don't know why that is either!
I like the idea that superfast cosmic rays are constantly bombarding us that must be coming from “a new kind of object in the universe that we don't know about” (and that the authors would like you to use your personal devices as cosmic ray detectors while you sleep, info here). And I like all the quirky coincidences of our universe: that subatomic particles could carry a charge of literally any value, but happen to have those that perfectly balance each other out (we wouldn't be here otherwise); that there is the ideal amount of mass and energy in the universe to give it its flat shape (one more or less hydrogen atom per cm² of space would curve or bend it in unusual ways); humans have evolved to our scientifically literate present at the perfect time in the history of the universe – when the forces of gravity and dark energy are balanced in their push and pull of the galaxies – in which to observe not only superclusters (“the largest structures the universe will ever know”) but also the routine night sky that first started us on the path to understanding the cosmos (a billion years from now, our sky will be dark as old stars die and everything else moves further away from us). As much as I liked these coincidences, the authors are careful to caution us away from finding anthropocentric significance in them (I seem to remember Stephen Hawking once saying that it's not that the universe was created specifically for human life, but that the universe, made randomly as it was, could only have created life that could survive in its uniquely random conditions. Something like that.)In the end, the unanswerable questions are all fascinating to think about, and along the way, Cham and Whiteson caught me up on what we do know today. I could have done with fewer llamas, ferrets, and puns, but without straining my brain, I learned plenty. Hard to complain about that."
3,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39346323-greg,2,"A very intriguing title, certainly and I found this to be humorous at times, but I don't know enough about quantam physics, etc., to tell the real from the jokes. For example, most of the footnote explanations are jokes themselves, but I'm not sure about the footnote 67 on page 156: ""Muons and taus are not extra-dimensional versions of electrons, because they don't have a regular mass spacing , and don't have the same weak-force interactions as electrons."" Some readers might think, ""Oh, exactly."" Some might laugh, IF this is a joke. And I think it must be a joke, as are most of the footnotes, but I have no idea. When the author talks about things I already know (the universe is expanding) and the author points out we really don't know why, I get that because I know that already.. But most of the time I wasn't sure what was fact or fiction. It took me three readings of Hawking's ""Brief History of Time"" before I felt I could follow it through. Then it was republished with an additional chapter or two and it felt to me the author of ""Brief History"" may have been just making things up all along. So, all in all, I really don't know, within this book, what we really do know and what we really don't know. Maybe that's the point. But I don't know, hence my two star rating. I recommend this to quantum physics experts only. And Sheldon."
4,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47021487-jose-moa,5,"This book is a good complement to de book What We Cannot Know by Marcus du Sautoy,because is not centered so much in the phylosofical side as in physics and cosmology.We are living a golden age of science popularization with a lot of good books abot disparate subjects.This one is a example,is a book that joins science,frontiers of science ,fine humor and amusing drawings.The book beguins saying that we only know the 5% of matter ,the rest 95% composed of dark matter and energy we almost have no idea.In the following chapters the book explains what we actually know and the questions about we have no idea.For put a few examples : Why are 3 generations of quarks and leptons? We have no idea.Are the quarks and leptons actually elemental? We have no idea.Why gravity is so weak with regard the other forces? We have no idea.Why there is a speed limit in the universe and why have its value? We have no idea.What is the origen of cosmic rays? We have no idea.Is the universe finite or infinite?We have no idea.Are we alone in the cosmos? We have no idea.why there are matter and no antimatter? We have no idea and so on.....A recomendable,easy reading,fun ,deep book about the to day limits of the knowledge of the our universe."
5,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5957642-jani-petri,3,"Pretty good popular scienceWorth reading. Maybe too much focus on cosmology for my taste, but we can not have everything. 3 more words needed because of this stupid app."
6,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23457359-c-sar,5,"If you gave up reading Stephen Hawking because you couldn’t grasp it but you really like science and want to understand weird and opaque concepts like particle theory, black matter, space ripples and the meaning of live, this is the book for you.It is great and fun reading, by real scientists with a no-bullshit approach on some of the most complex matters of cutting edge physics. Highly recommended."
7,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36740745-anna-shelby,4,A very lighthearted approach to some heavy questions and it's certainly solves none of them. I enjoyed the weird jokes and the fool proof examples make it a bit easier to understand the complicated science underneath. A good book to start your science quest with!
8,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4057172-jamie,5,"It's hard to overstate how good this book is at conveying, in a simple fashion and with an unending series of graphics and ""dad jokes"", some very complex materials. Each chapter is a topic in physics that ""we"" (we being scientists - I have almost no idea about most things) have surprisingly little idea about (hence the name), with topics that include time travel, the nature of empty space, why particles have mass, how big the universe is, etc. It's basic and strips out all of the math and hard bits, but what remains should prove fascinating for anyone with even a passing interest in science. The true success of this book is that it somehow strikes a perfect balance between something that a junior high student could easily follow, while avoiding a tone of ""talking down to"" the reader.One thing though: the jokes. They are uniformly terrible. Just so, so terrible. And yet...they become endearing almost immediately; probably because each page is bursting with a sense of enthusiasm and fun. "
9,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21017093-charlene,4,"Entertaining mix of text and toons. This is a great book for younger readers and those intrigued by physics but nervous or intimidated by the possibility of complicated explanations. There's no math here, but there are lots of interesting ideas--with good, vivid examples--and plenty of pop culture references and funny bits to stir up just about anyone's Sense of Wonder."
10,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8101737-peter-tillman,2,"I liked the *idea* behind this book: two hip young physicists, one a cartoonist, explaining how little we actually know about our universe. The execution -- well, the (alleged) humor, while OK in small doses, wore me down. I did learn some things, and the cartoon-diagrams were (sometimes) helpful. But, basically, the book's aim-point is people who know little about modern physics. Which does (kind-of) include me, except that I am (was) a professional geologist/geochemist, and I keep up with general physics (as best I can) at the Scientific American level. So, DNF at about 25% in, and not really the book for me."
11,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4,"covers topics in physics and cosmology where we have a profound ignorance of what is going on. Right now we can't answer questions like what is the stuff that makes up 95% of the universe, Why do we have charmed, Strange, top and bottom quarks which don't seem to have any purpose as far as we (ordinary matter beings) are concerned. Why three plus one dimensions, What about time. What happened before the big bang. Why inflation and what drives it. If you are interested in questions where the physicists are just as in the dark as you here is your book."
12,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21338059-travis-s,5,"Daniel and Jorge signed a pre release copy for me, and I'm a very excited to have read it! Very funny, as expected from the creators of PhD comics. Gives a great impression of the scope of our universe and just how much we don't understand. I recommend it for anyone to read!"
13,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7945180-rosey-waters,4,"Physics has always been my weakest subject in the sciences. It seems to be where my brain stops being able to pick things up with ease and instead goes “but whyyyyyyyy?!”So when I picked this up I thought it would help. Easy physics! Excellent!I still don’t understand physics. I found this boom to be dad joke filled and amusing all the same (the audiobook is filled with audio effects too).Ultimately, this was interesting but not illuminating. I enjoyed it, and even had some parts where I FINALLY understood some concepts I’ve struggled with make sense finally, but ultimately it was a book about things we don’t know. So I still don’t know much about physics!"
14,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,5,"""We Have No Idea"" is perhaps the funnest and funniest physics book I've yet to read! It's intriguing and profound, whilst also easy to understand, with great comic illustrations, graphs, and many jokes.... though some of the puns were a tad groan-worthy! It's an extremely gratifying read, discussing what we do know -- and pointing out many of the things that remain a mystery in our wild and wonderful and wacky universe. ""We Have No Idea"" is a must-read for anyone interested in this topic. It would probably be a great introductory book on particle physics and astrophysics, though I can't say for sure as I've read many books on this subject. It's definitely fun to read and very accessible to the scientific ideas discussed within."
15,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3735004-pamela,5,I was surprised to find this book to be funny..I often laughed out loudat the same time I was struggling with complicated concepts. There are so many unknowns; here is a tiny sample: why is the universe expanding and how will it end;wha is dark matter and dark energy; how big is the universe; what is time and what is space?I recommend this book and applaud the authors for their fun and humor.
16,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62788444-vladimir-slaykovsky,4,Without loads of silly jokes I would rate it 5 stars. It is on par with best Hawking's books. Latest discoveries such as gravitational waves and extrasolar planets are discussed
17,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5038680-eric-lin,2,"I couldn't take it. The writing is super patronizing, and tries to make everything a joke. There were informative portions here, but the tone was just insufferable (similar to how I felt about The Hard Thing About Hard Things)I get that this was written to make astrophysics more palatable to 'normals', but its effect felt more like the phenoma being addressed in The War on Normal People.You need to make jokes about deconstructing llamas (there is more than than one llama joke in this book, and one is already one too many), or how subatomic particles are having a party, to write an engaging book about a topic that is already very interesting. There was a particularly cringe-inducing section about fart particles ('farticles' groan).Bonus haterade: I listened to the audiobook, and they would include sound effects (SOUND EFFECTS!!) to crank these jokes up to a 11 on the 'how terrible are these jokes' scale. Do you really need to play fart sounds to accompany your farticles joke? If I wanted this level of humor, I would have stayed in the #dadjokes (AKA #badjokes) Slack channel at Goodreads.Anyway, I appreciate the effort, but if there's one thing I learned for sure from this book, it's that this guy most definitely has no idea."
18,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86302433-nanu,5,"If you've ever been curious about physics, astronomy and the fundamental questions of the universe, this is your book. Seriously. Daniel and Jorge are amazing at explaining mind-bogging concepts and scientific terms. I have two complaints, but these come as a fan of the podcast and not as a reader or the book:1- there's no mention of bananas1;2- there's no jorge co-reading the book. "
19,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385106-jamie,4,"Jorge Cham is a smart guy and the creator of the PHD webcomic, which pokes gentle fun at scientists and grad students. Daniel Whiteson is another smart guy --a partical phycisist at UC Irvine. Together they wrote this book about all the stuff in the universe that smart guys like them have no idea bout.Well, not ALL the stuff. Mostly it's about particle physics, astronomy, and related topics. How big is the universe? Are there more than three dimensions? What is time? Is there other life out there in the universe?The answer to every one of these questions is the same as its title: ""We have no idea."" But the interesting part is figuring out WHY we have no idea, and going through the things we DO know enough about to ask the question that we have NO idea about. For each question, Cham and Whiteson do a good job of walking you through a (very) simplified version of the current state of physics. Cham also provides little drawings and single panel cartoons that vary from informative to amusing to some combination of the two. It's a pretty good physics book for non-physicists, which is to say that it holds your hand while leading you out of your depth.At times, though, it may go a little too far in its attempts to be approachable and funny. It seems like every third sentence is a joke, and far too many of them are predictable or repetitious. And any time there is a list of concepts or examples, you can be 100% sure that the fourth one presented will be some joke about the funny animal or concept that they have chosen for that chapter. This is the chapter with the baboon jokes. This one has llamas. For this one we're mixing it up with jokes about marshmallows. It's too much and too tame to the point where it frequently detracts from the genuinely interesting stuff being discussed. It is too much Garfield and not enough XKCD (which, now that I mention it, did a similar and, I think, funnier book called ""What If..."").But as far as books that make you feel smarter because physics and science and stuff, We Have No Idea is still pretty enjoyable if you can learn to skim past every other joke. I learned a lot about what people haven't been able to learn, to the point where I'm pretty sure that scientists 200 years from now will have figured at least some of this stuff out and look back on us like we look back on cave men. It's nice to see it coming, in a way."
20,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30181442-yun,4,"While most books tell you everything there is to know about a topic, We Have No Idea flips that on its head and tells you all that we still don't know about physics and the universe (which is a lot, it turns out). I went into this book having some knowledge of the topics covered, and it was really interesting to see them approached from the other side of what we don't know yet, especially with respect to how these topics relate to each other and fit into a bigger picture.The tone and images throughout are a bit jokey and tongue-in-cheek, which is to say there are a lot of good (so good they're bad?) puns. I know some readers thought the jokes were a bit distracting, but I didn't feel they took anything away. I enjoyed them sprinkled through the pages and found that they livened up what otherwise would be very serious topics.I think if you go into this book expecting answers, you'll be disappointed. Instead, this book reads more like a discussion. It slowly explores our current thinking, how we got there, the limits of our knowledge, and where possibilities lie for more research in the future. At times, it does repeat itself with what it doesn't know, so the book could have been a bit more concise in its presentation.Overall, I got a lot of fascinating tidbits out of this book. It helped me connect some of my disparate thoughts into a more coherent picture of our universe, and left me with many questions yearning to be answered."
21,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,3,"This book has a compelling premise of ""these are the open questions in physics and some guesses as to what the answers could be"". For instance, we've identified and characterized some 18 sub-atomic particles yes seemingly all of the matter we see is made up of only three (up quark, down quark, and the electron) plus the force-carrying particles. What are the other 12 for? The book then walked through some 10 to 15 more questions and in some cases outlined what potential answers could look like.As much as I enjoyed myself, the book was constantly tripping over itself to make jokes. These jokes weren't generally funny, didn't help clarify the material, and simply added length. It was maddening. This book also seemed to very much be a ""whet your appetite"" book with the answers just being sketches and there being no in-depth discussion of who's working on the problem and the technology required to tackle it.Overall this book was frustrating but acceptable with occasional sections that were good. You can get most of the way here by reading the Wikipedia articles on ""open problems in physics""."
22,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"The illustrations in We Have No Idea seem like an attempt to copy Randall Munroe’s work in “What If” and XKCD, but these illustrations completely lack the visual wit of Munroe’s. Some help explain things a bit but most are a waste of space. And the attempts at being funny in this book are disastrous. The authors have many fine qualities, but being funny isn’t one of them. The jokes produce cringing rather than laughter. The huge number of failed jokes, both in the illustrations and in the text itself, drag this book down like an anchor tied to a man who is swimming for his life. It would have felt cathartic to read this whole thing with a red pencil and just line them all out.Ok. So much for the negative. I liked We Have No Idea because despite the cringe inducing jokes, the author are very good at explaining difficult scientific concepts. Also, the whole approach of looking at things we don’t understand in the universe was innovative and fun. You can learn a lot by focusing a bit on what you don’t know yet."
23,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1583312-christopher,4,"A properly pulled-off heist- physics doesn't even know what hit it. Reading notes:- The humor is egregiously bad/dumb, but in a comfortable, ugly couch kind of way that matches tone. - Any philosophical/intellectual deficiencies (and they are there), are easily forgivable because they simply mirror deficiencies in the larger scientific community. This does mean a few chapters are real duds, but seeing as the chapters on gravity, dark matter, the size of the universe, etc. were phenomenal, who cares?- That being said, the authors should be given due credit for delivering on the book's title. I really had no idea how deep our having no idea goes.*- Basically, this book really delivers on its premise, which is high praise. Highly recommended if you found yourself tempted by the premise.* Okay, maybe I had an inkling. See here: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."
24,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70858197-hrothgar,5,"This was a truly excellent read. The authors break down very difficult concepts into easy-to-understand explanations, with loads of relevant examples. Plenty of playful illustrations, gobs of humor, and a humble attitude toward what is (and is not!) known by science make this a delightful read. This book is highly accessible whether you have prior familiarity with modern quantum and relativistic physics or not, and yet even if you are well-read in this area, the authors' fresh and honest presentation of the state of knowledge can still teach you something. I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting either a gentle, lighthearted orientation to modern physics, or a seasoned science reader seeking a fresh perspective on where the mysteries really lie. Five stars!"
25,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55180466-akhil-munjal,5,"This book explains the deepest darkest secrets of our universe. Emphasis throughout the book are on questions science has no anwser for. And hence this book is different from many other books because instead of filling pages with half baked theories that may or may not stick, this book is upfront about what science just doesnt know, followed-up with some of the most promising explanations. I would recommend this book to readers with an existing basic knowledge of physics and science with a motivation to learn more without running into complicated equations and mathematics. I loved the fact that the audio book version uses well placed intonations and jingles that make this quite an interesting listening experience. I wish more audio books would take a cue from this approach."
26,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35600888-christopher-bradford,2,"This book was OK. I was a physics and astronomy major in college so I already knew most of the stuff they were talking about. Take out what I already knew and all of the corny jokes and attempts at humor and I found about 20% of the book useful. I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a strong science background. If you do have a strong background in science (physics, astronomy, cosmology) then much of this book will just be annoying. "
27,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,3,The ideas are so complex and so interesting but why does Cham talk to us like we're children? There are so many cutesy dad jokes and puns in here and I came for the science. I can't imagine anyone picking up a book about the universe that can't read it just for the ideas. It was so frustrating to read beyond all the cute to get to the very fascinating text. 
28,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3974931-aleksi,0,"Pros: explains the anti-intuitive and complex fundamentals of modern physics and cosmology succinctly and with admirable clarity.Cons: the constant barrage of groanworthy puns, dad jokes and tongue-in-cheek footnotes starts grating by the third chapter at the latest and it never, ever ceases.So is it a 3- or a 4-star effort? I have no idea."
29,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85693689-joshi,5,"What a wholesome book. The humor is really pleasant and integrated very well into the actual scientific content of the book.While it is called ""We have no idea"", after reading this you'll probably have learnt quite a few things.And if, like me, you have no idea about physics, the topics this book deals with are explained in a very casual and easy to understand manner."
30,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20566627-alvaro-p-rez,5,Extremely funny and informative. Manages to explain complex issues in physics in a simple and funny way. It's focus on uncertainty and unresolved questions (something I wish more science books would do) makes it a very intriguing read. And the drawings are cute. 
31,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4700048-fred-rexroad,5,I want to give 6 stars.
32,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10948462-gautam-kamath,4,I might have gone with 5 stars if not for the lame humour that repeatedly gets in the way of the narrative. Otherwise a wonderfully illuminating book on the mysteries of the universe. 
33,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39901666-ukasz-woli-ski,5,It left me with severe brain damage. I need more of this stuff. :) 
34,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6624611-simon-yoong,3,"A good introductory to the big questions of astrophysics and the cosmos. The humour is a little forced, though."
35,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63294595-florian,4,"Intriguing to read, but the graphics in the ebook version were way too small (at least in my experience) and 99% of the jokes were not funny."
36,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24559304-renato-lombardo,5,Incredibly fascinating and beautifully written.
37,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22109738-sascha-z,3,"""We Have No Idea"" is a fun and infotaining read about some of the big open questions in fundamental physics. These range from the ubiquitous problems of dark matter, dark energy, or the elusive quantum theory of gravity, to less mundane questions, such as ""Who's shooting superfast particles at the Earth?"", culminating in some intriguing speculations on whether or not we are alone in the universe.The unique selling point of the book is its PHD-comics-style illustrations. Those are mostly funny but — well, sometimes just a tad too much. It's a lovely idea to lighten up an esoteric topic by some amiable and lighthearted cartoons – but they should add some value by making the text easier to understand. Most of the time, though, they’re just rather pointless jokes, which can be distracting and repetitive if they’re found on nearly every page.The text itself tries to imitate this pattern: While the core ideas are well written (in plain language), Daniel Whiteson’s attempts at humor are just way too much and often childishly silly. Where Bill Bryson in “A Short History of Nearly Everything” only subtly sprinkled his main story with a few witty statements, in this work the jokes tend to be contrived and off the point. Annoyingly, there are quite a few footnotes which also turn out to be just nonsensical jokes.If you can handle these downsides, the book is a pleasant and amazingly light journey through the cornerstone problems of contemporary fundamental physics."

This book not only explains lots of different and fundamental physics laws, but primarily asks multiple questions... without answer.Do you like the universe? Do you like psychics? Do you have poor sense of humour? Grab this book!"
39,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3288454-aleksandar-mi-ovi,5,"What a refreshing, and charming take on what we know (or rather, don't know) about the universe. I would consider myself well-versed in the subject matter at hand—at least, as much as an amateur can be—but even I learned something new from most of the chapters. What's more is that while some of my previous notions about the concepts contained herein may have been foggy, and unclear, this book gave them form, and made them concrete objects that you can kick. Where I had problems talking about some of these concepts before, I now have an armed bazooka full of analogies, and stories. Ask me about the Kaluza-Klein Tower. I dare you.Cham, and Whiteson have a real talent for getting rid of the cruft from the core concepts, and duct-taping it with humour. Naturally, the humour helps a lot! Much of it is hopelessly cheesy, but it's never cringe-inducing. And I'll be the first to admit it, I laughed out loud a few times. It's spontaneous, nerdy, and good-natured. What's not to love?If you're a follower of PhD comics, this book is a no-brainer for you. And if you, like me, have a passion for science, or are even the least bit curious about our universe, I can't recommend this book enough."
40,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43537565-vincent-tsao,5,"I knew (almost) nothing about knowing nothing when I cracked open this book. As in, I had a minimal understanding of the depth of my ignorance. I learned more about particles, atoms, gravity, black holes, stars, space, matter, string theory, antiparticles, and light speed than I did in all my years in school. There are plenty of other subjects we trudged through with minimal applications to daily life (cough, calculus), but none I can remember that were fundamental to understanding our place in the universe. The world seems infinitely larger than when I started reading. This is a must-read for anyone remotely interested in understanding the complexities of the universe. It's also a perfect book for visual learners. Cham is a cartoonist with a PHD in robotics, so it's no surprise that this book spans all types of readers and learners. The concepts are well-explained, but the nature of the subject matter means this is no easy read. But if you're willing to sit back, think, and try to really understand what you're reading, you'll get the most out of it. Without the cartoons, this would still be one of the most educational books I've read. With the cartoons, this is a science book that is actually endless ENTERTAINING and is one of the best books I've ever read. "
41,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5042613-dale-furutani,5,"As someone who devours astronomy, cosmology and physics, it's getting exceedingly rare to find new information, or a new way of looking at things. This book focuses specifically on the biggest mysteries of our universe, the questions we're so far from answering most scientists have stopped asking. It's not afraid to speculate, which can be a lot of fun, and it really revels in the sense of mystery that makes science so exciting, something a lot of science books gloss over in the rush to provide answers. It was nice to stop and remember how little we actually know, and how much mystery remains.The dad-joke level humor was hit or miss, but does add to the charm of the book overall. I was also kind of hoping there would be chapter about how little we know about the phenomenon of consciousness, which is arguably one of the biggest mysteries of the universe, but these are all small complaints. A great read, and strongly recommended for arm-chair physicists with a philosophical leaning."
42,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66526198-dena,4,"You can't be sure what you do know, unless you know what you don't know. That is where this book is valuable to those interested in understanding the physical world.I love the title. One of my pet hates, is all the people who insist that they undestand how the universe works.My interest in theorectical physics is only slight. I am very much a practical person at heart, so I am not a natural reader for this book. Having said that I still enjoyed it because the writing is so amusing. I learned a lot as well.The authors have a remarkable talent for simplifying complex ideas and making them accessible to the widest possible audience. I think that they could write about anything and it would be a success. Author writers and presenters could learn a lot from them.For a well bound hardback on a niche subject, the price is surprisingly inexpensive.No hesistation at all in giving it top marks. An ideal book for libraries."
43,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1134433-mark,4,"I'm not a physicist or a mathematician, but I've always been drawn to the Big Questions. This book is just filled with Big Questions and lots of humor. Whiteson and Cham explain in layman's terms and with cute comics, the five percent about the universe that we do know, while opening up the readers' minds to the 95 percent of the universe that we are still stumped by. They explain how we might tackle these still unanswered questions and give us hope with the fact that we have managed to learn so much about our universe in just the last few hundred years. I admit that I read a few chapters more than once in attempt to absorb the heavy stuff, but that's because I really want to learn. Some of this stuff is downright mind boggling! and who could have guessed that footnotes could be so funny?"
44,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67249123-edward,4,"You'll no the score about this book just by looking at the title. Personally I find these books well worth trying as they make a good job of trying to explain things in a way that gives the average person an inkling into a subject that by its nature is in the realm of the academic. For the rest of us who aren't experts and maybe the public in general, the bigger question is why does it matter anyway and they tackle this too. In these miserable times it's important that we continue to support scientific endeavour even if the general benefits only come years later. It is also important to understand how the science community goes about its work and is constantly refinining its knowledge. A fine contrast with the junk we face daily from the media in the UK who constantly play with facts to bolster a position. Entertaining and informative"
45,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14215559-satya,4,"Humanity's understanding of the physical world is filled with a glut of chasms, grand canyons and huge yawning voids, which has had convulsed physicists. This book armed with infographics and cartoons presents a lucid explanation of science to the laity, who is inquisitive to do some mind-bending to understand the bizarre universe that besieges him/her. The duo authors although make an attempt in this book to make sense of the universe that ladened with the weird things which actually don't make sense, the narrative of the book turned to be more prosaic and repetitive. I think I can say it is written with a bit of cavalier attitude in the last few chapters. However, this book provides a light-hearted understanding of the ununderstandable universe. The take away from the book is --- today's philosophical questions are tomorrow's precise scientific experiments!"
46,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5411353-kevin-hogan,5,"This book covers a wide range of topics, from dark matter and energy to the questions of ""What is stuff made of?"" and ""Are we alone?"" -- and even why sometimes math has two answers but physics only requires one (it involves a cake cannon).None of the topics are touched on in great depth, but there is a bibliography. I learned a lot of new things in understanding why we don't know the things we don't know. I also have a better grasp on things which I sort-of-knew-but-didn't-entirely-understand.The writing style is engaging and conversational. The illustrations are sometimes helpful conceptually, but often exist to insert humor into a discussion where it wouldn't fit in the text. The footnotes also serve this purpose. There are 129 footnotes in this book, and I read every dang one.It hit all the marks for me. "
47,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12052386-sarah,4,"What an enjoyable read! This one certainly stretched my bounds of thinking while making me laugh. I would say to truly enjoy this one you MUST have a fundamental science background in some capacity. This book builds on concepts that without a sound foundation in physics and chemistry you'll probably be quite lost . If you've taken college level physics and chemistry though, and want a lighthearted popular science book to stretch your boundaries of thinking check this one out. One other thing to keep in mind, don't expect this book to answer any questions for you. This really is about bringing questions to the forefront and really making you ponder how much more is out there for human discovery. "
48,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41545118-anisa-khatun,5,"When you can find fun in the fundamental. Enjoyable bit by bit. My review can be little biased as I am a follower of PhD comics ( well I voted for this book last year, I admit ). I have my reasons. Here it goes. This book not only tells us what we don't know about our very existence and other fundamental questions goes by the title but also gives an overview of our so far understanding of physics . It's witty, funny and informative. One spoiler alert, I really like to share the idea of ""Crayfis App"" which turns your cellphone into a cosmic particle detector, yes it's real!! In science we share, right?. This one is a must read for anyone who loves science written in simple words with humourous sketches and word plays."
49,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43331194-jim,3,"I was a Goodreads winner of this book. It was an enjoyable read, filled with fun pictures and a light-hearted attitude about our universe. The premise of the book is that we don't know a lot about our universe but we shouldn't stop asking the questions. There are things in our universe that we can speculate on and have a bit of knowledge on but there are things out there that we just have no idea about. It made me think about all the ideas and concepts out there and wonder why sometimes TV programs seem so certain about what we do know about the universe when it is still a theory. A fascinating book that made me think about things beyond our own lives."
50,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67609021-maciej-kuczy-ski,4,"The book contains some solid knowledge and explains where we stand with science at the moment. The only gripe I have with it is that there’s too much humour for my taste. Don’t get me wrong, I love a good laugh, but in ""We Have No Idea"" the humour is just everywhere to the point where it becomes a nuisance and is distracting. It’s also not my type of humour since it’s very predictable – when the authors list some things, you can be sure that the last thing on the list is a joke and probably a random one at that (remember, random does not equal funny).Overall, it’s a good book for people who don’t know much about physics and would like to learn more about dark matter or dark energy."
51,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4378610-alan,5,"This physics book is really fun. Even my daughter who says she hates physics enjoyed the short selection I shared. (Deep down she loves physics). All the hardest problems of physics in one place. What is mass? What is time? What is space? (it's gooey, can be compressed or expanded or curved - and gives someplace for all those weirdos to be other than in your room now). Very clear explanations as to why these problems are important, challenging, and still unsolved. Great funny cartoons to illustrate the points. Highly Recommended."
52,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10349887-duc,5,A very easy-to-read book about science: the universe and quantum physics - explained in elementary way. I'd definitely recommend everyone to give this a try and update themselves about what we currently know about the universe. Maybe next year we will have to update several chapters of this book (hopefully) because that would mean we are still making progress in our quest to know the truth about our world. 
53,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11462400-chris-jaffe,4,"Fun and engaging look at all manner of Big Questions about the universe. And, as the title says, we really have no idea about this stuff. But this walks through the little we know, how we grasp at what we don't know, and all the rest. It's engaging written and has a bunch of entertaining cartoons sprinkled throughout. Downside: I'd usually forget what I'd read about shortly after reading it."
54,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31676140-joe-miller,2,"Who is the intended audience of this book?The subject matter gets kind of advanced. The humor can at times get a little grown up. But for the most part, the delivery is decidedly cartoonish (literally) and juvenile (cf. the footnotes that are not funny and do not elucidate or clarify much of anything but still manage number in the hundreds).Frustrating, because I feel like there is a funny, interesting (and much shorter) book in here, somewhere."
55,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72368-doc-opp,5,"This is just a fabulous book. If I had read this as an undergraduate, it may have made me a physics major. It is so full of wit and humor, so full of intriguing ideas, and so full of clear explanations of very complex topics. This is at once humbling and inspiring, serious and whimsical, and the sort of book I would highly recommend to any smart person who wants to better understand what we don't understand. One of the best non-fiction books I've read in recent memory."
56,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59656651-mahesh-gupta,5,"Guide to universe is one of most awesome book on physics that I could get my hands on, in last few years. A great introduction to various concepts (including cats :-P) which we do not understand completely. The book always starts with asking very basic every day question and flows into answering cutting edge physics question. It doesn't just introduce the topic but the whole path to it. Thank you Jorge for writing this amazing book :)"
57,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5246265-nick,4,"Science is not truth. Science is the way of discovering the truth. As this book points out, there are numerous things that have not yet been discovered, leaving us with centuries of scientific advancement that will continue to give us fascinating information about the universe.It would've been nice to have more references and expert interviews, but overall the topics are presented in an approachable way and the short comics embedded in each chapter help provide some brevity."
58,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15094741-priyank,4,"It is a very unique book which talks about what we do not know about the universe, and why it is hard to know about it. It covers a wide variety of topics, but also does a good job of explaining it in a simple language without throwing around jargons.The book is full of scientific puns and jokes (it is written by the author of PhD webcomic strip) that are actually funny."
59,0735211515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39733988-bruno,5,"Wanna know what we still don’t know about the universe? This book is such a fun ride through the biggest questions we have and we still have no idea how to answer them.The authors really know how to mix fun jokes and real content. You will probably have great laughs during the reading.I ended up with more questions than answers, but that is the purpose of the book. Mission accomplished."
