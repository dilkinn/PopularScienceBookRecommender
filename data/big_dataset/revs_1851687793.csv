Because I am not referring directly to Chad's book very much. I am expressing thoughts that were triggered through my reading of his book, and I find these thoughts fascinating. Still, there is a link to the book, and you will find it in the middle of my blurb under the heading ""A message to Chad"".The universe is making fun of meSo here's the problem: Particles do not exist - fields do. Fields do not exist - particles do. This insight is not helping me. In fact, I find that it leaves me profoundly frustrated. Clearly, the universe is conspiring against me. It is thwarting all my efforts to grasp what is going on. My intuition is failing. The way I have thought about the world all my life is useless when trying to understand how the world works at a deeper level. I am in a quagmire, I am thrashing around, straining to grasp the branch of a tree in an attempt to steady myself, to lift myself onto solid ground.The branch snaps, and I am being sucked down a little deeper into the pit.But hold on. Perhaps the problem is that I am not expressing myself properly. Perhaps the universe is not out to upset me. Perhaps I am just not using the right words. So let me try this again.What is a particle?My view of what a particle is has been shaped by an intellectual tradition that goes back to, indeed was started by, the Greek atomists of antiquity. As far as I know, Democritus is held to be the first philosopher who expounded an idea that matter is composed of indivisible entities called atoms. Although Plato thought the complexity of the universe could not be explained by the mere notion of atoms, his own idea of what we today call the ""Platonic solids"" shares with Democritus the notion that the world is composed of basic building blocks. Aristotle contradicted this idea by stating that the four elements (fire, water, earth, air) were continuous, but the idea of atomism survived the Middle Ages in the form of commentaries on Aristotle before experiencing a renaissance after the 16th century through thinkers such as Bacon, Gallileo, Hobbes, and, although in a slightly different form, Descartes.So the idea that an elementary particle is a tiny billiard ball that interacts with others just as its macroscopic counterparts in a game of pool (or snookers) is deeply ingrained, and I cannot shake it. But the insights of quantum physics tell a story that is simply irreconcilable with this mental picture. For one thing, these particles do not have a well-defined position. Before we try to measure the position, there is a chance that we will find the particle here, there, and everywhere. And in the case of these 'particles', this is not just a phrase! The normal state of a particle is ""superposition"", a state in which it exists in different positions at once. Another thing that is vaguely unsettling is that a particle can be part of a system in which it gives up its individual existence. In the spooky phenomenon called ""entanglement"", two particles duplicate each other's properties but also the range of spacetime points at which they may be encountered by a measuring observer. So, does it still make sense to speak of entangled particles in the plural? Are there really 'two'? What happens to the ultra-fundamental human concept of countability when we deal with entangled states?Well then. If a particle can be in different positions at once, and lose its haecceity (the characteristics that define a thing as a particular thing, also known in philosophical literature by the funny expression ""thisness""), then we are really not dealing with tiny billiard balls at all, are we?I am slowly approaching an insight here, I think. Maybe the universe is not playing a mischievous trick on me. Maybe language is. It makes no sense calling something a 'particle' that refuses to behave like objects that I associate with the word. So we really shouldn't. But what is it that 'particle physics' analyses? What do particle colliders collide? What do particle detectors detect?Who knows. Language has developed to describe things that we need to talk about because they happen in a world accessible to our sensory toolkit. Quantum things do not. So we are left with metaphors. I have started to think about particles as a kind of non-local 'fog' that is spread out across the entire universe, with different densities at different, specific, spacetime locations. The particles detected by particle detectors are more like ripples in a field, or ""excitations of the sensory material"", as German philosopher and physicist Meinard Kuhlmann said in a recent article in Scientific American (""What is Real?"", in Physics at the Limits, Scientific American Special Edition Winter 2015).Ok then. Disturbances in a field. This is much better. What is a field?Only it isn't. Turns out we are running into very similar linguistic problems when we adopt the expression 'field' in the hope this would solve the issues. But it is a slightly different kind of problem. This problem is at the same time less and also more severe. It is less so because the mental image of a 'field' seems less ingrained in the collective psyche than that of a 'particle'. But the physical description of a 'quantum field' turns out to be even more elusive if we insist that we cannot use a purely mathematical description to capture it. Anybody who was forced by their physics teacher at school to comment on the way that iron filings orientate when brought into proximity with a magnet knows what the classical interpretation of a field is. A classical field is a near-physical object in which every point has a uniquely measurable identity. I can measure the strength of a magnetic field in any one location. I can measure the force between a probe and the charge of an electric field at any point in the field.Not so for a quantum field. Quantum fields are non-local, and their quantities are not assigned to any specific points in space-time. Instead, their values are determined by a mathematical idea called the 'state vector'. The state vector can be formulated as a direct consequence of the superposition state of the 'particles' that give rise to the quantum field. In a baffling feat, 'particles' exist in all their allowed states simultaneously, like a schizophrenic who manages to act out all his different personalities at once. Accordingly, the state vector is a sort of probability-weighted average of all the allowed states of a 'particle'.Language as we know it simply fails to do justice to these phenomena. We have not developed any words that would allow us to capture these dynamics, simply because we never had any need to. A message to ChadSo perhaps we should not try. I feel that quantum physics, just as relativity theory, cannot be understood at a satisfactory intellectual level by reference to concepts we know. I am aware that in my own review, I have done the same, and introduced the metaphors of 'fog' and 'schizophrenic' to capture the behaviour of particles. But of course, while these words may help me to visualise what a state vector is a bit better, they may confuse others even more.Metaphors are not helpful in getting to grips with non-empirical subjects! So, Chad, would you please stop with the dog and the squirrels. I thought you explained the physics well, and I liked your book for these explanations, but I found myself skipping over the animal-metaphors very early on. I know that dog of yours is a brain-box, but I must confess I liked your book despite its unique selling point, rather than because of it.How shall we think about the world, then?Still. There is something that still leaves me unsatisfied. I am perfectly happy, on one level, to learn the maths required and think about 'particles' as state-vectors, and of their propagation as 'probability-waves', but there is something still missing. I still want to develop an intuitive understanding of these processes, I am not entirely content to leave them consigned to the realm of abstract mathematics.So what do we do? Help may be at hand in the form of a new branch of philosophical thought, unhelpfully, and I would even argue incorrectly, called 'trope ontology'. The first part of this weird expression is just a neologism for the expression 'property', and the second part refers to the philosophy of 'existence' (but, I would argue, the use of this expression is misleading, as the classical interpretation of ontology is exactly reversed in this new philosophy).The idea of this revised way of thinking about reality is to reverse the relationship between an object and its properties - and then get rid of the object. Meinard Kuhlmann, one proponent of this way of thinking, gives the example of a ball in the article I referenced earlier - I am going to go beyond what Meinard said, but my thoughts on this subject rest on his idea: Consider a simple object, say a red, squishy ball. An adult recognises the object as a ball first, and then identifies properties attached to the object - round, spherical, squishy, red. An infant would not do this. An infant would recognise the properties first: there's something bright, it is squishy to the touch, and it feels the same way whichever way I hold it. Later on, the infant learns to refer to this bundle of properties by using a shortcut phonetic code. This code is the word 'ball'. Through usage, the infant will then learn to replace the bundle of properties with the linguistic label. At that point, the transition will be complete - the ball will have properties, the bundle of properties will no longer exist independently of its physical carrier, as they used to do in the observer's infancy.But if we thought of objects as abstract bundles of properties, we would find it easier to intuit the world of quantum dynamics. What we used to call a 'particle' is a collection of properties. These properties do not need a physical carrier to exist meaningfully, and as they do not, neither do they need a linguistic label that fixes a mental picture that robs them of this free existence. The properties are mass, charge, and spin, and also position and momentum.So it seems that the new and alien world of quantum physics may provide more than a deeper understanding of nature. If understood well, it may re-define our relationship with language itself, and remind us that words are simply shortcuts that we use to define bundles of properties. If we managed to understand this fact consciously, we would enhance our ability to grasp the dynamics around us on a philosophically deeper level than ever before. We would be able to recognise the limitations of language, and in so doing re-define somewhat the idea that we and 'reality' are somehow disparate entities. The study of quantum physics, combined with a conscious re-definition of how we perceive reality, may lead us again to the insight that a conscious intellect is the 'unverse observing itself', and even cross Wittgenstein's barrier that language is the final obstacle to reality.Why Four Stars?Well. For some time while I was reading the book, I was in two minds about my rating. In fact, I was in five minds, one for each potential rating for the book. I existed in a state of superposition of five allowable states at once, and the state vector describing this phenomenon is:|Rating> = a(1) |*> + a(2) |**> + a(3) |***> + a(4) |****> + a(5) |*****>The amplitudes 'a(t)' of the states '|Stars>' are complex numbers normalised so that the sum of their squared moduli is unity (equals one). The amplitudes a1 to a5 in my state vector are 1/8; 1/4; 1/2; 1/sqrt(2); sqrt(11)/8. When I measured my state, I found that the outcome was ""4 stars"" with highest probability of 50%."

I loved almost every page. I've seen quite a few comments that thought the ""talking to the dog"" metaphor got tired. All I can say to those people is ""you obviously don't love your dog!"" Or, worse, perhaps you're a cat person. My only problem with Emmy (the dog) was that she's clearly smarter than my dog, who really didn't get a thing out of this book.Like when Emmy doesn't get a joke: ‘“It's a physics joke,” I explain, because that always makes things funnier.’ How can that not be funny?



Orzel has a tendency to state a proposition, then use it later as a proof, which is bad science but probably good science-writing—actually demonstrating the proof would lose a lot of readers. For instance, ""Back in chapter 2, we saw that the wave nature of matter gives rise to zero-point energy…"" Well, no, we didn't. Back in chapter 2, he stated that. And, in fact, near the end of the book, where I pulled this quote, he actually does explain zero-point energy better. We didn't ""see"" this in chapter 2, but that's really just a quibble with his English rather than a complaint about the way he explains his physics.



Whenever Orzel starts getting too far into dry science, Emmy gets him back on track. ""So, basically, nothing is defined in an absolute sense? Isn't that kind of … postmodern?"" No wonder I have so much trouble with quantum mechanics. I have so much trouble with postmodernism…



I was a bit disappointed in what I thought was short shrift given to the Many Worlds interpretation, but I guess his point was essentially that it could be entirely right but we can't ever know, because all those other worlds are lost to us. But again, Emmy keeps us on track. She likes the Many Worlds interpretation, because it has quantum bunnies made of cheese. She's not so enthralled with the Copenhagen interpretation: ""I don't think I like this interpretation, it's awfully solipsistic, isn't it?"" Well, duh, that's the postmodernism thing, again. Again, I'm a little disappointed in my dog. I had to define solipsistic for Vinka (which, of course, meant I had to check the dictionary).



Orzel may understand quantum physics, but he's not always right about dogs. ""A dog won't find dropped food on the same block every day, and a photon won't interact with a molecule in the same part of the interferometer every time."" I beg to differ. My dog can be guaranteed to find food on the same block of Wolsdon street every morning. I'd give it about an 80% probability of being in front of one of three houses.



Emmy also makes some great observations. On quantum tunneling:

“So the elec­trons just drill holes through the bar­rier?” 


“No, they pass through it as if it weren’t there at all. They don’t have enough en­ergy to punch through.” 


“But how do you know that?” 


“Well, the elec­trons show up on the far side of the bar­rier with ex­actly the same en­ergy as be­fore they hit it. If they were bor­ing lit­tle holes through the bar­rier, they would lose some en­ergy in the process, and we’d be able to de­tect that.” 


“Maybe they’re just re­ally tiny holes?”


“No, we can look at that with a scan­ning probe mi­cro­scope, and there aren’t holes.”

That's a pretty huge jump. Again, we're expected to accept that what he has just stated as a proposition is actually proven. How do we know that a scanning probe microscope can actually detect those ""really tiny holes?""



Sometimes Orzel makes statements he never makes any attempt to explain. On quantum teleportation: “You could use it to make a quan­tum ver­sion of the In­ter­net, if you had a cou­ple of quan­tum com­put­ers that you needed to con­nect to­gether.” I know a fair bit about the Internet, a fair bit about physics, and have a better than average understanding of quantum mechanics… and I'd love to know how that's going to work.



My biggest complaint with the book is actually nothing to do with Orzel. As written, it keeps citing page numbers of previously mentioned theorems and experiments: but they refer to a page number in some particular dead-tree-book edition. They aren't correct in my e-book edition, and they probably wouldn't have been correct in every DTB edition—or if they are (which means they must have been corrected for every other edition) why aren't they corrected for the e-book? It's particularly strange, because this e-book had the best footnoting of any e-book I've ever read, but it couldn't do page references.



All in all, it's a great introduction to quantum physics for people who know nothing of physics. It's not useless for people like me who have a fair bit of physics background, but are not up on QED; and of course it's probably terrible if you're a graduate quantum physicist.




But, dammit, we got through the whole book, and Vinka is still asking me why you can't know both the momentum and the position of a squirrel. Are we going to have to read this again?




Postscript [2017.11.20]: Perhaps I've been unfair to Vinka. This morning, as always, she was stalking squirrels in the park. Normally, when she goes on point, I can trust that there really is a squirrel, even if I can't see it, but this time I was certain there was no squirrel.
""There's nothing there.""
""Wait…,"" Vinka said.
We did, and sure enough a squirrel hopped into view.
""See—quantum physics! If you wait long enough, particles are generated spontaneously.""
""But, Vinka, they're generated in pairs. If there's a spontaneouosly created squirrel, there has to be an anti-squirrel.""
""Well, duh!"" she said. ""I'm the anti-squirrel!""



Perhaps she got more out of this book than I had thought.

3,1851687793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3563552-pat,4,"One of the things I love to do is browse around in the library looking at whatever catches my attention. I like to look over the new fiction and nonfiction sections, as well as just wandering the stacks pulling down and scanning all kinds of books. On one of my trips to the library last year, I discovered “How To Teach Physics To Your Dog”. I was amused by the cutesy title, but I was hooked as soon as I started reading the book.This book is an overview of quantum physics. Now I know that most people would rather undergo painful dental surgery than spend their free time reading a book about science, but this book deserves a chance. The author uses the literary devise of explaining physics to his dog to make the topic accessible and interesting. He makes the point that dogs (and nonscientists) have an advantage in learning quantum physics because they have fewer preconceived notions of how the world works, so they can more easily accept some of the basic concepts.Another facet of the accessibility of this book is that is has very little math. Physics is sometimes defined as the mathematical explanation of the physical world, so how can you do physics without math? The answer is simple. Dogs can’t count, let alone calculate square roots so the author uses concrete examples using bunnies, squirrels and dog treats to illustrate concepts like particle-wave duality and quantum tunneling.The book starts with a basic introduction to what quantum physics is, and how it differs from classical physics. From there it covers a number of topics, including Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle and the famous thought experiment known as Schrödinger’s Cat. Each chapter starts with a conversation between the author and his dog Emmy about a particular topic. From there the author moves to an explanation of the topic and the experiments used to prove the theory correct.I must admit that I cannot say I truly understand all the information presented in the book, but I read it with pleasure anyway. The material is presented in a way that the reader can get the general idea, and continue on without getting bogged down. As the complexity builds, the author gives you every opportunity to see how the ideas are interconnected with references to prior mentions (with chapter and page numbers). There is also a helpful glossary in the back of the book of many of the terms used.One of the things that impressed me about this book is how new many of the discoveries are. Some of the research cited was done in the 1990s and early 2000s. If you ever wanted to get a glimpse at what it like to be as smart as a rocket scientist, or have any curiosity about particles and waves, give this book a try."
4,1851687793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10138645-graeme-skinner,2,"This book was a real struggle.I was recommended to read this as a light hearted way to learn a little bit more about Quantum Physics and to be honest, it wasn't that bad. The book starts off with the main character being Chad, I presume, talking to his dog about bunny rabbits and other garden animals. Each chapter starts off very light hearted and flippant, where he sets the scene and for example, gets the dog to talk to him about chasing bunny rabbits and why they always escape him when he chases.... So the dog has a great idea to split in 2 and go both ways round the tree, that way, the bunny can't escape...Well, after that, it breaks into super heavy reading about physics and how the dog would need to go so slow that it would take him longer than the universe's existance to seperate and refract around the tree... Orzel then proceeds to write the equations and explanations for this before moving on to the next chapter.... Quantum Tunnelling or something like that....It was heavy reading in all, whilst I relatively enjoyed it, I wouldn't read it again and by the last couple of chapters I found myself almost forcing myself to complete the read...In summary - if you like Physics, you'll enjoy this book....If you have a degree in physics, dont bother reading it....If you don't like physics, but like dogs, then read the first half of each chapter.... :)"
5,1851687793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8015925-louisa-heath,4,"'Why Talk to Your Dog about Physics?'In his attempt to bring the rather complex discipline of quantum theory/physics/mechanics to the masses, or at least those masses who chose to pick up a science book, Orzel uses the interesting framing device which the book's title alludes to. Conversations between Orzel and his adopted German Shepard cross Emmy are sprinkled liberally throughout the text, adding some needed lightness between the heavier chunks of hard quantum theory.Subjects discussed by the human-canine duo range from bunnies made of cheese, to hypothetical threats that are both steak and chicken flavour until measured (i.e. eaten), and even to evil squirrels with goatees who come from a parallel dimension. Naturally all of this does lead on to more relevant scientific concepts including particle-wave duality, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and quantum tunneling. Each successive chapter builds upon its predecessors with a gradual increase in the complexity of the theory being handled. It is advisable to try reading through this book in as few sittings as possible, just so that the concepts and lessons of earlier chapters are still relatively fresh in the mind and clearly understood when they are inevitably needed again.This is a fairly compact book that nevertheless tackles some large, meaty aspects of the field in a manner that makes for a comprehensive and largely enjoyable read. Dog-style analogies provide a good introduction to the intricate and often confusing world of quantum physics. "
6,1851687793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24081766-michel-meijer,5,"This book offers a light explanation of the basic phenomenon of quantum physics, the wave function. I was looking for such explanation (not too high level, no mathematics) and this book really hit the sweet spot. Especially the first chapters were very good, after 50% the book focussed more on the weird universe of quantum teleportation and the measurements done in quantum optics, in line with the professional interest of Chad Orzel. One could argue if the dialogs between Chad and his dog Emmy were necesary, as the writing style may be perceived as childish, but afterwards, it actually provided the comic relief in a tough subject like quantum physics. I learned quite a lot from the stories and explanation and can recommend this to anyone with a popular scientific interest in (quantum) physics. 5 stars."

He'd need to be there with me and his dog and for demonstration purposes, and then I could go, ""wait, wait, what?!? can you slow down a bit? Okay, so waves... like the ocean, but we can't see them, and sound behaves like waves but also refracts? shit, okay, wait, start from the beginning."" Physics is var interesting, but damn, so difficult! "

It is a very down to earth and accessible introduction to Quantum Mechanics and the strangeness of Quantum world. You will get the Uncertainty Principle, Wave-Particle Duality of course but you will get Quantum Tunneling, Aspects of QED, Quantum Zeno Effect, The Quantum Eraser experiment, and the Many Worlds Interpretation. Very fun book and makes the subject more easily graspable. Definitely glad it was lent to me."
9,1851687793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,2,"Maybe a dog person would find Chad Orzel’s attempts to talk quantum mechanics in the language of a pet and her owner more endearing. How to Teach Physics to Your Dog is Yet Another Pop Sci look at quantum mechanics, albeit one from a more technical than, say, historical perspective. Orzel frames each chapter within a conversation with his dog, Emmy, grounded in the context of something a dog would do, like hunt bunnies or eat treats. Unfortunately, the writing tries too hard to be cutesy and funny. I found this device far too distracting and cheesy for my tastes, and it adds very little to Orzel’s explanations.As far as the quantum mechanics go, the development is fairly standard. It’s hard for me to approach books like this from the eyes of a first timer, because I’ve read so many—I don’t pretend that means I know a lot about quantum mechanics, but you do start to hear the same stories over and over. We are quite fortunate to live during a renaissance in books about quantum mechanics, so really, you are spoiled for choice. I don’t think How to Teach Physics to Your Dog is going to make it onto my list of recommended physics reads, though.Orzel’s explanations, while admirably complete, also tend towards a level of technical complexity that belies the book’s pop science label. This is, of course, always the difficult balancing act these writers face: the more you lean on analogy or sacrifice detail, the less accurate your rendition of quantum mechanics becomes—but the more you strive for accuracy, the harder it is to comprehend. The former scenario makes for better reading, but it also introduces the potential for more misconceptions. As Orzel points out in the second chapter, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is well known even in popular culture—but it is also often misinterpreted as a statement about measurement rather than a statement about reality. I liked his explanation of that, as well as his explanations of the Copenhagen interpretation versus the many worlds theory. I was less enamoured whenever he started talking about photons as waves and interference patterns … the way he was explaining it ended up confusing me and doubting my knowledge of quantum physics rather than honing it!The last chapter is a curious kind of addendum, in which Orzel debunks some of the abuses of the word “quantum” to promote healing scams or free energy scams. I have mixed feelings about this. On the one hand, I really like it when scientists take on these kinds of claims and explain why they are bunk and should be viewed sceptically. Also, Orzel does a pretty good job with those explanations. On the other hand, the tone is somewhat different from the rest of the book, so this last chapter feels less connected to what comes before.All in all, this is a competent work of popular science. It has some good explanations and some confusing ones. I think Orzel demands or assumes a level of comfort with math higher than one might expect from the audience that would be drawn to the book’s framing conceit. That is to say, if you’re reading this because you like physics talk involving dogs, you might not be so happy with the equations and symbols Orzel occasionally throws your way. I can totally see there being a sweet spot, though, an audience for this book both dog-happy and math-friendly—but I just don’t belong to that, and I have plenty of other physics books I still need to read.

10,1851687793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/742181-kit,4,"The ""teaching to your dog"" gimmick is cute at first but gets kind of old eventually, even though I'm sure that Orzel's dog is, as she reports, a VERY good dog. :) The thing I really liked about this book is that Orzel actually goes into detail about how the experiments were designed that proved various aspects of quantum theory. I've never read a popular physics book that didn't just skip over that part, and it made some of the concepts a lot easier to understand."
11,1851687793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25443702-zsombor,4,This is a perfectly cogent ultra-light introduction to quantum physics. My only complaint is that the dog bits are entirely superfluous and slightly annoying.
12,1851687793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,5,"This is an excellent book, despite its quirky, and somewhat cringe-making, style where the author is talking to his dog - and the dog, who is already quite knowledgeable about physics, replies. In the late 1960s, I had studied quantum mechanics at university as part of a chemistry degree course so I had some prior understanding of the subject matter. I found this book both refreshed what I knew and considerably added to it. It's far less mathematical than the book on quantum physics by Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw (Brian Cox Jeff Forshaw) and, perhaps because of that, is much more enjoyable. The bizarre world of quantum physics comes across much more powerfully in Chad Orzel's book than it does in Cox and Forshaw's work, and leaves much more of an impression on the reader. If you don't mind a talking dog, and frequent references to bunnies, then this is an excellent introduction to quantum physics."
13,1851687793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4174566-linda-addison,5,I had a lot of fun reading this book. Cuz the science geek in me can't get enough of this stuff. This book makes some serious science concepts easier to grasp and makes me laugh (per conversations with dog).
14,1851687793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108107400-michelle,5,"I'm still utterly bewildered by quantum mechanics, but dang Orzel sure did try. An excellent book. He helped me understand the uncertainty principle in a way I never had before, and if I couldn't quite make the leap to its application in the subsequent chapters, well, I truly don't think the fault lies with the author. I learned a ton, even if I still find it all too slippery to fully grasp.If you're new to the extreme weirdness that is quantum, I don't recommend you start here, though. The book is not an introduction to the ideas, but rather an attempt to explain its core concepts with some depth and specificity (albeit briefly and in lay terms). I would instead recommend Orzel to anyone who has already read a fair bit about the ideas of modern physics, and would now like to try and understand *why* reality works in such bizarre ways, and how physicists think they know the things they claim to know.Orzel's descriptions are clear, accessible and well laid out. He includes lots of helpful diagrams and explains what each different kind of experiment can and can't prove, how and why. The dog analogies usefully repeat the info in terms compatible to the way we experience real life. They also provide a nice frame to contrast the difference between the classical and quantum worlds, and explain why effects look so different when things get big. (Not being a dog person, I thought these sections might start to grate after a while, but they were actually tremendously helpful). Overall, the tone is fun and humorous, and I enjoyed the occasional touch of snark. Next up, m Al-Khalili's Quantum: A Guide for the Perplexed. We'll see how they compare - and whether repetition and a different way of presenting the weirdness continue to nudge me along a wee bit in my attempts to comprehend the incomprehensible."
15,1851687793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46503824-jithin-mukundan,5,"This book is about the author teaching quantum physics to his English speaking dog Emmy. This technique, I think, is supposed to explain quantum physics in such simple words that even a dog could understand. But does the complexity of quantum physics lie just in how it is explained? I don't think so (or probably I am less intelligent than his dog). Anyway, this book gives a good idea about quantum physics and the phenomena associated with it. The author knows his subject very well and knows how to explain it without relying on mathematical equations. I particularly liked how he explained Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. People usually tend to explain it as an inability of measurement, which is not the only reason of uncertainty. Randomness of particles is a law of nature.Certain other parts of this book, like explaining quantum Zeno effect and quantum teleportation, I think, could have been done in a better manner. The author was focussing too much on explaining these using dog equivalents that the details of the experiments were missing and it was simply confusing. I would recommend this book if you have some basic knowledge about quantum physics. Otherwise I am not sure whether reading this book could be a starting point. Interactions with the dog made the reading light, but I don't think it was making it any simple."

With a more fine-grained rating system I'd give it 3.5 stars, but given how much fun I've had while also learning new things have pushed it to 4 stars on Goodreads.The unique concept behind the book is both its charm and the reason for me to doubt whether or not to give it a slightly lower rating. The conversations that Chad Orzel has with his ""very good dog"" Emmy are mostly cute and original, but the trick eventually did start to wear me down a little bit.The real surprise for me was that the author goes deeper into the material than I anticipated. Somehow I had the expectation that this would be dumbed down a lot, but the latter half of each chapter proved to be quite informative. There is no room for actual proof or big equations in this book, but I don't think that that would have been fitting in this context.Overall this is definitely recommended to anybody that's interested in a broad discussion of all things relation to quantum physics."
17,1851687793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41407616-jorge-rosas,3,"A complicated yet quite enjoyable book about quantum physics, it follows the interactions and dialogue of a scientist and his dog, their dialog starts the explanation on various topic and their mechanics as, for example, it is explained why the dog cant be on two places at once to cross a three and ambush a squirrel. It has a lot of complicated stuff to explain but it does so with everyday examples how explains why the physics of the very small are so weird and different from the normal everyday physics. It was an enjoyable and educational reading. "

Accessible to the point that I actually understood big chunks with varying degrees of uncertainty (that was a quantum joke, right there). Definitely worth a go. The writing and tone were fantastic - it’s the quantum bits that were more difficult to get my head around. So 5 stars for the writing, the content, fewer by their very nature..."

22,1851687793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30833806-paul,5," For me, there is something about the study of how the universe is put together that grabs my brain and won't let it go. There is something beautiful in how everything is connected and by studying this interaction we learn just how similar everything truly is. While a great many books have been written on the subject by minds far greater than mine, many can be a struggle to get through without a much better understanding of the subject. What Orzel attempts to do in this book is break it down into my digestible parts. This is done ion the form of Emmy his must trusted and smart than the average dog.  Emmy has two great obsessions in life, the first is how to get food at her beckon call. The second is how to capture evil squirrels, complete with small goatee beards, the squirrel not Emmy. Now at this point, you may well question what these two things have to do with quantum physics. Well as it turns out quite a lot. As it can help with the acquisition of both. As Emmy asks her questions her owner attempts to you use science to help in her goals. Some reviews I read complained about this very thing, and I have to ask my self what exactly they thought they were getting into when buying a book called how to teach quantum physics to your dog. For me at least I think it's a light-hearted way to tackle such a big subject and also may be a way of getting younger readers into the book. It also goes a long way to add some humor to the subject and the book as a whole. Not that for me it needs it as I find the subject fascinating but it's still a nice touch. The book deals with some very big subject within the field, and in the case of most books if you only have a passing interest it can lead to it wrinkling your brain. With this text, it for me was just the right amount to get a grasp of the basic concepts for each problem he was trying to explain. No, I must say that I did not read this book entirely in one sitting. It felt like the kind of book to read alongside something else. you could go through a couple of chapters a day and you would be fine. It would also allow the mind time to process all the ideas and concepts being thrown at it. And for its worth, there are a lot. What you are not going to get her is a real deep understanding of the subject. Each of the topics talked would need there own book. But I did feel that it would be good to peak someone's interest and have a starting block to jump off from. Despite the heady subjects tackled I felt the author presented them In a way most of us could understand relating them to real-world problems something easier said than done when talking about how our very universe is put together.  As I said previously this book is a starting point, if you have already read a lot on the subject or even study it, then this is not the book for you. But it can work as a great aid for those young minds or curious older ones and will provide a few laughs along the way from a dog who very much like a treat, please."
23,1851687793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1452657-dennis-d,4,"In my GoodReads review of Sarah Vowell's book The Wordy Shipmates, I likened that work to ""a history lesson given by an impossibly hip professor."" To recycle that sentiment, How to Teach Physics to Your Dog is like taking a quantum physics class from a really cool teacher. Actually, author Chad Orzel is a physics professor, at Union College in NY. He also writes a science-y blog called Uncertain Principles, http://scienceblogs.com/principles/ (science-y, yes. But today a photo of his young daughter is featured prominently on the home page. So it’s not a complete geek-fest). Is he qualified? Dig around on his website a little, and you can check out his credentials in sections called ""Who is this clown?"" and ""Does he know what he’s talking about?"" My theory is that the title 'Quantum Physics for Dummies' was already taken, so Orzell opts for a similar approach, and instead invites us to listen in on elaborate conversations about quantum physics that he carries on with his dog, Emmy (who can also be found online on both Twitter and Facebook). Emmy listens intently – she is a GOOD GIRL!! Yes she is!! - but also asks good questions. Especially if she suspects that quantum physics may help her get more treats, or catch the squirrels or bunnies that turn up in the back yard. It sounds like a corny premise, but by the end, talking-Emmy seemed completely natural.I’ll spare you a total rehash, since I’d have to re-read the book a couple more times to be able to debate The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, or fully explain Schrödinger’s Cat. But Orzell takes these concepts, and other quantum physics concepts like them, and basically explains them slowly and clearly enough that even a higher-math nitwit like myself was able to follow along without any problems. Would I know if this were a bad physics book? Probably not. But it's short (225 pgs. + glossary and such), succinct and entertaining. This book was given to me as a Christmas present, and I'm thankful for that. I might have never stumbled across it on my own, but it was a total hoot, and I enjoyed it thoroughly."
24,1851687793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6098128-huw-evans,4,"We are all taught the basics of Newtonian physics at school, of gravity, force, mass and acceleration. Some of us can vaguely remember the equations learned to get us through exams, even if we were uncertain of their value in the real world. When I watched a physics teacher overcome the potent effects of gravity by lifting a paperclip from a tabletop I wondered what was the value of the things we were being taught. This was the same gravity, surely, that kept the moon in place, so what stopped matter flying apart on a regular basis?At the level of the atom Newtonian physics doesn't work. This was discovered at the turn of the twentieth century and set the world of physics and mathematics on fire. Was everything that we believed to be true to be turned on its head? Did it really matter to those of us excluded from the intellectual and philosophical circles? The world kept on turning in spite of the discoveries and experiments, the debates and arguments. We continued to stand upright without falling away from the earth and the Australians still have some internal mechanism that allows them to live upside down without all the blood rushing to theirs heads!Chad Orzel is a quantum physicist, who owns a very intelligent dog called Emmy. Emmy wishes to know whether this area of science will allow her to catch bunnies and squirrels in a more successful way. The short answer is, ""no"" because she is too massive but in explaining to Emmy why this is not possible (yet) he breaks the world of quantum physics into manageable pieces. I am grateful to Emmy's spirit of enquiry because I have learned a lot from this book. The world of quantum physics suits me personally, where nothing behaves quite as you would expect and the outcomes are based on probabilities and wave functions. It also explains why solid matter doesn't fall apart which is quite reassuring.Could I teach this to my dog? I doubt it for two reasons. Firstly my understanding of the quantum world is nowhere near as good as Professor Orzel's. Secondly, my dog is nowhere near as smart as Emmy."
25,1851687793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26876183-alisa-bagrova,3,"Initially, this book really made me excited as I finally immersed into quantum physics as it always looked so fascinating. Now I'd say, if someone wants to read a book on quantum physics merely out of interest and horizon broadening, this is just the book. Other than that, the further you dig, the more it starts to become annoying. That is simply because quantum physics can't be taught on a macro level, therefore the examples given start to interfere with further understanding. I found myself cringing towards the end of the book as more and more dogs and rabbits made of cheese appeared. The introduction is really nice, but the end throws too many silly examples towards you that are then tied to serious context and these two interfere so much that it's hard to understand what's happening where. I'd recommend this to someone who has no clue about quantum mechanics, however, a more serious reading is required if you're actually interested in it."
26,1851687793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2729402-thomas-holder,2,"Evidently, teaching me quantum physics is harder than teaching a dog. Whilst I tried to read this book sequentially, absorbing every snippet of information I could, but I couldn't. I re-read most chapters, sentences and sometimes words, but finished it eventually. Generally, I found the dog conversations quite annoying and strange (my dog is usually just sick everywhere), but they maybe made things slightly easier to comprehend. Quantum physics is a really hard topic and I'd suggest taking this book on with a lick of salt and some lemon to make it go down easier, but if you like this stuff then there aren't many better books out there.

I was particularly fascinated by quantum particle entanglement, Hawking radiation, antimatter, particle teleportation, which is, by the way, just copying one state of quantum particle to another, not actual teleportation :D, Schrodinger's cat thought experiment and tunneling, but there are plenty of other things to wrap your brain around, all put brilliantly by author. The evil squirrels and bunnies made out of cheese I will let you discover for yourself :) "
28,1851687793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90930-yoon,4,"Despite the cover, this is more properly a popular science book about quantum physics, presented through a series of humorous dialogues between the author and his dog Emmy. The writing is charming and accessible (the chapter on quantum entanglement is probably the most difficult one, but no one ever said quantum physics was easy), and this made perfect bedtime reading: both fun and informative. I was especially tickled by the final chapter, which debunks some quacks' use of quantum physics terminology."
29,1851687793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7038934-tin-wee,2," I must be a stupid dog. The book tries to explain basic concepts of quantum physics in as layman a language as I think is possible, and I think I understand at a superficial level what some of the theories are, but I found some of the concepts difficult to grasp even after rereading many times. One thing I found disappointing was there wasn't much explanations on how it makes things like quantum computing and LED switches work. What I did like was the last chapter which exposes many of the frauds which capitalise on quantum theory to make money from the gullible."

It is popular science and it is written in such a manner that even laymen are able to understand at least the basics. Quantum physics still blows my mind, but the funny examples with squirrels and rabbits made it easier to at least understand what's going on in the experiments. I would recommend it as an introduction to the field for all laymen."

I can not say I knew anything about Quantum Physics, and I am not sure that I am yet an expert, however I think I do know a little more. Chad Orzel is clever enough to make a complex subject understandable for his dog, maybe I could understand a little too. I like the cross between Physics and Philosophy, I am not sure as I coped with the maths. I did find the book an interesting and fun read. I just need to catch up with his clever dog. "
33,1851687793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2335215-theresa,3,The conversations he had with his dog were just too much; I skipped basically all of them after reading the first few.

The basis of this book was neat and an overall interesting idea.

Not fiction, however I did still thoroughly enjoy this book, the concepts discussed were very interesting, especially the chapter on particle wave duality. I would only recommend this to somebody who enjoys physics - A LOT, as it is technical and found myself re reading some pages just to grasp the ideas. You do not, however, have to have any advanced understanding of Quantum Physics to read this book, hence the title, but I would recommend knowing a least the basics."

Emmy asks her owner just the right kind of insightful questions that help illustrate the weird and wonderful concepts of quantum mechanics.The topic of quantum physics, is arguably one of the most mind-bending scientific subjects. A professor at Union College in Schenectady, NY, and a quantum physicist, Chad Orzel, explains quantum physics to Emmy, his precocious German shepherd in this book, making the mind-bending topic a little less traumatic when the going gets tough (quantum physics has a certain irreducible complexity that precludes an easy understanding of its implications). The book is extremely well-written, combining a scientist's rigor and accuracy with a natural raconteur's storytelling skill. Highly recommended to anyone wishing to learn more about this fascinating topic.In the book’s footnotes he includes anecdotes about the colorful personalities of the people involved in the discoveries he explains. And as a scifi fan himself, he also sprinkles in pop culture references as well as dog references.Chad Orzel has a newer book which I also recommend highly, one that gives the same treatment to the other great theory of modern physics. How to Teach Relativity to Your Dog covers everything from Einstein to dark matter, using analogies to which both dogs and ordinary people can relate.While you can read both books for pleasure, enjoying them involves staying alert and engaged. But the end result – understanding a little more of the amazing state of physical science and cosmology – is more than worth the effort.If you're a layperson interested in keeping up with the latest news about physics I highly recommend both books to you. You'll come out the other end feeling smarter than you went in."

Heisenberg uncertainty. Particle-wave duality. Virtual particles. I’m a humanities creative type, and so I struggle to understand the science behind quantum mechanics. But intuitively it makes so much sense, and so I keep trying to understand.Chad Orzel’s book How to Teach [Quantum] Physics to Your Dog is an enjoyable analysis of many of the basic concepts of quantum mechanics. Before reading the book, I was a little concerned about it being just another “cutesy” approach to a very difficult topic. But the reviews of the book were positive, and I really love dogs, so I bought it. The book alternates between short conversations with Orzel’s dog, an unusually intelligent animal who wants to use quantum mechanics to catch squirrels and rabbits, and Orzel’s straightforward presentation of the science behind the basic concepts. The conversations with the dog, although they actually are occasionally a bit cutesy, are funny and do add information that helps clarify the science presented.At a length of just a couple of hundred pages, the book doesn’t cover all quantum ideas, but it also doesn’t bury the reader under a mountain of scientific jargon and data. It uses just enough math to get the ideas across and frames much of the interpretation in metaphors based on the dog’s desire to catch little furry animals.Quantum mechanics is never an easy topic for me, and I had to re-read pages occasionally and work my way through the concepts. But I found it rewarding. Orzel establishes a good foundation for the reader by developing the key ideas and establishing a basic vocabulary."

Really enjoyed this book: it was accessible to someone who hasn’t studied physics for 15+ years (ie, me), without dumbing it down too much. I loved the interjections of conversations with Emmy, the dog - she piped up at just the right times for me, when I was just starting to get a bit lost, we got back to Emmy and her elusive garden rabbits, which helped explain things and kept me interested (it’s rare that I ever manage to finish a non-fiction!) I don’t think this was designed as a page-turner and I really enjoyed dipping into this bit-by-bit on my morning commute or a quick lunchtime read and then having time to muse over the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle on my walk to the office. So yes, definitely helped by the dog, the humour and the clear explanations, I finished my first non fiction in a looong time and I enjoyed it!"

Orzel does a wonderful job “demystifying” quantum physics for general laymen like myself. The whole dog-teaching theatrics were definitely fun and helped to make the heavy material more digestible. However, this didn’t stop me from having to re-read certain sections many times over just to wrap my head around whatever theory or experiment was being explained. But hey, it’s quantum mechanics we’re talking about here so I’d expect no less.As someone who's always been interested in quantum theory but only scratched the surface with YouTube videos and the occasional Wikipedia browsing sesh, I can confidently say that I have a much deeper understanding of the subject—on a practical level at least. Orzel doesn’t dive too heavily into the mathematics, thank Christ... but he does an awesome job at summarizing the core concepts and relating them to the tangible technology and observable phenomena they’ve brought about.

The bad news is that the better the author explains whats going on at a quantum level, the less everything makes sense.

It was great fun to read and I liked the Emmy-element. Because I combined the book with the regular lectures it seemed a bit shallowly explained. It still could serve as a great introduction to quantum mechanics. I skimmed the majority of the last chapter because after all the previous ones it was obvious that “free energy” is a scam and I think Orzel might have used too many pages on explaining whether not to utilize the theory and made it a little bit exhausting to read.

Emmy asks her owner just the right kind of insightful questions that help illustrate the weird and wonderful concepts of quantum mechanics.The topic of quantum physics, is arguably one of the most mind-bending scientific subjects. A professor at Union College in Schenectady, NY, and a quantum physicist, Chad Orzel, explains quantum physics to Emmy, his precocious German shepherd in this book, making the mind-bending topic a little less traumatic when the going gets tough (quantum physics has a certain irreducible complexity that precludes an easy understanding of its implications). The book is extremely well-written, combining a scientist's rigor and accuracy with a natural raconteur's storytelling skill. Highly recommended to anyone wishing to learn more about this fascinating topic.In the book’s footnotes he includes anecdotes about the colorful personalities of the people involved in the discoveries he explains. And as a scifi fan himself, he also sprinkles in pop culture references as well as dog references.Chad Orzel has a newer book which I also recommend highly, one that gives the same treatment to the other great theory of modern physics. How to Teach Relativity to Your Dog covers everything from Einstein to dark matter, using analogies to which both dogs and ordinary people can relate.While you can read both books for pleasure, enjoying them involves staying alert and engaged. But the end result – understanding a little more of the amazing state of physical science and cosmology – is more than worth the effort.If you're a layperson interested in keeping up with the latest news about physics I highly recommend both books to you. You'll come out the other end feeling smarter than you went in."
70,1851687793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62691310-gary-guinn,4,"There are things about quantum physics that fascinate me. What Einstein called “spooky influence at a distance.” Tunneling. Heisenberg uncertainty. Particle-wave duality. Virtual particles. I’m a humanities creative type, and so I struggle to understand the science behind quantum mechanics. But intuitively it makes so much sense, and so I keep trying to understand.Chad Orzel’s book How to Teach [Quantum] Physics to Your Dog is an enjoyable analysis of many of the basic concepts of quantum mechanics. Before reading the book, I was a little concerned about it being just another “cutesy” approach to a very difficult topic. But the reviews of the book were positive, and I really love dogs, so I bought it. The book alternates between short conversations with Orzel’s dog, an unusually intelligent animal who wants to use quantum mechanics to catch squirrels and rabbits, and Orzel’s straightforward presentation of the science behind the basic concepts. The conversations with the dog, although they actually are occasionally a bit cutesy, are funny and do add information that helps clarify the science presented.At a length of just a couple of hundred pages, the book doesn’t cover all quantum ideas, but it also doesn’t bury the reader under a mountain of scientific jargon and data. It uses just enough math to get the ideas across and frames much of the interpretation in metaphors based on the dog’s desire to catch little furry animals.Quantum mechanics is never an easy topic for me, and I had to re-read pages occasionally and work my way through the concepts. But I found it rewarding. Orzel establishes a good foundation for the reader by developing the key ideas and establishing a basic vocabulary."

Really enjoyed this book: it was accessible to someone who hasn’t studied physics for 15+ years (ie, me), without dumbing it down too much. I loved the interjections of conversations with Emmy, the dog - she piped up at just the right times for me, when I was just starting to get a bit lost, we got back to Emmy and her elusive garden rabbits, which helped explain things and kept me interested (it’s rare that I ever manage to finish a non-fiction!) I don’t think this was designed as a page-turner and I really enjoyed dipping into this bit-by-bit on my morning commute or a quick lunchtime read and then having time to muse over the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle on my walk to the office. So yes, definitely helped by the dog, the humour and the clear explanations, I finished my first non fiction in a looong time and I enjoyed it!"

However, this didn’t stop me from having to re-read certain sections many times over just to wrap my head around whatever theory or experiment was being explained. But hey, it’s quantum mechanics we’re talking about here so I’d expect no less.As someone who's always been interested in quantum theory but only scratched the surface with YouTube videos and the occasional Wikipedia browsing sesh, I can confidently say that I have a much deeper understanding of the subject—on a practical level at least.

It still could serve as a great introduction to quantum mechanics. I skimmed the majority of the last chapter because after all the previous ones it was obvious that “free energy” is a scam and I think Orzel might have used too many pages on explaining whether not to utilize the theory and made it a little bit exhausting to read.

The way the author explains it using interactions with his dog, Emmy, is just so simplistic and interesting. It actually makes quantum physics and all its mathematical...intresting and...easy to understand, which is something I truly did not expect at all.

Orzel presents a clear explanation of inexplicable phenomena, leaving the reader with at least some idea of what quantum physics is about. The gimmick of explaining it to his dog is a bit cloying, but it does allow him to lighten up. I'd recommend the book, but no one should imagine that after reading they will know very much about the field."

Emmy asks her owner just the right kind of insightful questions that help illustrate the weird and wonderful concepts of quantum mechanics.The topic of quantum physics, is arguably one of the most mind-bending scientific subjects. A professor at Union College in Schenectady, NY, and a quantum physicist, Chad Orzel, explains quantum physics to Emmy, his precocious German shepherd in this book, making the mind-bending topic a little less traumatic when the going gets tough (quantum physics has a certain irreducible complexity that precludes an easy understanding of its implications). The book is extremely well-written, combining a scientist's rigor and accuracy with a natural raconteur's storytelling skill. Highly recommended to anyone wishing to learn more about this fascinating topic.In the book’s footnotes he includes anecdotes about the colorful personalities of the people involved in the discoveries he explains. And as a scifi fan himself, he also sprinkles in pop culture references as well as dog references.Chad Orzel has a newer book which I also recommend highly, one that gives the same treatment to the other great theory of modern physics. How to Teach Relativity to Your Dog covers everything from Einstein to dark matter, using analogies to which both dogs and ordinary people can relate.While you can read both books for pleasure, enjoying them involves staying alert and engaged. But the end result – understanding a little more of the amazing state of physical science and cosmology – is more than worth the effort.If you're a layperson interested in keeping up with the latest news about physics I highly recommend both books to you. You'll come out the other end feeling smarter than you went in."
130,1851687793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62691310-gary-guinn,4,"There are things about quantum physics that fascinate me. What Einstein called “spooky influence at a distance.” Tunneling. Heisenberg uncertainty. Particle-wave duality. Virtual particles. I’m a humanities creative type, and so I struggle to understand the science behind quantum mechanics. But intuitively it makes so much sense, and so I keep trying to understand.Chad Orzel’s book How to Teach [Quantum] Physics to Your Dog is an enjoyable analysis of many of the basic concepts of quantum mechanics. Before reading the book, I was a little concerned about it being just another “cutesy” approach to a very difficult topic. But the reviews of the book were positive, and I really love dogs, so I bought it. The book alternates between short conversations with Orzel’s dog, an unusually intelligent animal who wants to use quantum mechanics to catch squirrels and rabbits, and Orzel’s straightforward presentation of the science behind the basic concepts. The conversations with the dog, although they actually are occasionally a bit cutesy, are funny and do add information that helps clarify the science presented.At a length of just a couple of hundred pages, the book doesn’t cover all quantum ideas, but it also doesn’t bury the reader under a mountain of scientific jargon and data. It uses just enough math to get the ideas across and frames much of the interpretation in metaphors based on the dog’s desire to catch little furry animals.Quantum mechanics is never an easy topic for me, and I had to re-read pages occasionally and work my way through the concepts. But I found it rewarding. Orzel establishes a good foundation for the reader by developing the key ideas and establishing a basic vocabulary."
131,1851687793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67022066-serena-turton,4,"Definitely now have a few quantum physics terms thoroughly entangled with dog stories: The Quantum Zeno Effect, for example, will forever be known in my brain as the dog repeatedly disturbing the physicist from getting to sleep just as they were starting to drift off every time! Really enjoyed this book: it was accessible to someone who hasn’t studied physics for 15+ years (ie, me), without dumbing it down too much. I loved the interjections of conversations with Emmy, the dog - she piped up at just the right times for me, when I was just starting to get a bit lost, we got back to Emmy and her elusive garden rabbits, which helped explain things and kept me interested (it’s rare that I ever manage to finish a non-fiction!) I don’t think this was designed as a page-turner and I really enjoyed dipping into this bit-by-bit on my morning commute or a quick lunchtime read and then having time to muse over the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle on my walk to the office. So yes, definitely helped by the dog, the humour and the clear explanations, I finished my first non fiction in a looong time and I enjoyed it!"

Orzel does a wonderful job “demystifying” quantum physics for general laymen like myself. The whole dog-teaching theatrics were definitely fun and helped to make the heavy material more digestible. However, this didn’t stop me from having to re-read certain sections many times over just to wrap my head around whatever theory or experiment was being explained. But hey, it’s quantum mechanics we’re talking about here so I’d expect no less.As someone who's always been interested in quantum theory but only scratched the surface with YouTube videos and the occasional Wikipedia browsing sesh, I can confidently say that I have a much deeper understanding of the subject—on a practical level at least. Orzel doesn’t dive too heavily into the mathematics, thank Christ... but he does an awesome job at summarizing the core concepts and relating them to the tangible technology and observable phenomena they’ve brought about. I highly recommend to anyone interested in being a little less confused about quantum physics."

The world of quantum physics is weird and includes properties like teleportation and disappearing, but it is the same world we live in now. People and dogs may be way to big to experience quantum physics directly but its effects, as explained by Orzel, are why we, Earth, our solar system and the whole universe exist.Explanation of rating: Four stars because it was very interesting and funny as well as teaching me a lot about quantum physics.

The bad news is that the better the author explains whats going on at a quantum level, the less everything makes sense. The good news is that if nothing makes sense, you probably finally have an inkling of what's really going on."

It was great fun to read and I liked the Emmy-element. Because I combined the book with the regular lectures it seemed a bit shallowly explained. It still could serve as a great introduction to quantum mechanics. I skimmed the majority of the last chapter because after all the previous ones it was obvious that “free energy” is a scam and I think Orzel might have used too many pages on explaining whether not to utilize the theory and made it a little bit exhausting to read.

Before reading the book, I was a little concerned about it being just another “cutesy” approach to a very difficult topic. But the reviews of the book were positive, and I really love dogs, so I bought it. The book alternates between short conversations with Orzel’s dog, an unusually intelligent animal who wants to use quantum mechanics to catch squirrels and rabbits, and Orzel’s straightforward presentation of the science behind the basic concepts. The conversations with the dog, although they actually are occasionally a bit cutesy, are funny and do add information that helps clarify the science presented.At a length of just a couple of hundred pages, the book doesn’t cover all quantum ideas, but it also doesn’t bury the reader under a mountain of scientific jargon and data. It uses just enough math to get the ideas across and frames much of the interpretation in metaphors based on the dog’s desire to catch little furry animals.Quantum mechanics is never an easy topic for me, and I had to re-read pages occasionally and work my way through the concepts. But I found it rewarding. Orzel establishes a good foundation for the reader by developing the key ideas and establishing a basic vocabulary."

Really enjoyed this book: it was accessible to someone who hasn’t studied physics for 15+ years (ie, me), without dumbing it down too much. I loved the interjections of conversations with Emmy, the dog - she piped up at just the right times for me, when I was just starting to get a bit lost, we got back to Emmy and her elusive garden rabbits, which helped explain things and kept me interested (it’s rare that I ever manage to finish a non-fiction!) I don’t think this was designed as a page-turner and I really enjoyed dipping into this bit-by-bit on my morning commute or a quick lunchtime read and then having time to muse over the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle on my walk to the office. So yes, definitely helped by the dog, the humour and the clear explanations, I finished my first non fiction in a looong time and I enjoyed it!"

Orzel does a wonderful job “demystifying” quantum physics for general laymen like myself. The whole dog-teaching theatrics were definitely fun and helped to make the heavy material more digestible. However, this didn’t stop me from having to re-read certain sections many times over just to wrap my head around whatever theory or experiment was being explained. But hey, it’s quantum mechanics we’re talking about here so I’d expect no less.As someone who's always been interested in quantum theory but only scratched the surface with YouTube videos and the occasional Wikipedia browsing sesh, I can confidently say that I have a much deeper understanding of the subject—on a practical level at least. Orzel doesn’t dive too heavily into the mathematics, thank Christ... but he does an awesome job at summarizing the core concepts and relating them to the tangible technology and observable phenomena they’ve brought about. I highly recommend to anyone interested in being a little less confused about quantum physics."

Emmy asks her owner just the right kind of insightful questions that help illustrate the weird and wonderful concepts of quantum mechanics.The topic of quantum physics, is arguably one of the most mind-bending scientific subjects. A professor at Union College in Schenectady, NY, and a quantum physicist, Chad Orzel, explains quantum physics to Emmy, his precocious German shepherd in this book, making the mind-bending topic a little less traumatic when the going gets tough (quantum physics has a certain irreducible complexity that precludes an easy understanding of its implications). The book is extremely well-written, combining a scientist's rigor and accuracy with a natural raconteur's storytelling skill. Highly recommended to anyone wishing to learn more about this fascinating topic.In the book’s footnotes he includes anecdotes about the colorful personalities of the people involved in the discoveries he explains. And as a scifi fan himself, he also sprinkles in pop culture references as well as dog references.Chad Orzel has a newer book which I also recommend highly, one that gives the same treatment to the other great theory of modern physics. How to Teach Relativity to Your Dog covers everything from Einstein to dark matter, using analogies to which both dogs and ordinary people can relate.While you can read both books for pleasure, enjoying them involves staying alert and engaged. But the end result – understanding a little more of the amazing state of physical science and cosmology – is more than worth the effort.If you're a layperson interested in keeping up with the latest news about physics I highly recommend both books to you. You'll come out the other end feeling smarter than you went in."

Chad Orzel is clever enough to make a complex subject understandable for his dog, maybe I could understand a little too.

Emmy asks her owner just the right kind of insightful questions that help illustrate the weird and wonderful concepts of quantum mechanics.The topic of quantum physics, is arguably one of the most mind-bending scientific subjects. A professor at Union College in Schenectady, NY, and a quantum physicist, Chad Orzel, explains quantum physics to Emmy, his precocious German shepherd in this book, making the mind-bending topic a little less traumatic when the going gets tough (quantum physics has a certain irreducible complexity that precludes an easy understanding of its implications). The book is extremely well-written, combining a scientist's rigor and accuracy with a natural raconteur's storytelling skill. Highly recommended to anyone wishing to learn more about this fascinating topic.In the book’s footnotes he includes anecdotes about the colorful personalities of the people involved in the discoveries he explains. And as a scifi fan himself, he also sprinkles in pop culture references as well as dog references.Chad Orzel has a newer book which I also recommend highly, one that gives the same treatment to the other great theory of modern physics. How to Teach Relativity to Your Dog covers everything from Einstein to dark matter, using analogies to which both dogs and ordinary people can relate.While you can read both books for pleasure, enjoying them involves staying alert and engaged. But the end result – understanding a little more of the amazing state of physical science and cosmology – is more than worth the effort.If you're a layperson interested in keeping up with the latest news about physics I highly recommend both books to you. You'll come out the other end feeling smarter than you went in."
220,1851687793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62691310-gary-guinn,4,"There are things about quantum physics that fascinate me. What Einstein called “spooky influence at a distance.” Tunneling. Heisenberg uncertainty. Particle-wave duality. Virtual particles. I’m a humanities creative type, and so I struggle to understand the science behind quantum mechanics. But intuitively it makes so much sense, and so I keep trying to understand.Chad Orzel’s book How to Teach [Quantum] Physics to Your Dog is an enjoyable analysis of many of the basic concepts of quantum mechanics. Before reading the book, I was a little concerned about it being just another “cutesy” approach to a very difficult topic. But the reviews of the book were positive, and I really love dogs, so I bought it. The book alternates between short conversations with Orzel’s dog, an unusually intelligent animal who wants to use quantum mechanics to catch squirrels and rabbits, and Orzel’s straightforward presentation of the science behind the basic concepts. The conversations with the dog, although they actually are occasionally a bit cutesy, are funny and do add information that helps clarify the science presented.At a length of just a couple of hundred pages, the book doesn’t cover all quantum ideas, but it also doesn’t bury the reader under a mountain of scientific jargon and data. It uses just enough math to get the ideas across and frames much of the interpretation in metaphors based on the dog’s desire to catch little furry animals.Quantum mechanics is never an easy topic for me, and I had to re-read pages occasionally and work my way through the concepts. But I found it rewarding. Orzel establishes a good foundation for the reader by developing the key ideas and establishing a basic vocabulary."

Really enjoyed this book: it was accessible to someone who hasn’t studied physics for 15+ years (ie, me), without dumbing it down too much. I loved the interjections of conversations with Emmy, the dog - she piped up at just the right times for me, when I was just starting to get a bit lost, we got back to Emmy and her elusive garden rabbits, which helped explain things and kept me interested (it’s rare that I ever manage to finish a non-fiction!) I don’t think this was designed as a page-turner and I really enjoyed dipping into this bit-by-bit on my morning commute or a quick lunchtime read and then having time to muse over the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle on my walk to the office. So yes, definitely helped by the dog, the humour and the clear explanations, I finished my first non fiction in a looong time and I enjoyed it!"

Orzel does a wonderful job “demystifying” quantum physics for general laymen like myself. The whole dog-teaching theatrics were definitely fun and helped to make the heavy material more digestible. However, this didn’t stop me from having to re-read certain sections many times over just to wrap my head around whatever theory or experiment was being explained. But hey, it’s quantum mechanics we’re talking about here so I’d expect no less.As someone who's always been interested in quantum theory but only scratched the surface with YouTube videos and the occasional Wikipedia browsing sesh, I can confidently say that I have a much deeper understanding of the subject—on a practical level at least. Orzel doesn’t dive too heavily into the mathematics, thank Christ... but he does an awesome job at summarizing the core concepts and relating them to the tangible technology and observable phenomena they’ve brought about. I highly recommend to anyone interested in being a little less confused about quantum physics."

It still could serve as a great introduction to quantum mechanics. I skimmed the majority of the last chapter because after all the previous ones it was obvious that “free energy” is a scam and I think Orzel might have used too many pages on explaining whether not to utilize the theory and made it a little bit exhausting to read.

Orzel presents a clear explanation of inexplicable phenomena, leaving the reader with at least some idea of what quantum physics is about. The gimmick of explaining it to his dog is a bit cloying, but it does allow him to lighten up. I'd recommend the book, but no one should imagine that after reading they will know very much about the field."

Definitely recommend this book for anyone looking to dip their toes into quantum mechanics.

It is popular science and it is written in such a manner that even laymen are able to understand at least the basics. Quantum physics still blows my mind, but the funny examples with squirrels and rabbits made it easier to at least understand what's going on in the experiments.

Chad Orzel is clever enough to make a complex subject understandable for his dog, maybe I could understand a little too. I like the cross between Physics and Philosophy, I am not sure as I coped with the maths. I did find the book an interesting and fun read. I just need to catch up with his clever dog. "

The basis of this book was neat and an overall interesting idea.

You do not, however, have to have any advanced understanding of Quantum Physics to read this book, hence the title, but I would recommend knowing a least the basics."

279,1851687793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8704071-alain-harvey,5,"Rereading an absolutely delightful book How to Teach Physics to Your Dog by Chad Orzel, the author’s first book.Chad Orzel puts quantum mechanics into understandable terms by means of a dialectic with his dog Emmy, whose interests run from chasing rabbits to virtual particles. Emmy asks her owner just the right kind of insightful questions that help illustrate the weird and wonderful concepts of quantum mechanics.The topic of quantum physics, is arguably one of the most mind-bending scientific subjects. A professor at Union College in Schenectady, NY, and a quantum physicist, Chad Orzel, explains quantum physics to Emmy, his precocious German shepherd in this book, making the mind-bending topic a little less traumatic when the going gets tough (quantum physics has a certain irreducible complexity that precludes an easy understanding of its implications). The book is extremely well-written, combining a scientist's rigor and accuracy with a natural raconteur's storytelling skill. Highly recommended to anyone wishing to learn more about this fascinating topic.In the book’s footnotes he includes anecdotes about the colorful personalities of the people involved in the discoveries he explains. And as a scifi fan himself, he also sprinkles in pop culture references as well as dog references.Chad Orzel has a newer book which I also recommend highly, one that gives the same treatment to the other great theory of modern physics. How to Teach Relativity to Your Dog covers everything from Einstein to dark matter, using analogies to which both dogs and ordinary people can relate.While you can read both books for pleasure, enjoying them involves staying alert and engaged. But the end result – understanding a little more of the amazing state of physical science and cosmology – is more than worth the effort.If you're a layperson interested in keeping up with the latest news about physics I highly recommend both books to you. You'll come out the other end feeling smarter than you went in."
280,1851687793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62691310-gary-guinn,4,"There are things about quantum physics that fascinate me. What Einstein called “spooky influence at a distance.” Tunneling. Heisenberg uncertainty. Particle-wave duality. Virtual particles. I’m a humanities creative type, and so I struggle to understand the science behind quantum mechanics. But intuitively it makes so much sense, and so I keep trying to understand.Chad Orzel’s book How to Teach [Quantum] Physics to Your Dog is an enjoyable analysis of many of the basic concepts of quantum mechanics. Before reading the book, I was a little concerned about it being just another “cutesy” approach to a very difficult topic. But the reviews of the book were positive, and I really love dogs, so I bought it. The book alternates between short conversations with Orzel’s dog, an unusually intelligent animal who wants to use quantum mechanics to catch squirrels and rabbits, and Orzel’s straightforward presentation of the science behind the basic concepts. The conversations with the dog, although they actually are occasionally a bit cutesy, are funny and do add information that helps clarify the science presented.At a length of just a couple of hundred pages, the book doesn’t cover all quantum ideas, but it also doesn’t bury the reader under a mountain of scientific jargon and data. It uses just enough math to get the ideas across and frames much of the interpretation in metaphors based on the dog’s desire to catch little furry animals.Quantum mechanics is never an easy topic for me, and I had to re-read pages occasionally and work my way through the concepts. But I found it rewarding. Orzel establishes a good foundation for the reader by developing the key ideas and establishing a basic vocabulary."
281,1851687793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67022066-serena-turton,4,"Definitely now have a few quantum physics terms thoroughly entangled with dog stories: The Quantum Zeno Effect, for example, will forever be known in my brain as the dog repeatedly disturbing the physicist from getting to sleep just as they were starting to drift off every time! Really enjoyed this book: it was accessible to someone who hasn’t studied physics for 15+ years (ie, me), without dumbing it down too much. I loved the interjections of conversations with Emmy, the dog - she piped up at just the right times for me, when I was just starting to get a bit lost, we got back to Emmy and her elusive garden rabbits, which helped explain things and kept me interested (it’s rare that I ever manage to finish a non-fiction!) I don’t think this was designed as a page-turner and I really enjoyed dipping into this bit-by-bit on my morning commute or a quick lunchtime read and then having time to muse over the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle on my walk to the office. So yes, definitely helped by the dog, the humour and the clear explanations, I finished my first non fiction in a looong time and I enjoyed it!"

Orzel does a wonderful job “demystifying” quantum physics for general laymen like myself. The whole dog-teaching theatrics were definitely fun and helped to make the heavy material more digestible. However, this didn’t stop me from having to re-read certain sections many times over just to wrap my head around whatever theory or experiment was being explained. But hey, it’s quantum mechanics we’re talking about here so I’d expect no less.As someone who's always been interested in quantum theory but only scratched the surface with YouTube videos and the occasional Wikipedia browsing sesh, I can confidently say that I have a much deeper understanding of the subject—on a practical level at least. Orzel doesn’t dive too heavily into the mathematics, thank Christ... but he does an awesome job at summarizing the core concepts and relating them to the tangible technology and observable phenomena they’ve brought about. I highly recommend to anyone interested in being a little less confused about quantum physics."

The world of quantum physics is weird and includes properties like teleportation and disappearing, but it is the same world we live in now. People and dogs may be way to big to experience quantum physics directly but its effects, as explained by Orzel, are why we, Earth, our solar system and the whole universe exist.Explanation of rating: Four stars because it was very interesting and funny as well as teaching me a lot about quantum physics.

The bad news is that the better the author explains whats going on at a quantum level, the less everything makes sense. The good news is that if nothing makes sense, you probably finally have an inkling of what's really going on."
285,1851687793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58185310-alexia-han,4,I read it as recommended material to a quantum physics introduction course at the Uni. It was great fun to read and I liked the Emmy-element. Because I combined the book with the regular lectures it seemed a bit shallowly explained. It still could serve as a great introduction to quantum mechanics. I skimmed the majority of the last chapter because after all the previous ones it was obvious that “free energy” is a scam and I think Orzel might have used too many pages on explaining whether not to utilize the theory and made it a little bit exhausting to read.
286,1851687793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32259830-cherie,5,"As someone who have never taken physics throughout her entire academic career, I truly love this book.

It actually makes quantum physics and all its mathematical...intresting and...easy to understand, which is something I truly did not expect at all.
