0,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4350004-josh-hamacher,3,"This book is about chaos and complexity, how the interaction of simple rules can result in complex behavior.The first quarter of the book is a remarkably readable history of math. Starting with Galileo and moving forward to modern times, Gribbin mentions most of the major discoveries that led to the modern understanding of chaos. I was very much looking forward to the rest of the book after finishing this second chapter.Unfortunately the rest of the book was a minor disappointment. Without a historical narrative to tie everything together and keep it moving, Gribbin seemed to skip back and forth at random between different complex behaviors. The book remained relatively readable, but I had a hard time keeping track of what the major theme of each chapter was supposed to be. Many of the examples were truly fascinating, which kept me reading, but I feel the organization of the book could have been significantly better. It also rubbed me the wrong way that a large percentage of the footnotes were references to other books by Gribbin - at some points it was almost as if this book was nothing but a large advertisement. Gribbin also seemed to try to interject humor into some passages but most of those attempts fell flat, in my opinion."

2,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5555413-vishy,4,"I have read a few John Gribbin books and loved them all. His book about quantum theory, 'In Search of Schrödinger's Cat', is a classic. I have had 'Deep Simplicity' with me for a long time. I thought it was time to take it out and read it for 'Science September'.In 'Deep Simplicity', John Gribbin talks about Chaos theory. I remember during my student days one of my classmates was reading about it and he was planning to apply it in his research on business cycles. I don't know whether he was able to do that and whether he came out with interesting predictions which came true. That was probably the first time that I had heard about Chaos theory. In essence, as John Gribbin describes it, Chaos theory is simple. It tries to study systems which start with simple origins but result in complex patterns and behaviour. And it also tries to study what happens if some minor changes are made at the start. The conclusion is that minor changes in the initial conditions will lead to complex, unbelievable changes later. That is all there is to Chaos theory. Because it is an interdisciplinary field with applications across different areas like physics, chemistry, biology, geology, economics, the stock market, traffic movement and weather forecasting, there are many different techniques and ways of studying how real world systems behave, when they evolve from simple origins to complex futures. John Gribbin describes some of these across these different fascinating fields. He describes the beauty of fractals and how they are observed in the real world in surprising ways. He talks about something called the 'power law' and describes how it amazes us by manifesting itself in the real world in surprising ways. Gribbin is strong when he talks about physics and its related areas because it is his field, but he also spends considerable time in biology, the evolution of life and the extinction of dinosaurs and other species. It is very fascinating to read. I enjoyed reading 'Deep Simplicity'. John Gribbin gives a beautiful guided tour of physics in the initial chapters before delving into other branches of science and other fields, while exploring Chaos theory. It is not an easy read, because it demands close attention and contemplation, but it is a rewarding read. I am giving below the first couple of passages from the introduction to the book which sets the tone for the rest of the book, so that you can get a flavour for the subject and also experience Gribbin's style. ""The world around us seems to be a complex place. Although there are some simple truths that seem to be eternal (apples always fall to the ground, not to the sky; the Sun rises in the east, never in the west), our lives, in spite of modern technology, are still, all too often, at the mercy of complicated processes that produce dramatic changes out of the blue. Weather forecasting is still as much an art as a science; earthquakes and volcanic eruptions strike unpredictably, and seemingly at random; stock-market fluctuations continue to produce boom and bust with no obvious pattern to them. From the time of Galileo (in round numbers, the beginning of the seventeenth century) science made progress – enormous progress – largely by ignoring these complexities, and focusing on the simple questions, looking to explain why apples fall to the ground, and why the Sun rises in the east. Progress was so spectacular, indeed, that by about the middle of the twentieth century all the simple questions had been answered. Concepts such as the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics explained the overall workings of the Universe on the very large and very small scales respectively, while the discovery of the structure of DNA and the way in which it is copied from generation to generation made life itself, and evolution, seem simple at the molecular level. And yet, the complexity of the world at the human level – at the level of life – remained. The most interesting question of all, the question of how life could have emerged from non-life, remained unanswered.  It is no surprise that the most complex features of the Universe, which proved most reluctant to yield to the traditional methods of scientific investigation, should exist on our scale. Indeed, we may be the most complex things there are in the Universe. The reason is that on smaller scales entities such as individual atoms behave in a relatively simple way in their one-to-one interactions, and that complicated and interesting things are produced when many atoms are linked together in complicated and interesting ways, to make things like people. But this process cannot continue indefinitely, since if more and more atoms are joined together, their total mass increases to the point where gravity crushes all the interesting structure out of existence. An atom, or even a simple molecule like water, is simpler than a human being because it has little internal structure; a star, or the interior of a planet, is simpler than a human being because gravity crushes any structure out of existence. And that is why science can tell us more about the behaviour of atoms and the internal workings of the stars than it can about the way people behave."" Have you read 'Deep Simplicity' by John Gribbin? What do you think about it?"
3,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,3,"Noted science writer, John Gribbin, is on to a little known aspect of science related to chaos theory and self-organized complexity that is the basis of life and other complex systems. The book is organized as to be helpful for the initiate, and is a good attempt to bring this new concept into the public domain. Mathematics breaks down when the systems move from simple shapes or manipulations to complex objects and repetitive interactions begin on a large scale. Future states of such systems cannot be predicted in advance, as a slight change in the initial conditions would deviate the system through a wide margin from the original. These entities are said to be on the edge of chaos and is the basis of most physical systems existing on earth. The novel concept brought home in the book is the application of this deceptively simple construct to the as yet unfathomable issue of emergence of life on this planet. Gribbin has put forward a fairly consistent argument on this issue and is a good starting point for further study.Science broke free of the shackles of organized religion in the 17th century. Galileo’s infamous trial and incarceration is, ironically, the very last of such well-known instances. The human intellect was thus freed to explore the wide world, which it promptly did. Epochal events and discoveries were unfolded in that century, with Newton’s theory of gravitation, birth of calculus, gas laws and the first glimmers of electricity. When at last the overarching fetters of religion were finally removed, science progressed along the path of determinism, in order to deny any role for a supernatural force to dictate terms in scientific theories. Laplace crowned the deterministic faction by boldly claiming that if you know the laws of interaction between all particles and their exact initial states, you will be able to predict all the future states of the system quite faithfully. He is even claimed to have once remarked to Napoleon that he didn’t want God to turn up anywhere in his account of why the world is how it is! But as science extended its knowledge from the basics to the subtle, its limitations were soon exposed in painful detail. Even gravity was a problem when the number of interacting bodies increased. Newton’s equation is solvable even for a high school student, if we simplify the situation so as to involve only two bodies. When three objects are involved, the equations can’t be solved analytically, only approximations are possible. Consider the case of the solar system then, and we may feel butterflies in our stomach when we learn that nobody has been able to prove that the solar system is stable in the long run! However, we may take some consolation that the ‘long’ in long run is indeed long, say, a few billion years. This system is said to be chaotic, not in the literary sense, but as a very complex system that runs on simple principles, but made impossibly difficult to predict by positive feedback. Chaos means that the response for even a small change in the input might be immense, as evident in references to the ‘Butterfly Effect’, the fluttering of a butterfly’s wings in the Amazonian rain forest setting up a train of events that result in a tornado in Texas. But obviously, this example is highly exaggerated.Readers are in for a surprise to know that self-organized complex systems cover everything from climate systems, astronomical objects, the biological kingdoms and even the collapse of a sand pile. Each illustration given in the book is followed by graphical representations and very informative text. The fundamental characteristic of all these systems is that they are not linear. You won’t get proportional change in output corresponding to a change in input. Here, a power law is involved, as the output is proportional to some power of the input. Hope everyone remembers their school math! The power of a number means the number multiplied that many times with itself. The secret behind eliciting a large response from a small stimulus is this power relation. Add to that the interaction among individuals. You get a complex system teetering on the edge of chaos.Several charts and illustrative diagrams are squeezed into the text, but they lack clarity and visual appeal. Rather than instruments for better comprehension, these diagrams seem to serve the requirement of incorporating visual media in a volume of popular science. The diagrams are not anchored to the text. The readers have no clue at what point they should stop reading the text and look at the picture. So we reach a consensus to study the chart before the page is turned over. And, though it may seem uncharitable, it must be said that, in a future edition, if all the charts are omitted by mistake, a person reading the text won’t notice it.As a sequel to the above, it is to be noted that the book literally overflows with text that fails to carry conviction. However, to do justice to Gribbin, any book on chaos and self-organized complexity is marred by this same disadvantage. This may probably be due to the non-availability of second layer (not to be confused with second rate) writers who take inputs from first layer writers and simplify it for the lay audience. Chaos is still the preserve of pioneering writers.Gribbin walks out of the beaten path of chaos theory to endorse evolution. He asserts the truth of the theory of evolution in unequivocal terms. Propagandists of creation and intelligent design often accuse evolution to be only a theory and not fact. Gribbin concludes that Evolution is a theory in the same sense of saying that gravity is Newton’s theory. In another context, he specifies that a hypothesis is an untested postulate and when it is supported by experiment, it graduates to the status of a theory. Evolution is a tried and tested theory in that sense.The book also includes a defense for James Lovelock’s Gaia hypothesis with the rather bold conclusion that is a theory. But here, the association is doubtful. It appears as if the author’s personal familiarity with Lovelock and his ideas are dictating terms here. Gaia’s relevance to the subject under study is given only glancingly. Moreover, Gribbin is a renowned popularizer of science who is also a prolific author. Naturally, his works cover almost all areas of physics. Consequently he advises the readers through foot notes to refer to his various books, if they want to clarify a point under discussion. This self advertisement is amusing to behold. "
4,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2459318-deniz-cem-nduygu,4,"This was my first Gribbin and the first few chapters made me regret not reading him before: a delightful historical summary of our theories for gravity and thermodynamics with patiently explained mathematics, accompanied by a careful discussion of determinism – a real page-turner.The latter part of the book however didn't live up to my expectations – especially the way he handles the issue of life, endorsing a metabolism-first approach without explaining how RNA-DNA integrated into it, and not leaving much role for evolutionary agents and processes in organism/metabolism design except for maintaining the balance dictated by physics and mathematics. Even if he only adopted this angle in accordance with the theme of the book, it felt myopic to me. (And he certainly doesn't hide his admiration for Kauffman, so I guess this may not be a temporary adoption.)Overall I loved Gribbin's prose, but I'll stick to his physics-only books in future."
5,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70504722-abraham-dabengwa,4,"Still reading the book. My opinion of the book is imperfect but I worry that James Gleick's Chaos was a better presentation. Gribbin does dig up a lot of historical facts to piece together a story, however, most is partisan to the old world. It's a useful book on complexity or chaos science... This is a more accessible book compared with others out there. As bonus, it's not pretentious."
6,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3099470-scribe,4,"Bought many years ago and day on the shelf as I don't read many hardbacks. Finally got round to this though and glad I did. 4 stars as some parts are fairly dry and, even in their simple form, are helped out by a bit of a background in maths and other theory. But there are some points in here which absolutely blew me away, and indeed changed my life. The emergence of order, of systems (planetary, life, intelligence etc) and its *inevitability* turned my world on its head.So a must read if you're at all interested in systems and complexity, and a reminder I need to read more on this area."
7,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52315139-manoj-joshi,5,There are some rare texts that invite your thinking and even challenge it one step ahead of what you contemplate . Assorting complex dimensions round one self directed by the existence of physics in ones life the author has done great justice in thought provoking chapters well gardened for novice and advanced readers . As of now it has entered in my shelf of all time favourite and will analyse its content once I read few more books . Must for thinkers
8,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30980760-richard-ash,4,"Overall good book:- Some parts are too long- author jumps around a lot (though I guess that's expected given the topic)- main point of the book is fascinating, I'm curious to see where this research goes in the future, especially regarding the origin of life"
9,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17121663-craig,3,"Interesting and mind-stretching though the material is, this book suffers from some British Academic Stuffiness that made my eyes glaze over time and again. Gribbin tries to make the underlying science accessible, but there's a bar there that even I couldn't quite hurdle over. This book could have used a more populist editor, I think, to trim the fat of biographical trivia, hair-splitting details that don't affect the larger ideas, and over-engineered sentences that run on and barely hold up under their own weight. Gripes aside, the basic idea is this: given simple processes, minuscule differences in starting conditions produce galactic-level effects far down the line. This occurs at every level we can observe, from atoms to molecules to cells to organisms to planets to solar systems to galaxies, and across a variety of events like evolution, earthquakes, and climate. Gribbin traces the development of these ideas mainly through mathematics and physics, but this book is more a telling of that history than an illumination of how we experience chaos day to day. What's admirable is just how elegantly this theoretical framework explains a multitude of seemingly unsolvable questions, like the origin of life on Earth. We have to constantly remind ourselves, though, that these things take place on a scale we are entirely unfit to conceptualize – hundreds of millions of years, distances between atoms or between solar systems, etc. So, in summary: I enjoyed the material, but not so much the ride."
10,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13459886-yhc,5,"This book took me a lot of focus to be able to finish it. So much information from evolution, computer science (Turing machine), cosmology...etc. It starts from the chaos, thanks to the chaos with patterns, everything follow the law of physics in a predictable way: power law. Earthquakes, economic..,etc. What caught my eyes in this book was about the connection of Alan Turing and evolution on animal fur/ skin color patterns. ""In fact, one overarching theory of how biological patterns form comes from an unlikely place: codebreaker Alan Turing. About 65 years ago, he proposed that stripes, spots, and even appendages like fingers may emerge from a series of chemical interactions between two hypothetical substances: an activator and an inhibitor. As both substances spread across a canvas like an animal’s skin at different paces, they compete with one another to give rise to patterns."" from (https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/16/15...)Alan Turing surely an genius that i would like to dig deeper about his mind, thanks to this book.Overall, I enjoy a lot reading this book since most of the topic are exactly what i am interested in. There are many details about the on-going science, one aspect this book doesn't cover is about AI., which is ok, because it's already rich enough as knowledge in this book!! "
11,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36401880-sagar-acharya,4,"In an excellent non-mathematical language, John goes on to explain the prerequisites required to understand life generating systems.He explains power law on how positive feedback loops give exponential function equivalents in real life, fractals, some very important entities to understand complexity generating out of simplicity, evolution to show how today's life forms have been created by simple changing factors and shows the real life examples to understand complexity with simplicity. He also explains chaos theory which is based on divergence of mathematical series which I fortunately learnt in my college.At the end he explains, how life and non-living features exist in equilibrium at this short time interval of 10 million years on the astronomical scales on earth. It's a beautifully written book."
12,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32264840-martin-j,5,"It took me a long time to read this book, mainly reading small sections and intermittently. Not necessarily an easy read, but full of fascinating ideas and covering in effect the broadest possible spectrum of life, the universe and everything. For me it’s another book which I know I’m likely to read again. What’s more I’m sure I’ll get even more from it the next time I read it. The principle theme is initially difficult to grasp, but once the penny drops I think you have a ‘aha’ moment (or probably more likely many ‘aha’ moments) and everything begins to fall into place. And by ‘everything’ I mean ‘everything’ - this book, and others similar to it, does in effect explain everything. That’s my take a way! "
13,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18203058-bruno-taveira,5,"This reading is delightful and eye opening.From Newton’s gravity to Darwin’s natural selection, the book breaks down the three layers of any problem: the apparent simplicity in the surface, the complexity going deeper and then the simple rules which built the complexity.The variety of fields studied make this book about something more than science. The planetary system, gas thermodynamics, fractals everywhere in nature and society and on the emergency of life itself. The book also discuss a bit of theory with Complex Theory and how tensions built-up to a critical system, such as earthquakes."
14,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1470364-matt,4,I read this book on a dare from Charlie Munger. I understood about 3/4 of it and what I understood was pretty fantastic. There are some amazing ideas about how life and the universe work. I especially liked the explanation of how the sun is much larger now than it was a billion years ago and yet the Earth's temperature remains the same. And the bit about how life on another planet can be identified simply by the presence of significant amounts of Oxygen and Nitrogen in the atmosphere. This is not an easy read but it is worth the effort. 
15,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17723741-steve,5,"Good overview of Chaos Theory as it applies to our world, though perhaps a little preoccupied with the question of the origins of life. It's a wide, deep topic and at 253 pages some parts feel a little short-changed, so perhaps it could be considered a good starting point to explore outward in areas of interest. Accessible to the interested amateur with, say, Algebra and a smattering of Calculus. "
16,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76454875-delsom,4,"Gribbin goes from describing the spectroscopic analysis required to provide evidence of life on a planet to summarizing his whole book in the swoop of one paragraph. If you desire to think briefly about many intricately scientific and mathematical topics, this book is for you. If you want that summary after each topic, choose something less grand in scope."
17,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64252124-daniel-b-g,3,"This was a bit of a slog, but with a lot of interesting stuff in there. It made some sense of the whole story from Newton to modern chaos and complexity in a coherent and interesting manner, which is a huge achievement. It was just a little hard to make progress at times, though that may be more a reflection on me and my sleep deprived toddler addled brain."
18,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36807526-haloda,3,I am not sure if anyone who read that book was able to grasp it all. It's pretty insightful but I fail to summarize the content and connect all the theories mentioned together. It's challenging to say a book had it all.

More often, he brings in some fact and then dismisses it with ""but we won't talk about that any more"" and moves on to another, seemingly unrelated topic.Chapter 5 talks about where power laws, or ""1/f"" noise appear.

His earlier works on quantum mechanics (In Search of Schrodinger's Cat: Quantum Physics And Reality and Schrodinger's Kittens and the Search for Reality: Solving the Quantum Mysteries) were accessible, entertaining, as well as educational.This book opens some deep wells of difficult-to-comprehend ideas, which I'm sure were just as difficult to translate to a popular science audience. In the Introduction, Gribbin even admits to not understanding chaos and wanting to wait for someone else to popularize it, finally giving up and doing it himself. For all that, he does a decent job of getting the ideas across: phase space, attractors, fractals, entropy, power laws, etc. The first half of the book concerning the development of these ideas and theories is the more interesting part of the book. In the second half Gribbin applies the concepts to biology, evolution, and finally in a lengthy final chapter Gaia theory and the possibilities of life beyond earth. Which is to say it felt as though it stopped being about Chaos in general and more about specific non-equilibrium systems. I don't feel as though I got as much out of this book as I have out of others by Gribbin."

We've all come across the stories that provide us with some answer or another, mostly involving paint, scorching fire, or the animal in question standing quietly in the shade of some long grass blades. I thought they were beautiful stories, all of them, but none of the explanations were quite as convincing as the one we find in Deep Simplicity.Gribbin takes us through the history of discoveries in the fields of physics, mathematics, chemistry and biology that lead to the development of chaos theory. His narrative focuses on the concepts of chaos, complexity and the idea that complex systems emerge on the edge of chaos; and he concludes that there are simple mathematical rules at the base of complex systems that we find in nature, the sort of systems that feed back on themselves so that what they do affects their own behaviour. Simple mathematical formulas can explain the patterns and the fractals found in nature, the evolution and extinction of species, the way cells take up different functions in our body, how every little zebra embryo gets its stripes, and ultimately, how life must have started, here on earth and elsewhere in the universe.Of course, Gribbin doesn't have all the answers, and he readily admits that no one knows just what did occur when life emerged from non-life.

If you're looking for something on emergent behaviour, Critical Mass by Phillip Ball was a lot more interesting (especially the bit about how traffic jams form).____________The underlying simplicity from which chaos and complexity emerge - simple laws, non-linearity, sensitivity to initial conditions and feedback are what make the world tick.It is the absence of chaos in the changing obliquity (angle of tilt) thanks to the presence of the Moon which has allowed life on Earth to evolve under more or less stable climatic circumstances for billions of years.Sometimes small mutations, or small changes in the environment, can have big effects on the body form that develops (in particular when we are dealing with dissipative systems at the edge of chaos.Without the intervention of life, all the oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere would get locked away in nitrates, carbon dioxide, iron oxides and silicate rocks in less than ten million years. If you're an astronomer who happens to observe a planet like the Earth and notice that it has an oxygen-rich atmosphere, that either means you are witnessing a rare, transient event on that planet, or that the atmosphere is being maintained in a state far from equilibrium.Clouds reflect away so much of the incoming solar energy that without any cloud cover the average surface temperature on Earth would be 35 deg C, 20 deg higher than it actually is."

I have read books on the arrow of time, and found them less satisfying than this one. I have read Richard Dawkins' ""The Greatest Show on Earth"", which powerfully argues for Evolution, but I found parts of this book to be more interesting than Dawkins' descriptions.This book covers a lot of territory, but it does it in a very accessible way.

37,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19069281-tirath,4,"The beginning was too complex for me, it required a good amount of focus.The author tries to tie in a lot of mental models which aids in the buildup towards the end of the book - covering the chaos in nature to the complexity of small systems and large systems, but how easy it can be to understand things.Loved the bits on earthquakes, fractals, fjords, cloud formation, Gaia, power laws, the 5 extinctions that the Earth has witnessed, the effects of effects of infinitesimally small changes.Deeply thought provoking book.Not for the casual reader."
38,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3738780-rich,4,"Gribbin does a fantastic job guiding the reader through an often mind-bending theory, leaving the reader with a decent grasp of some very complex concepts. Some of the insights I've gained from this book regarding life on Earth and how it came to exist did not mesh with ideas I'd gone into this book with, but I was compelled and finished the book more fascinated by the material than when I'd started. Deep Simplicity will likely not be the final book I read on the subject."
39,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18985571-james,4,"I found this to be a fairly thought provoking book. To be honest the chapter on fractals and chaos theory almost caused me to stop reading. I was not able to become very interested in it. However, the rest of the book is fairly interesting. Basically, it shows how just about everything, including the universe itself can seem very complex but is actually, controlled by simple rules. Many processed are just on the edge of chaos. "
40,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28954470-sanjay-vyas,4,"Hardest book I've read. ""Seeking Wisdom"" was close. Requires the reader to be familiar with basics of thermodynamics, mechanics, biology, others. I've been out of school for 20 years, so lots of cobwebs. The author tries to boil things down, and he does a good job. Systems which are driven by power law functions and involve feedback display chaotic attributes. Good book, but alas I doubt I got out of it what I should have. "
41,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2027595-nya,5,"This is an amazing book about how transformation works in this universe, which is at the edge of chaos, where systems are about to change their state. The laws of this transformational state, are remarkably mathematically consistent, and the underlying patterns are as true for the patterns displayed by galaxies, as for the patterns displayed on a tiger's tail. Heady stuff."
42,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4091913-timothy-chklovski,4,"There seem to be multiple books on these themes. This one helped me see chaotic and complex systems in everyday world, eg in market fluctuations - providing a more nuanced understanding than ""pendulum swings"" (which, ironically, has a constant period for given mass and length"" -- the opposite of what describes reversion"
43,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4418494-s-l-moore,5,"This book is just amazing. I can't praise it highly enough! If you are a lover of knowledge, like myself, this book will help demystify the Chaos theory and explain it simple enough for you to understand. It even goes into why the weather can't be predicted correctly AT ALL! This is just an amazing read all around and the author makes it fun to read as well."
44,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38623347-simon-eskildsen,3,"A book about how complexity arises from simplicity. The most interesting from this book I'll remember, was the ones about the working of weather prediction. But there are sporadic intersting insights about evolution, fractals, Turing, and power laws—however, the author tends to circle around the point for too long, which is unfortunate because they're generally good."
45,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16707866-andrew,4,"I really enjoyed this book. Although I struggled with some parts of it, like the concept of 1/f noise, other sections such as how the different stripe/spot patterns on animals develop and are related to body size where incredibly enlightening. I will probably have to return to the book sometime in the future to re-read some sections but that wouldn't be a problem.Recommended."

47,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5855346-sam,3,Simple iterative systems can produce complex phenomena -- and according to John Gribbin this goes a long way toward describing much of the natural world. The math of complexity & chaos was a mental workout.
48,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6583711-salma,4,"I really enjoyed this book. It starts slow paced but becomes captivating towards the end as Gribbin guide the reader through many diverse systems from animal spots to earthquakes to the population of cities, reflecting its deep simplicity and the mathematical beauty of complexity. "
49,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27617188-john-kowalczyk,5,"A very informative and enjoyable read from the basic Newtonian model, and how simple models are stepping stones up into Chaos and complexity and the resulting spontaneous order, ending in universe-scaled self-similiar systems."
50,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15888480-george-law,4,"Well written, with excellent material being discussed in understandable language, but not very well presented in layout. The long chapters (each about thirty pages) could have been broken down into bite-sized sections, making material easier to digest."
51,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3176707-paul-hartzog,3,"Just didn't grab me. I actually think I've read this book twice and simply didn't recognize any of it the second time through. And complexity science is my field, so this book really just doesn't register on me."
52,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/524412-dan,5,"layperson's guide to chaos, fractals, quantum physics, etc. An enjoyable read, relatively easy to digest, even for those without background in science/mathematics"

54,140006256X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1967680-ming,5,My first venture into the more frontier theories of modern empirical science. Very sweet book by an astrophysicist on chaos and complex theory.
