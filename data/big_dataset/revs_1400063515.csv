0,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1097970-aaron,3,"This is a book that raises a number of very important questions, but chief among them is definitely the question of how the interplay between a good idea and an insufferable author combine to effect the reading experience? This author is an a-hole. Full stop. He's dismissive, chronically insecure, unstructured and hostile towards his detractors. He engages in what may be the lowest form of rhetoric by pre-emptively attacking any critics (even before they've had the chance to come forward) as too stupid or blinkered to follow his argument. He's contemptuous towards entire disciplines (economics, law, social science) without making much attempt to engage with the concepts he's critiquing beyond the broadest levels of generality. He's got a huge chip on his shoulder towards the scientific/academic establishment (especially the Nobel committee - try taking a shot every time he makes an off-hand, tangential attack on Nobel and you've made your Friday night). Worst of all, he's endlessly digressive, and couches his digressions in the language of capricious genius rather than simple bad writing (he hits the occasional sweetnote with these tangents, but if anyone else who has read this thing cover to cover wanted to put a bullet in Yvgenia, feel free to step on up). He's hard to like.It's unfortunate, because at the core of all of the go-nowhere anecdotes and borderline psychobabble is a good analysis on how people are psychologically and socially ill-equipped to handle unexpected outlier events (which he persistently, desperately refers to as ""Black Swans"", one of approximately 3000 new bits of not-too-essential terminology he's trying to appropriate for himself) and can't learn from our mistakes. It's a wonderful theory for a book one third the length of this one, and I'm happy to admit that some of the better moments were probably missed by this reader simply because of the exhaustion of filtering through the surplusage.I am sure that the failure to give this book five or six stars (the possibility of a six star rating might itself be something of a Black Swan) is due to my own marginal intellect. The author has made it clear that any other explanation would be entirely unpredictable."
1,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/269132-nick,5,"This is a great book. And, to take a page from Taleb, anyone who doesn't think so is wrong.No, no, there are a number of problems with the book. A bit bloated, a bit repetitive. And NNT does make the misstep every once and a while. To take a very small instance, Taleb bases a short section of the book upon the idea that to be ""hardened by the Gulag"" means to become ""harder"" or ""stronger"" rather than its true meaning of someone who has become inured to certain difficulties, not necessarily stronger because of it.However, this along with other problems are mere quibbles relative to the strengths of this book (and, I think it's worth noting that many of the negative reviews on this site base their hostile reactions to Taleb on just such insignificant trifles.) The Black Swan deals with the fascinating topic of the nature uncertainty and approaches it from a variety of intellectual angles, mainly the psychological blocks that we are both born with and have created for ourselves that prevent our understanding of the improbable: the narrative fallacy and the problem of induction (the tenuous relationship of cause and effect); our reliance on flawed mathematical models; the expect problem. Each one of these discussions reinforces his main argument but captivate independently as they are insights to the way we process information.Taleb also references numerous thinkers that are not as well known in the popular consciousness and provides wonderful anecdotes and examples from their life and work that illustrate his points and entertain the reader.Many other reviewers comment on the Taleb's unique style: arrogant and aggressive. Just because he's arrogant, however, doesn't mean he's wrong--this man has spent most of his life dedicated to this subject and it shows. And his antagonistic style seems appropriate--it's hard to go against the establishment, even if your goal is truth; people aren't going to believe you. He attacks the Nobel Prize in Economics because according to him, the financial models created by the prizewinners that that Swedish committee has rewarded have done a great deal of harm to people's understanding of the true economic risks involved. Preposterous? Sacrilege? These are the exclamations of narrow-minded thinkers who have yet to examine the evidence thoroughly.I, personally, found Taleb's style to be amusing and engaging. It reflects a true passion and dedication to the beliefs he expounds in the book, beliefs that are worth some attention. If we live in a time of uncertainty, it's a good thing to understand what that really means."
2,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1036274-rmn,3,"I can summarize this book in two words: Shit happens.Actually, I should be more fair since the author spent 300 pages laying out his beliefs and arguing his conclusions. The real summary of this book should be: Shit happens more often than you think.The author, Taleb, rails against economics, most philosophers, and the way we incorporate news to allow us to make sense of events and everyday happenings. He wants us to unlearn the way we think and learn, while destroying the modern beliefs in statistics and at the same time eviscerating the nobel prize winners who got us to where we are today.While the author has valid points, his writing style oscillates between boring, repetitive, and just plain bad. Plus he uses the pronouns “I” and “me” more often than any other author I have read. Perhaps he is using his gigantic ego to prove the existence of fat tails in the standard bell curve and thus exhibit directly the central thesis which is that the Gaussian curve does not hold up in our modern “extremistan” society (and trust me that that sentence is funny if you read the book).The author does understand his limitation to some degree and even suggests skipping certain chapters, though to be honest, the chapters he recommends skipping I found to be the best in the book.I do recommend this for the ideas. It is worth a read/skim for anyone interested in statistics, economics, managing money, or just generally intellectually curious. "
3,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7952147-mark,1,"First, a disclaimer. I am, professionally, a statistician. I do not have a Ph.D. in my field because I feel that statisticians with Ph.D.'s are devoid of practicality and usefulness to the real world. I work at a factory where I assist engineers in better understanding how processes work and making things better. I generally feel that I make a worthwhile contribution to the world. I bought and read this book because it was critical of statisticians. I do not believe in surrounding myself with 'yes men' in the form of books and actively seek to challenge my personal beliefs through the things I read and study. Also, the only fields of statistics that I have ever avoided are time series (forecasting) and actuarial science (incredibly boring).NNT (as he loves to refer to himself in the book) is an idiot. Actually, he's worse than an idiot, he's a charlatan of the worst order. If I were NNT I wouldn't have to defend that statement at all, pretentious phonies reading this to feel intelligent about themselves would nod in agreement at the 'wisdom' I've laid at their feet. But I'm not NNT and I believe in substantiating otherwise baseless claims.One of the first things criticized in this book is the narrative for conveying information. Yet that is all NNT does in this book is lay out narrative. No philosopher is quoted, no idea co-opted without some flourishing tale of how they were never appreciated despite their obvious intelligence or of how they were recognized for their genius but the cold, unending march of human forgetfulness relegated them to the annals of history until someone else rediscovered the idea and NNT bought the original book at a used bookstore in some non-American city that has an air of academia to it.Later in the book, NNT makes one of his few cogent points (I'll chalk it up to luck on his part). Silent evidence is a major problem everywhere we look and in every field (sadly). The negative studies are almost never published, the failures are not chronicled, etc... The hard thing about silent evidence is that it's almost never available at all and we rarely recognize that we're not seeing it. Yet NNT frequently ignores silent evidence. He discusses casinos and all the money they put into preventing cheating (something that, apparently, comes from mediocristan and is easily predictable) but mocks them for doing so because the biggest losses they'd suffered in recent history had nothing to do with cheating. Apparently NNT failed to recognize that perhaps the systems in place so effectively prevented cheating that it was no longer a potential source of lost income. Perhaps if he had looked further back in time he would have seen the financial cost of cheating. It would be like criticizing a store for employing anti-shoplifting techniques when their biggest loses came from a lost shipment, a dishonest accountant and some other unpredictable and essentially unavoidable problem. The suggestion from NNT must be that dealing with the things we can is stupid and we should focus on the things that we cannot predict (and therefore cannot prevent).NNT spends a whole chapter discussing luck and how every successful economist, banker, investor or other scalable professional is successful not due to skill, but to luck. I'm not going to debate that as the entire premise renders coherent arguments null and void (you cannot disprove the assertion that someone is chronically lucky, well played NNT). However, this luck doesn't apply to his favorite philosophers. NNT spends a chapter lauding Poincare for being a 'thinking mathematician' because he didn't rely on rigor, but rather intuition. NNT lambastes other mathematicians for criticizing Poincare by calling his techniques 'hand waving' which he decides is due to childishness on the part of the other 'nerd' mathematicians. But success due to intuition is not success due to skill and is therefore not success to be recognized or rewarded (at least, that's the case with bankers and investors). NNT doesn't understand the reason why mathematicians and other 'hard' scientists don't like hand waving is because there's no way to know if it's success or luck, it isn't repeatable and it isn't verifiable. Also, NNT ignores the silent evidence of intuition. He looks to Poincare as a savior and steward of his profession while ignoring the unmarked graves of all the other 'thinking mathematicians' who failed miserably in their intuitive hand waving.For all of his experimental 'proof' offered in defense of claims about how we understand, learn and process things, NNT never gives more than one study as evidence (although he will claim, without a footnote or other reference) that many other studies have verified that particular claim. He accepts these theories as facts and bases large portions of his argument upon them, yet he criticizes doctors, biologists and other scientists for using experimental evidence to make theories on why things work instead of simply accepting that they do work. How many times does he bring up 'anchoring' as a theory for why things happen, yet he cannot accept the fact that perhaps birds and humans use different brain regions to perform similar tasks?NNT at one point is criticizing the models that trader and economists have made to predict the stock market and quotes a study that compared the model's performance to that of the naive model (today's value is my guess for tomorrow) which concluded that, ""statistically sophisticated or complex models DO NOT NECESSARILY provide more accurate forecasts than simpler ones"" (page 154, emphasis added). The study didn't prove that complex models are no different from simple ones, just that not all of them were better (but no claim that they were ever worse). So why would I get rid of something that doesn't do worse but could do better? If I buy a lottery ticket that is guaranteed to make me my money back and could make me more than what I paid, why wouldn't I buy it? Now, I understand that predicting the future is foolhardy, and I'm not saying that it's something we should put a lot of stock into (pun intended) but past information can give us a general idea about the future, even if it doesn't give us a great one.NNT passes himself off as some cool headed, rational thinker who sees beyond the noise and chaos of the world and invites the world to join him on the greener side of the pasture. But nearly all of his arguments are based on contradictions with other arguments that he has made. Further, the remaining arguments that are defensible are impossible to disprove because they impossible to prove. Much like a believing person who argues that without empirical proof of man evolving from lower life or of the big bang, the scientist cannot be right, NNT argues that because models are not perfect, no one can use them to any benefit.The book is altogether too long given the core point of the book which is this: the most important things that happen (or that don't happen) are unknowable. Because we cannot predict the future with certainty or even near certainty, we should not even try but rather just do whatever the heck we want because sometimes it's just as good."
4,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5864678-jan-rice,5,"The first time through, I listened to this book with my husband, usually while I was cooking. Although I tried to stop and mark important passages, I ended up thinking the book was not very systematic. The second time through, chapter by chapter, the method in his madness is more apparent. I continued to think Taleb is more a popularizer than an innovator. But even if so, that's not so shabby. He's trying to revolutionize the way we think, and the more we rehearse that, the better. Nassim Nicholas Taleb is working the same territory as Daniel Kahneman in Thinking, Fast and Slow. While they both have us investigating our thinking, for Kahneman, it's to make us own up, while Taleb has more direct emphasis on avoiding disaster.He would like for us to realize our overuse of normal-curve thinking, which makes us minimize risk and have no expectations out of the ordinary: like the turkey whose experience all goes to show how human beings love him and care about him and prove it by feeding him--until Thanksgiving day arrives and he's dinner.The normal curve tells us that the further out from the mean we go, the rarity of unusual events rapidly increases. Fine--when it applies. We are not going to meet any 20-foot tall people or anyone living to 150 years old. But the normal curve often doesn't apply. We can't predict which books will be best sellers or how how the sales count will go on one of them. We can't predict when a war will occur or just how one will transpire. The world is not fair. Unfairness and inequality are no epiphenomena but part and parcel of reality. Even in evolution, the fittest survive, thrive, and have more offspring. Take writing: before literacy, every town crier and performer had his day. With written methods, all the little guys are out of work. Then, one book may become a bestseller. It leaves even the other books in the dust. And when the author of the bestseller writes another book, it'll get more attention than those who didn't write a bestseller.When we think normal curves apply but they don't, we are confusing what the world is like with how we would like it to be. We are shoving reality into the Procrustean bed of our idealized thinking. That distorts our vision of reality. By keeping an open mind, at least, we won't be walking blindly into risk. We can't prevent the unexpected, but we can at least turn the black swans into grey swans. We are like the 13th fairy at the Sleeping Beauty's christening. We can't do away with the angry fairy's curse, but we can mitigate it. Grey swan, not black.The difficulty with many kinds of prognosticators in our world is that they are spinning theories that purport to predict, but their theories are stories, and their stories connect the plot points and only sound as though they are predictive. We are lulled or, even worse, misled. We listen according to our preferred belief system. We listen to what we want to hear: confirmatory listening. We actively cherry pick reality to make it fit what we want to believe. The solution? Try the opposite, finding something that doesn't fit. A plethora of confirmatory evidence is exactly what the turkey had before Thanksgiving. Taleb lauds two unexpected types of practitioners: military people and financial managers. They will know if their predictions are wrong or right. If they are wrong, they'll have to face the music. Their predictions matter. Not so the world of talking heads and stuffed shirts: they just adjust their stories and keep on going.What those stories are, are predictions of the past.If you see an ice cube sitting on a table you can predict the future: it will melt into a little puddle of water. But if you see a puddle on the table, and that's all you see, there could be a thousand stories of what it is and how it came to be there. The correct explanation may be 1001--or one which will never be found.It could be that angry old fairy, melted.As I said, most of the stories are not explanations. But theories are sticky. Once you have one you have a hard time seeing beyond it (remembering that sometimes no theory is best, if the theory is wrong). So, he recommends an empirical approach with art and craft, a less grand theory, and always an eye toward outcomes.Right at the end it occurred to me that this is religion. He tells you how to sustain yourself in the absence of worldly support, how to stand up to others and say your piece, how to wait and be patient, and about the merits of surrounding yourself with like-minded souls.To close, a rousing rendition of Kipling's 
If
He can't teach like Kahneman, but he gets it said."
5,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/251826-greg,2,"This book has diminishing returns on the time spent reading it. Taleb's jeremiad is directed against - well - everyone who is not as enlightened as he is. I trudged through this book because - well - everyone is reading it and enlightened people should know how to comment on it. There, I did it. Now I can look down on all those people out there who aren't enlightened like Taleb. And now, me.Taleb is actually on to something important if you can tolerate his self-importance enough to filter his verbage to get his good ideas. A central idea is that we assume everything in the world is Gaussian and then we base all our decisions about life on our Gaussian models. But the significant, life-changing, society-changing, events are outside the Gaussian. Things like 9-11. They belong to Extremestan, not Mediocristan. The ideas are interesting. Many are quite compelling. But it really seems Taleb's main point is ""everyone else is an idiot."" It seems the details why are secondary to that point.I did find quite useful a good line of thought regarding the importance of narrative in grasping truth. We are so drawn to narrative, that all retained ""true"" facts must fit into our constructed narrative. Other data are ignored or made to fit. We need to be on the watch for data that disproves rather than confirms our story. And perhaps we ought to learn better how to understand and speak in story. Mmm - God himself, in the person of Jesus, communicated truth in parables - narratives! No one else seems to have caught on. Except Taleb, of course."
6,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/226705-daniel,2,I stopped reading this because the author is so pompous and annoying.
7,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7213075-ted,3,"Taleb is a pretty good writer, but I thought this was a very uneven book. As I read it I was constantly alternating between ""Wow, that's a really great insight, a great way of presenting it"" and ""Gee, who doesn't realize that?"", or even ""That just seems flat-out wrong"".It's a book that should have been read by the quantitative analysts (""quants"") working for the hedge funds and investment banks in early 2008; but it probably wouldn't have made much difference in the financial melt-down that followed. The problem with all their quantitative analysis was, as Taleb rightly points out, that it assumed that everything that could happen in the markets belonged to the domain of bell-curve events, and that hence probabilities could be computed for any possible market outcome. But ""Black Swan"" events (very rare, not even things we think about happening, and not linked to the factors that determine day to day market swings) do occur, they are of course unpredictable, and they can have massive effects. Some sorts of unpredictable events (such as unexpected conflict flareups, deaths of influential national leaders) are not Black Swan events because they are events we know about, and they are not really unexpected - only the timing is in doubt. Others, the real Black Swans, such as 9/11 and the derivatives bubble, have effects that play out over years.But really, other than as a cautionary tale for those whose job it is to predict (unpredictable) things on a daily basis, these observations probably don't surprise most people who have thought much about the nature of reality and our grasp of the future. No one that I know owns a crystal ball. Without one even broad outlines of the future, that we believe are pretty certain, still have an element of risk/uncertainty; and perhaps a more significant element than we realize.As the esteemed Donald (not Trump, the other one) pointed out, in one of his rare truly insightful comments, there are the unknowns that we know about, and the unknowns that we don't know about. It's the latter part of reality where the Black Swans live. (Of course, they also live in Australia, which is how the phrase got its meaning.)"
8,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1335072-will,2,"This review will be comprised of two parts: a review of the ideas presented and a review of the way in which it is written(A) The ideasThere is no question here, Taleb is an erudite and intelligent scholar. His take on epistomology and the scientific method breathe fresh air into the subject and gloss it with some 21st century context.It would be difficult for me to overstate the importance of the black swan problem in modern life and the degree to which we are, as societies, unaware of its impact. However, anybody with half a background in statistics, chaos theory or the philosophy of science will have encountered most of the concepts in this book before and will have cogitated at length over them. Still, Taleb's text acts both as a refresher course and a collection of intelligent new perspectives on the subject which make for a decent think-a-thon. For that reason somebody with an interest should give this book a go.(B) The executionThis book could have been a third of its length. Taleb comes across as insufferable and fustian. His one-page-per-topic writing style flits between ideas without exploring or explaining them properly. The narrative is disjoint and underdeveloped. Only at the end of the book does he even begin to make some positive suggestions for replacing the intellectual institutions he (rightly) criticises. Anybody who has read Richard Dawkins will be familiar with the arrogance with which Taleb states his claims and dismisses the thinking of others. It is almost enough to make one toss the book away.So I gave this book two stars. I valued the content but it is most definitely not groundbreaking and it most definitely is not well written.'Fooled by randomness' is slightly better."
9,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/964670-ben,1,"If you skipped your Systems, Statistics, or Random Variables classes in college, or if you think you know more than everyone else on Wall Street, then read this book. It will reaffirm what you already know. To the rest of you: this book will reaffirm what you thought you knew when you were 5 or 6...with an updated vocabulary. I put this book down after the first chapter, but thought I would give it another chance, that I was being unfair. When I read the second chapter (which is a metaphor for what Taleb thinks is him) I puked in my shirt. This man is the most conceited person I think I've discovered through reading his garbage hypothesis. If I met Taleb, I would recommend that he read some other theories on random variables (why does he use Gaussian distribution as the only example of random distribution?), systems theory, and the scientific theory. He apparently was sleeping though these discussions. So, not only was this book difficult to read due to the fact that Taleb was obsessed with how right he was, but the missing details and theories and general disregard for EVERYTHING that happened before him forced me to close this book, hand it to my roommate to sell on Amazon, take a few days to cool off, and then write this review. Thank God I am not an editor."
10,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1876124-bonnie,1,"This felt like it was trying to be the next The Tipping Point or Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything and just failed spectacularly, on all counts. Most importantly, perhaps, was that it was dull and a chore to read. In the little footnotes suggesting a chapter was unneccessary for a nontechnical reader and could be skipped (read: you are too dumb to understand this chapter, so don't even bother), like Chapter 15, I gladly took his advice because it meant one less chapter to slog through. I finished it out of a perverse desire to finish things, nothing more. My biggest complaint with the book, though, was that the author came across as a giant tool. He loves to use sarcastic quotes to criticize things like ""prestigious"" institutions (despite mentioning multiple times that he himself attended the prestigious Wharton School). He also often makes unecessary--and often derogatory--asides in parantheses (I do the same thing, but I'm not a published author who has things like an editor and a paycheck)and snipes at newspapers, the French, Harold Bloom, academics, CEOs, MBAs/businessmen (but did I mention he attended Wharton?), the rich, the Nobel Prize, etc. Whether his hatreds are justified or not, the way he does it comes across as terribly juvenile and he never misses a cheap shot. He appears to see himself as some kind of persecuted genius, taking on the establishment. He loves nothing more than describing how some so-called ""expert"" goes apopleptic when confronted with his brilliant Black Swan idea (which he keeps reminding you he came up with at the age of 22) and fantasizes about dropping rats down overly serious people's shirts to watch them squirm (is he actually 12 or just a bastard? who knows). Overall he comes across as arrogant, condescending, smug, self-righteous and incredibly pretentious, the kind of person you get trapped in conversation with at a party who will either goad and/or mock you for his own amusment or bore you with self-indulgent pontifications that include name-dropping obscure writers to impress upon you how smart he is. He also seems to be something of a failed/aspiring novelist, as he decides to make up the character of Yevgenia Krasnova, a fictional novelist whose book was a Black Swan, something that no one wanted to publish but then became a huge hit. Why does he have to make her up? The publishing industry is littered with these people, it would be simple to use a real person. But not only does he make her up (and does not even bother to tell you she is fake until the following chapter) but he gives several pages to her biography, invents fake friends and THEIR biographies and then comes back to her AGAIN, all with no real relevance. These fictional characters could've been cut out entirely or replaced with real people and not affected the book at all. They are simply another one of his petty self-indulgences. I could have saved time, money and my blood pressure level and probably been more entertained by simply reading the book's entry on Wikipedia. The central idea is good, but the execution oh-so-isn't. "
11,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,1,"This book profoundly nasty and intellectually demented. Taleb a classic science denier; oscillating between anti-science and pseudo-intellectual arguments. When some scientist says something he likes, he misrepresents it to fit his narrative.

His argumentation in this book is like a case study in logical fallacies and crank red flags.Special pleading.Ignoring disconfirming evidence like the exceptions to the professed rule.* ""Certain professionals ... don't know more about their subject matter than the general population.""

The first claim is only partially true. The reputation of an author is judged by their published work, but the products of science are ideas. These ideas are, in the scientific literature, judged primarily by their content. In science, a humble patent clerk can become the biggest name in theoretical physics by having the right idea. The accusation of tit-for-tat citation is ludicrous. Speak for yourself, Taleb!* ""Chapter 15: The Bell Curve, That Great Intellectual Fraud."" He rails against misuse of the bell curve by those ""who wear dark suits"" without ever giving a single god damn specific example. He accuses whole fields of study, like economics, of being rife with mathematical theatrics. If that's true I'd love to read about it. But he offers no evidence for this, and is more guilty of this particular offense than any person I know. http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/pp2...* ""In my mind mathematicians, trained for certainties, had no business dealing in randomness.""

12,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7986781-heidi-the-reader,3,"Nassim Nicholas Taleb discusses ""black swans"", unexpected and life-changing events, and how life is far more uncertain than most believe it to be. He also examines, in-depth, how we fool ourselves into believing reality is otherwise by various means like confirmation bias (we look for evidence to support our existing beliefs) and narrative fallacies (the tendency to describe existence using linear stories when reality is far more complicated).Mix in a heaping dose of storytelling and autobiographical information and you get The Black Swan.""This combination of low predictability and large impact makes the Black Swan a great puzzle; but that is not yet the core concern of this book. Add to this phenomenon the fact that we tend to act as if it does not exist!"" Prologue xxiiThis is a dense read, full of philosophical references and terminology. Basically, beyond black swans having a larger impact on reality than we realize they do, this book can be simplified way down to ""beware of because"" and ""know what you don't know"".""Beware of because"" because (tee-hee) reality is far more random than most believe it to be. And we suck at predicting the future, for a variety of reasons, but partially because it is impossible to project future events from historical ones.""Note here that I am not saying causes do not exist; do not use this argument to avoid trying to learn from history. All I am saying is that is it not so simple; be suspicious of the ""because"" and handle it with care — particularly in situations where you suspect silent evidence."" pgs 120-121""Silent evidence"" is the information not readily apparent for whatever reason. Taleb gives an illustrative example of silent evidence from ancient history of a philosopher being presented an argument that a group of sailors survived a shipwreck because they prayed. The philosopher wonders how many of the sailors who drowned were also praying. The drowned sailors, you see, are the silent evidence.Biologically, Taleb says, human beings are not set up to be deep thinkers and are fooled by a variety of logical fallacies. This is only a problem because, as time goes on, humanity has less running away to do from things trying to eat us and more dealing with the complexities of modern existence.But by remembering ""to know what we don't know"" and understanding some of the limitations built into our brains by memory and logical fallacies, we can be prepared to make better decisions than before. Or, at least, we'll have a better grasp on how risky and unknown life is.Anyway, this book certainly gave me a lot to think about. The part that struck me the most is when Taleb applies his black swan idea to careers and how this uncertainty applies particularly to authors and artists. For every J.K. Rowling, there will be thousands of writers who never make that break through. I started wondering how many extraordinary books I will never get to read because of this phenomena.The author's tone throughout the book, slightly irreverent, didn't annoy me as much as it seems to have bothered other readers. I enjoyed learning a new way to look at reality, but, as I mentioned before, this is a dense read and I wouldn't consider it ""fun"" reading either.It may appeal most to philosophers and anyone who wants to consider new ways to view reality."
13,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1123611-rob,1,"A lot of blogs said a lot of nice things about this book, and from this I conclude that most of those bloggers either A) strictly read the executive summary or B) only read other bloggers. This is a pretty terrible book, and while it has one or two good ideas, they are better and more rigorously expressed in books like ""Sway"" or ""The Drunkard's Walk"" than they are in this shameless exercise in self promotion.The fact that the author displays a limited understanding of the topic, and tends to lump everything he doesn't understand into the same bucket would be forgivable from an author possessed of wit and charm. Sadly, we get neither, and no small portion of the book is dedicated to elaborations on the author's high opinion of himself and low opinions of virtually everyone else.If you are thinking about reading the book because you've heard the term ""A Black Swan"" in an interesting context, I can only attempt to wave my arms in frantic warning. The eponymous black swan is an event which is highly unlikely to happen, so unlikely as to be unpredictable, but which happens anyway because when a lot of things happen (and they do) then it becomes nearly certain that some of them will be wildly unlikely. The greater the range of possible outcomes, the more disruptive this black swan will be. In short, if you grasp normal distribution, you already know this.This is very much an ""Everyone But Me Is Stupid"" sort of book, and as such it is guaranteed to have a certain appeal to readers who share that sentiment. If that's the case then it's probably a good read, but otherwise I really strongly endorse any other book on the topic. Either of two I mention (Brafman & Brafman's 'Sway' and Mlodinow's 'The Drunkard's Walk') will be more informative and vastly more entertaining."
14,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75564661-seema-singh,1,"I love reading and I rarely criticise authors. I think it takes discipline to complete a book and thus authors deserves respect. This review is my first negative one and hopefully my last. I buddy read this which was the only positive aspect. We read about a chapter a day and every time we discussed it, we would be at a loss for words. I heard such great reviews about this book highlighting that it was quite controversial. Generally i seek out anything controversial but this author is just a rebel without a cause. It was a perfect example of the dunning kruger effect (which is a concept that the author refers too in the book). About 40 % was contradictory ramblings, the other 40 % was an attack on the greatest scientists and philosophers of our time. In fact he even targets every person with an MBA. Another 10 % was about how the author knows more than anybody else in the world (he basically regurgitates known concepts and comes up with new words which he strings  together to form nonsensical statements). For someone who clearly despises statistics, he claims to understand it better than a Phd student  (i suppose its normal to spend all your valuable time becoming an expert in a subject so that you can go on to passionately discredit it). The lowest point was when he insulted autistic people encouraging them to send someone else to socialise at a party because apparently he is 'ceratin' that autistic people are incapable of socialising themselves. The last 10 % was basically a constant reminder that the bell curve and statistics in general is complete nonsense. Sorry I may have given the wrong stats (deliberately) but I'm sure that the author won't mind because who needs stats anyway. I honestly didn't see the point of the book. In the beginning of some chapters, he would agree with some mathematician or philosopher but by the end of the the very same chapter, he does a complete 360 (sorry there goes my reference to maths again). The amazing bit is that he actually uses so much of stats and science to explain his points but then goes on to discredit the very same principles. For someone who is preaching about the fact that most things can't be predicted with certainty (which is rather obvious), he is fairly 'certain' about his viewpoint. In fact he is so certain that he literally created his own aproach to randomness. If you are interested in arrogant ignorance, please read this book. This is by far the worst non fiction book I have read but it did give my friend and I plenty to laugh about so it wasn't a complete waste of time. I highly recommend reading this for pure entertainment."

Very anectdotal as well as making use of ""thought experiments"" to illustrate concepts that could have done with more explanation and less story. Yes, I get his point that stories help us learn, but I would argue that stories work best as analogies on the mythical or fable level, or when a single analogy perfectly illustrates an entire principle such as Scroedinger's cat.Update: cannot get through this muddled mess of a book.

His key practical point is about the need for a NON-parametric look at any situation in which low-probability events can carry a high-impact. He's almost certainly right that we over-apply the ""bell curve"" and other normalized frequency distributions, with the consequence of underestimating the probability of very rare events.But he's kind of a jerk about it.If you don't mind that kind of thing (I don't, really), then this is a pretty good read. If you've thought along these lines before, though, don't expect to be startled. There are no magic recipes for success in Taleb's ""Extremistan"" here, just some common sense principles that you can pretty much derive from the first 50 pages of the book.My only other complaint--and it's not one I can really spell out with any confidence--is this: I came away with this diffuse sense of overconfidence from Taleb...that he believes his metaphors and conjectures, etc. apply in more instances than they actually do.All told, it's a good book, and if I could force it on MBA graduates, I would. I'd just package it with a single grain of salt."

Difficult to comprehend during the first reading, it attacks the application of the Gaussian bell curve in Modern Portfolio Management Theory viciously and having read it a lot recently, it makes me feel like a fool. The book is a treasure trove if you are a quizzer. Contains a hell lot of names(philosophers, economists, mathematicians..). Makes you think hard and gives you a lot to build upon. Has invoked a strong urge to read more philosophy."
18,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64540-misha,2,"This book is a weird mix of novel ideas, bragging, and pseudo-science.Taleb makes a strong case for his theory of black swans. It's an interesting and valuable theory but it's also one that could be communicated in a short conversation and does not need a whole book to contain it. Taleb fills the rest of the pages by bragging about his own success and ridiculing established philosophers, economists, and anyone else he can think of. I'm not in any position to judge his opinions of these people, but I know that he really drops the ball with his math, which is amateur at best and misleading at its worst. For example, on page 235 of the hardcover edition he writes: ""Take a random sample of any two people in the U.S. population who jointly earn $1 million per annum ... it would be $50,000 and $950,000"" This is used to illustrate income inequality in the U.S., but really the only reason it's true is because $50,000 is a common annual income. If he set his total to $2 million, or $100 million, his point would seem even more significant. I stopped reading this book shortly after that page."

In the first few pages he name-drops people like Umberto Eco and Nabokov, tells us about people who were rather unknown five years ago (but forgets to tell us that they are still rather unknown now), and compares himself to people in history who are/were actually influential. For a man who claims he is not writing an autobiography, he really works hard to impress the reader. He adds little bits of information in parentheses, between dashes, and then tacks some on with footnotes, all in some bizarre attempt to sound funny or cute or intelligent, but he really just sounds like a jerk. For a guy writing a book that claims ""what we don't know is more important that we do know,"" he really wants the reader to know that he sure knows a whole lot. He also tries to be really conversational and funny, but he isn't funny, and he keeps coming up with examples (some good, some bad) to illustrate and re-illustrate his points. For better or worse, though, he does have a good point - black swans are out there and can change everything we know in instant, and some people refuse to acknowledge or let others know about these potential swans. Unfortunately, it may have been the worst beginning of any book I have ever read... that's why I didn't get past page 13. "

The use of mathematics in social sciences overestimates what we know (observed past events)and underestimates what we don't (probable future events): too little science papers succeeded to make (near) accurate predictions; and successful inventions are almost always accidental. Thaleb proposed Mandelbrotian approach against Gaussian (to which detail i am not technically capable to comprehend). To statistics-illiterate like me, Black Swan is highly persuasive. Thaleb's humor is never without satire and his case illustrations are sometimes fictious (on a regular basis i would say it's a weakness, on this, i'm open to suggestion). In the last book i read, Practical Intelligence, Karl Albrecht proposes one skill for a person to develop for the purpose of exercising his/her full intellectual potentials: metaboxical thinking (that's a fancier term for out-of-the-box thinking). Thaleb is clearly in that category. In a bell-curve, he would place himself in an extreme place (either far left or far right), but that is highly improbable considering bell-curving is against his belief."

A bit bitter for those who are unfamiliar with the Black Swan brand of uncertainty, yet disconcertingly alerting for those who have encountered this rare blend. The Black Swan glides through deep philosophical discussions and clever humor as effortlessly as its namesake. I was deeply enthralled by Nassim Nicholas Taleb's depth of erudition and wisdom concerning the philosophy of uncertainty. The second edition of which I was privileged to read contained an extra 70 pages of essays replete with great gems as well as technical knowledge. Having a background in finance and having read Complexity by M. Mitchell Waldrop helped me to see deeply into what the author decided to add in this edition. As for the rest of the book there is probably nothing that I can say that hasn't already been said by many other reviews. A great book for those who are interested in risk and uncertainty."
26,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,2,"Nassim Taleb's earlier book ""Fooled by Randomness"" was enormously successful - deservedly so, in my opinion. Unfortunately, this second book is a complete disappointment. Despite its length, it adds very little of interest to the material in the first book. Much of it is a rambling and indulgent rehash of ideas already developed adequately in the first book. If you are looking for fresh insight, spare your money.Taleb is a very smart guy. In the first book, he wrote fluidly, clearly, without condescending to the reader. Unfortunately, this sequel does not manage to avoid a self-congratulatory smugness, which makes it less fun to read than the earlier book.Recommendation: ""Fooled by Randomness"" is a book which should be read by everyone. Give ""The Black Swan"" a miss."
27,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1910836-lobstergirl,2,"This book ""just wrote itself,"" Taleb says early on. I believe him. Rarely do you read anything so rambling, bouncing from anecdote to anecdote, with such wack-ass headings: Saw Another Red Mini! / Information is Bad for Knowledge / Don't Cross a River if It Is (on Average) Four Feet Deep / How to Look for Bird Poop / How Not to Be a Nerd / How Coffee Drinking Can Be Safe. On the internet this is called clickbait, and once you've clicked and realized how shallow the resulting story is, or how it has little to do with its heading, you're pissed.I suppose it's at least somewhat true that we undervalue the rare, high-profile, hard to predict event (the black swan). But the book was overlong and boring. Taleb should have condensed his ideas down to a book half this size. One entertaining aspect was his disgusting narcissism. Every five pages he praises himself and blasts all the idiots around him. This is typical:The postcrash years [he's referring to the 1987 stock market crash] were entertaining for me, intellectually. I attended conferences in finance and mathematics of uncertainty; not once did I find a speaker, Nobel or no Nobel, who understood what he was talking about when it came to probability, so I could freak them out with my questions. They did ""deep work in mathematics,"" but when you asked them where they got their probabilities, their explanations made it clear that they had fallen for the ludic fallacy - there was a strange cohabitation of technical skills and absence of understanding that you find in idiot savants."

The Covid19 is globally massive, was predictable by some and, surely, ""darker than Vantablack"".  ""Frustration that the pandemic we are living through was predictable and preventable,...”. Dominic Jermey of the Zoological Society of London Maybe for some it was improbable (I mean, for those who insisted ""it's just a flu on steroids"", or those against lockdowns or ""travel bans""). [Yes, some acted as if it ""didn't exist""]. It really depends on which side of the ""fence"" you're at: victim or agent/perpetrator (if the virus was a ""planned thing""**). If there was a plan, those who ""did""***it, knew about the odds. The millions of victims (both the dead and the infected) didn't and weren't prepared.But even if the coronavirus spread was the result of an accident (which might have occurred in a Wuhan lab), there's still an element of prediction...and criminality, because the virus was not fully contained; thus let loose. Plus, information was blocked.🐼 🐼 🐼Now, back to the book. One might think, once upon a time everybody believed swans were all white. Until Australia was discovered. Then that belief was falsified.According to Nassim a Black Swan event has 3 characteristics. (1) It's an outlier; a rare event. (2) It carries extreme impact. (3) Its explanation occurs only after the fact, you may call it ""retrospective predictability"".The author makes the case for this thesis: small number of Black Swans can explain almost everything in the world. I have my doubts, though.He also suggests that increasing effects of Black Swans in our recent time is due to increasing complexity. Maybe.He gives plenty of examples (some from his own experience as a ""quant"" and a financial trader) of faulty definitions of ""risk"" in finance; ...and astrology. Because they leave aside Black Swans. So he wonders, ""why do we keep focusing on pennies instead of dollars, why, on minutiae instead of general large events?"" [I even heard him once speaking about ""extreme events"" and telling the audience: ""try to avoid your psychology professor and you'll live longer""]. 🤨🤨""Unread books are antilibrary"" (be it the Umberto Eco's, a very large one or any other). Black Swans come from our misrepresentations on the role (likelihood) of surprise, ..and unread books. An antischolar is a skeptical empiricist, as Nassim likes to think of himself.How the Black Swan keeps hiding from us? Because we are fooled by our emotions and other errors (the confirmation error, namely). Even knowledge derived from games is ""lethal"".Nassim's analysis of some of the errors the human mind makes, is pertinent. Like, many people do confuse ""almost all terrorists are Moslems"" for ""almost all Moslems are terrorists"". The consequence is an overestimation of 50,000 times. Unfair, really. And still, I am wondering, there are other birds ...and animals, even extinct ones. And colors. Nassim, I would challenge you to write another series called ""Certo"", this time around. On the first volume you would focus on Retroactive Epistemology apropos the coronavirus. (As if implementing a sort of variation of the Melting Ice Cube experiment you describe in your book). Who's accountable for the spread of Covid19?? You should focus your epistemological machinery on finding the culprit. Not for money-making purposes. Rather to pursue Truth. There are minds in the West who think there's a panda bear, invisible thus far, doing terrible things.

29,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,3,"This book is hyper-interesting, very rich but also super-annoying at the same time. So much has been written about it, that I am going to limit myself to some essentials. This book is about the absolutely unexpected, the black swan you would never suspect if you only saw white swans all your life. Taleb, of course, refers to numerous historical examples of things that have come completely out of the blue: the collapse of the Soviet Union, Nine-eleven, major stock market crises and so on. And of course also the things in our ordinary life: when you look back, it is usually a succession of unexpected events that keep stuck in your memory and have shaped your life. The interesting thing about this book is that Taleb does explain in a solid way why we are always surprised by such things. And that is in the first place psychological: we are mentally set up so that we always expect things to go their way as they are now, we assume stability, while reality is very complex and almost unpredictable; our misjudgment is also caused because we expect everything to be very logical and linear, that cause and effect are always very clear, even in advance. Not so. What's more: we usually strongly oppose warnings about what could go wrong, while - if you look at history - uncertainty is the rule and regularity the exception. So the problem mainly is situated between our ears.But what is worse: scientists, historians and journalists reinforce that tunnel vision by presenting - in retrospect - plausible explanations, which gives us the impression that if we had sufficient knowledge, we would have been able to estimate everything better and therefore in the future will be able to make the correct estimation, because we know so much more. Or they make it clear that the circumstances were very exceptional, and that a repetition is as good as impossible (and of course they're right: there's almost never a real repetition, every Black Swan is different).I’m just giving a very superficial summary of what Taleb offers, because his book is actually very rich in examples and arguments. But .... as I said, it is also very annoying at the same time. For three, maybe four reasons. The first is that Taleb almost exclusively focuses on the economy, especially the stock market; that makes sense, since he was a stock market trader and therefore gained a lot of experience in that environment, but it narrows the focus substantially. Two: as the book progresses, Taleb dabs his pen more and more in the purest vitriol against all kinds of scientists, stock market gurus, statisticians and the like, whom he names by name (especially Nobel laureates). According to him they have completely missed the point of reality, by using the wrong methods. It may well be that Taleb is right, that is not what matters to me, it is mainly about the way he presents his criticism: with an arrogance that borders on the unlikely and that only increases as the book progresses.Moreover, he - and this is my third objection to this book - has resorted to a very technical, statistical explanation to reinforce his bold claims: whole chapters are devoted to mathematical models that – according to Taleb – don’t relate to reality. He may also be right there, but as a reader he completely lost me there. And then there is a fourth objection against this book, which in retrospect is perhaps more important than seems plausible at first glance: all experts, both the reliable and the untrustworthy, to which Taleb refers are .... men; there is only one female character in this book and that is completely fictional; it might be an interesting study to determine the correlation between the Black Swan syndrome and gender issues (not the least those of Taleb himself, I refer to his mysoginist ""Twitter-war"" with Mary Beard).In short, if I can give a concise reading warning: read only the first half of this book and make the best of it, but forget the second half (unless you’re a professional economist or statistician). And remember especially: Black Swans do exist, but you can arm yourself against them to a very limited extent, just by using common sense, and knowing that - at any moment in your life or in history in general - shit can happen."
30,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,3,"This is a book about the perils of real life randomness that don't fit within neat distributions such as the bell curve. The author explains his insight in a wandering narrative spiced with enough personal autobiography, criticism of nobel laureates, and even fictional characters to hold the reader's interest. Through most of the book I was considering giving it 4 or 5 stars, but then toward the end of the book the author hurt his credibility by going overboard with his criticism of other economist. I think this book was rescued from obscurity by the coincidental quote included in a pre-publish review manuscript that appeared to predict the 911 attack. It included a quote of a French philosopher who said, "" ... predicting something like that is like predicting when the World Trade Center will be hit by an airplane."" (my paraphrased quote) The irony is that the point of the quote was that you can't predict things like that. Most reviewers took it as a prediction that came true. Thus the book became famous."

The prose did not capture my interest, and his examples seemed to imitate (badly) the anecdotal style of Blink or Freakonomics.His postulation is not original--indeed \""black swans\"" and the other jargon that Taleb invents are merely the repurposing of well-known psychological/economical laws and whathaveyou.The book should have been more cursive. It was .. somewhat disorganized, not aesthetically but intellectually.He spoke at length about something which was actually an embellished version of the \""confirmation bias,\"" etc.He demonstrated that the \""narrative fallacy\"" is something to be avoided at all costs, but all the corroborative evidence in this book is buttressed by NARRATIVE.What!"

34,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26055396-sense-of-history,3,"It has been more than two months since I read this book and only now I succeed in writing a review about what this book can mean for a historian. That says something about how difficult it is to separate the problematic aspects of this book (the arrogant and polemical tone) from the real content. Because Taleb does have something to say for those who look at the past.For the sake of clarity, firstly his definition of Black Swans: these are unexpected events, both negative and positive, with a huge impact, where no prior warnings exist for those who experience the event, but of which we post-factually are able to give explanations and thus have the impression that they were nevertheless predictable. That is already quite something to chew on. What Taleb offers is the paradoxical side of Black Swans: they come unexpectedly, but we can explain them perfectly afterwards. Some examples: the First World War had to break out if you see how recklessly in the decades before an arms race was under way and how the political leaders underestimated the enormous implications of their aggressive behavior; the fall of the Communist bloc in 1989 could have been predicted, because there were many indications that the economies of those countries were broke, that they were military-technological giants on clay feet, and that their populations only confessed to the official ideology for appearances; and so on, and so on.Taleb sketches nothing less here, than the work of historians do (and by extension of course also journalists and other categories): explaining why something happened. You could have the impression that he actually takes this as a child's play: every one could predict the outcome, given the right facts. But of course, Taleb is not that stupid. In his book there is one striking example that, in all its simplicity, explains the core problem of historical observation. Taleb quotes a scientific experiment: suppose you have an ice block of 1 cubic meter, and you put that in a heated room; by applying a number of scientific laws you can almost perfectly predict how quickly this ice block will melt and how large the pool of water eventually will be; but then think about the reverse experiment: you start with a large pool of water in a room; you can formulate dozens or even hundreds of explanations of how that pool came about, of which only one is that of the experiment with the ice block. In other words: it’s nearly impossible to find out exactly what happened.When I read this, I was initially very impressed: indeed, the dense veil that hangs over the past makes it almost impossible for a historian to reconstruct what really happened. But after some thought, I have to admit that I felt badly deceived, or better, that I was angry with myself that I had not seen it at once. Because the experiment of Taleb is of such simplicity that it is not realistic: from the experience of a historian we know that there have to be a lot more clues in the room than the simple pool of water: maybe there were still people in white lab coats running around indicating a scientific experiment, perhaps there were heat-convectors in the immediate vicinity, maybe in the puddle there still was the wooden pallet on which the ice block was transported, perhaps scientific reports surfaced in which the experiment was literally described, or perhaps there was a cleaning crew present of which some people had seen everything happen, etc. To keep it short: a really perfect reconstruction may not be easy, but there are always enough traces that provide an approximative, plausible explanation. And just that last thing, and the methodology that comes with it, is the work of the historian.Another interesting aspect in this book is that Taleb gives many explanations why we do not see Black Swans coming, and that is also relevant to the work of the historian, because it shows where the pitfalls lie, the classic ""fallacies"" of which one half century ago the American historian D.H. Fischer gave an almost exhaustive list in his seminal work ""Historic Fallacies"". Taleb mainly focusses on psychological-mental aspects: our very human inclination, for example, to always assume that things will continue to go as they go now; we are mentally blind to the factor of change and chance in history. What is especially bad is that now we think we can predict the future better because of the flight science has taken and has brought more knowledge to the foreside. No wonder Taleb has a lot of criticism on econometrists and demographers who make predictions about economic growth, population trends and so on, which in retrospect almost always prove to be incorrect. Now, Taleb blames this mainly on the use of wrong probability models (and the technicality of this makes the reading of the second half of this book so difficult). And that's where - according to me - he gets trapped in an own kind of contradiction. His book is full of historical examples of predictions and expectations that turned out to be wrong, and at the end of his book he argues for a form of stoicism because we cannot know which unexpected things can happen. But in other places he argues that we are able to demarcate an area (he calls it Mediocristan) where we are fairly safe, and thus also a very small area (Extremistan) where the Black Swans are active; and this knowledge, that demarcation, could protect us to a certain extent against huge mistakes. I'm afraid that, in all its vagueness, with this Taleb once again opens the door to historians who imagine that, based on facts from the past, they can predict the future to some extent, and we are back to square one. The incomprehensible thing is that Taleb himself warnes against these kind of mistakes, mistakes that are inherent to mankind: ""We do not spontaneously learn that we don’t learn that we don’t learn. The problem lies in the structure of our minds: we don’t learn rules, just facts, and only facts. Metarules (such as the rule that we have a tendency to not learn rules) we don’t seem to be good at getting. We scorn the abstract; we scorn it with passion ""(pp xxvi). It is a lesson an historian should always remember."

I am not afraid to admit that I like patterns, I like predictability, I like stability...I understand so much more now about our erroneous desire to make things fit Gaussian bell curves, even when its inappropriate to do so. I will never read a mutual fund prospectus or annual report the same way again nor will I ever trust an economic forecast. But I think that this book opened my eyes in a good way, too. Despite the arrogant and aggressive way he presents his material, he offers some really salient points and I especially liked a phrase from the last chapter:""In refusing to run to catch trains, I have felt the true value of elegance and aesthetics in behavior, a sense of being in control of my time, my schedule, and my life. Missing a train is only painful if you run after it! Likewise, not matching the idea of success others expect from you is only painful if that's what you are seeking."" Overall, I liked his anecdote-filled narratives and I laughed out loud at some of his sarcastic witticisms. I did not understand all of the technical bits, but I enjoyed the book as a whole.new words: salutary, gestalt, vitiate, polymathic"
36,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51862916-arunothia-marappan,4,"I really liked this book but it's tough to comprehend all that I got out of it. To begin with, the author's style of writing is not so comfortable.. I mean it does look like he's writing in a flow that's matching everything on his mind, but that flow doesn't naturally register in me. That might be because I'm neither exposed to the financial world like him nor have I previously even heard of all those long list of great thinkers he references. Given that, I was completely taken in by his examples to illustrate how science sometimes becomes the religion and how researchers are not always doing something that's significant but are just trying to get their next tenure. It's the sad reality of academia in today's times. This book has a lot of eye opening view of this world and has left me with a profound feeling of ignorance like never before. It confirms a lot of the biases I had about this world and it makes it even harder for me now to make sense out of anything. In short, ""I don't know."" and if there was any dopamine shot beyond that from this book then it's that ""Nobody knows anything"". I recommend it to everyone who wants to be humbled by the limits of knowledge."
37,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32553593-elliott-bignell,5,"Taleb - Arabic for ""student"" - is infuriatingly sure of himself and even more infuriatingly difficult to fault. False modesty is tantamount to fraud, and Taleb quite properly declines to defraud us. Reading him feels like being the bear in the John West Salmon advert. You dance and spin and deliver a perfect back kick and you think you've landed him on his bottom. Then he says, ""Oh, look! An eagle!"" You look up. He kicks you in the nadgers.He got me with a question about simple probability. He asks an academic statistician and a trader from the Bronx: A fair coin has just come up heads 99 times. What is the probability that it will come up heads next throw? ""50%,"" I say, smug person that I am. ""The coin has no memory."" No fool I. ""Come on,"" says the trader. ""The coin is loaded. No fair coin is going to come up heads 99 times."" Oof. Argh, my nadgers!The slightly less smug person than hitherto had thought within the frame offered; the smart trader questioned the frame.At first the book comes across as a bit of an intellectual mixed grill. There are a lot of unconventional takes on fairly familiar themes such as confirmation bias and the role of disconfirmation in empiricism. As you enter the final stretch, however, you realise that you have been looking at a unity all along. Taleb just needed to move his pieces into place.What he has done is to checkmate conventional economics and finance theory. This theory wins Nobel Prizes, but if Taleb is right - and personally I'm convinced - then the most horrible and potentially catastrophic error lies at its very heart. He essentially states that the probability distribution in economics and finance is not Gaussian but scale-invariant, determined by a power law, and that the whole of modern economics is labouring under a misapprehension that causes it dangerously to underestimate the probability of extreme events. In 1987, when he was a trader, a crash occurred that wiped out essentially all the money the banks had ever made. This represents a TWENTY SIGMA deviation if trading fluctuations are really Gaussian - it should happen once in several billion times the life of the Universe.When my edition of the book came out, in 2007, it happened again.Taleb describes his reception at economics conferences when he lays out the evidence for this error. It might look familiar to climate scientists, who have also detected the smell of a dead rat in affairs that matter to neoliberal economists. He is essentially condemned for heresy.The immune reaction facing Taleb would kill any less robust agent, but the fact is that he is not putting anyone's job in danger. They can still deal with probabilistic models and work in finance. They just need a better model. What he is facing is the denial of a challenge to a substantial intellectual investment.There is the slight whiff of paradox in this book. A philosopher allegedly told Taleb this and he admits the charge. I see a few candidates, but the central one seems to me to be this: The black swan may encounter its own black swan. It essentially states that we can't see our black swans - things that overturn our presumptions - from where we stand. We cannot generalise from experience without introducing circularity. This is tied up with the problem of induction. The problem is that the black swan is a generalisation from experience, seen from where we stand. I don't see it as that big a deal, however. Firstly, pace Gödel, any work sufficiently complete entails a risk of paradox. Secondly, it doesn't change anything. Vastly improbable events occur too often in finance. That's a problem, and it's a show-stopper if not taken into account. If these fluctuations are scale-invariant and the probabilities to date are any guide, we may well live to see a crash an order of magnitude or two larger than the current piddling crisis. This is a big deal. Then there is the sheer inequitability of outcomes in a scale-invariant distribution of rewards.Suffice to say, something has to give.This book is a rare flight of intellectual brilliance from a man with little patience for intellectuals, or at least academics - erudite, witty and entirely convincing. It foot-sweeps one repeatedly, challenging considerable intellectual investments of the reader's own. Opinionated, self-assured and unconventional, I found myself hating him. I wish the site allowed us an extra five stars just so I can show how much I hate him. "
38,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,3,"I have a strange relationship with this book. Back in 2008 I was having a talk with my then-agent about what to write next. He said to me ‘You ought to write something like The Black Swan,’ proving, as we shall see, that he hadn’t read the book. I duly bought a copy, had a quick flick through it, decided it was pretentious tosh and put it to one side. So it has sat there unread for four years, until I was needing a bit of light relief from physics books and decided it was time it was reviewed.I quickly discovered this is in many ways a very readable book, though with some serious reservations I’ll mention in a moment. Nassim Nicholas Taleb really only makes one point in the entire 292 pages, but it is a very important point: that there are two types of randomness, and the sort physicists and economists deal with bears very little relationship to the kind of randomness that drives everything from the weather to sales of books and the success or failure of traders.This is a hugely significant point, and Taleb has no end of fun pointing out the idiocy of those who try to use predictions based on the normal distribution bell curve in situations that are dominated by huge unexpected discrepancies. As he points out, a turkey trying to predict the future given its normal distribution of life’s ups and downs in the past would never predict the day when Christmas looms on the horizon and it gets the chop.So far, so good. And Taleb uses some great examples and makes some excellent points along the way. (Or rather scores some excellent points as this is very much a ‘me versus the world’ book.) But, despite this flash of genius there are good reasons for this book only getting three stars.One is the style. It is often pompous, didactic, nit-picking and irritating. There is far too much of the author in it – I really don’t care about him or want to know about him. The other is the lack of content. My agent was wrong about ‘writing another Black Swan‘ because the whole point of mega-successful books is you can’t predict their coming. And Black Swan also proves him wrong as one of his tests of a successful non-fiction book was to say ‘Is it a book or is it an article?’ I.e. does it have enough material to make a book? Black Swan is definitely an article posing as a book – it makes the one point over and over and over again, because there is really very little else to say. There is no real defence against this kind of randomness (though he gives a couple of pages of vague suggestions) and so it is just a warning of things going wrong, repeated indefinitely.As such it shouldn’t have worked as a book – but it did (sorry, agent). I find it difficult to recommend it because I disliked so much of it, but I have to admire that key would-make-a-great-article point, so in the end it’s a book I would probably go out and buy anyway.Review first published on www.popularscience.co.uk and reproduced with permission"
39,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/815375-bernard-chen,5,"This was my first encounter with Nassim Taleb. The writing has a hint of condescension that would be more irritating if his points weren't so interesting. This guy is either great to have at dinner or an arrogant ass. Probably both on the same night.The basic idea behind the book is that the observational methods that underpin science can't prove the non-existence of an object/event. To make matters worse, human cognition is driven by heuristics instead of perfect memorization of data, so we have a lot of trouble processing the probability or scale (the expected values) of highly unlikely events. We tend to think that things will continue on as they are only changing an amount that we feel comfortable imagining - we aren't capable of predicting the major shifts in history.The definition of Black Swan events are that they are: completely unpredictable, huge in their effect (good or bad), and appear to be predictable in hindsight but really aren't.A couple of examples of situations with unpredictable shifts in thinking:Early Europeans thought all swans were white because they'd only ever seen white swans. There was no way to prove the existence or non-existence of black swans until they saw their first example.Turkey's think they have great lives. Every day for 1000 days a farmer feeds them and cleans their cage. The turkey's impression of its life is accurate for 1000 days, but on the 1001 day right before Thanksgiving, the farmer cuts off its head. Taleb really goes after people in the financial world who pretend that they can provide models of prediction. He targets the Black-Scholes model of option pricing in particular because it pretends to provide an estimate of value, but is really missing so many parameters that it's useless except to other people who buy into the model. As long as b-schools teach that the model is sacrosanct, and traders come from b-schools, then the system is internally consistent. Unfortunately, options (and stocks) will eventually go through an event not covered by the model and everyone who depends on Black-Scholes will have a surprisingly positive/negative event.My main takeaway:- invest in items that have positive black-swan ability with limited downsides. For example: startups can make disproportional profits, with losses limited to the initial investment. Movies and books behave similarly (some winners enjoy massive upside, all players can limit their downside).I'm sure I've forgotten tons of info in this book since I read it a year ago, though."
40,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2729963-duffy-pratt,4,"We don't know what we don't know. Pretending that we do can cause all kinds of harm.Taleb takes those basic ideas and spins them out in many, many directions. For me, despite his self-satisfaction and tendancy towards being insufferable, I enjoyed the writing. More, I like the ideas. They are ideas that seem simple, but are very easy to forget or willfully ignore.Here's an extrapolation from the book. I've wondered why Science Fiction as a genre seems to have failed. Taleb argues that history, and especially the history of science and technology, is made up of Black Swan events, events that were highly unlikely, unforseen, and had a huge subsequent impact. Easy examples are things like the invention of the transistor, or the wheel, or moveable type, or the rise of Christianity or Islam. The events with the greatest impact also tend to be the least foreseeable. What does this have to do with science fiction? When we project into the future, we tend to extrapolate from what we know. Science fiction that dealt with computers tended to deal with the consequences of a huge centralized computer, and extrapolation of the IBM mainframe. After a few decades, most science fiction just seems silly, because they got everything wrong. Just think of the scene in 2001 where the guy stops at a phone kiosk to make a video call home. It's likely that kids today won't even know what a phone booth was. So, science fiction, which tends to take a Japanese engineering approach to the future, becomes outdated very quickly, because it simply can't predict the astonishing leaps forward that are bound to happen, even though no-one knows what they are. One snarky comment, if I may. In the essay added for the second edition, Taleb praises building redundancy into systems to make them more robust, and less vulnerable to the bad effects of highly improbably events. It struck me that that might explain some of the structure of his book. But, if you have an interest in skepticism, or in randomness, then this book is definitely worth it. "
41,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/381736-dav,4,"This book is in my top 10 list now. I'm adding it to my Books-That-Changed-My-Thinking shelf here, although more accurately it should be Books-That-Clarified-And-Informed-My-Thinking. I won't go much into what it's about as I'm sure there are plenty of reviews covering that. For me personally it was a wonderful experience because Taleb, through the deep research allowed by being a gentleman scholar (unfettered from academic career or financial constraints), explores a philosophy toward which I intuitively have groped for much of my life. He convincingly reveals a sound foundation for a structure of thought that for me has been mostly a mist shrouded vision, perhaps even disconnected structures.The book is written with the snarky smug attitude of someone who has been repeatedly slighted by people whom he considers intellectually inferior. I'm ok with that. His scathing critiques on statistics and Nobel Prize winning economists are important and fundamentally correct if not polite or politically correct. Studies he mentions, such as the one showing you may well be better off trusting a cab driver's financial advice than that of the Federal Reserve chairman, should be popularized more. The importance to the general public of having a better understanding of the true risks in our world, especially in financial matters, is now readily apparent since the 2008 economic collapse, which Taleb accurately predicted in this book published in 2007."
42,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/253624-paula,4,"Have you read a book recently that blew your mind every other page? Because that's what ""Black Swan"" did to me. Basically, Taleb takes everything you learned in Econ and Statistics 101 and throws it out the window (which made me feel better, because I didn't do so well in Stats). There's only one main idea in this book: events in society are becoming increasingly random and unpredictable. We've moved from a world of averages to a world of extremes, and we have no way of guessing what those extremes are. Exhibit A: 9/11. Exhibit B: Bill Gates. Exhibit C: Sub-prime mortgages. Etc. etc. Most of the book is just a bunch of examples exhibiting this fact. They're necessary because we've all been trained the wrong way to think for so long. Usually I am so skeptical of these types of books, the ones that purport to examine society but don't come up with anything except a cute metaphor. ""Black Swan"" uses a cute metaphor but will really change the way you think. And try as critics might, Taleb's methods seem to be right. Check it out. "

48,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,5,"This book shames me deeply. Here I was thinking I was the only one with these ideas--and then this guy comes along, does it better, does it with more literary flare--and the guy knows math inside out! I cheered, I smiled, I screamed (quietly because no one really screams when they read a book), and then I became concerned (more on this later). In the last five or so years, there has really only been a handful of nonfiction books that have impressed me the way this one has. They are, in no particular order: *Jared Diamond: Guns, Germs, and Steel*Richard Rumelt: Good Strategy/ Bad Strategy *Josh Kaufman: The Personal MBA (for different reasons than the other three)*A Cultural Theory of International Relations, Ned Lebow I think I need to spend more time reading outside of the field of International Relations...but I digress. For me personally, the book comes with a number of problems. One, it encourages you not to study statistics too deeply, lest you become a “spreadsheet charlatan”! And this, just as I was getting going with statistics. The book also suggests that understanding risk and prediction is a liberal art! Never tell this to a guy with an English degree struggling to get the motivation to study statistics! Horrible! That’s what I thought all along, but I tricked myself into thinking I needed to learn statistics like all the other professional MBAs, PhD, and consultant-types. And I have been studying statistics off and on, all the time feeling like a liberal arts approach would give better value. But the only way I would know for sure is if I studied statistics. The F-word would fit nicely right here. Alas, I am a man of decorum. So, the book encourages you not to learn what the “spreadsheet charlatans” learn! It instead implores you to do what liberal arts people do: learn through doing, reflect on what you do, and use your creativity to tinker productively. That stuff is fun; I do it anyway! What’s the catch? Ironically, my concerns are mirrored by Ben, a reviewer who gives the book one star. He writes: “If you skipped your Systems, Statistics, or Random Variables classes in college, or if you think you know more than everyone else on Wall Street, then read this book. It will reaffirm what you already know. To the rest of you: this book will reaffirm what you thought you knew when you were 5 or 6...with an updated vocabulary.” Right on!He goes on to write:“I put this book down after the first chapter, but thought I would give it another chance, that I was being unfair. When I read the second chapter (which is a metaphor for what Taleb thinks is him) I puked in my shirt. This man is the most conceited person I think I've discovered through reading his garbage hypothesis. If I met Taleb, I would recommend that he read some other theories on random variables (why does he use Gaussian distribution as the only example of random distribution?), systems theory, and the scientific theory. He apparently was sleeping though these discussions.”The problem with my five star rating is that I am too susceptible to the message of this book. I’m not sure what to make of the second part of Ben’s review. When Nassim Taleb tells me to skip the parts that discuss math, it’s too easy for me to do so. If I accept the message of this book, I can save myself hours and hours of my productive life and spend it enjoying time with family (It’s like someone telling you, “You are free from the onus of learning German forever.” Are you sure? Are you sure I’ll never have to learn German. What about Spanish or Chinese?) So, the problem is that I lack a clear framework from which to read this book critically (read: skeptically)! I am convinced that he has the liberal arts background--his book is thoroughly entertaining (and despite what others think, not pretentious or pompous) and honest. It’s also rich in reflective thinking. And I am convinced the guy can do the numbers thing with the excel sheet if he wanted to. There is one path, however, open to me for critical reflection on this book. It goes something like this. The field of International Relations both within and outside the field sometimes gets comprehensively critiqued as “trained incapacity” from time to time. This is the same critique Taleb levels at the economists, social scientists, and MBA crowd. The Black Swan reminds me of much of the writing of Michael Shapiro on IR and its uselessness. In an interview on Theory Talks he has this to say about IR (http://www.theory-talks.org/2010/02/t... “My advice is to avoid becoming “a specialist in IR” because it is a specialty that is intellectually challenged; it’s a “trained incapacity” (to use Thorstein Veblen’s expression). One who wants to achieve a critical distance from the way the dominant disciplines make their worlds must seek to learn the nuances of what Jacques Rancière calls ‘indisciplinarity’.”Perhaps it’s easy to critique anything that becomes disciplinary as a kind of trained incapacity. The more you train at one thing--and especially the more time you devote to improvements at the margins (or frontier, your choice) of something--the more your other capabilities degrade. There are no shortages of theorists critiquing those who go so deep down the rabbit hole of one particular subdiscipline or way of thinking that they lose the capability for other kinds of thought (lateral thinking, common sense, or critical thinking--whatever you want to designate these types of thinking). Everyone knows a big name professor who became so good at one thing he or she completely lost the ability to communicate with 18 and 19-year old students. In the same way that I think these critiques of IR are a bit unfair, perhaps Taleb’s attack on “spreadsheet charlatans” and other types of charlatans dismisses too much of what is important or should genuinely be understood as a kind of progress. Just to get to this critique of his book though I have to stretch pretty far. IR is a trained incapacity--but it’s a useful one if you’re trying to solve certain types of problems. Even when you are solving these problems, though, the kind of IR you should use I think has more in common with Taleb’s thinking than any kind of dogmatic way of thinking. Anyway, perhaps Nietzsche had the last word when he said: “Death to all dogmatists.” (I can’t find exactly where he said that, but surely he meant that!). In short, like the other books on the list above, this one deserves a second read and some reflection--or should I finally get back to my statistics book? As long as statistics doesn’t lead to dogmatism and is not an anti-liberal arts, that should be fine. "
49,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2442229-richard-pinnell,1,"As I have a limited amount of time to read I'm usually quite cautious about choosing my books. Unfortunately on this occasion I threw caution to the wind and bought this book on the spur of the moment simply because it looked interesting. As it turned out this is one of the most tedious books I've ever had the misfortune to read. I really had to struggle just to not throw this book down on the ground, dowse it in petrol and set light to it. It was only because it cost me $10 and I really don't like to half finish books that I persevered. What is a Black Swan? It's an expected or random event. Actually NNT doesn't know if it is random or not, and that doesn't mater to him. What matters is that it is an unpredictable event. And what do unpredictable events mean? They mean we can't predict the future something which I think most sane humans are already aware of. That's why we have proverbs in English such as “don't count your chickens before they hatch” and ""the best laid plans often go astray"". For some strange reason, however NNT seems to think that he personally invented the idea of unpredictable events. Now imagine that someone were to sit down with the basic idea that the future is unpredictable and write 300 one page essays on the subject. Each essay would have the same subject I.e. the unpredictability of the future, but include different examples, anecdotes, scientific data or whatever in order to prove that the future is indeed unpredictable. It doesn't matter if the various examples, anecdotes and scientific data used to back up the claim are repeated just as long as each of the 300 one page essays is different. Now continue to imagine taking a pair of scissors and cutting up each of the essays into individual paragraphs so that you have about 1300 paragraphs on the same subject. Put all the paragraphs in a big hat and select them randomly one by one. Glue them all back together attach prologue to the beginning and a final summary chapter to the end and send it off to the publisher. If you can imagine that then you'll have a very good idea about this book. The book is so hideously badly written it defies words. NNT will be writing about bell curves in one paragraph, followed by a paragraph on dialectical materialism and then one on Vespa scooter riding. Two chapters latter bell curves pop up again, but this time followed by silly fantasies about stock market traders named fat Tony or Honest Bob with Karl Marx and Karl Popper in the next paragraph. The whole thing is totally disjointed and repetitive. On the very rare occasions that NNT actually starts to get interesting he will destroy it all by completely changing the subject and telling us about what a complete genius he is for having such a wonderfully marvellous idea. He sums the book up himself when on page 301 he writes “the book wrote itself”. "

There are negative black swans such as wars, natural disasters and recessions, and there are positive black swans such as the Harry Potter books, scientific discoveries and the internet. In this book, Nassim Nicholas Taleb starts by illustrating the fuzzy concept of a Black Swan by describing the war that took place in his native country (and mine). The Lebanese Civil War is well known for having lasted decades, but according to Taleb the consensus at the its earliest stages was that it would not last long. Since, before the war, all the different religions were living in harmony in Lebanon, and since the war was originally believed to only last a few weeks, Taleb claims that the Lebanese Civil War was a Black Swan.What happened in Lebanon (like in many other countries) demonstrates how a Black Swan was able to turn the tables around and change everything.In this book, Taleb will first introduce you to Black Swans, and then completely alter the way you look at certainty. I have always considered myself a skeptic, but after this book, I'm starting to think that I'm a delusional sucker. Your head will spin, you will be confused, and you will want to throw the book at the wall, but you'll come out better than before.I'm not saying this book is enough to get a full picture about black swans, in fact the picture is very much still murky; but this book does let you know that reality is not as mediocre as it seems.In this funny and daunting book, you won't only learn what black swans are, but also how you can lessen the blow of negative black swans and how you can make the best of positive ones.

Taleb is severely critical of the arrogance of many fields of human knowledge, and he is right. “I am most often irritated by those who attack the bishop but somehow fall for the securities analyst--those who exercise their skepticism against religion but not against economists, social scientists, and phony statisticians. Using the confirmation bias, these people will tell you that religion was horrible for mankind by counting deaths from the Inquisition and various religious wars.

Improbable events (black swans) are more likely than you think, because the ways they could occur don't come to mind without prompting.3. Avoid the impact of negative black swans with a low-risk strategy, and be open to the impact of positive black swans with a high-risk strategy.

He's up front about the fact that the only modern philosopher worth knowing is Karl Popper and he explains why.I don't understand why other reviewers don't love this book as much as do.

Highly recommended, and if you find yourself resistant to its main ideas, that may mean that you need to hear what Taleb has to say even more than I did.

62,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4969387-john,5,"It’s books like this that make me feel justified in giving other very good books a 4 or 4.5 stars. For large sections, this book felt like a 6. I had to read slowly. It took time to process, digest and try to apply all that Taleb had to say. Some sections I spent as much time staring out the window as I did actually reading words on the paper. I limited myself in the number of pages I read in a day in hope that spreading it out would help me process is more.  Chapter 6, The Narrative Fallacy, was mind-blowing. The mind’s desperate hunger for narrative is not a new idea to me. It is one I have read before (The Storytelling Animal by Jonathan Gottschall was a great read on the idea). But Taleb drove it home, and showed how deeply it affects our thinking. A couple of quotes from it:P66 “Our propensity to impose meaning and concepts blocks our awareness of the details making up the concepts.” We no longer see what exists, but see our interpretations. P69 “The same condition that makes us simplify (how we see the world) pushes us to think that the world is less random than it actually is.” To save “space” in our brains, we simplify. That simplification produces profound blindness to uncommon events. It was just in the news today that there were reports of another police shooting in Baltimore, a cold-blooded shooting of someone in the back. Multiple witnesses spoke with conviction that they saw it. But it turns out it never happened. Some noise sounded like a gun (it might have been one), just the perceived victim fell to the ground, all while police were pointing their guns at him. Thus people were convinced they saw a shooting. An extreme case, but a great example of how our brain strains and simplifies what it sees all the time.  The author did not talk about this, but the need for a narrative is why politicians give examples of a specific person to tell a story. Instead of talking about how a new factory in town created 200 new jobs, they will say something like, “Look at Jane Doe, hard-working mother of 2. Thanks to her new job at the factory, she is able to help her oldest daughter become the first family member to attend law school.” The narrative brings is home. Another politically related take away for me was how America is stuck with a two party political system. Taleb talks about how a winner-takes-all competition leads to larger inequalities. No other parties can gain a foothold in the country because of the current winner-take-all format. If a party gaining 10% of the vote was given 10% representation, Democrats and Republicans would quickly change (adapt) or become dinosaurs. Another deeply enlightening concept was the information about how poorly humans estimate odds. The studies about how estimating odds changes when you are given a cause for what you are supposed to predict, was particularly insightful. Our ability to predict what will happen is the cornerstone of our species. But also it’s our Achilles heel. We blind ourselves by not seeing all that could happen. Another great quote: “We have a natural tendency to listen to the expert, even in fields where there may be no experts.” P189. People who know the most are not always “experts!” Art, music, and pop culture are all fields this applies to. And perhaps weather forecasting. I felt challenged to think about what I accept as the narrative of History as it was taught to me. Reconstructing the past is much, much, much harder than we think it is. Again, the narrative idea works against us. It’s easy to simplify, but dangerous. It leaves a lot out, and gives a false impression that since the past narrative is obvious, the present and future should be too.  I can’t say enough good things about this book. Read it! "
63,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15639925-t-nu-vahtra,4,"""Science is about how not to be a sucker."" “Prediction, not narration, is the real test of our understanding of the world.”I was not too much impressed by ""Antifragile"" and I liked ""Skin in the game"" even less, but this book is among the earlier of Taleb's books while he was still ""less angry"" and the style of the writing did not spoil the message (the style was still quite arrogant to say the least). Mainly the book provokes you towards more critical thinking, the enemy number one in this one is the Gaussian distribution (which is not relevant for black swan events) and anyone claiming that they have the theories and knowledge to ""handle"" black swan events VS just trying to acknowledge them and limit the maximum negative exposure. There is also quite a lot of praise for Kahneman here while I know thought leaders who disagree with both Taleb and Kahneman in most things. At times it felt that the same message could have been conveyed with less words and repetition from different angles but maybe such approach is inevitable for ""influencers"". “Missing a train is only painful if you run after it! Likewise, not matching the idea of success others expect from you is only painful if that’s what you are seeking.”“When you develop your opinions on the basis of weak evidence, you will have difficulty interpreting subsequent information that contradicts these opinions, even if this new information is obviously more accurate.”“The problem with experts is that they do not know what they do not know”“I propose that if you want a simple step to a higher form of life, as distant from the animal as you can get, then you may have to denarrate, that is, shut down the television set, minimize time spent reading newspapers, ignore the blogs. Train your reasoning abilities to control your decisions; nudge System 1 (the heuristic or experiential system) out of the important ones. Train yourself to spot the difference between the sensational and the empirical. This insulation from the toxicity of the world will have an additional benefit: it will improve your well-being.”“The strategy for the discoverers and entrepreneurs is to rely less on top-down planning and focus on maximum tinkering and recognizing opportunities when they present themselves. So I disagree with the followers of Marx and those of Adam Smith: the reason free markets work is because they allow people to be lucky, thanks to aggressive trial and error, not by giving rewards or “incentives” for skill. The strategy is, then, to tinker as much as possible and try to collect as many Black Swan opportunities as you can.”“Consider a turkey that is fed every day. Every single feeding will firm up the bird’s belief that it is the general rule of life to be fed every day by friendly members of the human race “looking out for its best interests,” as a politician would say. On the afternoon of the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, something unexpected will happen to the turkey. It will incur a revision of belief.”“Read books are far less valuable than unread ones. The library should contain as much of what you do not know as your financial means, mortgage rates, and the currently tight real-estate market allow you to put there.”"
64,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82093-todd,4,"The Black SwanThis is one of those “must read” books that many more people will claim to have read than will actually slog through. Like with Fooled by Randomness, Taleb takes many more pages than necessary to get his important points across. Those points are that we have incredibly poor skills at estimating extreme events, we regularly abuse historical statistics in ways that set us up to fail miserably, and we should have a great distrust of most planning processes. The ultimate message is positive, however, since there are general guidelines on how we can do better (set yourself up for good extreme events while protecting the downside). The style will either excite or turn off the reader. 90% of the parenthetical phrases and footnotes add little except Taleb’s (often snarky) editorials. Traders are sometimes described as people for whom the only thing worse than losing money themselves, is watching others make money. Taleb writes as if the only thing worse than him not getting adequate attention for his ideas is watching others get lauded. He clearly wants this book to be considered scholarly as he has 19 pages of notes and a 28 page bibliography designed to demonstrate the depth of his own reading. Segmenting the personal prose from its academic foundation may have the effect of improving the accessibility to the ideas within, but the reader should be cautioned. Any author who, in the acknowledgements, states “…[the book] just wrote itself,” and then thanks his editor for protecting him from “the intrusions of the standardizing editors,” has probably produced a verbose, tangent driven effort rather than the perfect prose he imagines.If the style excites you, great. If it turns you off, try to work through it. The world is full of decision makers who rely on experts, statistics and intricate models that are built on soft sand. The risks they take affect all of us, and while this behavior will probably never stop, we can take steps to minimize the impact of their folly. Anyone who has been visited by a negative Black Swan will understand this implicitly. For the rest of us, the cost of this book will be a much lower tuition than we might have to pay learning the lessons first hand."
65,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30590986-laurent-michiels,4,"Idea 5 stars, style 2 stars.I am following Taleb for c. 5 years now, and his ideas, including the Black Swan-concept, have contributed significantly to how I view the world.A Black Swan is an event which is rare, has an extreme impact and is predictable in retrospect. Our problem is that we tend to be blind with respect to incomplete information and the unknown, and particularly to the large deviations. Yet, knowing the concept of Black Swan is one thing; leveraging on it is another. Acknowledging that we don't know what we don't know, it does not make sense to precisely predict Black Swans. Instead we should accept uncertainties and invest in preparedness. Taleb urges us to be aggressive when we can gain exposure to positive Black Swans and very conservative (i.e. prevention over treatment) when we are under threat from a negative Black Swan. Obviously, this holds for all nonlinear events, both predictable and unpredictable.But reader beware! I have mixed feelings with this book. As I similarly experienced with his other books (e.g. Skin in the Game), Taleb's writing style is often dismissive, unstructured, yet entertaining at times. Also, I think you can easily skip or skim through many (repetitive, off-topic, etc.) chapters to still grasp the main ideas.I picked up this book again in quarantine during the COVID-19 lockdown. Importantly however, Taleb called the COVID-19 pandemic a white swan as he deems it wholly predictable and thus can not be used as an excuse for our unpreparedness. I think this is especially true concerning the outbreak in Western countries (months after China)."
66,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4749980-jeroen-kraan,1,"Very nearly got to the end of part one, but then it just became too stupid. As others have pointed out, Taleb is an absolutely insufferable author. His arrogance and disrespect for others probably makes him the second least likable writer after Richard Dawkins.But this is not just a matter of personality. While there are some glimmers of insight in this book, they are covered by a thick layer of confused logic. I finally gave up reading the book when Taleb used two fictional characters' answers to a thought experiment to point out that people who think scientifically are less likely to be succesful in life than the good ol' Plumber Joe type who may not have the IQ on paper but has street smarts. ""Have you ever wondered why so many of these straight-A students end up going nowhere in life while someone who lagged behind is now getting the shekels, buying diamonds, and getting his phone calls returned?"", he asks. The assertion is not just incredible and unfounded (when was the last time someone without a traditional education became president?), but the assertion comes directly after a screed blasting people for giving in to confirmation bias, seeing a narrative where there is none and generally making assumptions without using the proper data.On top of all that, the editing is sloppier than what you might find in most self-published erotic fiction. Seriously, enough with the supposedly witty asides already. Someone with a really good pair of scissors could have turned this 400-page book into a really clever 10-page New Yorker essay."

""The first step to wisdom is knowing what we don't know"" may sound like a line from the 1970s TV show ""Kung Fu,"" but it is an important theme in NNT's book. It's hard for me (being a product of an MBA program where we learned to look at everything as a bell curve) to fully embrace his ideas, but I feel a better man for knowing his views. Uncertainty is a big part of my job as a financial advisor (fee only, no commissions) and NNT's perspectives are useful in my work. Taken to the extreme, one may feel that all life is in vain; I don't think he'd agree with that, but he does say very clearly that our lives are not the linear, well-planned stories that our personal histories might suggest. There is something about the human mind that craves the simple, logical narrative, whether it be about the history of nations or of a person. NNT accepts this craving, but then explains really what happens in life - we are more a product of the rare and unexpected events (cancer, early death of parent, etc.) in our lives than the planned ones. This book is likely to generate lots of discussion among friends who like to debate or some deeper introspection about your own life's trajectory. Highly recommended!!"

As an undergraduate mathematics student, I was fascinated by the power of statistics and higher level mathematics to model and predict. Unfortunately, I never was introduced into its limitations ---- I don't remember them even being discussed.Taleb shows these limitations, and the way in which --- especially in the soft sciences of economics, finance, and psychology --- misuse of statistics or failure to understand the limitations of statistical methods can result in catastrophic results ---- namely via rare events with huge impacts arising well outside the possibilities predicted. In ""The Black Swan"", Taleb comes down especially hard upon economists, bankers, politicians, and journalists --- all of whom become enamored of methods they don't fully understand or short term thinking enabled by overreliance upon mathematical models unsuited for the dangerously random environment in which they work.This book should be required reading by every student of mathematics, economics, finance, or psychology in my opinion."
69,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237995-loyd,4,"No, it has nothing to do with the Natalie Portman movie. Researcher Nassim Nicholas Taleb's The Black Swan is a study of how unexpected, often tragic or shocking circumstances are the catalyst for positive change in the world. Here's the premise: an unexpected occurrence (like the discovery of an actual black swan in nature when none were thought to exist) jogs our thought processes, thus opening our eyes to a different future, for better or worse. I'm not sure every example in the book accurately supports the idea, but there is abundant proof that we constantly ""close the barn doors after the horse has escaped"" when it comes to national security, health scares, natural disasters, etc.In my mind The Black Swan ties to G.B. Shaw's quote: ""The reasonable man adapts himself to the conditions that surround him... The unreasonable man adapts surrounding conditions to himself... All progress depends on the unreasonable man.""We would like to think we don't have to be unreasonable—or victims of catastrophe—in order to progress. But the evidence might be against us."

The Black Swan is definitely a perspective changing book introducing a lot of fresh, powerful ideas and discusses the nature of uncertainty and the limits of knowledge i.e the unknown unknowns. It explains why predicting the future is a fundamentally hard problem and why projects with long timelines have to grapple with the unknown unknowns.

I already was of the same opinion as Talib – that people who make predictions in economics and social sciences, or believe in social engineering and shaping the history, are full of hot air. I’ve been through mathematically rigorous training on the theory of random processes myself, and I know how largely irrelevant it is even in engineering. Forget about finance and economics. And I always laugh at the commentators who act like they’re explaining the instantaneous movement of the stock market or oil prices. NASDAQ is down 11 points right now because blah blah blah.

It was just after the 2008 crisis and I had a vague sense that every authority figure I’d ever listened to was completely full of shit.The Black Swan convinced that was basically the case and I would have to build my own models and understanding of how things actually worked. The Black Swan itself contributed a lot to that new model and is still a big part of how I see the world.Re-reading it was well worth it. I picked up a couple of things I didn’t catch the first time around like the distinction between grey swans and black swans and the notion of “Platonicity.”If you haven’t picked up anything by Taleb, I think Fooled by Randomness is the best entry point."

It discusses how rare events have high impacts and that we are controlled by them, calling these events the Black Swans. The way we consider historic data to make decisions and forecasts is highly vulnerable to both the factors we cannot predict, and the factors we cannot measure. I was heavily involved in forecasting techniques and building basic/advanced mathematical models for forecasting,, and believe me it was hard for me to use these techniques while having the black swan theory ringing all the time in my mind :)"

In my perspective, that is a very exagorated, limited and unnuanced view of academia .

I really enjoyed the discussion about empiricism vs rationalism, and their strengths and limitations. The concepts of extremistan vs mediocristan are very useful. He goes over falsification, the scientific method, the filtering effect on ancient processes, the problem of silent evidence, and a lot more. He discusses really well the phenomenon of why those who find cures are recognised and rewarded far more than those who find preventions, and how we should think about this (the answer is not to throw up our hands and say ""well what else can we do?""). I've always thought about these kinds of things, especially how someone who had implemented a policy of locked airline cabin doors on September 10, 2001 would never have been credited with saving 1000s of lives and preventing a long war, but would have actually prevented that nonetheless. I think we're often confused by the lack of empirical results of preventionism, so we give up. We need best practices, and robustness (aka antifragility), even when we can't show the results. We also can't be fooled by thinking that post-black swan fixes make us safe. Putting locks on cabin doors on September 12 would prevent another September 11 style takeover, but wouldn't prevent the next black swan. Locks are good, but feeling confident that we've fixed the problem is bad.Taleb talks about silent evidence, and naive empiricism, but I thought he should have covered (emphasised) beneficial empiricism, and when an argument from silence is valid, ie, when there's a lack of evidence when there shouldn't be (eg, finding no archaeological remains of a city in a particular place doesn't mean it's theoretically impossible that the place existed but was thoroughly and systematically erased, but its lack of evidence is so unexpected that we'd consider that to be a valid argument from silence that the place most probably didn't ever exist).Taleb's distinction of the 4 quadrants was also helpful, because it clarified when and how black swans are a problem.The other thing I really liked is the discussion about how some of the greatest scientific discoveries were serendipitous discoveries, not ones that the scientist planned to find. The trick is to put yourself in the path of good luck and not be too blinkered by your plan and projected outcomes, but be on the lookout for opportunities. I've found that some of the best opportunities in life and work have come when least expected and in a way that I could never have planned for. The trick isn't to plan to have a specific thing happen, but to put yourself in situations and frames of mind to recognise those opportunities. Sometimes from the outside this can look like wasted time because it's not following a specific plan, but it's very intentional. After a while people may wonder why you're so lucky, and it's hard to explain to them. You're no luckier than the next person, you're just more open to it and putting yourself in situations where more lucky things can find you, due to the laws of large numbers and probabilities.I'm not sure if this is a review anymore or a journal, but Taleb makes me think...."
86,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60222708-nati-s,5,"Philosophers talk about two types of reasoning: deduction and induction. In deductive reasoning the move from premises to conclusions is such that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In inductive reasoning, on the other hand, the conclusion follows from the premises not with necessity but only with probability. In a nutshell, this book is about the consequences confusing inductive reasoning for deductive reasoning and why the confusion occurs in the first place.Taleb states that probability is the mother of all abstractions. This is so because probability is a mode of thought/reasoning that attempts to capture uncertainty. Abstraction is sort of the construction of a mental model that represents reality in a general sense, such act requires a certain “amount”, or rather, “energy”. The mother abstraction, thus, being at the infinite limit, requires infinite cognitive energy. Hence, this particular abstraction is truly incomprehensible. To me this makes better sense when looked at via an example. Autistic individuals are not able to understand other’s emotions because they lack whatever is necessary to do that. This means such understanding is outside their mental scope, it’s something like sympathy-empathy abstraction that represents whatever allows this understanding. It is somewhat self-evident why said abstraction will not be comprehensible to these individuals. Somewhat similarly, all individuals are not able to comprehend uncertainty. There are two things needed in order for one to enjoy this book: curiosity and the ability to put aside, or rather be entertained by, the authors need to bash on academics and people associated with banks. I think it is beautifully written, insightful and humbling."
87,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2899659-guy,5,"I have just begun reading this, after it sat on my shelves for a bunch of years. I see immediately its importance and value both because of the points and quality of the writing — it has an irreverent humour I am enjoying — as well as having several immediate synchronicities with the Jordan B. Peterson lecture, The Maps of Knowledge, that I also just began listening to.Now I have finished it and have begun immediately to re-read it. This book is powerful and important and will likely have been and will continue to be totally ignored. Fascinating. A further review to follow my second read.And the second read was richly rewarding! Learned much more. And was quietly pleased that I made some observations about the nature of economics as does Taleb when I wrote my 'Economics Debunked' course several years ago.Taleb does a great job of comparing the way our officially accepted economic and social risk and growth measures and models are built within something akin to a two dimensional world oblivious to the reality of their existence being in a three or four dimensional one. He is astounded that such an obvious failure is not accepted. This made me smile because of something similar I observed with the great science of mathematics. For almost 2000 years Euclid's theorem about parallel lines was accepted as an ideal truth, despite the inability of mathematicians to prove it. In the end, it was finally accepted as only true in two dimensions. In three dimensions it is basically the foundation of navigational mathematics.Delusion knows no bounds, and is somehow always the other person's problem.I have twenty-plus yellow sticky flags in the book. One of them is a remarkable synchronicity with the psychologist Carl Jung, which occurred, as synchronicities tend to do, with my randomly, and for no obvious 'good' reason, picking up a Jung anthology for a quick glance even with my wanting to get back to Taleb. (Taleb doesn't mention Jung.) The synchronicity involves epistemology and the unpredictable nature of the soul and numbers. For Taleb it was about the unpredictability of history. Taleb wrote:First, when you spend a couple of decades doing mass-scale empirical work with data and taking risks based on such studies, you can easily spot elements in the texture of the world that the Platonified 'thinker' is too brainwashed, or too threatened, to see. Second, it allowed me to become formal and systematic in my thinking instead of wallowing in the anecdotal. Finally, both the philosophy of history and epistemology (the philosophy of knowledge) seemed inseparable from the empirical study of times series data, which is a succession of numbers instead of words. And numbers are easy to process on computers. Studying historical data makes you conscious that history runs forward, not backward, and that it is messier than the narrated accounts. Epistemology, the philosophy of history, and statistics aim at understanding truths, investigating the mechanisms that generate them, and separating regularity from the coincidental in historical matters. They all address the question of what one knows, except that all are to be found in different buildings, so to speak (p20).Jung: ""The moment one forms an idea of a thing and successfully catches one of its aspects, one invariably succumbs to the illusion having caught the whole"" (Jung, cited in DeLaszlo 
Basic Writings of C. G. Jung. Modern Library No. 300
 (p38). The delusion that mathematical modelling can be applied to the complexity of life is simply an extension of this idea. Like it was with the belief in Euclid's theorem against all evidence. Jung elaborates that if the first numbers came from a string of peas laid out, that that was easily grasped as the true meaning of number, but missed out that that simple idea, while true enough, missed the meta truth of the properties of numbers, such as odd and even and irrational and well the entire edifice of mathematics!Jung continues: One never considers that a total apprehension is right out of the question. Not even an idea that is posited as total is total, for it is still an entity on its own with unpredictable qualities. This self-deception certainly promotes peace of mind: the unknown is named, the far has been brought near, so that one can lay one's finger on it. One has taken possession of it, and it has become an inalienable piece of property, like a slain creature of the wild that can no longer run away. It is a magical procedure such as the primitive practices upon objects and the psychologist son the psyche. He is no longer at its mercy, but he never suspects that the very fact of grasping the object conceptually gives it a golden opportunity to display all those qualities which would never have made their appearance had it not been imprisoned in a concept (remember the numbers!) (p38-9).This is a true book: it challenges what you think you know, and asks you to begin to see the world as it is, not as we want it to be. I will read this again, because it has too much knowledge to be fully understood with even two readings."
88,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4643358-dimitris-hall,3,"This was a smart book. The author, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, is one of these guys you come across sometimes who are smartasses and they know it, are in love with that smartass prestige of theirs, and who you can't help but sit and listen to because they're so damn interesting. Sometimes their smartassiness goes a bit overboard, similar to the scratching of an itch that at first is satisfying but can easily hurt if you don't stop at the right moment. However, albeit barely, most of the time they keep it under control.I have to tell the truth. Most of the Black Swan was too technical for me, too difficult. I caught the main idea but at some point I just didn't know what I was reading anymore. I wonder if Taleb would have had a bigger impact with his book (and he did a big impact as far as I can tell) if he had made it easier to read for a broader audience. I have the impression that the more sophisticated an academic or a specialist is, the more resistant to books such as this he or she is, whereasAnyway, Taleb's idea, the whole topic of this book, is rather simple: life is full of Black Swan events, and...Sod it, I'll let Wikipedia do the talking for a sec:The phrase ""black swan"" derives from a Latin expression; its oldest known occurrence is the poet Juvenal's characterization of something being ""rara avis in terris nigroque simillima cygno"" (""a rare bird in the lands and very much like a black swan""; 6.165).[4] When the phrase was coined, the black swan was presumed not to exist.[...]Juvenal's phrase was a common expression in 16th century London as a statement of impossibility. The London expression derives from the Old World presumption that all swans must be white because all historical records of swans reported that they had white feathers.[5] In that context, a black swan was impossible or at least nonexistent. After Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh discovered black swans in Western Australia in 1697,[6] the term metamorphosed to connote that a perceived impossibility might later be disproven. Taleb notes that in the 19th century John Stuart Mill used the black swan logical fallacy as a new term to identify falsification.[7][...]Based on the author's criteria:1. The event is a surprise (to the observer).2. The event has a major effect.3. After the first recorded instance of the event, it is rationalized by hindsight, as if it could have been expected; that is, the relevant data were available but unaccounted for in risk mitigation programs. The same is true for the personal perception by individuals.[...]The theory was developed by Nassim Nicholas Taleb to explain:1. The disproportionate role of high-profile, hard-to-predict, and rare events that are beyond the realm of normal expectations in history, science, finance, and technology.2. The non-computability of the probability of the consequential rare events using scientific methods (owing to the very nature of small probabilities).3. The psychological biases that make people individually and collectively blind to uncertainty and unaware of the massive role of the rare event in historical affairs.Basically, we can't predict things. We think we can, but we can't, and they are the ones we are most vulnerable to. What do we have to do to make ourselves more robust to Black Swans? Be aware of them. And screw banksters and speculators, they're frauds. There, I just summarised the whole book!Don't give Black Swan a read if you're a bankster or speculator and want to preserve your so-called self-respect. Do give it a read if you believe that the world is much more complex than any model we can come up with, but be prepared to skim, skim, skim."
89,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5685608-john-jr,5,"What you don't know can hurt you: that's a truism, which means that, however familiar and easily forgotten it may be, what it says is true. It's not an adequate summary of Nassim Nicholas Taleb's book, but one gets a little closer by saying The Black Swan will tell you why it's true, how it's true, where it's true, and even, in passing, a few places where it's not true. An example from Taleb of where it's not true: If your wife is pregnant, you may not yet know the gender of the child, but there are only two possibilities, and in practice it can be determined (through amniocentesis or ultrasound), and the answer is relatively inconsequential, won't really hurt anyone--except possibly the child, who may be born into one of those cultures in which the killing of infant daughters is surreptitiously practiced. Taleb omits the infanticide note, but adding it is entirely in keeping with the spirit of his book, for he's forever reminding us that life in the modern world is more complex than we're apt to think. Here's an example of an unknown that does matter, which makes one of the fundamental points of Taleb's book: A turkey who has been fed every day for 1,000 days by a kind farmer knows what to expect, and for the turkey life is good--until day number 1,001, when the farmer shows up with an ax. That day is both unexpected and highly consequential--at least for the turkey, though not for the farmer--and it's the kind of thing Taleb calls a Black Swan event.One difference between Taleb's argument and what philosophers have long called the problem of induction (which is basically that 1,000 examples don't tell you for sure what the 1,001st will be) is this: unexpected and highly consequential things can happen (which even the philosophers recognize), but it matters where you stand. The ax-wielding farmer is a Black Swan event only for the turkey. Similarly, the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, were a Black Swan event for almost everybody else, but certainly not for the men who planned them. (In case you wonder about the title and the concept: Taleb explains in his opening paragraph that people in the Old World thought all swans were white until the discovery of Australia revealed to them that some swans are black.) What can we do? Answers permeate the book, but in a sense it boils down to this: be the smart guy, not the sucker (Taleb, an elegant writer who keeps his feet on the ground, isn't afraid to put it like that); when you don't have much choice, look for ways to limit the consequences.The turkey problem is hardly the whole of his book. Another of Taleb's points is that we construct stories after the fact that provide causes and explanations and allow us to believe after the fact that the unpredictable could've been predicted. (He doesn't waste much time, nor will I, on 9/11; the now-famous Presidential Daily Briefing that warned ""Bin Laden determined to attack in US"" counts for little, because it said nothing about how, when, and where, yet that's the kind of prediction we would've needed.) Taleb calls this retrospective storytelling the narrative fallacy, and if you haven't already noticed that historians, as well as the rest of us, repeatedly come up with differing ""explanations"" after the fact for what happened in the past, which you'd think would cast doubt on many of their explanations, you'll start noticing it. There's more, such as: what casinos have to do with uncertainty, and whether the U.S. military has paid any attention to Donald Rumsfeld's ""unknown unknowns"" (he's not named, but his term is), and what went wrong with the Sydney Opera House, and what the smart answer would've been when Alan Greenspan said the recent financial crisis couldn't have been foreseen because it had never happened before. Here's something to try: estimate the answers, read the book, and see if you were right. Prediction is hard, even about knowable things, and humans, by nature, aren't very good at it.If you want a label, The Black Swan is an extended argument for what Taleb calls skeptical empiricism. It's also maybe the most entertaining and useful erudite book that I've ever read. Umberto Eco's erudite novel Foucault's Pendulum will teach you to be careful with stories you make up; it's vastly entertaining but maybe not that useful (except as a warning about what the crazies might do). Taleb goes farther, warning us repeatedly against the stories (and theories and financial models) that others make up, and giving me, among other things, ideas for reworking my financial plan. And there's nothing wrong with a book that inspires one to read more books. This one has left me wanting to read Montaigne (again), and Seneca, and Karl Popper, and Friedrich Hayek, and Keynes, and Poincaré. In a way, the statue on the campus in Animal House had it right: Knowledge is good, if it helps you be the smart guy."
90,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10931405-ardyn,4,"This book finally spoke to some of the concerns I've had about what I've learned in business school. It is a well written book that presents brilliant ideas. I could have done without the author's snide comments and condescending tone but if you can get past that the content of this book is insightful, well organized, and incredibly captivating. You won't see the world the same way once you're done with this ground breaking book. "
91,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43781060-anthony-degleris,3,"Great ideas throughout this book. Unfortunately the author is a prick, a mediocre philosopher, and a hypocrite throughout his unorganized tirade."
92,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4969387-john,5,"It’s books like this that make me feel justified in giving other very good books a 4 or 4.5 stars. For large sections, this book felt like a 6. I had to read slowly. It took time to process, digest and try to apply all that Taleb had to say. Some sections I spent as much time staring out the window as I did actually reading words on the paper. I limited myself in the number of pages I read in a day in hope that spreading it out would help me process is more.  Chapter 6, The Narrative Fallacy, was mind-blowing. The mind’s desperate hunger for narrative is not a new idea to me. It is one I have read before (The Storytelling Animal by Jonathan Gottschall was a great read on the idea). But Taleb drove it home, and showed how deeply it affects our thinking. A couple of quotes from it:P66 “Our propensity to impose meaning and concepts blocks our awareness of the details making up the concepts.” We no longer see what exists, but see our interpretations. P69 “The same condition that makes us simplify (how we see the world) pushes us to think that the world is less random than it actually is.” To save “space” in our brains, we simplify. That simplification produces profound blindness to uncommon events. It was just in the news today that there were reports of another police shooting in Baltimore, a cold-blooded shooting of someone in the back. Multiple witnesses spoke with conviction that they saw it. But it turns out it never happened. Some noise sounded like a gun (it might have been one), just the perceived victim fell to the ground, all while police were pointing their guns at him. Thus people were convinced they saw a shooting. An extreme case, but a great example of how our brain strains and simplifies what it sees all the time.  The author did not talk about this, but the need for a narrative is why politicians give examples of a specific person to tell a story. Instead of talking about how a new factory in town created 200 new jobs, they will say something like, “Look at Jane Doe, hard-working mother of 2. Thanks to her new job at the factory, she is able to help her oldest daughter become the first family member to attend law school.” The narrative brings is home. Another politically related take away for me was how America is stuck with a two party political system. Taleb talks about how a winner-takes-all competition leads to larger inequalities. No other parties can gain a foothold in the country because of the current winner-take-all format. If a party gaining 10% of the vote was given 10% representation, Democrats and Republicans would quickly change (adapt) or become dinosaurs. Another deeply enlightening concept was the information about how poorly humans estimate odds. The studies about how estimating odds changes when you are given a cause for what you are supposed to predict, was particularly insightful. Our ability to predict what will happen is the cornerstone of our species. But also it’s our Achilles heel. We blind ourselves by not seeing all that could happen. Another great quote: “We have a natural tendency to listen to the expert, even in fields where there may be no experts.” P189. People who know the most are not always “experts!” Art, music, and pop culture are all fields this applies to. And perhaps weather forecasting. I felt challenged to think about what I accept as the narrative of History as it was taught to me. Reconstructing the past is much, much, much harder than we think it is. Again, the narrative idea works against us. It’s easy to simplify, but dangerous. It leaves a lot out, and gives a false impression that since the past narrative is obvious, the present and future should be too.  I can’t say enough good things about this book. Read it! "
93,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15639925-t-nu-vahtra,4,"""Science is about how not to be a sucker."" “Prediction, not narration, is the real test of our understanding of the world.”I was not too much impressed by ""Antifragile"" and I liked ""Skin in the game"" even less, but this book is among the earlier of Taleb's books while he was still ""less angry"" and the style of the writing did not spoil the message (the style was still quite arrogant to say the least). Mainly the book provokes you towards more critical thinking, the enemy number one in this one is the Gaussian distribution (which is not relevant for black swan events) and anyone claiming that they have the theories and knowledge to ""handle"" black swan events VS just trying to acknowledge them and limit the maximum negative exposure. There is also quite a lot of praise for Kahneman here while I know thought leaders who disagree with both Taleb and Kahneman in most things. At times it felt that the same message could have been conveyed with less words and repetition from different angles but maybe such approach is inevitable for ""influencers"". “Missing a train is only painful if you run after it! Likewise, not matching the idea of success others expect from you is only painful if that’s what you are seeking.”“When you develop your opinions on the basis of weak evidence, you will have difficulty interpreting subsequent information that contradicts these opinions, even if this new information is obviously more accurate.”“The problem with experts is that they do not know what they do not know”“I propose that if you want a simple step to a higher form of life, as distant from the animal as you can get, then you may have to denarrate, that is, shut down the television set, minimize time spent reading newspapers, ignore the blogs. Train your reasoning abilities to control your decisions; nudge System 1 (the heuristic or experiential system) out of the important ones. Train yourself to spot the difference between the sensational and the empirical. This insulation from the toxicity of the world will have an additional benefit: it will improve your well-being.”“The strategy for the discoverers and entrepreneurs is to rely less on top-down planning and focus on maximum tinkering and recognizing opportunities when they present themselves. So I disagree with the followers of Marx and those of Adam Smith: the reason free markets work is because they allow people to be lucky, thanks to aggressive trial and error, not by giving rewards or “incentives” for skill. The strategy is, then, to tinker as much as possible and try to collect as many Black Swan opportunities as you can.”“Consider a turkey that is fed every day. Every single feeding will firm up the bird’s belief that it is the general rule of life to be fed every day by friendly members of the human race “looking out for its best interests,” as a politician would say. On the afternoon of the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, something unexpected will happen to the turkey. It will incur a revision of belief.”“Read books are far less valuable than unread ones. The library should contain as much of what you do not know as your financial means, mortgage rates, and the currently tight real-estate market allow you to put there.”"
94,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82093-todd,4,"The Black SwanThis is one of those “must read” books that many more people will claim to have read than will actually slog through. Like with Fooled by Randomness, Taleb takes many more pages than necessary to get his important points across. Those points are that we have incredibly poor skills at estimating extreme events, we regularly abuse historical statistics in ways that set us up to fail miserably, and we should have a great distrust of most planning processes. The ultimate message is positive, however, since there are general guidelines on how we can do better (set yourself up for good extreme events while protecting the downside). The style will either excite or turn off the reader. 90% of the parenthetical phrases and footnotes add little except Taleb’s (often snarky) editorials. Traders are sometimes described as people for whom the only thing worse than losing money themselves, is watching others make money. Taleb writes as if the only thing worse than him not getting adequate attention for his ideas is watching others get lauded. He clearly wants this book to be considered scholarly as he has 19 pages of notes and a 28 page bibliography designed to demonstrate the depth of his own reading. Segmenting the personal prose from its academic foundation may have the effect of improving the accessibility to the ideas within, but the reader should be cautioned. Any author who, in the acknowledgements, states “…[the book] just wrote itself,” and then thanks his editor for protecting him from “the intrusions of the standardizing editors,” has probably produced a verbose, tangent driven effort rather than the perfect prose he imagines.If the style excites you, great. If it turns you off, try to work through it. The world is full of decision makers who rely on experts, statistics and intricate models that are built on soft sand. The risks they take affect all of us, and while this behavior will probably never stop, we can take steps to minimize the impact of their folly. Anyone who has been visited by a negative Black Swan will understand this implicitly. For the rest of us, the cost of this book will be a much lower tuition than we might have to pay learning the lessons first hand."
95,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30590986-laurent-michiels,4,"Idea 5 stars, style 2 stars.I am following Taleb for c. 5 years now, and his ideas, including the Black Swan-concept, have contributed significantly to how I view the world.A Black Swan is an event which is rare, has an extreme impact and is predictable in retrospect. Our problem is that we tend to be blind with respect to incomplete information and the unknown, and particularly to the large deviations. Yet, knowing the concept of Black Swan is one thing; leveraging on it is another. Acknowledging that we don't know what we don't know, it does not make sense to precisely predict Black Swans. Instead we should accept uncertainties and invest in preparedness. Taleb urges us to be aggressive when we can gain exposure to positive Black Swans and very conservative (i.e. prevention over treatment) when we are under threat from a negative Black Swan. Obviously, this holds for all nonlinear events, both predictable and unpredictable.But reader beware! I have mixed feelings with this book. As I similarly experienced with his other books (e.g. Skin in the Game), Taleb's writing style is often dismissive, unstructured, yet entertaining at times. Also, I think you can easily skip or skim through many (repetitive, off-topic, etc.) chapters to still grasp the main ideas.I picked up this book again in quarantine during the COVID-19 lockdown. Importantly however, Taleb called the COVID-19 pandemic a white swan as he deems it wholly predictable and thus can not be used as an excuse for our unpreparedness. I think this is especially true concerning the outbreak in Western countries (months after China)."
96,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4749980-jeroen-kraan,1,"Very nearly got to the end of part one, but then it just became too stupid. As others have pointed out, Taleb is an absolutely insufferable author. His arrogance and disrespect for others probably makes him the second least likable writer after Richard Dawkins.But this is not just a matter of personality. While there are some glimmers of insight in this book, they are covered by a thick layer of confused logic. I finally gave up reading the book when Taleb used two fictional characters' answers to a thought experiment to point out that people who think scientifically are less likely to be succesful in life than the good ol' Plumber Joe type who may not have the IQ on paper but has street smarts. ""Have you ever wondered why so many of these straight-A students end up going nowhere in life while someone who lagged behind is now getting the shekels, buying diamonds, and getting his phone calls returned?"", he asks. The assertion is not just incredible and unfounded (when was the last time someone without a traditional education became president?), but the assertion comes directly after a screed blasting people for giving in to confirmation bias, seeing a narrative where there is none and generally making assumptions without using the proper data.On top of all that, the editing is sloppier than what you might find in most self-published erotic fiction. Seriously, enough with the supposedly witty asides already. Someone with a really good pair of scissors could have turned this 400-page book into a really clever 10-page New Yorker essay."

""The first step to wisdom is knowing what we don't know"" may sound like a line from the 1970s TV show ""Kung Fu,"" but it is an important theme in NNT's book. It's hard for me (being a product of an MBA program where we learned to look at everything as a bell curve) to fully embrace his ideas, but I feel a better man for knowing his views. Uncertainty is a big part of my job as a financial advisor (fee only, no commissions) and NNT's perspectives are useful in my work. Taken to the extreme, one may feel that all life is in vain; I don't think he'd agree with that, but he does say very clearly that our lives are not the linear, well-planned stories that our personal histories might suggest. There is something about the human mind that craves the simple, logical narrative, whether it be about the history of nations or of a person. NNT accepts this craving, but then explains really what happens in life - we are more a product of the rare and unexpected events (cancer, early death of parent, etc.) in our lives than the planned ones. This book is likely to generate lots of discussion among friends who like to debate or some deeper introspection about your own life's trajectory. Highly recommended!!"
98,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9496879-michael-o-brien,5,"This is one of the most outstanding books I've read in a long time. As an undergraduate mathematics student, I was fascinated by the power of statistics and higher level mathematics to model and predict. Unfortunately, I never was introduced into its limitations ---- I don't remember them even being discussed.Taleb shows these limitations, and the way in which --- especially in the soft sciences of economics, finance, and psychology --- misuse of statistics or failure to understand the limitations of statistical methods can result in catastrophic results ---- namely via rare events with huge impacts arising well outside the possibilities predicted. In ""The Black Swan"", Taleb comes down especially hard upon economists, bankers, politicians, and journalists --- all of whom become enamored of methods they don't fully understand or short term thinking enabled by overreliance upon mathematical models unsuited for the dangerously random environment in which they work.This book should be required reading by every student of mathematics, economics, finance, or psychology in my opinion."
99,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237995-loyd,4,"No, it has nothing to do with the Natalie Portman movie. Researcher Nassim Nicholas Taleb's The Black Swan is a study of how unexpected, often tragic or shocking circumstances are the catalyst for positive change in the world. Here's the premise: an unexpected occurrence (like the discovery of an actual black swan in nature when none were thought to exist) jogs our thought processes, thus opening our eyes to a different future, for better or worse. I'm not sure every example in the book accurately supports the idea, but there is abundant proof that we constantly ""close the barn doors after the horse has escaped"" when it comes to national security, health scares, natural disasters, etc.In my mind The Black Swan ties to G.B. Shaw's quote: ""The reasonable man adapts himself to the conditions that surround him... The unreasonable man adapts surrounding conditions to himself... All progress depends on the unreasonable man.""We would like to think we don't have to be unreasonable—or victims of catastrophe—in order to progress. But the evidence might be against us."

Especially working at GoJek where a lot of people use vocabulary from this book. I'm a bit rebellious that way. About a week ago, I finally got to reading this. The Black Swan is definitely a perspective changing book introducing a lot of fresh, powerful ideas and discusses the nature of uncertainty and the limits of knowledge i.e the unknown unknowns. It explains why predicting the future is a fundamentally hard problem and why projects with long timelines have to grapple with the unknown unknowns. Especially when living in a world containing millions of independent-decision making actors. Two actionable strategies which I've found interesting from this book include keeping shorter timelines and the barbell investment strategy."
101,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"A lot of interesting tidbits, but I thought the book was on an overkill. Or maybe it was overkill to me. I already was of the same opinion as Talib – that people who make predictions in economics and social sciences, or believe in social engineering and shaping the history, are full of hot air. I’ve been through mathematically rigorous training on the theory of random processes myself, and I know how largely irrelevant it is even in engineering. Forget about finance and economics. And I always laugh at the commentators who act like they’re explaining the instantaneous movement of the stock market or oil prices. NASDAQ is down 11 points right now because blah blah blah. They know that they’re bullshitting, but they still keep on bullshitting. "

It was just after the 2008 crisis and I had a vague sense that every authority figure I’d ever listened to was completely full of shit.The Black Swan convinced that was basically the case and I would have to build my own models and understanding of how things actually worked. The Black Swan itself contributed a lot to that new model and is still a big part of how I see the world.Re-reading it was well worth it. I picked up a couple of things I didn’t catch the first time around like the distinction between grey swans and black swans and the notion of “Platonicity.”If you haven’t picked up anything by Taleb, I think Fooled by Randomness is the best entry point."

It discusses how rare events have high impacts and that we are controlled by them, calling these events the Black Swans. The way we consider historic data to make decisions and forecasts is highly vulnerable to both the factors we cannot predict, and the factors we cannot measure. I was heavily involved in forecasting techniques and building basic/advanced mathematical models for forecasting,, and believe me it was hard for me to use these techniques while having the black swan theory ringing all the time in my mind :)"

This author puts off the latter. His writing is self-indulgent, and he spends so much effort flaunting his intellect and condescending to practically everyone else living and dead who has thought about the subject that I hardly cared to finish reading. The style itself is sub-par as well, frenetic and redundant. Having said all that, his point is correct and very important--but reading his entire book to get it probably isn't necessary."

However, to me the book felt as an accusation of scientist/academics, who allegedly think too highly of themselves, ignore common sense and do research that is not useful in practice. In my perspective, that is a very exagorated, limited and unnuanced view of academia . Taleb might want to update as well, e.g. He might want to discuss evolutionary economics, which solves a lot of his critique on neoclassical economics."

Please treat his books as a series of philisophical treatise, not, god-forbid, business books. We humans are excellent in explaining past events, but always tend to be surprised when highly improbable events impact us hugely. Then we go back to explaining how we saw this coming all along. Do not belive forecasts, do not believe in very precise mathematical models which promise to predict the future, and do not take risks which can make you go bust. Do not be a sucker."

The proximity of the 2 men is large. It is a little a popularizing work but this is not pejorative.

115,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7918888-michael,5,"Despite a few flaws and Taleb's characteristic and unapologetic meandering style, this was really good. All his books should be required reading for anyone in business, policy making, decision making, or breathing. I really enjoyed the discussion about empiricism vs rationalism, and their strengths and limitations. The concepts of extremistan vs mediocristan are very useful. He goes over falsification, the scientific method, the filtering effect on ancient processes, the problem of silent evidence, and a lot more. He discusses really well the phenomenon of why those who find cures are recognised and rewarded far more than those who find preventions, and how we should think about this (the answer is not to throw up our hands and say ""well what else can we do?""). I've always thought about these kinds of things, especially how someone who had implemented a policy of locked airline cabin doors on September 10, 2001 would never have been credited with saving 1000s of lives and preventing a long war, but would have actually prevented that nonetheless. I think we're often confused by the lack of empirical results of preventionism, so we give up. We need best practices, and robustness (aka antifragility), even when we can't show the results. We also can't be fooled by thinking that post-black swan fixes make us safe. Putting locks on cabin doors on September 12 would prevent another September 11 style takeover, but wouldn't prevent the next black swan. Locks are good, but feeling confident that we've fixed the problem is bad.Taleb talks about silent evidence, and naive empiricism, but I thought he should have covered (emphasised) beneficial empiricism, and when an argument from silence is valid, ie, when there's a lack of evidence when there shouldn't be (eg, finding no archaeological remains of a city in a particular place doesn't mean it's theoretically impossible that the place existed but was thoroughly and systematically erased, but its lack of evidence is so unexpected that we'd consider that to be a valid argument from silence that the place most probably didn't ever exist).Taleb's distinction of the 4 quadrants was also helpful, because it clarified when and how black swans are a problem.The other thing I really liked is the discussion about how some of the greatest scientific discoveries were serendipitous discoveries, not ones that the scientist planned to find. The trick is to put yourself in the path of good luck and not be too blinkered by your plan and projected outcomes, but be on the lookout for opportunities. I've found that some of the best opportunities in life and work have come when least expected and in a way that I could never have planned for. The trick isn't to plan to have a specific thing happen, but to put yourself in situations and frames of mind to recognise those opportunities. Sometimes from the outside this can look like wasted time because it's not following a specific plan, but it's very intentional. After a while people may wonder why you're so lucky, and it's hard to explain to them. You're no luckier than the next person, you're just more open to it and putting yourself in situations where more lucky things can find you, due to the laws of large numbers and probabilities.I'm not sure if this is a review anymore or a journal, but Taleb makes me think...."
116,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60222708-nati-s,5,"Philosophers talk about two types of reasoning: deduction and induction. In deductive reasoning the move from premises to conclusions is such that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In inductive reasoning, on the other hand, the conclusion follows from the premises not with necessity but only with probability. In a nutshell, this book is about the consequences confusing inductive reasoning for deductive reasoning and why the confusion occurs in the first place.Taleb states that probability is the mother of all abstractions. This is so because probability is a mode of thought/reasoning that attempts to capture uncertainty. Abstraction is sort of the construction of a mental model that represents reality in a general sense, such act requires a certain “amount”, or rather, “energy”. The mother abstraction, thus, being at the infinite limit, requires infinite cognitive energy. Hence, this particular abstraction is truly incomprehensible. To me this makes better sense when looked at via an example. Autistic individuals are not able to understand other’s emotions because they lack whatever is necessary to do that. This means such understanding is outside their mental scope, it’s something like sympathy-empathy abstraction that represents whatever allows this understanding. It is somewhat self-evident why said abstraction will not be comprehensible to these individuals. Somewhat similarly, all individuals are not able to comprehend uncertainty. There are two things needed in order for one to enjoy this book: curiosity and the ability to put aside, or rather be entertained by, the authors need to bash on academics and people associated with banks. I think it is beautifully written, insightful and humbling."
117,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2899659-guy,5,"I have just begun reading this, after it sat on my shelves for a bunch of years. I see immediately its importance and value both because of the points and quality of the writing — it has an irreverent humour I am enjoying — as well as having several immediate synchronicities with the Jordan B. Peterson lecture, The Maps of Knowledge, that I also just began listening to.Now I have finished it and have begun immediately to re-read it. This book is powerful and important and will likely have been and will continue to be totally ignored. Fascinating. A further review to follow my second read.And the second read was richly rewarding! Learned much more. And was quietly pleased that I made some observations about the nature of economics as does Taleb when I wrote my 'Economics Debunked' course several years ago.Taleb does a great job of comparing the way our officially accepted economic and social risk and growth measures and models are built within something akin to a two dimensional world oblivious to the reality of their existence being in a three or four dimensional one. He is astounded that such an obvious failure is not accepted. This made me smile because of something similar I observed with the great science of mathematics. For almost 2000 years Euclid's theorem about parallel lines was accepted as an ideal truth, despite the inability of mathematicians to prove it. In the end, it was finally accepted as only true in two dimensions. In three dimensions it is basically the foundation of navigational mathematics.Delusion knows no bounds, and is somehow always the other person's problem.I have twenty-plus yellow sticky flags in the book. One of them is a remarkable synchronicity with the psychologist Carl Jung, which occurred, as synchronicities tend to do, with my randomly, and for no obvious 'good' reason, picking up a Jung anthology for a quick glance even with my wanting to get back to Taleb. (Taleb doesn't mention Jung.) The synchronicity involves epistemology and the unpredictable nature of the soul and numbers. For Taleb it was about the unpredictability of history. Taleb wrote:First, when you spend a couple of decades doing mass-scale empirical work with data and taking risks based on such studies, you can easily spot elements in the texture of the world that the Platonified 'thinker' is too brainwashed, or too threatened, to see. Second, it allowed me to become formal and systematic in my thinking instead of wallowing in the anecdotal. Finally, both the philosophy of history and epistemology (the philosophy of knowledge) seemed inseparable from the empirical study of times series data, which is a succession of numbers instead of words. And numbers are easy to process on computers. Studying historical data makes you conscious that history runs forward, not backward, and that it is messier than the narrated accounts. Epistemology, the philosophy of history, and statistics aim at understanding truths, investigating the mechanisms that generate them, and separating regularity from the coincidental in historical matters. They all address the question of what one knows, except that all are to be found in different buildings, so to speak (p20).Jung: ""The moment one forms an idea of a thing and successfully catches one of its aspects, one invariably succumbs to the illusion having caught the whole"" (Jung, cited in DeLaszlo 
Basic Writings of C. G. Jung. Modern Library No. 300
 (p38). The delusion that mathematical modelling can be applied to the complexity of life is simply an extension of this idea. Like it was with the belief in Euclid's theorem against all evidence. Jung elaborates that if the first numbers came from a string of peas laid out, that that was easily grasped as the true meaning of number, but missed out that that simple idea, while true enough, missed the meta truth of the properties of numbers, such as odd and even and irrational and well the entire edifice of mathematics!Jung continues: One never considers that a total apprehension is right out of the question. Not even an idea that is posited as total is total, for it is still an entity on its own with unpredictable qualities. This self-deception certainly promotes peace of mind: the unknown is named, the far has been brought near, so that one can lay one's finger on it. One has taken possession of it, and it has become an inalienable piece of property, like a slain creature of the wild that can no longer run away. It is a magical procedure such as the primitive practices upon objects and the psychologist son the psyche. He is no longer at its mercy, but he never suspects that the very fact of grasping the object conceptually gives it a golden opportunity to display all those qualities which would never have made their appearance had it not been imprisoned in a concept (remember the numbers!) (p38-9).This is a true book: it challenges what you think you know, and asks you to begin to see the world as it is, not as we want it to be. I will read this again, because it has too much knowledge to be fully understood with even two readings."
118,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4643358-dimitris-hall,3,"This was a smart book. The author, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, is one of these guys you come across sometimes who are smartasses and they know it, are in love with that smartass prestige of theirs, and who you can't help but sit and listen to because they're so damn interesting. Sometimes their smartassiness goes a bit overboard, similar to the scratching of an itch that at first is satisfying but can easily hurt if you don't stop at the right moment. However, albeit barely, most of the time they keep it under control.I have to tell the truth. Most of the Black Swan was too technical for me, too difficult. I caught the main idea but at some point I just didn't know what I was reading anymore. I wonder if Taleb would have had a bigger impact with his book (and he did a big impact as far as I can tell) if he had made it easier to read for a broader audience. I have the impression that the more sophisticated an academic or a specialist is, the more resistant to books such as this he or she is, whereasAnyway, Taleb's idea, the whole topic of this book, is rather simple: life is full of Black Swan events, and...Sod it, I'll let Wikipedia do the talking for a sec:The phrase ""black swan"" derives from a Latin expression; its oldest known occurrence is the poet Juvenal's characterization of something being ""rara avis in terris nigroque simillima cygno"" (""a rare bird in the lands and very much like a black swan""; 6.165).[4] When the phrase was coined, the black swan was presumed not to exist.[...]Juvenal's phrase was a common expression in 16th century London as a statement of impossibility. The London expression derives from the Old World presumption that all swans must be white because all historical records of swans reported that they had white feathers.[5] In that context, a black swan was impossible or at least nonexistent. After Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh discovered black swans in Western Australia in 1697,[6] the term metamorphosed to connote that a perceived impossibility might later be disproven. Taleb notes that in the 19th century John Stuart Mill used the black swan logical fallacy as a new term to identify falsification.[7][...]Based on the author's criteria:1. The event is a surprise (to the observer).2. The event has a major effect.3. After the first recorded instance of the event, it is rationalized by hindsight, as if it could have been expected; that is, the relevant data were available but unaccounted for in risk mitigation programs. The same is true for the personal perception by individuals.[...]The theory was developed by Nassim Nicholas Taleb to explain:1. The disproportionate role of high-profile, hard-to-predict, and rare events that are beyond the realm of normal expectations in history, science, finance, and technology.2. The non-computability of the probability of the consequential rare events using scientific methods (owing to the very nature of small probabilities).3. The psychological biases that make people individually and collectively blind to uncertainty and unaware of the massive role of the rare event in historical affairs.Basically, we can't predict things. We think we can, but we can't, and they are the ones we are most vulnerable to. What do we have to do to make ourselves more robust to Black Swans? Be aware of them. And screw banksters and speculators, they're frauds. There, I just summarised the whole book!Don't give Black Swan a read if you're a bankster or speculator and want to preserve your so-called self-respect. Do give it a read if you believe that the world is much more complex than any model we can come up with, but be prepared to skim, skim, skim."
119,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5685608-john-jr,5,"What you don't know can hurt you: that's a truism, which means that, however familiar and easily forgotten it may be, what it says is true. It's not an adequate summary of Nassim Nicholas Taleb's book, but one gets a little closer by saying The Black Swan will tell you why it's true, how it's true, where it's true, and even, in passing, a few places where it's not true. An example from Taleb of where it's not true: If your wife is pregnant, you may not yet know the gender of the child, but there are only two possibilities, and in practice it can be determined (through amniocentesis or ultrasound), and the answer is relatively inconsequential, won't really hurt anyone--except possibly the child, who may be born into one of those cultures in which the killing of infant daughters is surreptitiously practiced. Taleb omits the infanticide note, but adding it is entirely in keeping with the spirit of his book, for he's forever reminding us that life in the modern world is more complex than we're apt to think. Here's an example of an unknown that does matter, which makes one of the fundamental points of Taleb's book: A turkey who has been fed every day for 1,000 days by a kind farmer knows what to expect, and for the turkey life is good--until day number 1,001, when the farmer shows up with an ax. That day is both unexpected and highly consequential--at least for the turkey, though not for the farmer--and it's the kind of thing Taleb calls a Black Swan event.One difference between Taleb's argument and what philosophers have long called the problem of induction (which is basically that 1,000 examples don't tell you for sure what the 1,001st will be) is this: unexpected and highly consequential things can happen (which even the philosophers recognize), but it matters where you stand. The ax-wielding farmer is a Black Swan event only for the turkey. Similarly, the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, were a Black Swan event for almost everybody else, but certainly not for the men who planned them. (In case you wonder about the title and the concept: Taleb explains in his opening paragraph that people in the Old World thought all swans were white until the discovery of Australia revealed to them that some swans are black.) What can we do? Answers permeate the book, but in a sense it boils down to this: be the smart guy, not the sucker (Taleb, an elegant writer who keeps his feet on the ground, isn't afraid to put it like that); when you don't have much choice, look for ways to limit the consequences.The turkey problem is hardly the whole of his book. Another of Taleb's points is that we construct stories after the fact that provide causes and explanations and allow us to believe after the fact that the unpredictable could've been predicted. (He doesn't waste much time, nor will I, on 9/11; the now-famous Presidential Daily Briefing that warned ""Bin Laden determined to attack in US"" counts for little, because it said nothing about how, when, and where, yet that's the kind of prediction we would've needed.) Taleb calls this retrospective storytelling the narrative fallacy, and if you haven't already noticed that historians, as well as the rest of us, repeatedly come up with differing ""explanations"" after the fact for what happened in the past, which you'd think would cast doubt on many of their explanations, you'll start noticing it. There's more, such as: what casinos have to do with uncertainty, and whether the U.S. military has paid any attention to Donald Rumsfeld's ""unknown unknowns"" (he's not named, but his term is), and what went wrong with the Sydney Opera House, and what the smart answer would've been when Alan Greenspan said the recent financial crisis couldn't have been foreseen because it had never happened before. Here's something to try: estimate the answers, read the book, and see if you were right. Prediction is hard, even about knowable things, and humans, by nature, aren't very good at it.If you want a label, The Black Swan is an extended argument for what Taleb calls skeptical empiricism. It's also maybe the most entertaining and useful erudite book that I've ever read. Umberto Eco's erudite novel Foucault's Pendulum will teach you to be careful with stories you make up; it's vastly entertaining but maybe not that useful (except as a warning about what the crazies might do). Taleb goes farther, warning us repeatedly against the stories (and theories and financial models) that others make up, and giving me, among other things, ideas for reworking my financial plan. And there's nothing wrong with a book that inspires one to read more books. This one has left me wanting to read Montaigne (again), and Seneca, and Karl Popper, and Friedrich Hayek, and Keynes, and Poincaré. In a way, the statue on the campus in Animal House had it right: Knowledge is good, if it helps you be the smart guy."
120,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10931405-ardyn,4,"This book finally spoke to some of the concerns I've had about what I've learned in business school. It is a well written book that presents brilliant ideas.

121,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43781060-anthony-degleris,3,"Great ideas throughout this book. Unfortunately the author is a prick, a mediocre philosopher, and a hypocrite throughout his unorganized tirade."
122,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4969387-john,5,"It’s books like this that make me feel justified in giving other very good books a 4 or 4.5 stars. For large sections, this book felt like a 6. I had to read slowly. It took time to process, digest and try to apply all that Taleb had to say. Some sections I spent as much time staring out the window as I did actually reading words on the paper. I limited myself in the number of pages I read in a day in hope that spreading it out would help me process is more.  Chapter 6, The Narrative Fallacy, was mind-blowing. The mind’s desperate hunger for narrative is not a new idea to me. It is one I have read before (The Storytelling Animal by Jonathan Gottschall was a great read on the idea). But Taleb drove it home, and showed how deeply it affects our thinking. A couple of quotes from it:P66 “Our propensity to impose meaning and concepts blocks our awareness of the details making up the concepts.” We no longer see what exists, but see our interpretations. P69 “The same condition that makes us simplify (how we see the world) pushes us to think that the world is less random than it actually is.” To save “space” in our brains, we simplify. That simplification produces profound blindness to uncommon events. It was just in the news today that there were reports of another police shooting in Baltimore, a cold-blooded shooting of someone in the back. Multiple witnesses spoke with conviction that they saw it. But it turns out it never happened. Some noise sounded like a gun (it might have been one), just the perceived victim fell to the ground, all while police were pointing their guns at him. Thus people were convinced they saw a shooting. An extreme case, but a great example of how our brain strains and simplifies what it sees all the time.  The author did not talk about this, but the need for a narrative is why politicians give examples of a specific person to tell a story. Instead of talking about how a new factory in town created 200 new jobs, they will say something like, “Look at Jane Doe, hard-working mother of 2. Thanks to her new job at the factory, she is able to help her oldest daughter become the first family member to attend law school.” The narrative brings is home. Another politically related take away for me was how America is stuck with a two party political system. Taleb talks about how a winner-takes-all competition leads to larger inequalities. No other parties can gain a foothold in the country because of the current winner-take-all format. If a party gaining 10% of the vote was given 10% representation, Democrats and Republicans would quickly change (adapt) or become dinosaurs. Another deeply enlightening concept was the information about how poorly humans estimate odds. The studies about how estimating odds changes when you are given a cause for what you are supposed to predict, was particularly insightful. Our ability to predict what will happen is the cornerstone of our species. But also it’s our Achilles heel. We blind ourselves by not seeing all that could happen. Another great quote: “We have a natural tendency to listen to the expert, even in fields where there may be no experts.” P189. People who know the most are not always “experts!” Art, music, and pop culture are all fields this applies to. And perhaps weather forecasting. I felt challenged to think about what I accept as the narrative of History as it was taught to me. Reconstructing the past is much, much, much harder than we think it is. Again, the narrative idea works against us. It’s easy to simplify, but dangerous. It leaves a lot out, and gives a false impression that since the past narrative is obvious, the present and future should be too.  I can’t say enough good things about this book. Read it! "

Mainly the book provokes you towards more critical thinking, the enemy number one in this one is the Gaussian distribution (which is not relevant for black swan events) and anyone claiming that they have the theories and knowledge to ""handle"" black swan events VS just trying to acknowledge them and limit the maximum negative exposure. There is also quite a lot of praise for Kahneman here while I know thought leaders who disagree with both Taleb and Kahneman in most things. At times it felt that the same message could have been conveyed with less words and repetition from different angles but maybe such approach is inevitable for ""influencers"". “Missing a train is only painful if you run after it! Likewise, not matching the idea of success others expect from you is only painful if that’s what you are seeking.”“When you develop your opinions on the basis of weak evidence, you will have difficulty interpreting subsequent information that contradicts these opinions, even if this new information is obviously more accurate.”“The problem with experts is that they do not know what they do not know”“I propose that if you want a simple step to a higher form of life, as distant from the animal as you can get, then you may have to denarrate, that is, shut down the television set, minimize time spent reading newspapers, ignore the blogs. Train your reasoning abilities to control your decisions; nudge System 1 (the heuristic or experiential system) out of the important ones. Train yourself to spot the difference between the sensational and the empirical. This insulation from the toxicity of the world will have an additional benefit: it will improve your well-being.”“The strategy for the discoverers and entrepreneurs is to rely less on top-down planning and focus on maximum tinkering and recognizing opportunities when they present themselves. So I disagree with the followers of Marx and those of Adam Smith: the reason free markets work is because they allow people to be lucky, thanks to aggressive trial and error, not by giving rewards or “incentives” for skill. The strategy is, then, to tinker as much as possible and try to collect as many Black Swan opportunities as you can.”“Consider a turkey that is fed every day. Every single feeding will firm up the bird’s belief that it is the general rule of life to be fed every day by friendly members of the human race “looking out for its best interests,” as a politician would say. On the afternoon of the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, something unexpected will happen to the turkey. It will incur a revision of belief.”“Read books are far less valuable than unread ones. The library should contain as much of what you do not know as your financial means, mortgage rates, and the currently tight real-estate market allow you to put there.”"
124,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82093-todd,4,"The Black SwanThis is one of those “must read” books that many more people will claim to have read than will actually slog through. Like with Fooled by Randomness, Taleb takes many more pages than necessary to get his important points across. Those points are that we have incredibly poor skills at estimating extreme events, we regularly abuse historical statistics in ways that set us up to fail miserably, and we should have a great distrust of most planning processes. The ultimate message is positive, however, since there are general guidelines on how we can do better (set yourself up for good extreme events while protecting the downside). The style will either excite or turn off the reader. 90% of the parenthetical phrases and footnotes add little except Taleb’s (often snarky) editorials. Traders are sometimes described as people for whom the only thing worse than losing money themselves, is watching others make money. Taleb writes as if the only thing worse than him not getting adequate attention for his ideas is watching others get lauded. He clearly wants this book to be considered scholarly as he has 19 pages of notes and a 28 page bibliography designed to demonstrate the depth of his own reading. Segmenting the personal prose from its academic foundation may have the effect of improving the accessibility to the ideas within, but the reader should be cautioned. Any author who, in the acknowledgements, states “…[the book] just wrote itself,” and then thanks his editor for protecting him from “the intrusions of the standardizing editors,” has probably produced a verbose, tangent driven effort rather than the perfect prose he imagines.If the style excites you, great. If it turns you off, try to work through it. The world is full of decision makers who rely on experts, statistics and intricate models that are built on soft sand. The risks they take affect all of us, and while this behavior will probably never stop, we can take steps to minimize the impact of their folly. Anyone who has been visited by a negative Black Swan will understand this implicitly. For the rest of us, the cost of this book will be a much lower tuition than we might have to pay learning the lessons first hand."
125,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30590986-laurent-michiels,4,"Idea 5 stars, style 2 stars.I am following Taleb for c. 5 years now, and his ideas, including the Black Swan-concept, have contributed significantly to how I view the world.A Black Swan is an event which is rare, has an extreme impact and is predictable in retrospect. Our problem is that we tend to be blind with respect to incomplete information and the unknown, and particularly to the large deviations. Yet, knowing the concept of Black Swan is one thing; leveraging on it is another. Acknowledging that we don't know what we don't know, it does not make sense to precisely predict Black Swans. Instead we should accept uncertainties and invest in preparedness. Taleb urges us to be aggressive when we can gain exposure to positive Black Swans and very conservative (i.e. prevention over treatment) when we are under threat from a negative Black Swan. Obviously, this holds for all nonlinear events, both predictable and unpredictable.But reader beware! I have mixed feelings with this book. As I similarly experienced with his other books (e.g. Skin in the Game), Taleb's writing style is often dismissive, unstructured, yet entertaining at times. Also, I think you can easily skip or skim through many (repetitive, off-topic, etc.) chapters to still grasp the main ideas.I picked up this book again in quarantine during the COVID-19 lockdown. Importantly however, Taleb called the COVID-19 pandemic a white swan as he deems it wholly predictable and thus can not be used as an excuse for our unpreparedness. I think this is especially true concerning the outbreak in Western countries (months after China)."
126,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4749980-jeroen-kraan,1,"Very nearly got to the end of part one, but then it just became too stupid. As others have pointed out, Taleb is an absolutely insufferable author. His arrogance and disrespect for others probably makes him the second least likable writer after Richard Dawkins.But this is not just a matter of personality. While there are some glimmers of insight in this book, they are covered by a thick layer of confused logic. I finally gave up reading the book when Taleb used two fictional characters' answers to a thought experiment to point out that people who think scientifically are less likely to be succesful in life than the good ol' Plumber Joe type who may not have the IQ on paper but has street smarts. ""Have you ever wondered why so many of these straight-A students end up going nowhere in life while someone who lagged behind is now getting the shekels, buying diamonds, and getting his phone calls returned?"", he asks. The assertion is not just incredible and unfounded (when was the last time someone without a traditional education became president?), but the assertion comes directly after a screed blasting people for giving in to confirmation bias, seeing a narrative where there is none and generally making assumptions without using the proper data.On top of all that, the editing is sloppier than what you might find in most self-published erotic fiction. Seriously, enough with the supposedly witty asides already. Someone with a really good pair of scissors could have turned this 400-page book into a really clever 10-page New Yorker essay."

""The first step to wisdom is knowing what we don't know"" may sound like a line from the 1970s TV show ""Kung Fu,"" but it is an important theme in NNT's book. It's hard for me (being a product of an MBA program where we learned to look at everything as a bell curve) to fully embrace his ideas, but I feel a better man for knowing his views. Uncertainty is a big part of my job as a financial advisor (fee only, no commissions) and NNT's perspectives are useful in my work. Taken to the extreme, one may feel that all life is in vain; I don't think he'd agree with that, but he does say very clearly that our lives are not the linear, well-planned stories that our personal histories might suggest. There is something about the human mind that craves the simple, logical narrative, whether it be about the history of nations or of a person. NNT accepts this craving, but then explains really what happens in life - we are more a product of the rare and unexpected events (cancer, early death of parent, etc.) in our lives than the planned ones. This book is likely to generate lots of discussion among friends who like to debate or some deeper introspection about your own life's trajectory. Highly recommended!!"

As an undergraduate mathematics student, I was fascinated by the power of statistics and higher level mathematics to model and predict. Unfortunately, I never was introduced into its limitations ---- I don't remember them even being discussed.Taleb shows these limitations, and the way in which --- especially in the soft sciences of economics, finance, and psychology --- misuse of statistics or failure to understand the limitations of statistical methods can result in catastrophic results ---- namely via rare events with huge impacts arising well outside the possibilities predicted. In ""The Black Swan"", Taleb comes down especially hard upon economists, bankers, politicians, and journalists --- all of whom become enamored of methods they don't fully understand or short term thinking enabled by overreliance upon mathematical models unsuited for the dangerously random environment in which they work.This book should be required reading by every student of mathematics, economics, finance, or psychology in my opinion."
129,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237995-loyd,4,"No, it has nothing to do with the Natalie Portman movie. Researcher Nassim Nicholas Taleb's The Black Swan is a study of how unexpected, often tragic or shocking circumstances are the catalyst for positive change in the world. Here's the premise: an unexpected occurrence (like the discovery of an actual black swan in nature when none were thought to exist) jogs our thought processes, thus opening our eyes to a different future, for better or worse. I'm not sure every example in the book accurately supports the idea, but there is abundant proof that we constantly ""close the barn doors after the horse has escaped"" when it comes to national security, health scares, natural disasters, etc.In my mind The Black Swan ties to G.B. Shaw's quote: ""The reasonable man adapts himself to the conditions that surround him... The unreasonable man adapts surrounding conditions to himself... All progress depends on the unreasonable man.""We would like to think we don't have to be unreasonable—or victims of catastrophe—in order to progress. But the evidence might be against us."

Especially working at GoJek where a lot of people use vocabulary from this book. I'm a bit rebellious that way. About a week ago, I finally got to reading this. The Black Swan is definitely a perspective changing book introducing a lot of fresh, powerful ideas and discusses the nature of uncertainty and the limits of knowledge i.e the unknown unknowns. It explains why predicting the future is a fundamentally hard problem and why projects with long timelines have to grapple with the unknown unknowns. Especially when living in a world containing millions of independent-decision making actors. Two actionable strategies which I've found interesting from this book include keeping shorter timelines and the barbell investment strategy."

I already was of the same opinion as Talib – that people who make predictions in economics and social sciences, or believe in social engineering and shaping the history, are full of hot air. I’ve been through mathematically rigorous training on the theory of random processes myself, and I know how largely irrelevant it is even in engineering. Forget about finance and economics. And I always laugh at the commentators who act like they’re explaining the instantaneous movement of the stock market or oil prices. NASDAQ is down 11 points right now because blah blah blah.

It was just after the 2008 crisis and I had a vague sense that every authority figure I’d ever listened to was completely full of shit.The Black Swan convinced that was basically the case and I would have to build my own models and understanding of how things actually worked. The Black Swan itself contributed a lot to that new model and is still a big part of how I see the world.Re-reading it was well worth it. I picked up a couple of things I didn’t catch the first time around like the distinction between grey swans and black swans and the notion of “Platonicity.”If you haven’t picked up anything by Taleb, I think Fooled by Randomness is the best entry point."

It discusses how rare events have high impacts and that we are controlled by them, calling these events the Black Swans. The way we consider historic data to make decisions and forecasts is highly vulnerable to both the factors we cannot predict, and the factors we cannot measure. I was heavily involved in forecasting techniques and building basic/advanced mathematical models for forecasting,, and believe me it was hard for me to use these techniques while having the black swan theory ringing all the time in my mind :)"

In my perspective, that is a very exagorated, limited and unnuanced view of academia .

145,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7918888-michael,5,"Despite a few flaws and Taleb's characteristic and unapologetic meandering style, this was really good. All his books should be required reading for anyone in business, policy making, decision making, or breathing. I really enjoyed the discussion about empiricism vs rationalism, and their strengths and limitations. The concepts of extremistan vs mediocristan are very useful. He goes over falsification, the scientific method, the filtering effect on ancient processes, the problem of silent evidence, and a lot more. He discusses really well the phenomenon of why those who find cures are recognised and rewarded far more than those who find preventions, and how we should think about this (the answer is not to throw up our hands and say ""well what else can we do?""). I've always thought about these kinds of things, especially how someone who had implemented a policy of locked airline cabin doors on September 10, 2001 would never have been credited with saving 1000s of lives and preventing a long war, but would have actually prevented that nonetheless. I think we're often confused by the lack of empirical results of preventionism, so we give up. We need best practices, and robustness (aka antifragility), even when we can't show the results. We also can't be fooled by thinking that post-black swan fixes make us safe. Putting locks on cabin doors on September 12 would prevent another September 11 style takeover, but wouldn't prevent the next black swan. Locks are good, but feeling confident that we've fixed the problem is bad.Taleb talks about silent evidence, and naive empiricism, but I thought he should have covered (emphasised) beneficial empiricism, and when an argument from silence is valid, ie, when there's a lack of evidence when there shouldn't be (eg, finding no archaeological remains of a city in a particular place doesn't mean it's theoretically impossible that the place existed but was thoroughly and systematically erased, but its lack of evidence is so unexpected that we'd consider that to be a valid argument from silence that the place most probably didn't ever exist).Taleb's distinction of the 4 quadrants was also helpful, because it clarified when and how black swans are a problem.The other thing I really liked is the discussion about how some of the greatest scientific discoveries were serendipitous discoveries, not ones that the scientist planned to find. The trick is to put yourself in the path of good luck and not be too blinkered by your plan and projected outcomes, but be on the lookout for opportunities. I've found that some of the best opportunities in life and work have come when least expected and in a way that I could never have planned for. The trick isn't to plan to have a specific thing happen, but to put yourself in situations and frames of mind to recognise those opportunities. Sometimes from the outside this can look like wasted time because it's not following a specific plan, but it's very intentional. After a while people may wonder why you're so lucky, and it's hard to explain to them. You're no luckier than the next person, you're just more open to it and putting yourself in situations where more lucky things can find you, due to the laws of large numbers and probabilities.I'm not sure if this is a review anymore or a journal, but Taleb makes me think...."
146,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60222708-nati-s,5,"Philosophers talk about two types of reasoning: deduction and induction. In deductive reasoning the move from premises to conclusions is such that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In inductive reasoning, on the other hand, the conclusion follows from the premises not with necessity but only with probability. In a nutshell, this book is about the consequences confusing inductive reasoning for deductive reasoning and why the confusion occurs in the first place.Taleb states that probability is the mother of all abstractions. This is so because probability is a mode of thought/reasoning that attempts to capture uncertainty. Abstraction is sort of the construction of a mental model that represents reality in a general sense, such act requires a certain “amount”, or rather, “energy”. The mother abstraction, thus, being at the infinite limit, requires infinite cognitive energy. Hence, this particular abstraction is truly incomprehensible. To me this makes better sense when looked at via an example. Autistic individuals are not able to understand other’s emotions because they lack whatever is necessary to do that. This means such understanding is outside their mental scope, it’s something like sympathy-empathy abstraction that represents whatever allows this understanding. It is somewhat self-evident why said abstraction will not be comprehensible to these individuals. Somewhat similarly, all individuals are not able to comprehend uncertainty. There are two things needed in order for one to enjoy this book: curiosity and the ability to put aside, or rather be entertained by, the authors need to bash on academics and people associated with banks. I think it is beautifully written, insightful and humbling."
147,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2899659-guy,5,"I have just begun reading this, after it sat on my shelves for a bunch of years. I see immediately its importance and value both because of the points and quality of the writing — it has an irreverent humour I am enjoying — as well as having several immediate synchronicities with the Jordan B. Peterson lecture, The Maps of Knowledge, that I also just began listening to.Now I have finished it and have begun immediately to re-read it. This book is powerful and important and will likely have been and will continue to be totally ignored. Fascinating. A further review to follow my second read.And the second read was richly rewarding! Learned much more. And was quietly pleased that I made some observations about the nature of economics as does Taleb when I wrote my 'Economics Debunked' course several years ago.Taleb does a great job of comparing the way our officially accepted economic and social risk and growth measures and models are built within something akin to a two dimensional world oblivious to the reality of their existence being in a three or four dimensional one. He is astounded that such an obvious failure is not accepted. This made me smile because of something similar I observed with the great science of mathematics. For almost 2000 years Euclid's theorem about parallel lines was accepted as an ideal truth, despite the inability of mathematicians to prove it. In the end, it was finally accepted as only true in two dimensions. In three dimensions it is basically the foundation of navigational mathematics.Delusion knows no bounds, and is somehow always the other person's problem.I have twenty-plus yellow sticky flags in the book. One of them is a remarkable synchronicity with the psychologist Carl Jung, which occurred, as synchronicities tend to do, with my randomly, and for no obvious 'good' reason, picking up a Jung anthology for a quick glance even with my wanting to get back to Taleb. (Taleb doesn't mention Jung.) The synchronicity involves epistemology and the unpredictable nature of the soul and numbers. For Taleb it was about the unpredictability of history. Taleb wrote:First, when you spend a couple of decades doing mass-scale empirical work with data and taking risks based on such studies, you can easily spot elements in the texture of the world that the Platonified 'thinker' is too brainwashed, or too threatened, to see. Second, it allowed me to become formal and systematic in my thinking instead of wallowing in the anecdotal. Finally, both the philosophy of history and epistemology (the philosophy of knowledge) seemed inseparable from the empirical study of times series data, which is a succession of numbers instead of words. And numbers are easy to process on computers. Studying historical data makes you conscious that history runs forward, not backward, and that it is messier than the narrated accounts. Epistemology, the philosophy of history, and statistics aim at understanding truths, investigating the mechanisms that generate them, and separating regularity from the coincidental in historical matters. They all address the question of what one knows, except that all are to be found in different buildings, so to speak (p20).Jung: ""The moment one forms an idea of a thing and successfully catches one of its aspects, one invariably succumbs to the illusion having caught the whole"" (Jung, cited in DeLaszlo 
Basic Writings of C. G. Jung. Modern Library No. 300
 (p38). The delusion that mathematical modelling can be applied to the complexity of life is simply an extension of this idea. Like it was with the belief in Euclid's theorem against all evidence. Jung elaborates that if the first numbers came from a string of peas laid out, that that was easily grasped as the true meaning of number, but missed out that that simple idea, while true enough, missed the meta truth of the properties of numbers, such as odd and even and irrational and well the entire edifice of mathematics!Jung continues: One never considers that a total apprehension is right out of the question. Not even an idea that is posited as total is total, for it is still an entity on its own with unpredictable qualities. This self-deception certainly promotes peace of mind: the unknown is named, the far has been brought near, so that one can lay one's finger on it. One has taken possession of it, and it has become an inalienable piece of property, like a slain creature of the wild that can no longer run away. It is a magical procedure such as the primitive practices upon objects and the psychologist son the psyche. He is no longer at its mercy, but he never suspects that the very fact of grasping the object conceptually gives it a golden opportunity to display all those qualities which would never have made their appearance had it not been imprisoned in a concept (remember the numbers!) (p38-9).This is a true book: it challenges what you think you know, and asks you to begin to see the world as it is, not as we want it to be. I will read this again, because it has too much knowledge to be fully understood with even two readings."
148,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4643358-dimitris-hall,3,"This was a smart book. The author, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, is one of these guys you come across sometimes who are smartasses and they know it, are in love with that smartass prestige of theirs, and who you can't help but sit and listen to because they're so damn interesting. Sometimes their smartassiness goes a bit overboard, similar to the scratching of an itch that at first is satisfying but can easily hurt if you don't stop at the right moment. However, albeit barely, most of the time they keep it under control.I have to tell the truth. Most of the Black Swan was too technical for me, too difficult. I caught the main idea but at some point I just didn't know what I was reading anymore. I wonder if Taleb would have had a bigger impact with his book (and he did a big impact as far as I can tell) if he had made it easier to read for a broader audience. I have the impression that the more sophisticated an academic or a specialist is, the more resistant to books such as this he or she is, whereasAnyway, Taleb's idea, the whole topic of this book, is rather simple: life is full of Black Swan events, and...Sod it, I'll let Wikipedia do the talking for a sec:The phrase ""black swan"" derives from a Latin expression; its oldest known occurrence is the poet Juvenal's characterization of something being ""rara avis in terris nigroque simillima cygno"" (""a rare bird in the lands and very much like a black swan""; 6.165).[4] When the phrase was coined, the black swan was presumed not to exist.[...]Juvenal's phrase was a common expression in 16th century London as a statement of impossibility. The London expression derives from the Old World presumption that all swans must be white because all historical records of swans reported that they had white feathers.[5] In that context, a black swan was impossible or at least nonexistent. After Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh discovered black swans in Western Australia in 1697,[6] the term metamorphosed to connote that a perceived impossibility might later be disproven. Taleb notes that in the 19th century John Stuart Mill used the black swan logical fallacy as a new term to identify falsification.[7][...]Based on the author's criteria:1. The event is a surprise (to the observer).2. The event has a major effect.3. After the first recorded instance of the event, it is rationalized by hindsight, as if it could have been expected; that is, the relevant data were available but unaccounted for in risk mitigation programs. The same is true for the personal perception by individuals.[...]The theory was developed by Nassim Nicholas Taleb to explain:1. The disproportionate role of high-profile, hard-to-predict, and rare events that are beyond the realm of normal expectations in history, science, finance, and technology.2. The non-computability of the probability of the consequential rare events using scientific methods (owing to the very nature of small probabilities).3. The psychological biases that make people individually and collectively blind to uncertainty and unaware of the massive role of the rare event in historical affairs.Basically, we can't predict things. We think we can, but we can't, and they are the ones we are most vulnerable to. What do we have to do to make ourselves more robust to Black Swans? Be aware of them. And screw banksters and speculators, they're frauds. There, I just summarised the whole book!Don't give Black Swan a read if you're a bankster or speculator and want to preserve your so-called self-respect. Do give it a read if you believe that the world is much more complex than any model we can come up with, but be prepared to skim, skim, skim."
149,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5685608-john-jr,5,"What you don't know can hurt you: that's a truism, which means that, however familiar and easily forgotten it may be, what it says is true. It's not an adequate summary of Nassim Nicholas Taleb's book, but one gets a little closer by saying The Black Swan will tell you why it's true, how it's true, where it's true, and even, in passing, a few places where it's not true. An example from Taleb of where it's not true: If your wife is pregnant, you may not yet know the gender of the child, but there are only two possibilities, and in practice it can be determined (through amniocentesis or ultrasound), and the answer is relatively inconsequential, won't really hurt anyone--except possibly the child, who may be born into one of those cultures in which the killing of infant daughters is surreptitiously practiced. Taleb omits the infanticide note, but adding it is entirely in keeping with the spirit of his book, for he's forever reminding us that life in the modern world is more complex than we're apt to think. Here's an example of an unknown that does matter, which makes one of the fundamental points of Taleb's book: A turkey who has been fed every day for 1,000 days by a kind farmer knows what to expect, and for the turkey life is good--until day number 1,001, when the farmer shows up with an ax. That day is both unexpected and highly consequential--at least for the turkey, though not for the farmer--and it's the kind of thing Taleb calls a Black Swan event.One difference between Taleb's argument and what philosophers have long called the problem of induction (which is basically that 1,000 examples don't tell you for sure what the 1,001st will be) is this: unexpected and highly consequential things can happen (which even the philosophers recognize), but it matters where you stand. The ax-wielding farmer is a Black Swan event only for the turkey. Similarly, the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, were a Black Swan event for almost everybody else, but certainly not for the men who planned them. (In case you wonder about the title and the concept: Taleb explains in his opening paragraph that people in the Old World thought all swans were white until the discovery of Australia revealed to them that some swans are black.) What can we do? Answers permeate the book, but in a sense it boils down to this: be the smart guy, not the sucker (Taleb, an elegant writer who keeps his feet on the ground, isn't afraid to put it like that); when you don't have much choice, look for ways to limit the consequences.The turkey problem is hardly the whole of his book. Another of Taleb's points is that we construct stories after the fact that provide causes and explanations and allow us to believe after the fact that the unpredictable could've been predicted. (He doesn't waste much time, nor will I, on 9/11; the now-famous Presidential Daily Briefing that warned ""Bin Laden determined to attack in US"" counts for little, because it said nothing about how, when, and where, yet that's the kind of prediction we would've needed.) Taleb calls this retrospective storytelling the narrative fallacy, and if you haven't already noticed that historians, as well as the rest of us, repeatedly come up with differing ""explanations"" after the fact for what happened in the past, which you'd think would cast doubt on many of their explanations, you'll start noticing it. There's more, such as: what casinos have to do with uncertainty, and whether the U.S. military has paid any attention to Donald Rumsfeld's ""unknown unknowns"" (he's not named, but his term is), and what went wrong with the Sydney Opera House, and what the smart answer would've been when Alan Greenspan said the recent financial crisis couldn't have been foreseen because it had never happened before. Here's something to try: estimate the answers, read the book, and see if you were right. Prediction is hard, even about knowable things, and humans, by nature, aren't very good at it.If you want a label, The Black Swan is an extended argument for what Taleb calls skeptical empiricism. It's also maybe the most entertaining and useful erudite book that I've ever read. Umberto Eco's erudite novel Foucault's Pendulum will teach you to be careful with stories you make up; it's vastly entertaining but maybe not that useful (except as a warning about what the crazies might do). Taleb goes farther, warning us repeatedly against the stories (and theories and financial models) that others make up, and giving me, among other things, ideas for reworking my financial plan. And there's nothing wrong with a book that inspires one to read more books. This one has left me wanting to read Montaigne (again), and Seneca, and Karl Popper, and Friedrich Hayek, and Keynes, and Poincaré. In a way, the statue on the campus in Animal House had it right: Knowledge is good, if it helps you be the smart guy."

It is a well written book that presents brilliant ideas. I could have done without the author's snide comments and condescending tone but if you can get past that the content of this book is insightful, well organized, and incredibly captivating. You won't see the world the same way once you're done with this ground breaking book. "
151,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43781060-anthony-degleris,3,"Great ideas throughout this book. Unfortunately the author is a prick, a mediocre philosopher, and a hypocrite throughout his unorganized tirade."
152,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4969387-john,5,"It’s books like this that make me feel justified in giving other very good books a 4 or 4.5 stars. For large sections, this book felt like a 6. I had to read slowly. It took time to process, digest and try to apply all that Taleb had to say. Some sections I spent as much time staring out the window as I did actually reading words on the paper. I limited myself in the number of pages I read in a day in hope that spreading it out would help me process is more.  Chapter 6, The Narrative Fallacy, was mind-blowing. The mind’s desperate hunger for narrative is not a new idea to me. It is one I have read before (The Storytelling Animal by Jonathan Gottschall was a great read on the idea). But Taleb drove it home, and showed how deeply it affects our thinking. A couple of quotes from it:P66 “Our propensity to impose meaning and concepts blocks our awareness of the details making up the concepts.” We no longer see what exists, but see our interpretations. P69 “The same condition that makes us simplify (how we see the world) pushes us to think that the world is less random than it actually is.” To save “space” in our brains, we simplify. That simplification produces profound blindness to uncommon events. It was just in the news today that there were reports of another police shooting in Baltimore, a cold-blooded shooting of someone in the back. Multiple witnesses spoke with conviction that they saw it. But it turns out it never happened. Some noise sounded like a gun (it might have been one), just the perceived victim fell to the ground, all while police were pointing their guns at him. Thus people were convinced they saw a shooting. An extreme case, but a great example of how our brain strains and simplifies what it sees all the time.  The author did not talk about this, but the need for a narrative is why politicians give examples of a specific person to tell a story. Instead of talking about how a new factory in town created 200 new jobs, they will say something like, “Look at Jane Doe, hard-working mother of 2. Thanks to her new job at the factory, she is able to help her oldest daughter become the first family member to attend law school.” The narrative brings is home. Another politically related take away for me was how America is stuck with a two party political system. Taleb talks about how a winner-takes-all competition leads to larger inequalities. No other parties can gain a foothold in the country because of the current winner-take-all format. If a party gaining 10% of the vote was given 10% representation, Democrats and Republicans would quickly change (adapt) or become dinosaurs. Another deeply enlightening concept was the information about how poorly humans estimate odds. The studies about how estimating odds changes when you are given a cause for what you are supposed to predict, was particularly insightful. Our ability to predict what will happen is the cornerstone of our species. But also it’s our Achilles heel. We blind ourselves by not seeing all that could happen. Another great quote: “We have a natural tendency to listen to the expert, even in fields where there may be no experts.” P189. People who know the most are not always “experts!” Art, music, and pop culture are all fields this applies to. And perhaps weather forecasting. I felt challenged to think about what I accept as the narrative of History as it was taught to me. Reconstructing the past is much, much, much harder than we think it is. Again, the narrative idea works against us. It’s easy to simplify, but dangerous. It leaves a lot out, and gives a false impression that since the past narrative is obvious, the present and future should be too.  I can’t say enough good things about this book. Read it! "
153,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15639925-t-nu-vahtra,4,"""Science is about how not to be a sucker."" “Prediction, not narration, is the real test of our understanding of the world.”I was not too much impressed by ""Antifragile"" and I liked ""Skin in the game"" even less, but this book is among the earlier of Taleb's books while he was still ""less angry"" and the style of the writing did not spoil the message (the style was still quite arrogant to say the least). Mainly the book provokes you towards more critical thinking, the enemy number one in this one is the Gaussian distribution (which is not relevant for black swan events) and anyone claiming that they have the theories and knowledge to ""handle"" black swan events VS just trying to acknowledge them and limit the maximum negative exposure. There is also quite a lot of praise for Kahneman here while I know thought leaders who disagree with both Taleb and Kahneman in most things. At times it felt that the same message could have been conveyed with less words and repetition from different angles but maybe such approach is inevitable for ""influencers"". “Missing a train is only painful if you run after it! Likewise, not matching the idea of success others expect from you is only painful if that’s what you are seeking.”“When you develop your opinions on the basis of weak evidence, you will have difficulty interpreting subsequent information that contradicts these opinions, even if this new information is obviously more accurate.”“The problem with experts is that they do not know what they do not know”“I propose that if you want a simple step to a higher form of life, as distant from the animal as you can get, then you may have to denarrate, that is, shut down the television set, minimize time spent reading newspapers, ignore the blogs. Train your reasoning abilities to control your decisions; nudge System 1 (the heuristic or experiential system) out of the important ones. Train yourself to spot the difference between the sensational and the empirical. This insulation from the toxicity of the world will have an additional benefit: it will improve your well-being.”“The strategy for the discoverers and entrepreneurs is to rely less on top-down planning and focus on maximum tinkering and recognizing opportunities when they present themselves. So I disagree with the followers of Marx and those of Adam Smith: the reason free markets work is because they allow people to be lucky, thanks to aggressive trial and error, not by giving rewards or “incentives” for skill. The strategy is, then, to tinker as much as possible and try to collect as many Black Swan opportunities as you can.”“Consider a turkey that is fed every day. Every single feeding will firm up the bird’s belief that it is the general rule of life to be fed every day by friendly members of the human race “looking out for its best interests,” as a politician would say. On the afternoon of the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, something unexpected will happen to the turkey. It will incur a revision of belief.”“Read books are far less valuable than unread ones. The library should contain as much of what you do not know as your financial means, mortgage rates, and the currently tight real-estate market allow you to put there.”"
154,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82093-todd,4,"The Black SwanThis is one of those “must read” books that many more people will claim to have read than will actually slog through. Like with Fooled by Randomness, Taleb takes many more pages than necessary to get his important points across. Those points are that we have incredibly poor skills at estimating extreme events, we regularly abuse historical statistics in ways that set us up to fail miserably, and we should have a great distrust of most planning processes. The ultimate message is positive, however, since there are general guidelines on how we can do better (set yourself up for good extreme events while protecting the downside). The style will either excite or turn off the reader. 90% of the parenthetical phrases and footnotes add little except Taleb’s (often snarky) editorials. Traders are sometimes described as people for whom the only thing worse than losing money themselves, is watching others make money. Taleb writes as if the only thing worse than him not getting adequate attention for his ideas is watching others get lauded. He clearly wants this book to be considered scholarly as he has 19 pages of notes and a 28 page bibliography designed to demonstrate the depth of his own reading. Segmenting the personal prose from its academic foundation may have the effect of improving the accessibility to the ideas within, but the reader should be cautioned. Any author who, in the acknowledgements, states “…[the book] just wrote itself,” and then thanks his editor for protecting him from “the intrusions of the standardizing editors,” has probably produced a verbose, tangent driven effort rather than the perfect prose he imagines.If the style excites you, great. If it turns you off, try to work through it. The world is full of decision makers who rely on experts, statistics and intricate models that are built on soft sand. The risks they take affect all of us, and while this behavior will probably never stop, we can take steps to minimize the impact of their folly. Anyone who has been visited by a negative Black Swan will understand this implicitly. For the rest of us, the cost of this book will be a much lower tuition than we might have to pay learning the lessons first hand."
155,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30590986-laurent-michiels,4,"Idea 5 stars, style 2 stars.I am following Taleb for c. 5 years now, and his ideas, including the Black Swan-concept, have contributed significantly to how I view the world.A Black Swan is an event which is rare, has an extreme impact and is predictable in retrospect. Our problem is that we tend to be blind with respect to incomplete information and the unknown, and particularly to the large deviations. Yet, knowing the concept of Black Swan is one thing; leveraging on it is another. Acknowledging that we don't know what we don't know, it does not make sense to precisely predict Black Swans. Instead we should accept uncertainties and invest in preparedness. Taleb urges us to be aggressive when we can gain exposure to positive Black Swans and very conservative (i.e. prevention over treatment) when we are under threat from a negative Black Swan. Obviously, this holds for all nonlinear events, both predictable and unpredictable.But reader beware! I have mixed feelings with this book. As I similarly experienced with his other books (e.g. Skin in the Game), Taleb's writing style is often dismissive, unstructured, yet entertaining at times. Also, I think you can easily skip or skim through many (repetitive, off-topic, etc.) chapters to still grasp the main ideas.I picked up this book again in quarantine during the COVID-19 lockdown. Importantly however, Taleb called the COVID-19 pandemic a white swan as he deems it wholly predictable and thus can not be used as an excuse for our unpreparedness. I think this is especially true concerning the outbreak in Western countries (months after China)."
156,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4749980-jeroen-kraan,1,"Very nearly got to the end of part one, but then it just became too stupid. As others have pointed out, Taleb is an absolutely insufferable author. His arrogance and disrespect for others probably makes him the second least likable writer after Richard Dawkins.But this is not just a matter of personality. While there are some glimmers of insight in this book, they are covered by a thick layer of confused logic. I finally gave up reading the book when Taleb used two fictional characters' answers to a thought experiment to point out that people who think scientifically are less likely to be succesful in life than the good ol' Plumber Joe type who may not have the IQ on paper but has street smarts. ""Have you ever wondered why so many of these straight-A students end up going nowhere in life while someone who lagged behind is now getting the shekels, buying diamonds, and getting his phone calls returned?"", he asks. The assertion is not just incredible and unfounded (when was the last time someone without a traditional education became president?), but the assertion comes directly after a screed blasting people for giving in to confirmation bias, seeing a narrative where there is none and generally making assumptions without using the proper data.On top of all that, the editing is sloppier than what you might find in most self-published erotic fiction. Seriously, enough with the supposedly witty asides already. Someone with a really good pair of scissors could have turned this 400-page book into a really clever 10-page New Yorker essay."

""The first step to wisdom is knowing what we don't know"" may sound like a line from the 1970s TV show ""Kung Fu,"" but it is an important theme in NNT's book. It's hard for me (being a product of an MBA program where we learned to look at everything as a bell curve) to fully embrace his ideas, but I feel a better man for knowing his views. Uncertainty is a big part of my job as a financial advisor (fee only, no commissions) and NNT's perspectives are useful in my work. Taken to the extreme, one may feel that all life is in vain; I don't think he'd agree with that, but he does say very clearly that our lives are not the linear, well-planned stories that our personal histories might suggest. There is something about the human mind that craves the simple, logical narrative, whether it be about the history of nations or of a person. NNT accepts this craving, but then explains really what happens in life - we are more a product of the rare and unexpected events (cancer, early death of parent, etc.) in our lives than the planned ones. This book is likely to generate lots of discussion among friends who like to debate or some deeper introspection about your own life's trajectory. Highly recommended!!"

As an undergraduate mathematics student, I was fascinated by the power of statistics and higher level mathematics to model and predict. Unfortunately, I never was introduced into its limitations ---- I don't remember them even being discussed.Taleb shows these limitations, and the way in which --- especially in the soft sciences of economics, finance, and psychology --- misuse of statistics or failure to understand the limitations of statistical methods can result in catastrophic results ---- namely via rare events with huge impacts arising well outside the possibilities predicted. In ""The Black Swan"", Taleb comes down especially hard upon economists, bankers, politicians, and journalists --- all of whom become enamored of methods they don't fully understand or short term thinking enabled by overreliance upon mathematical models unsuited for the dangerously random environment in which they work.This book should be required reading by every student of mathematics, economics, finance, or psychology in my opinion."
159,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237995-loyd,4,"No, it has nothing to do with the Natalie Portman movie. Researcher Nassim Nicholas Taleb's The Black Swan is a study of how unexpected, often tragic or shocking circumstances are the catalyst for positive change in the world. Here's the premise: an unexpected occurrence (like the discovery of an actual black swan in nature when none were thought to exist) jogs our thought processes, thus opening our eyes to a different future, for better or worse. I'm not sure every example in the book accurately supports the idea, but there is abundant proof that we constantly ""close the barn doors after the horse has escaped"" when it comes to national security, health scares, natural disasters, etc.In my mind The Black Swan ties to G.B. Shaw's quote: ""The reasonable man adapts himself to the conditions that surround him... The unreasonable man adapts surrounding conditions to himself... All progress depends on the unreasonable man.""We would like to think we don't have to be unreasonable—or victims of catastrophe—in order to progress. But the evidence might be against us."

Especially working at GoJek where a lot of people use vocabulary from this book. I'm a bit rebellious that way. About a week ago, I finally got to reading this. The Black Swan is definitely a perspective changing book introducing a lot of fresh, powerful ideas and discusses the nature of uncertainty and the limits of knowledge i.e the unknown unknowns. It explains why predicting the future is a fundamentally hard problem and why projects with long timelines have to grapple with the unknown unknowns. Especially when living in a world containing millions of independent-decision making actors. Two actionable strategies which I've found interesting from this book include keeping shorter timelines and the barbell investment strategy."

I already was of the same opinion as Talib – that people who make predictions in economics and social sciences, or believe in social engineering and shaping the history, are full of hot air. I’ve been through mathematically rigorous training on the theory of random processes myself, and I know how largely irrelevant it is even in engineering. Forget about finance and economics. And I always laugh at the commentators who act like they’re explaining the instantaneous movement of the stock market or oil prices. NASDAQ is down 11 points right now because blah blah blah.

It was just after the 2008 crisis and I had a vague sense that every authority figure I’d ever listened to was completely full of shit.The Black Swan convinced that was basically the case and I would have to build my own models and understanding of how things actually worked. The Black Swan itself contributed a lot to that new model and is still a big part of how I see the world.Re-reading it was well worth it. I picked up a couple of things I didn’t catch the first time around like the distinction between grey swans and black swans and the notion of “Platonicity.”If you haven’t picked up anything by Taleb, I think Fooled by Randomness is the best entry point."

It discusses how rare events have high impacts and that we are controlled by them, calling these events the Black Swans. The way we consider historic data to make decisions and forecasts is highly vulnerable to both the factors we cannot predict, and the factors we cannot measure. I was heavily involved in forecasting techniques and building basic/advanced mathematical models for forecasting,, and believe me it was hard for me to use these techniques while having the black swan theory ringing all the time in my mind :)"

However, to me the book felt as an accusation of scientist/academics, who allegedly think too highly of themselves, ignore common sense and do research that is not useful in practice. In my perspective, that is a very exagorated, limited and unnuanced view of academia .

All his books should be required reading for anyone in business, policy making, decision making, or breathing. I really enjoyed the discussion about empiricism vs rationalism, and their strengths and limitations. The concepts of extremistan vs mediocristan are very useful. He goes over falsification, the scientific method, the filtering effect on ancient processes, the problem of silent evidence, and a lot more. He discusses really well the phenomenon of why those who find cures are recognised and rewarded far more than those who find preventions, and how we should think about this (the answer is not to throw up our hands and say ""well what else can we do?""). I've always thought about these kinds of things, especially how someone who had implemented a policy of locked airline cabin doors on September 10, 2001 would never have been credited with saving 1000s of lives and preventing a long war, but would have actually prevented that nonetheless. I think we're often confused by the lack of empirical results of preventionism, so we give up. We need best practices, and robustness (aka antifragility), even when we can't show the results. We also can't be fooled by thinking that post-black swan fixes make us safe. Putting locks on cabin doors on September 12 would prevent another September 11 style takeover, but wouldn't prevent the next black swan. Locks are good, but feeling confident that we've fixed the problem is bad.Taleb talks about silent evidence, and naive empiricism, but I thought he should have covered (emphasised) beneficial empiricism, and when an argument from silence is valid, ie, when there's a lack of evidence when there shouldn't be (eg, finding no archaeological remains of a city in a particular place doesn't mean it's theoretically impossible that the place existed but was thoroughly and systematically erased, but its lack of evidence is so unexpected that we'd consider that to be a valid argument from silence that the place most probably didn't ever exist).Taleb's distinction of the 4 quadrants was also helpful, because it clarified when and how black swans are a problem.The other thing I really liked is the discussion about how some of the greatest scientific discoveries were serendipitous discoveries, not ones that the scientist planned to find. The trick is to put yourself in the path of good luck and not be too blinkered by your plan and projected outcomes, but be on the lookout for opportunities. I've found that some of the best opportunities in life and work have come when least expected and in a way that I could never have planned for. The trick isn't to plan to have a specific thing happen, but to put yourself in situations and frames of mind to recognise those opportunities. Sometimes from the outside this can look like wasted time because it's not following a specific plan, but it's very intentional. After a while people may wonder why you're so lucky, and it's hard to explain to them. You're no luckier than the next person, you're just more open to it and putting yourself in situations where more lucky things can find you, due to the laws of large numbers and probabilities.I'm not sure if this is a review anymore or a journal, but Taleb makes me think...."
176,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60222708-nati-s,5,"Philosophers talk about two types of reasoning: deduction and induction. In deductive reasoning the move from premises to conclusions is such that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In inductive reasoning, on the other hand, the conclusion follows from the premises not with necessity but only with probability. In a nutshell, this book is about the consequences confusing inductive reasoning for deductive reasoning and why the confusion occurs in the first place.Taleb states that probability is the mother of all abstractions. This is so because probability is a mode of thought/reasoning that attempts to capture uncertainty. Abstraction is sort of the construction of a mental model that represents reality in a general sense, such act requires a certain “amount”, or rather, “energy”. The mother abstraction, thus, being at the infinite limit, requires infinite cognitive energy. Hence, this particular abstraction is truly incomprehensible. To me this makes better sense when looked at via an example. Autistic individuals are not able to understand other’s emotions because they lack whatever is necessary to do that. This means such understanding is outside their mental scope, it’s something like sympathy-empathy abstraction that represents whatever allows this understanding. It is somewhat self-evident why said abstraction will not be comprehensible to these individuals. Somewhat similarly, all individuals are not able to comprehend uncertainty. There are two things needed in order for one to enjoy this book: curiosity and the ability to put aside, or rather be entertained by, the authors need to bash on academics and people associated with banks. I think it is beautifully written, insightful and humbling."
177,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2899659-guy,5,"I have just begun reading this, after it sat on my shelves for a bunch of years. I see immediately its importance and value both because of the points and quality of the writing — it has an irreverent humour I am enjoying — as well as having several immediate synchronicities with the Jordan B. Peterson lecture, The Maps of Knowledge, that I also just began listening to.Now I have finished it and have begun immediately to re-read it. This book is powerful and important and will likely have been and will continue to be totally ignored. Fascinating. A further review to follow my second read.And the second read was richly rewarding! Learned much more. And was quietly pleased that I made some observations about the nature of economics as does Taleb when I wrote my 'Economics Debunked' course several years ago.Taleb does a great job of comparing the way our officially accepted economic and social risk and growth measures and models are built within something akin to a two dimensional world oblivious to the reality of their existence being in a three or four dimensional one. He is astounded that such an obvious failure is not accepted. This made me smile because of something similar I observed with the great science of mathematics. For almost 2000 years Euclid's theorem about parallel lines was accepted as an ideal truth, despite the inability of mathematicians to prove it. In the end, it was finally accepted as only true in two dimensions. In three dimensions it is basically the foundation of navigational mathematics.Delusion knows no bounds, and is somehow always the other person's problem.I have twenty-plus yellow sticky flags in the book. One of them is a remarkable synchronicity with the psychologist Carl Jung, which occurred, as synchronicities tend to do, with my randomly, and for no obvious 'good' reason, picking up a Jung anthology for a quick glance even with my wanting to get back to Taleb. (Taleb doesn't mention Jung.) The synchronicity involves epistemology and the unpredictable nature of the soul and numbers. For Taleb it was about the unpredictability of history. Taleb wrote:First, when you spend a couple of decades doing mass-scale empirical work with data and taking risks based on such studies, you can easily spot elements in the texture of the world that the Platonified 'thinker' is too brainwashed, or too threatened, to see. Second, it allowed me to become formal and systematic in my thinking instead of wallowing in the anecdotal. Finally, both the philosophy of history and epistemology (the philosophy of knowledge) seemed inseparable from the empirical study of times series data, which is a succession of numbers instead of words. And numbers are easy to process on computers. Studying historical data makes you conscious that history runs forward, not backward, and that it is messier than the narrated accounts. Epistemology, the philosophy of history, and statistics aim at understanding truths, investigating the mechanisms that generate them, and separating regularity from the coincidental in historical matters. They all address the question of what one knows, except that all are to be found in different buildings, so to speak (p20).Jung: ""The moment one forms an idea of a thing and successfully catches one of its aspects, one invariably succumbs to the illusion having caught the whole"" (Jung, cited in DeLaszlo 
Basic Writings of C. G. Jung. Modern Library No. 300
 (p38). The delusion that mathematical modelling can be applied to the complexity of life is simply an extension of this idea. Like it was with the belief in Euclid's theorem against all evidence. Jung elaborates that if the first numbers came from a string of peas laid out, that that was easily grasped as the true meaning of number, but missed out that that simple idea, while true enough, missed the meta truth of the properties of numbers, such as odd and even and irrational and well the entire edifice of mathematics!Jung continues: One never considers that a total apprehension is right out of the question. Not even an idea that is posited as total is total, for it is still an entity on its own with unpredictable qualities. This self-deception certainly promotes peace of mind: the unknown is named, the far has been brought near, so that one can lay one's finger on it. One has taken possession of it, and it has become an inalienable piece of property, like a slain creature of the wild that can no longer run away. It is a magical procedure such as the primitive practices upon objects and the psychologist son the psyche. He is no longer at its mercy, but he never suspects that the very fact of grasping the object conceptually gives it a golden opportunity to display all those qualities which would never have made their appearance had it not been imprisoned in a concept (remember the numbers!) (p38-9).This is a true book: it challenges what you think you know, and asks you to begin to see the world as it is, not as we want it to be. I will read this again, because it has too much knowledge to be fully understood with even two readings."
178,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4643358-dimitris-hall,3,"This was a smart book. The author, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, is one of these guys you come across sometimes who are smartasses and they know it, are in love with that smartass prestige of theirs, and who you can't help but sit and listen to because they're so damn interesting. Sometimes their smartassiness goes a bit overboard, similar to the scratching of an itch that at first is satisfying but can easily hurt if you don't stop at the right moment. However, albeit barely, most of the time they keep it under control.I have to tell the truth. Most of the Black Swan was too technical for me, too difficult. I caught the main idea but at some point I just didn't know what I was reading anymore. I wonder if Taleb would have had a bigger impact with his book (and he did a big impact as far as I can tell) if he had made it easier to read for a broader audience. I have the impression that the more sophisticated an academic or a specialist is, the more resistant to books such as this he or she is, whereasAnyway, Taleb's idea, the whole topic of this book, is rather simple: life is full of Black Swan events, and...Sod it, I'll let Wikipedia do the talking for a sec:The phrase ""black swan"" derives from a Latin expression; its oldest known occurrence is the poet Juvenal's characterization of something being ""rara avis in terris nigroque simillima cygno"" (""a rare bird in the lands and very much like a black swan""; 6.165).[4] When the phrase was coined, the black swan was presumed not to exist.[...]Juvenal's phrase was a common expression in 16th century London as a statement of impossibility. The London expression derives from the Old World presumption that all swans must be white because all historical records of swans reported that they had white feathers.[5] In that context, a black swan was impossible or at least nonexistent. After Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh discovered black swans in Western Australia in 1697,[6] the term metamorphosed to connote that a perceived impossibility might later be disproven. Taleb notes that in the 19th century John Stuart Mill used the black swan logical fallacy as a new term to identify falsification.[7][...]Based on the author's criteria:1. The event is a surprise (to the observer).2. The event has a major effect.3. After the first recorded instance of the event, it is rationalized by hindsight, as if it could have been expected; that is, the relevant data were available but unaccounted for in risk mitigation programs. The same is true for the personal perception by individuals.[...]The theory was developed by Nassim Nicholas Taleb to explain:1. The disproportionate role of high-profile, hard-to-predict, and rare events that are beyond the realm of normal expectations in history, science, finance, and technology.2. The non-computability of the probability of the consequential rare events using scientific methods (owing to the very nature of small probabilities).3. The psychological biases that make people individually and collectively blind to uncertainty and unaware of the massive role of the rare event in historical affairs.Basically, we can't predict things. We think we can, but we can't, and they are the ones we are most vulnerable to. What do we have to do to make ourselves more robust to Black Swans? Be aware of them. And screw banksters and speculators, they're frauds. There, I just summarised the whole book!Don't give Black Swan a read if you're a bankster or speculator and want to preserve your so-called self-respect. Do give it a read if you believe that the world is much more complex than any model we can come up with, but be prepared to skim, skim, skim."
179,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5685608-john-jr,5,"What you don't know can hurt you: that's a truism, which means that, however familiar and easily forgotten it may be, what it says is true. It's not an adequate summary of Nassim Nicholas Taleb's book, but one gets a little closer by saying The Black Swan will tell you why it's true, how it's true, where it's true, and even, in passing, a few places where it's not true. An example from Taleb of where it's not true: If your wife is pregnant, you may not yet know the gender of the child, but there are only two possibilities, and in practice it can be determined (through amniocentesis or ultrasound), and the answer is relatively inconsequential, won't really hurt anyone--except possibly the child, who may be born into one of those cultures in which the killing of infant daughters is surreptitiously practiced. Taleb omits the infanticide note, but adding it is entirely in keeping with the spirit of his book, for he's forever reminding us that life in the modern world is more complex than we're apt to think. Here's an example of an unknown that does matter, which makes one of the fundamental points of Taleb's book: A turkey who has been fed every day for 1,000 days by a kind farmer knows what to expect, and for the turkey life is good--until day number 1,001, when the farmer shows up with an ax. That day is both unexpected and highly consequential--at least for the turkey, though not for the farmer--and it's the kind of thing Taleb calls a Black Swan event.One difference between Taleb's argument and what philosophers have long called the problem of induction (which is basically that 1,000 examples don't tell you for sure what the 1,001st will be) is this: unexpected and highly consequential things can happen (which even the philosophers recognize), but it matters where you stand. The ax-wielding farmer is a Black Swan event only for the turkey. Similarly, the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, were a Black Swan event for almost everybody else, but certainly not for the men who planned them. (In case you wonder about the title and the concept: Taleb explains in his opening paragraph that people in the Old World thought all swans were white until the discovery of Australia revealed to them that some swans are black.) What can we do? Answers permeate the book, but in a sense it boils down to this: be the smart guy, not the sucker (Taleb, an elegant writer who keeps his feet on the ground, isn't afraid to put it like that); when you don't have much choice, look for ways to limit the consequences.The turkey problem is hardly the whole of his book. Another of Taleb's points is that we construct stories after the fact that provide causes and explanations and allow us to believe after the fact that the unpredictable could've been predicted. (He doesn't waste much time, nor will I, on 9/11; the now-famous Presidential Daily Briefing that warned ""Bin Laden determined to attack in US"" counts for little, because it said nothing about how, when, and where, yet that's the kind of prediction we would've needed.) Taleb calls this retrospective storytelling the narrative fallacy, and if you haven't already noticed that historians, as well as the rest of us, repeatedly come up with differing ""explanations"" after the fact for what happened in the past, which you'd think would cast doubt on many of their explanations, you'll start noticing it. There's more, such as: what casinos have to do with uncertainty, and whether the U.S. military has paid any attention to Donald Rumsfeld's ""unknown unknowns"" (he's not named, but his term is), and what went wrong with the Sydney Opera House, and what the smart answer would've been when Alan Greenspan said the recent financial crisis couldn't have been foreseen because it had never happened before. Here's something to try: estimate the answers, read the book, and see if you were right. Prediction is hard, even about knowable things, and humans, by nature, aren't very good at it.If you want a label, The Black Swan is an extended argument for what Taleb calls skeptical empiricism. It's also maybe the most entertaining and useful erudite book that I've ever read. Umberto Eco's erudite novel Foucault's Pendulum will teach you to be careful with stories you make up; it's vastly entertaining but maybe not that useful (except as a warning about what the crazies might do). Taleb goes farther, warning us repeatedly against the stories (and theories and financial models) that others make up, and giving me, among other things, ideas for reworking my financial plan. And there's nothing wrong with a book that inspires one to read more books. This one has left me wanting to read Montaigne (again), and Seneca, and Karl Popper, and Friedrich Hayek, and Keynes, and Poincaré. In a way, the statue on the campus in Animal House had it right: Knowledge is good, if it helps you be the smart guy."
180,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10931405-ardyn,4,"This book finally spoke to some of the concerns I've had about what I've learned in business school. It is a well written book that presents brilliant ideas. I could have done without the author's snide comments and condescending tone but if you can get past that the content of this book is insightful, well organized, and incredibly captivating. You won't see the world the same way once you're done with this ground breaking book. "
181,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43781060-anthony-degleris,3,"Great ideas throughout this book. Unfortunately the author is a prick, a mediocre philosopher, and a hypocrite throughout his unorganized tirade."
182,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4969387-john,5,"It’s books like this that make me feel justified in giving other very good books a 4 or 4.5 stars. For large sections, this book felt like a 6. I had to read slowly. It took time to process, digest and try to apply all that Taleb had to say. Some sections I spent as much time staring out the window as I did actually reading words on the paper. I limited myself in the number of pages I read in a day in hope that spreading it out would help me process is more.  Chapter 6, The Narrative Fallacy, was mind-blowing. The mind’s desperate hunger for narrative is not a new idea to me. It is one I have read before (The Storytelling Animal by Jonathan Gottschall was a great read on the idea). But Taleb drove it home, and showed how deeply it affects our thinking. A couple of quotes from it:P66 “Our propensity to impose meaning and concepts blocks our awareness of the details making up the concepts.” We no longer see what exists, but see our interpretations. P69 “The same condition that makes us simplify (how we see the world) pushes us to think that the world is less random than it actually is.” To save “space” in our brains, we simplify. That simplification produces profound blindness to uncommon events. It was just in the news today that there were reports of another police shooting in Baltimore, a cold-blooded shooting of someone in the back. Multiple witnesses spoke with conviction that they saw it. But it turns out it never happened. Some noise sounded like a gun (it might have been one), just the perceived victim fell to the ground, all while police were pointing their guns at him. Thus people were convinced they saw a shooting. An extreme case, but a great example of how our brain strains and simplifies what it sees all the time.  The author did not talk about this, but the need for a narrative is why politicians give examples of a specific person to tell a story. Instead of talking about how a new factory in town created 200 new jobs, they will say something like, “Look at Jane Doe, hard-working mother of 2. Thanks to her new job at the factory, she is able to help her oldest daughter become the first family member to attend law school.” The narrative brings is home. Another politically related take away for me was how America is stuck with a two party political system. Taleb talks about how a winner-takes-all competition leads to larger inequalities. No other parties can gain a foothold in the country because of the current winner-take-all format. If a party gaining 10% of the vote was given 10% representation, Democrats and Republicans would quickly change (adapt) or become dinosaurs. Another deeply enlightening concept was the information about how poorly humans estimate odds. The studies about how estimating odds changes when you are given a cause for what you are supposed to predict, was particularly insightful. Our ability to predict what will happen is the cornerstone of our species. But also it’s our Achilles heel. We blind ourselves by not seeing all that could happen. Another great quote: “We have a natural tendency to listen to the expert, even in fields where there may be no experts.” P189. People who know the most are not always “experts!” Art, music, and pop culture are all fields this applies to. And perhaps weather forecasting. I felt challenged to think about what I accept as the narrative of History as it was taught to me. Reconstructing the past is much, much, much harder than we think it is. Again, the narrative idea works against us. It’s easy to simplify, but dangerous. It leaves a lot out, and gives a false impression that since the past narrative is obvious, the present and future should be too.  I can’t say enough good things about this book. Read it! "
183,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15639925-t-nu-vahtra,4,"""Science is about how not to be a sucker."" “Prediction, not narration, is the real test of our understanding of the world.”I was not too much impressed by ""Antifragile"" and I liked ""Skin in the game"" even less, but this book is among the earlier of Taleb's books while he was still ""less angry"" and the style of the writing did not spoil the message (the style was still quite arrogant to say the least). Mainly the book provokes you towards more critical thinking, the enemy number one in this one is the Gaussian distribution (which is not relevant for black swan events) and anyone claiming that they have the theories and knowledge to ""handle"" black swan events VS just trying to acknowledge them and limit the maximum negative exposure. There is also quite a lot of praise for Kahneman here while I know thought leaders who disagree with both Taleb and Kahneman in most things. At times it felt that the same message could have been conveyed with less words and repetition from different angles but maybe such approach is inevitable for ""influencers"". “Missing a train is only painful if you run after it! Likewise, not matching the idea of success others expect from you is only painful if that’s what you are seeking.”“When you develop your opinions on the basis of weak evidence, you will have difficulty interpreting subsequent information that contradicts these opinions, even if this new information is obviously more accurate.”“The problem with experts is that they do not know what they do not know”“I propose that if you want a simple step to a higher form of life, as distant from the animal as you can get, then you may have to denarrate, that is, shut down the television set, minimize time spent reading newspapers, ignore the blogs. Train your reasoning abilities to control your decisions; nudge System 1 (the heuristic or experiential system) out of the important ones. Train yourself to spot the difference between the sensational and the empirical. This insulation from the toxicity of the world will have an additional benefit: it will improve your well-being.”“The strategy for the discoverers and entrepreneurs is to rely less on top-down planning and focus on maximum tinkering and recognizing opportunities when they present themselves. So I disagree with the followers of Marx and those of Adam Smith: the reason free markets work is because they allow people to be lucky, thanks to aggressive trial and error, not by giving rewards or “incentives” for skill. The strategy is, then, to tinker as much as possible and try to collect as many Black Swan opportunities as you can.”“Consider a turkey that is fed every day. Every single feeding will firm up the bird’s belief that it is the general rule of life to be fed every day by friendly members of the human race “looking out for its best interests,” as a politician would say. On the afternoon of the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, something unexpected will happen to the turkey. It will incur a revision of belief.”“Read books are far less valuable than unread ones. The library should contain as much of what you do not know as your financial means, mortgage rates, and the currently tight real-estate market allow you to put there.”"
184,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82093-todd,4,"The Black SwanThis is one of those “must read” books that many more people will claim to have read than will actually slog through. Like with Fooled by Randomness, Taleb takes many more pages than necessary to get his important points across. Those points are that we have incredibly poor skills at estimating extreme events, we regularly abuse historical statistics in ways that set us up to fail miserably, and we should have a great distrust of most planning processes. The ultimate message is positive, however, since there are general guidelines on how we can do better (set yourself up for good extreme events while protecting the downside). The style will either excite or turn off the reader. 90% of the parenthetical phrases and footnotes add little except Taleb’s (often snarky) editorials. Traders are sometimes described as people for whom the only thing worse than losing money themselves, is watching others make money. Taleb writes as if the only thing worse than him not getting adequate attention for his ideas is watching others get lauded. He clearly wants this book to be considered scholarly as he has 19 pages of notes and a 28 page bibliography designed to demonstrate the depth of his own reading. Segmenting the personal prose from its academic foundation may have the effect of improving the accessibility to the ideas within, but the reader should be cautioned. Any author who, in the acknowledgements, states “…[the book] just wrote itself,” and then thanks his editor for protecting him from “the intrusions of the standardizing editors,” has probably produced a verbose, tangent driven effort rather than the perfect prose he imagines.If the style excites you, great. If it turns you off, try to work through it. The world is full of decision makers who rely on experts, statistics and intricate models that are built on soft sand. The risks they take affect all of us, and while this behavior will probably never stop, we can take steps to minimize the impact of their folly. Anyone who has been visited by a negative Black Swan will understand this implicitly. For the rest of us, the cost of this book will be a much lower tuition than we might have to pay learning the lessons first hand."
185,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30590986-laurent-michiels,4,"Idea 5 stars, style 2 stars.I am following Taleb for c. 5 years now, and his ideas, including the Black Swan-concept, have contributed significantly to how I view the world.A Black Swan is an event which is rare, has an extreme impact and is predictable in retrospect. Our problem is that we tend to be blind with respect to incomplete information and the unknown, and particularly to the large deviations. Yet, knowing the concept of Black Swan is one thing; leveraging on it is another. Acknowledging that we don't know what we don't know, it does not make sense to precisely predict Black Swans. Instead we should accept uncertainties and invest in preparedness. Taleb urges us to be aggressive when we can gain exposure to positive Black Swans and very conservative (i.e. prevention over treatment) when we are under threat from a negative Black Swan. Obviously, this holds for all nonlinear events, both predictable and unpredictable.But reader beware! I have mixed feelings with this book. As I similarly experienced with his other books (e.g. Skin in the Game), Taleb's writing style is often dismissive, unstructured, yet entertaining at times. Also, I think you can easily skip or skim through many (repetitive, off-topic, etc.) chapters to still grasp the main ideas.I picked up this book again in quarantine during the COVID-19 lockdown. Importantly however, Taleb called the COVID-19 pandemic a white swan as he deems it wholly predictable and thus can not be used as an excuse for our unpreparedness. I think this is especially true concerning the outbreak in Western countries (months after China)."
186,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4749980-jeroen-kraan,1,"Very nearly got to the end of part one, but then it just became too stupid. As others have pointed out, Taleb is an absolutely insufferable author. His arrogance and disrespect for others probably makes him the second least likable writer after Richard Dawkins.But this is not just a matter of personality. While there are some glimmers of insight in this book, they are covered by a thick layer of confused logic. I finally gave up reading the book when Taleb used two fictional characters' answers to a thought experiment to point out that people who think scientifically are less likely to be succesful in life than the good ol' Plumber Joe type who may not have the IQ on paper but has street smarts. ""Have you ever wondered why so many of these straight-A students end up going nowhere in life while someone who lagged behind is now getting the shekels, buying diamonds, and getting his phone calls returned?"", he asks. The assertion is not just incredible and unfounded (when was the last time someone without a traditional education became president?), but the assertion comes directly after a screed blasting people for giving in to confirmation bias, seeing a narrative where there is none and generally making assumptions without using the proper data.On top of all that, the editing is sloppier than what you might find in most self-published erotic fiction. Seriously, enough with the supposedly witty asides already. Someone with a really good pair of scissors could have turned this 400-page book into a really clever 10-page New Yorker essay."

""The first step to wisdom is knowing what we don't know"" may sound like a line from the 1970s TV show ""Kung Fu,"" but it is an important theme in NNT's book. It's hard for me (being a product of an MBA program where we learned to look at everything as a bell curve) to fully embrace his ideas, but I feel a better man for knowing his views. Uncertainty is a big part of my job as a financial advisor (fee only, no commissions) and NNT's perspectives are useful in my work. Taken to the extreme, one may feel that all life is in vain; I don't think he'd agree with that, but he does say very clearly that our lives are not the linear, well-planned stories that our personal histories might suggest. There is something about the human mind that craves the simple, logical narrative, whether it be about the history of nations or of a person. NNT accepts this craving, but then explains really what happens in life - we are more a product of the rare and unexpected events (cancer, early death of parent, etc.) in our lives than the planned ones. This book is likely to generate lots of discussion among friends who like to debate or some deeper introspection about your own life's trajectory. Highly recommended!!"
188,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9496879-michael-o-brien,5,"This is one of the most outstanding books I've read in a long time. As an undergraduate mathematics student, I was fascinated by the power of statistics and higher level mathematics to model and predict. Unfortunately, I never was introduced into its limitations ---- I don't remember them even being discussed.Taleb shows these limitations, and the way in which --- especially in the soft sciences of economics, finance, and psychology --- misuse of statistics or failure to understand the limitations of statistical methods can result in catastrophic results ---- namely via rare events with huge impacts arising well outside the possibilities predicted. In ""The Black Swan"", Taleb comes down especially hard upon economists, bankers, politicians, and journalists --- all of whom become enamored of methods they don't fully understand or short term thinking enabled by overreliance upon mathematical models unsuited for the dangerously random environment in which they work.This book should be required reading by every student of mathematics, economics, finance, or psychology in my opinion."
189,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237995-loyd,4,"No, it has nothing to do with the Natalie Portman movie. Researcher Nassim Nicholas Taleb's The Black Swan is a study of how unexpected, often tragic or shocking circumstances are the catalyst for positive change in the world. Here's the premise: an unexpected occurrence (like the discovery of an actual black swan in nature when none were thought to exist) jogs our thought processes, thus opening our eyes to a different future, for better or worse. I'm not sure every example in the book accurately supports the idea, but there is abundant proof that we constantly ""close the barn doors after the horse has escaped"" when it comes to national security, health scares, natural disasters, etc.In my mind The Black Swan ties to G.B. Shaw's quote: ""The reasonable man adapts himself to the conditions that surround him... The unreasonable man adapts surrounding conditions to himself... All progress depends on the unreasonable man.""We would like to think we don't have to be unreasonable—or victims of catastrophe—in order to progress. But the evidence might be against us."

Especially working at GoJek where a lot of people use vocabulary from this book. I'm a bit rebellious that way. About a week ago, I finally got to reading this. The Black Swan is definitely a perspective changing book introducing a lot of fresh, powerful ideas and discusses the nature of uncertainty and the limits of knowledge i.e the unknown unknowns. It explains why predicting the future is a fundamentally hard problem and why projects with long timelines have to grapple with the unknown unknowns. Especially when living in a world containing millions of independent-decision making actors. Two actionable strategies which I've found interesting from this book include keeping shorter timelines and the barbell investment strategy."

I already was of the same opinion as Talib – that people who make predictions in economics and social sciences, or believe in social engineering and shaping the history, are full of hot air. I’ve been through mathematically rigorous training on the theory of random processes myself, and I know how largely irrelevant it is even in engineering. Forget about finance and economics. And I always laugh at the commentators who act like they’re explaining the instantaneous movement of the stock market or oil prices. NASDAQ is down 11 points right now because blah blah blah. They know that they’re bullshitting, but they still keep on bullshitting. "

It was just after the 2008 crisis and I had a vague sense that every authority figure I’d ever listened to was completely full of shit.The Black Swan convinced that was basically the case and I would have to build my own models and understanding of how things actually worked. The Black Swan itself contributed a lot to that new model and is still a big part of how I see the world.Re-reading it was well worth it. I picked up a couple of things I didn’t catch the first time around like the distinction between grey swans and black swans and the notion of “Platonicity.”If you haven’t picked up anything by Taleb, I think Fooled by Randomness is the best entry point."

It discusses how rare events have high impacts and that we are controlled by them, calling these events the Black Swans. The way we consider historic data to make decisions and forecasts is highly vulnerable to both the factors we cannot predict, and the factors we cannot measure. I was heavily involved in forecasting techniques and building basic/advanced mathematical models for forecasting,, and believe me it was hard for me to use these techniques while having the black swan theory ringing all the time in my mind :)"

However, to me the book felt as an accusation of scientist/academics, who allegedly think too highly of themselves, ignore common sense and do research that is not useful in practice. In my perspective, that is a very exagorated, limited and unnuanced view of academia . Taleb might want to update as well, e.g. He might want to discuss evolutionary economics, which solves a lot of his critique on neoclassical economics."

205,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7918888-michael,5,"Despite a few flaws and Taleb's characteristic and unapologetic meandering style, this was really good. All his books should be required reading for anyone in business, policy making, decision making, or breathing. I really enjoyed the discussion about empiricism vs rationalism, and their strengths and limitations. The concepts of extremistan vs mediocristan are very useful. He goes over falsification, the scientific method, the filtering effect on ancient processes, the problem of silent evidence, and a lot more. He discusses really well the phenomenon of why those who find cures are recognised and rewarded far more than those who find preventions, and how we should think about this (the answer is not to throw up our hands and say ""well what else can we do?""). I've always thought about these kinds of things, especially how someone who had implemented a policy of locked airline cabin doors on September 10, 2001 would never have been credited with saving 1000s of lives and preventing a long war, but would have actually prevented that nonetheless. I think we're often confused by the lack of empirical results of preventionism, so we give up. We need best practices, and robustness (aka antifragility), even when we can't show the results. We also can't be fooled by thinking that post-black swan fixes make us safe. Putting locks on cabin doors on September 12 would prevent another September 11 style takeover, but wouldn't prevent the next black swan. Locks are good, but feeling confident that we've fixed the problem is bad.Taleb talks about silent evidence, and naive empiricism, but I thought he should have covered (emphasised) beneficial empiricism, and when an argument from silence is valid, ie, when there's a lack of evidence when there shouldn't be (eg, finding no archaeological remains of a city in a particular place doesn't mean it's theoretically impossible that the place existed but was thoroughly and systematically erased, but its lack of evidence is so unexpected that we'd consider that to be a valid argument from silence that the place most probably didn't ever exist).Taleb's distinction of the 4 quadrants was also helpful, because it clarified when and how black swans are a problem.The other thing I really liked is the discussion about how some of the greatest scientific discoveries were serendipitous discoveries, not ones that the scientist planned to find. The trick is to put yourself in the path of good luck and not be too blinkered by your plan and projected outcomes, but be on the lookout for opportunities. I've found that some of the best opportunities in life and work have come when least expected and in a way that I could never have planned for. The trick isn't to plan to have a specific thing happen, but to put yourself in situations and frames of mind to recognise those opportunities. Sometimes from the outside this can look like wasted time because it's not following a specific plan, but it's very intentional. After a while people may wonder why you're so lucky, and it's hard to explain to them. You're no luckier than the next person, you're just more open to it and putting yourself in situations where more lucky things can find you, due to the laws of large numbers and probabilities.I'm not sure if this is a review anymore or a journal, but Taleb makes me think...."
206,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60222708-nati-s,5,"Philosophers talk about two types of reasoning: deduction and induction. In deductive reasoning the move from premises to conclusions is such that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In inductive reasoning, on the other hand, the conclusion follows from the premises not with necessity but only with probability. In a nutshell, this book is about the consequences confusing inductive reasoning for deductive reasoning and why the confusion occurs in the first place.Taleb states that probability is the mother of all abstractions. This is so because probability is a mode of thought/reasoning that attempts to capture uncertainty. Abstraction is sort of the construction of a mental model that represents reality in a general sense, such act requires a certain “amount”, or rather, “energy”. The mother abstraction, thus, being at the infinite limit, requires infinite cognitive energy. Hence, this particular abstraction is truly incomprehensible. To me this makes better sense when looked at via an example. Autistic individuals are not able to understand other’s emotions because they lack whatever is necessary to do that. This means such understanding is outside their mental scope, it’s something like sympathy-empathy abstraction that represents whatever allows this understanding. It is somewhat self-evident why said abstraction will not be comprehensible to these individuals. Somewhat similarly, all individuals are not able to comprehend uncertainty. There are two things needed in order for one to enjoy this book: curiosity and the ability to put aside, or rather be entertained by, the authors need to bash on academics and people associated with banks. I think it is beautifully written, insightful and humbling."
207,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2899659-guy,5,"I have just begun reading this, after it sat on my shelves for a bunch of years. I see immediately its importance and value both because of the points and quality of the writing — it has an irreverent humour I am enjoying — as well as having several immediate synchronicities with the Jordan B. Peterson lecture, The Maps of Knowledge, that I also just began listening to.Now I have finished it and have begun immediately to re-read it. This book is powerful and important and will likely have been and will continue to be totally ignored. Fascinating. A further review to follow my second read.And the second read was richly rewarding! Learned much more. And was quietly pleased that I made some observations about the nature of economics as does Taleb when I wrote my 'Economics Debunked' course several years ago.Taleb does a great job of comparing the way our officially accepted economic and social risk and growth measures and models are built within something akin to a two dimensional world oblivious to the reality of their existence being in a three or four dimensional one. He is astounded that such an obvious failure is not accepted. This made me smile because of something similar I observed with the great science of mathematics. For almost 2000 years Euclid's theorem about parallel lines was accepted as an ideal truth, despite the inability of mathematicians to prove it. In the end, it was finally accepted as only true in two dimensions. In three dimensions it is basically the foundation of navigational mathematics.Delusion knows no bounds, and is somehow always the other person's problem.I have twenty-plus yellow sticky flags in the book. One of them is a remarkable synchronicity with the psychologist Carl Jung, which occurred, as synchronicities tend to do, with my randomly, and for no obvious 'good' reason, picking up a Jung anthology for a quick glance even with my wanting to get back to Taleb. (Taleb doesn't mention Jung.) The synchronicity involves epistemology and the unpredictable nature of the soul and numbers. For Taleb it was about the unpredictability of history. Taleb wrote:First, when you spend a couple of decades doing mass-scale empirical work with data and taking risks based on such studies, you can easily spot elements in the texture of the world that the Platonified 'thinker' is too brainwashed, or too threatened, to see. Second, it allowed me to become formal and systematic in my thinking instead of wallowing in the anecdotal. Finally, both the philosophy of history and epistemology (the philosophy of knowledge) seemed inseparable from the empirical study of times series data, which is a succession of numbers instead of words. And numbers are easy to process on computers. Studying historical data makes you conscious that history runs forward, not backward, and that it is messier than the narrated accounts. Epistemology, the philosophy of history, and statistics aim at understanding truths, investigating the mechanisms that generate them, and separating regularity from the coincidental in historical matters. They all address the question of what one knows, except that all are to be found in different buildings, so to speak (p20).Jung: ""The moment one forms an idea of a thing and successfully catches one of its aspects, one invariably succumbs to the illusion having caught the whole"" (Jung, cited in DeLaszlo 
Basic Writings of C. G. Jung. Modern Library No. 300
 (p38). The delusion that mathematical modelling can be applied to the complexity of life is simply an extension of this idea. Like it was with the belief in Euclid's theorem against all evidence. Jung elaborates that if the first numbers came from a string of peas laid out, that that was easily grasped as the true meaning of number, but missed out that that simple idea, while true enough, missed the meta truth of the properties of numbers, such as odd and even and irrational and well the entire edifice of mathematics!Jung continues: One never considers that a total apprehension is right out of the question. Not even an idea that is posited as total is total, for it is still an entity on its own with unpredictable qualities. This self-deception certainly promotes peace of mind: the unknown is named, the far has been brought near, so that one can lay one's finger on it. One has taken possession of it, and it has become an inalienable piece of property, like a slain creature of the wild that can no longer run away. It is a magical procedure such as the primitive practices upon objects and the psychologist son the psyche. He is no longer at its mercy, but he never suspects that the very fact of grasping the object conceptually gives it a golden opportunity to display all those qualities which would never have made their appearance had it not been imprisoned in a concept (remember the numbers!) (p38-9).This is a true book: it challenges what you think you know, and asks you to begin to see the world as it is, not as we want it to be. I will read this again, because it has too much knowledge to be fully understood with even two readings."
208,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4643358-dimitris-hall,3,"This was a smart book. The author, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, is one of these guys you come across sometimes who are smartasses and they know it, are in love with that smartass prestige of theirs, and who you can't help but sit and listen to because they're so damn interesting. Sometimes their smartassiness goes a bit overboard, similar to the scratching of an itch that at first is satisfying but can easily hurt if you don't stop at the right moment. However, albeit barely, most of the time they keep it under control.I have to tell the truth. Most of the Black Swan was too technical for me, too difficult. I caught the main idea but at some point I just didn't know what I was reading anymore. I wonder if Taleb would have had a bigger impact with his book (and he did a big impact as far as I can tell) if he had made it easier to read for a broader audience. I have the impression that the more sophisticated an academic or a specialist is, the more resistant to books such as this he or she is, whereasAnyway, Taleb's idea, the whole topic of this book, is rather simple: life is full of Black Swan events, and...Sod it, I'll let Wikipedia do the talking for a sec:The phrase ""black swan"" derives from a Latin expression; its oldest known occurrence is the poet Juvenal's characterization of something being ""rara avis in terris nigroque simillima cygno"" (""a rare bird in the lands and very much like a black swan""; 6.165).[4] When the phrase was coined, the black swan was presumed not to exist.[...]Juvenal's phrase was a common expression in 16th century London as a statement of impossibility. The London expression derives from the Old World presumption that all swans must be white because all historical records of swans reported that they had white feathers.[5] In that context, a black swan was impossible or at least nonexistent. After Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh discovered black swans in Western Australia in 1697,[6] the term metamorphosed to connote that a perceived impossibility might later be disproven. Taleb notes that in the 19th century John Stuart Mill used the black swan logical fallacy as a new term to identify falsification.[7][...]Based on the author's criteria:1. The event is a surprise (to the observer).2. The event has a major effect.3. After the first recorded instance of the event, it is rationalized by hindsight, as if it could have been expected; that is, the relevant data were available but unaccounted for in risk mitigation programs. The same is true for the personal perception by individuals.[...]The theory was developed by Nassim Nicholas Taleb to explain:1. The disproportionate role of high-profile, hard-to-predict, and rare events that are beyond the realm of normal expectations in history, science, finance, and technology.2. The non-computability of the probability of the consequential rare events using scientific methods (owing to the very nature of small probabilities).3. The psychological biases that make people individually and collectively blind to uncertainty and unaware of the massive role of the rare event in historical affairs.Basically, we can't predict things. We think we can, but we can't, and they are the ones we are most vulnerable to. What do we have to do to make ourselves more robust to Black Swans? Be aware of them. And screw banksters and speculators, they're frauds. There, I just summarised the whole book!Don't give Black Swan a read if you're a bankster or speculator and want to preserve your so-called self-respect. Do give it a read if you believe that the world is much more complex than any model we can come up with, but be prepared to skim, skim, skim."
209,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5685608-john-jr,5,"What you don't know can hurt you: that's a truism, which means that, however familiar and easily forgotten it may be, what it says is true. It's not an adequate summary of Nassim Nicholas Taleb's book, but one gets a little closer by saying The Black Swan will tell you why it's true, how it's true, where it's true, and even, in passing, a few places where it's not true. An example from Taleb of where it's not true: If your wife is pregnant, you may not yet know the gender of the child, but there are only two possibilities, and in practice it can be determined (through amniocentesis or ultrasound), and the answer is relatively inconsequential, won't really hurt anyone--except possibly the child, who may be born into one of those cultures in which the killing of infant daughters is surreptitiously practiced. Taleb omits the infanticide note, but adding it is entirely in keeping with the spirit of his book, for he's forever reminding us that life in the modern world is more complex than we're apt to think. Here's an example of an unknown that does matter, which makes one of the fundamental points of Taleb's book: A turkey who has been fed every day for 1,000 days by a kind farmer knows what to expect, and for the turkey life is good--until day number 1,001, when the farmer shows up with an ax. That day is both unexpected and highly consequential--at least for the turkey, though not for the farmer--and it's the kind of thing Taleb calls a Black Swan event.One difference between Taleb's argument and what philosophers have long called the problem of induction (which is basically that 1,000 examples don't tell you for sure what the 1,001st will be) is this: unexpected and highly consequential things can happen (which even the philosophers recognize), but it matters where you stand. The ax-wielding farmer is a Black Swan event only for the turkey. Similarly, the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, were a Black Swan event for almost everybody else, but certainly not for the men who planned them. (In case you wonder about the title and the concept: Taleb explains in his opening paragraph that people in the Old World thought all swans were white until the discovery of Australia revealed to them that some swans are black.) What can we do? Answers permeate the book, but in a sense it boils down to this: be the smart guy, not the sucker (Taleb, an elegant writer who keeps his feet on the ground, isn't afraid to put it like that); when you don't have much choice, look for ways to limit the consequences.The turkey problem is hardly the whole of his book. Another of Taleb's points is that we construct stories after the fact that provide causes and explanations and allow us to believe after the fact that the unpredictable could've been predicted. (He doesn't waste much time, nor will I, on 9/11; the now-famous Presidential Daily Briefing that warned ""Bin Laden determined to attack in US"" counts for little, because it said nothing about how, when, and where, yet that's the kind of prediction we would've needed.) Taleb calls this retrospective storytelling the narrative fallacy, and if you haven't already noticed that historians, as well as the rest of us, repeatedly come up with differing ""explanations"" after the fact for what happened in the past, which you'd think would cast doubt on many of their explanations, you'll start noticing it. There's more, such as: what casinos have to do with uncertainty, and whether the U.S. military has paid any attention to Donald Rumsfeld's ""unknown unknowns"" (he's not named, but his term is), and what went wrong with the Sydney Opera House, and what the smart answer would've been when Alan Greenspan said the recent financial crisis couldn't have been foreseen because it had never happened before. Here's something to try: estimate the answers, read the book, and see if you were right. Prediction is hard, even about knowable things, and humans, by nature, aren't very good at it.If you want a label, The Black Swan is an extended argument for what Taleb calls skeptical empiricism. It's also maybe the most entertaining and useful erudite book that I've ever read. Umberto Eco's erudite novel Foucault's Pendulum will teach you to be careful with stories you make up; it's vastly entertaining but maybe not that useful (except as a warning about what the crazies might do). Taleb goes farther, warning us repeatedly against the stories (and theories and financial models) that others make up, and giving me, among other things, ideas for reworking my financial plan. And there's nothing wrong with a book that inspires one to read more books. This one has left me wanting to read Montaigne (again), and Seneca, and Karl Popper, and Friedrich Hayek, and Keynes, and Poincaré. In a way, the statue on the campus in Animal House had it right: Knowledge is good, if it helps you be the smart guy."
210,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10931405-ardyn,4,"This book finally spoke to some of the concerns I've had about what I've learned in business school.

212,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4969387-john,5,"It’s books like this that make me feel justified in giving other very good books a 4 or 4.5 stars. For large sections, this book felt like a 6. I had to read slowly. It took time to process, digest and try to apply all that Taleb had to say. Some sections I spent as much time staring out the window as I did actually reading words on the paper. I limited myself in the number of pages I read in a day in hope that spreading it out would help me process is more.  Chapter 6, The Narrative Fallacy, was mind-blowing. The mind’s desperate hunger for narrative is not a new idea to me. It is one I have read before (The Storytelling Animal by Jonathan Gottschall was a great read on the idea). But Taleb drove it home, and showed how deeply it affects our thinking. A couple of quotes from it:P66 “Our propensity to impose meaning and concepts blocks our awareness of the details making up the concepts.” We no longer see what exists, but see our interpretations. P69 “The same condition that makes us simplify (how we see the world) pushes us to think that the world is less random than it actually is.” To save “space” in our brains, we simplify. That simplification produces profound blindness to uncommon events. It was just in the news today that there were reports of another police shooting in Baltimore, a cold-blooded shooting of someone in the back. Multiple witnesses spoke with conviction that they saw it. But it turns out it never happened. Some noise sounded like a gun (it might have been one), just the perceived victim fell to the ground, all while police were pointing their guns at him. Thus people were convinced they saw a shooting. An extreme case, but a great example of how our brain strains and simplifies what it sees all the time.  The author did not talk about this, but the need for a narrative is why politicians give examples of a specific person to tell a story. Instead of talking about how a new factory in town created 200 new jobs, they will say something like, “Look at Jane Doe, hard-working mother of 2. Thanks to her new job at the factory, she is able to help her oldest daughter become the first family member to attend law school.” The narrative brings is home. Another politically related take away for me was how America is stuck with a two party political system. Taleb talks about how a winner-takes-all competition leads to larger inequalities. No other parties can gain a foothold in the country because of the current winner-take-all format. If a party gaining 10% of the vote was given 10% representation, Democrats and Republicans would quickly change (adapt) or become dinosaurs. Another deeply enlightening concept was the information about how poorly humans estimate odds. The studies about how estimating odds changes when you are given a cause for what you are supposed to predict, was particularly insightful. Our ability to predict what will happen is the cornerstone of our species. But also it’s our Achilles heel. We blind ourselves by not seeing all that could happen. Another great quote: “We have a natural tendency to listen to the expert, even in fields where there may be no experts.” P189. People who know the most are not always “experts!” Art, music, and pop culture are all fields this applies to. And perhaps weather forecasting. I felt challenged to think about what I accept as the narrative of History as it was taught to me. Reconstructing the past is much, much, much harder than we think it is. Again, the narrative idea works against us. It’s easy to simplify, but dangerous. It leaves a lot out, and gives a false impression that since the past narrative is obvious, the present and future should be too.  I can’t say enough good things about this book. Read it! "
213,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15639925-t-nu-vahtra,4,"""Science is about how not to be a sucker."" “Prediction, not narration, is the real test of our understanding of the world.”I was not too much impressed by ""Antifragile"" and I liked ""Skin in the game"" even less, but this book is among the earlier of Taleb's books while he was still ""less angry"" and the style of the writing did not spoil the message (the style was still quite arrogant to say the least). Mainly the book provokes you towards more critical thinking, the enemy number one in this one is the Gaussian distribution (which is not relevant for black swan events) and anyone claiming that they have the theories and knowledge to ""handle"" black swan events VS just trying to acknowledge them and limit the maximum negative exposure. There is also quite a lot of praise for Kahneman here while I know thought leaders who disagree with both Taleb and Kahneman in most things. At times it felt that the same message could have been conveyed with less words and repetition from different angles but maybe such approach is inevitable for ""influencers"". “Missing a train is only painful if you run after it! Likewise, not matching the idea of success others expect from you is only painful if that’s what you are seeking.”“When you develop your opinions on the basis of weak evidence, you will have difficulty interpreting subsequent information that contradicts these opinions, even if this new information is obviously more accurate.”“The problem with experts is that they do not know what they do not know”“I propose that if you want a simple step to a higher form of life, as distant from the animal as you can get, then you may have to denarrate, that is, shut down the television set, minimize time spent reading newspapers, ignore the blogs. Train your reasoning abilities to control your decisions; nudge System 1 (the heuristic or experiential system) out of the important ones. Train yourself to spot the difference between the sensational and the empirical. This insulation from the toxicity of the world will have an additional benefit: it will improve your well-being.”“The strategy for the discoverers and entrepreneurs is to rely less on top-down planning and focus on maximum tinkering and recognizing opportunities when they present themselves. So I disagree with the followers of Marx and those of Adam Smith: the reason free markets work is because they allow people to be lucky, thanks to aggressive trial and error, not by giving rewards or “incentives” for skill. The strategy is, then, to tinker as much as possible and try to collect as many Black Swan opportunities as you can.”“Consider a turkey that is fed every day. Every single feeding will firm up the bird’s belief that it is the general rule of life to be fed every day by friendly members of the human race “looking out for its best interests,” as a politician would say. On the afternoon of the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, something unexpected will happen to the turkey. It will incur a revision of belief.”“Read books are far less valuable than unread ones. The library should contain as much of what you do not know as your financial means, mortgage rates, and the currently tight real-estate market allow you to put there.”"
214,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82093-todd,4,"The Black SwanThis is one of those “must read” books that many more people will claim to have read than will actually slog through. Like with Fooled by Randomness, Taleb takes many more pages than necessary to get his important points across. Those points are that we have incredibly poor skills at estimating extreme events, we regularly abuse historical statistics in ways that set us up to fail miserably, and we should have a great distrust of most planning processes. The ultimate message is positive, however, since there are general guidelines on how we can do better (set yourself up for good extreme events while protecting the downside). The style will either excite or turn off the reader. 90% of the parenthetical phrases and footnotes add little except Taleb’s (often snarky) editorials. Traders are sometimes described as people for whom the only thing worse than losing money themselves, is watching others make money. Taleb writes as if the only thing worse than him not getting adequate attention for his ideas is watching others get lauded. He clearly wants this book to be considered scholarly as he has 19 pages of notes and a 28 page bibliography designed to demonstrate the depth of his own reading. Segmenting the personal prose from its academic foundation may have the effect of improving the accessibility to the ideas within, but the reader should be cautioned. Any author who, in the acknowledgements, states “…[the book] just wrote itself,” and then thanks his editor for protecting him from “the intrusions of the standardizing editors,” has probably produced a verbose, tangent driven effort rather than the perfect prose he imagines.If the style excites you, great. If it turns you off, try to work through it. The world is full of decision makers who rely on experts, statistics and intricate models that are built on soft sand. The risks they take affect all of us, and while this behavior will probably never stop, we can take steps to minimize the impact of their folly. Anyone who has been visited by a negative Black Swan will understand this implicitly. For the rest of us, the cost of this book will be a much lower tuition than we might have to pay learning the lessons first hand."
215,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30590986-laurent-michiels,4,"Idea 5 stars, style 2 stars.I am following Taleb for c. 5 years now, and his ideas, including the Black Swan-concept, have contributed significantly to how I view the world.A Black Swan is an event which is rare, has an extreme impact and is predictable in retrospect. Our problem is that we tend to be blind with respect to incomplete information and the unknown, and particularly to the large deviations. Yet, knowing the concept of Black Swan is one thing; leveraging on it is another. Acknowledging that we don't know what we don't know, it does not make sense to precisely predict Black Swans. Instead we should accept uncertainties and invest in preparedness. Taleb urges us to be aggressive when we can gain exposure to positive Black Swans and very conservative (i.e. prevention over treatment) when we are under threat from a negative Black Swan. Obviously, this holds for all nonlinear events, both predictable and unpredictable.But reader beware! I have mixed feelings with this book. As I similarly experienced with his other books (e.g. Skin in the Game), Taleb's writing style is often dismissive, unstructured, yet entertaining at times. Also, I think you can easily skip or skim through many (repetitive, off-topic, etc.) chapters to still grasp the main ideas.I picked up this book again in quarantine during the COVID-19 lockdown. Importantly however, Taleb called the COVID-19 pandemic a white swan as he deems it wholly predictable and thus can not be used as an excuse for our unpreparedness. I think this is especially true concerning the outbreak in Western countries (months after China)."
216,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4749980-jeroen-kraan,1,"Very nearly got to the end of part one, but then it just became too stupid. As others have pointed out, Taleb is an absolutely insufferable author. His arrogance and disrespect for others probably makes him the second least likable writer after Richard Dawkins.But this is not just a matter of personality. While there are some glimmers of insight in this book, they are covered by a thick layer of confused logic. I finally gave up reading the book when Taleb used two fictional characters' answers to a thought experiment to point out that people who think scientifically are less likely to be succesful in life than the good ol' Plumber Joe type who may not have the IQ on paper but has street smarts. ""Have you ever wondered why so many of these straight-A students end up going nowhere in life while someone who lagged behind is now getting the shekels, buying diamonds, and getting his phone calls returned?"", he asks. The assertion is not just incredible and unfounded (when was the last time someone without a traditional education became president?), but the assertion comes directly after a screed blasting people for giving in to confirmation bias, seeing a narrative where there is none and generally making assumptions without using the proper data.On top of all that, the editing is sloppier than what you might find in most self-published erotic fiction. Seriously, enough with the supposedly witty asides already. Someone with a really good pair of scissors could have turned this 400-page book into a really clever 10-page New Yorker essay."

""The first step to wisdom is knowing what we don't know"" may sound like a line from the 1970s TV show ""Kung Fu,"" but it is an important theme in NNT's book. It's hard for me (being a product of an MBA program where we learned to look at everything as a bell curve) to fully embrace his ideas, but I feel a better man for knowing his views. Uncertainty is a big part of my job as a financial advisor (fee only, no commissions) and NNT's perspectives are useful in my work. Taken to the extreme, one may feel that all life is in vain; I don't think he'd agree with that, but he does say very clearly that our lives are not the linear, well-planned stories that our personal histories might suggest. There is something about the human mind that craves the simple, logical narrative, whether it be about the history of nations or of a person. NNT accepts this craving, but then explains really what happens in life - we are more a product of the rare and unexpected events (cancer, early death of parent, etc.) in our lives than the planned ones. This book is likely to generate lots of discussion among friends who like to debate or some deeper introspection about your own life's trajectory. Highly recommended!!"

As an undergraduate mathematics student, I was fascinated by the power of statistics and higher level mathematics to model and predict. Unfortunately, I never was introduced into its limitations ---- I don't remember them even being discussed.Taleb shows these limitations, and the way in which --- especially in the soft sciences of economics, finance, and psychology --- misuse of statistics or failure to understand the limitations of statistical methods can result in catastrophic results ---- namely via rare events with huge impacts arising well outside the possibilities predicted. In ""The Black Swan"", Taleb comes down especially hard upon economists, bankers, politicians, and journalists --- all of whom become enamored of methods they don't fully understand or short term thinking enabled by overreliance upon mathematical models unsuited for the dangerously random environment in which they work.This book should be required reading by every student of mathematics, economics, finance, or psychology in my opinion."
219,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237995-loyd,4,"No, it has nothing to do with the Natalie Portman movie. Researcher Nassim Nicholas Taleb's The Black Swan is a study of how unexpected, often tragic or shocking circumstances are the catalyst for positive change in the world. Here's the premise: an unexpected occurrence (like the discovery of an actual black swan in nature when none were thought to exist) jogs our thought processes, thus opening our eyes to a different future, for better or worse. I'm not sure every example in the book accurately supports the idea, but there is abundant proof that we constantly ""close the barn doors after the horse has escaped"" when it comes to national security, health scares, natural disasters, etc.In my mind The Black Swan ties to G.B. Shaw's quote: ""The reasonable man adapts himself to the conditions that surround him... The unreasonable man adapts surrounding conditions to himself... All progress depends on the unreasonable man.""We would like to think we don't have to be unreasonable—or victims of catastrophe—in order to progress. But the evidence might be against us."

Especially working at GoJek where a lot of people use vocabulary from this book. I'm a bit rebellious that way. About a week ago, I finally got to reading this. The Black Swan is definitely a perspective changing book introducing a lot of fresh, powerful ideas and discusses the nature of uncertainty and the limits of knowledge i.e the unknown unknowns. It explains why predicting the future is a fundamentally hard problem and why projects with long timelines have to grapple with the unknown unknowns. Especially when living in a world containing millions of independent-decision making actors. Two actionable strategies which I've found interesting from this book include keeping shorter timelines and the barbell investment strategy."

I already was of the same opinion as Talib – that people who make predictions in economics and social sciences, or believe in social engineering and shaping the history, are full of hot air. I’ve been through mathematically rigorous training on the theory of random processes myself, and I know how largely irrelevant it is even in engineering. Forget about finance and economics. And I always laugh at the commentators who act like they’re explaining the instantaneous movement of the stock market or oil prices. NASDAQ is down 11 points right now because blah blah blah. They know that they’re bullshitting, but they still keep on bullshitting. "

It was just after the 2008 crisis and I had a vague sense that every authority figure I’d ever listened to was completely full of shit.The Black Swan convinced that was basically the case and I would have to build my own models and understanding of how things actually worked. The Black Swan itself contributed a lot to that new model and is still a big part of how I see the world.Re-reading it was well worth it. I picked up a couple of things I didn’t catch the first time around like the distinction between grey swans and black swans and the notion of “Platonicity.”If you haven’t picked up anything by Taleb, I think Fooled by Randomness is the best entry point."

It discusses how rare events have high impacts and that we are controlled by them, calling these events the Black Swans. The way we consider historic data to make decisions and forecasts is highly vulnerable to both the factors we cannot predict, and the factors we cannot measure. I was heavily involved in forecasting techniques and building basic/advanced mathematical models for forecasting,, and believe me it was hard for me to use these techniques while having the black swan theory ringing all the time in my mind :)"

However, to me the book felt as an accusation of scientist/academics, who allegedly think too highly of themselves, ignore common sense and do research that is not useful in practice. In my perspective, that is a very exagorated, limited and unnuanced view of academia .

235,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7918888-michael,5,"Despite a few flaws and Taleb's characteristic and unapologetic meandering style, this was really good. All his books should be required reading for anyone in business, policy making, decision making, or breathing. I really enjoyed the discussion about empiricism vs rationalism, and their strengths and limitations. The concepts of extremistan vs mediocristan are very useful. He goes over falsification, the scientific method, the filtering effect on ancient processes, the problem of silent evidence, and a lot more. He discusses really well the phenomenon of why those who find cures are recognised and rewarded far more than those who find preventions, and how we should think about this (the answer is not to throw up our hands and say ""well what else can we do?""). I've always thought about these kinds of things, especially how someone who had implemented a policy of locked airline cabin doors on September 10, 2001 would never have been credited with saving 1000s of lives and preventing a long war, but would have actually prevented that nonetheless. I think we're often confused by the lack of empirical results of preventionism, so we give up. We need best practices, and robustness (aka antifragility), even when we can't show the results. We also can't be fooled by thinking that post-black swan fixes make us safe. Putting locks on cabin doors on September 12 would prevent another September 11 style takeover, but wouldn't prevent the next black swan. Locks are good, but feeling confident that we've fixed the problem is bad.Taleb talks about silent evidence, and naive empiricism, but I thought he should have covered (emphasised) beneficial empiricism, and when an argument from silence is valid, ie, when there's a lack of evidence when there shouldn't be (eg, finding no archaeological remains of a city in a particular place doesn't mean it's theoretically impossible that the place existed but was thoroughly and systematically erased, but its lack of evidence is so unexpected that we'd consider that to be a valid argument from silence that the place most probably didn't ever exist).Taleb's distinction of the 4 quadrants was also helpful, because it clarified when and how black swans are a problem.The other thing I really liked is the discussion about how some of the greatest scientific discoveries were serendipitous discoveries, not ones that the scientist planned to find. The trick is to put yourself in the path of good luck and not be too blinkered by your plan and projected outcomes, but be on the lookout for opportunities. I've found that some of the best opportunities in life and work have come when least expected and in a way that I could never have planned for. The trick isn't to plan to have a specific thing happen, but to put yourself in situations and frames of mind to recognise those opportunities. Sometimes from the outside this can look like wasted time because it's not following a specific plan, but it's very intentional. After a while people may wonder why you're so lucky, and it's hard to explain to them. You're no luckier than the next person, you're just more open to it and putting yourself in situations where more lucky things can find you, due to the laws of large numbers and probabilities.I'm not sure if this is a review anymore or a journal, but Taleb makes me think...."
236,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60222708-nati-s,5,"Philosophers talk about two types of reasoning: deduction and induction. In deductive reasoning the move from premises to conclusions is such that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In inductive reasoning, on the other hand, the conclusion follows from the premises not with necessity but only with probability. In a nutshell, this book is about the consequences confusing inductive reasoning for deductive reasoning and why the confusion occurs in the first place.Taleb states that probability is the mother of all abstractions. This is so because probability is a mode of thought/reasoning that attempts to capture uncertainty. Abstraction is sort of the construction of a mental model that represents reality in a general sense, such act requires a certain “amount”, or rather, “energy”. The mother abstraction, thus, being at the infinite limit, requires infinite cognitive energy. Hence, this particular abstraction is truly incomprehensible. To me this makes better sense when looked at via an example. Autistic individuals are not able to understand other’s emotions because they lack whatever is necessary to do that. This means such understanding is outside their mental scope, it’s something like sympathy-empathy abstraction that represents whatever allows this understanding. It is somewhat self-evident why said abstraction will not be comprehensible to these individuals. Somewhat similarly, all individuals are not able to comprehend uncertainty. There are two things needed in order for one to enjoy this book: curiosity and the ability to put aside, or rather be entertained by, the authors need to bash on academics and people associated with banks. I think it is beautifully written, insightful and humbling."
237,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2899659-guy,5,"I have just begun reading this, after it sat on my shelves for a bunch of years. I see immediately its importance and value both because of the points and quality of the writing — it has an irreverent humour I am enjoying — as well as having several immediate synchronicities with the Jordan B. Peterson lecture, The Maps of Knowledge, that I also just began listening to.Now I have finished it and have begun immediately to re-read it. This book is powerful and important and will likely have been and will continue to be totally ignored. Fascinating. A further review to follow my second read.And the second read was richly rewarding! Learned much more. And was quietly pleased that I made some observations about the nature of economics as does Taleb when I wrote my 'Economics Debunked' course several years ago.Taleb does a great job of comparing the way our officially accepted economic and social risk and growth measures and models are built within something akin to a two dimensional world oblivious to the reality of their existence being in a three or four dimensional one. He is astounded that such an obvious failure is not accepted. This made me smile because of something similar I observed with the great science of mathematics. For almost 2000 years Euclid's theorem about parallel lines was accepted as an ideal truth, despite the inability of mathematicians to prove it. In the end, it was finally accepted as only true in two dimensions. In three dimensions it is basically the foundation of navigational mathematics.Delusion knows no bounds, and is somehow always the other person's problem.I have twenty-plus yellow sticky flags in the book. One of them is a remarkable synchronicity with the psychologist Carl Jung, which occurred, as synchronicities tend to do, with my randomly, and for no obvious 'good' reason, picking up a Jung anthology for a quick glance even with my wanting to get back to Taleb. (Taleb doesn't mention Jung.) The synchronicity involves epistemology and the unpredictable nature of the soul and numbers. For Taleb it was about the unpredictability of history. Taleb wrote:First, when you spend a couple of decades doing mass-scale empirical work with data and taking risks based on such studies, you can easily spot elements in the texture of the world that the Platonified 'thinker' is too brainwashed, or too threatened, to see. Second, it allowed me to become formal and systematic in my thinking instead of wallowing in the anecdotal. Finally, both the philosophy of history and epistemology (the philosophy of knowledge) seemed inseparable from the empirical study of times series data, which is a succession of numbers instead of words. And numbers are easy to process on computers. Studying historical data makes you conscious that history runs forward, not backward, and that it is messier than the narrated accounts. Epistemology, the philosophy of history, and statistics aim at understanding truths, investigating the mechanisms that generate them, and separating regularity from the coincidental in historical matters. They all address the question of what one knows, except that all are to be found in different buildings, so to speak (p20).Jung: ""The moment one forms an idea of a thing and successfully catches one of its aspects, one invariably succumbs to the illusion having caught the whole"" (Jung, cited in DeLaszlo 
Basic Writings of C. G. Jung. Modern Library No. 300
 (p38). The delusion that mathematical modelling can be applied to the complexity of life is simply an extension of this idea. Like it was with the belief in Euclid's theorem against all evidence. Jung elaborates that if the first numbers came from a string of peas laid out, that that was easily grasped as the true meaning of number, but missed out that that simple idea, while true enough, missed the meta truth of the properties of numbers, such as odd and even and irrational and well the entire edifice of mathematics!Jung continues: One never considers that a total apprehension is right out of the question. Not even an idea that is posited as total is total, for it is still an entity on its own with unpredictable qualities. This self-deception certainly promotes peace of mind: the unknown is named, the far has been brought near, so that one can lay one's finger on it. One has taken possession of it, and it has become an inalienable piece of property, like a slain creature of the wild that can no longer run away. It is a magical procedure such as the primitive practices upon objects and the psychologist son the psyche. He is no longer at its mercy, but he never suspects that the very fact of grasping the object conceptually gives it a golden opportunity to display all those qualities which would never have made their appearance had it not been imprisoned in a concept (remember the numbers!) (p38-9).This is a true book: it challenges what you think you know, and asks you to begin to see the world as it is, not as we want it to be. I will read this again, because it has too much knowledge to be fully understood with even two readings."
238,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4643358-dimitris-hall,3,"This was a smart book. The author, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, is one of these guys you come across sometimes who are smartasses and they know it, are in love with that smartass prestige of theirs, and who you can't help but sit and listen to because they're so damn interesting. Sometimes their smartassiness goes a bit overboard, similar to the scratching of an itch that at first is satisfying but can easily hurt if you don't stop at the right moment. However, albeit barely, most of the time they keep it under control.I have to tell the truth. Most of the Black Swan was too technical for me, too difficult. I caught the main idea but at some point I just didn't know what I was reading anymore. I wonder if Taleb would have had a bigger impact with his book (and he did a big impact as far as I can tell) if he had made it easier to read for a broader audience. I have the impression that the more sophisticated an academic or a specialist is, the more resistant to books such as this he or she is, whereasAnyway, Taleb's idea, the whole topic of this book, is rather simple: life is full of Black Swan events, and...Sod it, I'll let Wikipedia do the talking for a sec:The phrase ""black swan"" derives from a Latin expression; its oldest known occurrence is the poet Juvenal's characterization of something being ""rara avis in terris nigroque simillima cygno"" (""a rare bird in the lands and very much like a black swan""; 6.165).[4] When the phrase was coined, the black swan was presumed not to exist.[...]Juvenal's phrase was a common expression in 16th century London as a statement of impossibility. The London expression derives from the Old World presumption that all swans must be white because all historical records of swans reported that they had white feathers.[5] In that context, a black swan was impossible or at least nonexistent. After Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh discovered black swans in Western Australia in 1697,[6] the term metamorphosed to connote that a perceived impossibility might later be disproven. Taleb notes that in the 19th century John Stuart Mill used the black swan logical fallacy as a new term to identify falsification.[7][...]Based on the author's criteria:1. The event is a surprise (to the observer).2. The event has a major effect.3. After the first recorded instance of the event, it is rationalized by hindsight, as if it could have been expected; that is, the relevant data were available but unaccounted for in risk mitigation programs. The same is true for the personal perception by individuals.[...]The theory was developed by Nassim Nicholas Taleb to explain:1. The disproportionate role of high-profile, hard-to-predict, and rare events that are beyond the realm of normal expectations in history, science, finance, and technology.2. The non-computability of the probability of the consequential rare events using scientific methods (owing to the very nature of small probabilities).3. The psychological biases that make people individually and collectively blind to uncertainty and unaware of the massive role of the rare event in historical affairs.Basically, we can't predict things. We think we can, but we can't, and they are the ones we are most vulnerable to. What do we have to do to make ourselves more robust to Black Swans? Be aware of them. And screw banksters and speculators, they're frauds. There, I just summarised the whole book!Don't give Black Swan a read if you're a bankster or speculator and want to preserve your so-called self-respect. Do give it a read if you believe that the world is much more complex than any model we can come up with, but be prepared to skim, skim, skim."
239,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5685608-john-jr,5,"What you don't know can hurt you: that's a truism, which means that, however familiar and easily forgotten it may be, what it says is true. It's not an adequate summary of Nassim Nicholas Taleb's book, but one gets a little closer by saying The Black Swan will tell you why it's true, how it's true, where it's true, and even, in passing, a few places where it's not true. An example from Taleb of where it's not true: If your wife is pregnant, you may not yet know the gender of the child, but there are only two possibilities, and in practice it can be determined (through amniocentesis or ultrasound), and the answer is relatively inconsequential, won't really hurt anyone--except possibly the child, who may be born into one of those cultures in which the killing of infant daughters is surreptitiously practiced. Taleb omits the infanticide note, but adding it is entirely in keeping with the spirit of his book, for he's forever reminding us that life in the modern world is more complex than we're apt to think. Here's an example of an unknown that does matter, which makes one of the fundamental points of Taleb's book: A turkey who has been fed every day for 1,000 days by a kind farmer knows what to expect, and for the turkey life is good--until day number 1,001, when the farmer shows up with an ax. That day is both unexpected and highly consequential--at least for the turkey, though not for the farmer--and it's the kind of thing Taleb calls a Black Swan event.One difference between Taleb's argument and what philosophers have long called the problem of induction (which is basically that 1,000 examples don't tell you for sure what the 1,001st will be) is this: unexpected and highly consequential things can happen (which even the philosophers recognize), but it matters where you stand. The ax-wielding farmer is a Black Swan event only for the turkey. Similarly, the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, were a Black Swan event for almost everybody else, but certainly not for the men who planned them. (In case you wonder about the title and the concept: Taleb explains in his opening paragraph that people in the Old World thought all swans were white until the discovery of Australia revealed to them that some swans are black.) What can we do? Answers permeate the book, but in a sense it boils down to this: be the smart guy, not the sucker (Taleb, an elegant writer who keeps his feet on the ground, isn't afraid to put it like that); when you don't have much choice, look for ways to limit the consequences.The turkey problem is hardly the whole of his book. Another of Taleb's points is that we construct stories after the fact that provide causes and explanations and allow us to believe after the fact that the unpredictable could've been predicted. (He doesn't waste much time, nor will I, on 9/11; the now-famous Presidential Daily Briefing that warned ""Bin Laden determined to attack in US"" counts for little, because it said nothing about how, when, and where, yet that's the kind of prediction we would've needed.) Taleb calls this retrospective storytelling the narrative fallacy, and if you haven't already noticed that historians, as well as the rest of us, repeatedly come up with differing ""explanations"" after the fact for what happened in the past, which you'd think would cast doubt on many of their explanations, you'll start noticing it. There's more, such as: what casinos have to do with uncertainty, and whether the U.S. military has paid any attention to Donald Rumsfeld's ""unknown unknowns"" (he's not named, but his term is), and what went wrong with the Sydney Opera House, and what the smart answer would've been when Alan Greenspan said the recent financial crisis couldn't have been foreseen because it had never happened before. Here's something to try: estimate the answers, read the book, and see if you were right. Prediction is hard, even about knowable things, and humans, by nature, aren't very good at it.If you want a label, The Black Swan is an extended argument for what Taleb calls skeptical empiricism. It's also maybe the most entertaining and useful erudite book that I've ever read. Umberto Eco's erudite novel Foucault's Pendulum will teach you to be careful with stories you make up; it's vastly entertaining but maybe not that useful (except as a warning about what the crazies might do). Taleb goes farther, warning us repeatedly against the stories (and theories and financial models) that others make up, and giving me, among other things, ideas for reworking my financial plan. And there's nothing wrong with a book that inspires one to read more books. This one has left me wanting to read Montaigne (again), and Seneca, and Karl Popper, and Friedrich Hayek, and Keynes, and Poincaré. In a way, the statue on the campus in Animal House had it right: Knowledge is good, if it helps you be the smart guy."

It is a well written book that presents brilliant ideas. I could have done without the author's snide comments and condescending tone but if you can get past that the content of this book is insightful, well organized, and incredibly captivating. You won't see the world the same way once you're done with this ground breaking book. "

242,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4969387-john,5,"It’s books like this that make me feel justified in giving other very good books a 4 or 4.5 stars. For large sections, this book felt like a 6. I had to read slowly. It took time to process, digest and try to apply all that Taleb had to say. Some sections I spent as much time staring out the window as I did actually reading words on the paper. I limited myself in the number of pages I read in a day in hope that spreading it out would help me process is more.  Chapter 6, The Narrative Fallacy, was mind-blowing. The mind’s desperate hunger for narrative is not a new idea to me. It is one I have read before (The Storytelling Animal by Jonathan Gottschall was a great read on the idea). But Taleb drove it home, and showed how deeply it affects our thinking. A couple of quotes from it:P66 “Our propensity to impose meaning and concepts blocks our awareness of the details making up the concepts.” We no longer see what exists, but see our interpretations. P69 “The same condition that makes us simplify (how we see the world) pushes us to think that the world is less random than it actually is.” To save “space” in our brains, we simplify. That simplification produces profound blindness to uncommon events. It was just in the news today that there were reports of another police shooting in Baltimore, a cold-blooded shooting of someone in the back. Multiple witnesses spoke with conviction that they saw it. But it turns out it never happened. Some noise sounded like a gun (it might have been one), just the perceived victim fell to the ground, all while police were pointing their guns at him. Thus people were convinced they saw a shooting. An extreme case, but a great example of how our brain strains and simplifies what it sees all the time.  The author did not talk about this, but the need for a narrative is why politicians give examples of a specific person to tell a story. Instead of talking about how a new factory in town created 200 new jobs, they will say something like, “Look at Jane Doe, hard-working mother of 2. Thanks to her new job at the factory, she is able to help her oldest daughter become the first family member to attend law school.” The narrative brings is home. Another politically related take away for me was how America is stuck with a two party political system. Taleb talks about how a winner-takes-all competition leads to larger inequalities. No other parties can gain a foothold in the country because of the current winner-take-all format. If a party gaining 10% of the vote was given 10% representation, Democrats and Republicans would quickly change (adapt) or become dinosaurs. Another deeply enlightening concept was the information about how poorly humans estimate odds. The studies about how estimating odds changes when you are given a cause for what you are supposed to predict, was particularly insightful. Our ability to predict what will happen is the cornerstone of our species. But also it’s our Achilles heel. We blind ourselves by not seeing all that could happen. Another great quote: “We have a natural tendency to listen to the expert, even in fields where there may be no experts.” P189. People who know the most are not always “experts!” Art, music, and pop culture are all fields this applies to. And perhaps weather forecasting. I felt challenged to think about what I accept as the narrative of History as it was taught to me. Reconstructing the past is much, much, much harder than we think it is. Again, the narrative idea works against us. It’s easy to simplify, but dangerous. It leaves a lot out, and gives a false impression that since the past narrative is obvious, the present and future should be too.  I can’t say enough good things about this book. Read it! "
243,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15639925-t-nu-vahtra,4,"""Science is about how not to be a sucker."" “Prediction, not narration, is the real test of our understanding of the world.”I was not too much impressed by ""Antifragile"" and I liked ""Skin in the game"" even less, but this book is among the earlier of Taleb's books while he was still ""less angry"" and the style of the writing did not spoil the message (the style was still quite arrogant to say the least). Mainly the book provokes you towards more critical thinking, the enemy number one in this one is the Gaussian distribution (which is not relevant for black swan events) and anyone claiming that they have the theories and knowledge to ""handle"" black swan events VS just trying to acknowledge them and limit the maximum negative exposure. There is also quite a lot of praise for Kahneman here while I know thought leaders who disagree with both Taleb and Kahneman in most things. At times it felt that the same message could have been conveyed with less words and repetition from different angles but maybe such approach is inevitable for ""influencers"". “Missing a train is only painful if you run after it! Likewise, not matching the idea of success others expect from you is only painful if that’s what you are seeking.”“When you develop your opinions on the basis of weak evidence, you will have difficulty interpreting subsequent information that contradicts these opinions, even if this new information is obviously more accurate.”“The problem with experts is that they do not know what they do not know”“I propose that if you want a simple step to a higher form of life, as distant from the animal as you can get, then you may have to denarrate, that is, shut down the television set, minimize time spent reading newspapers, ignore the blogs. Train your reasoning abilities to control your decisions; nudge System 1 (the heuristic or experiential system) out of the important ones. Train yourself to spot the difference between the sensational and the empirical. This insulation from the toxicity of the world will have an additional benefit: it will improve your well-being.”“The strategy for the discoverers and entrepreneurs is to rely less on top-down planning and focus on maximum tinkering and recognizing opportunities when they present themselves. So I disagree with the followers of Marx and those of Adam Smith: the reason free markets work is because they allow people to be lucky, thanks to aggressive trial and error, not by giving rewards or “incentives” for skill. The strategy is, then, to tinker as much as possible and try to collect as many Black Swan opportunities as you can.”“Consider a turkey that is fed every day. Every single feeding will firm up the bird’s belief that it is the general rule of life to be fed every day by friendly members of the human race “looking out for its best interests,” as a politician would say. On the afternoon of the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, something unexpected will happen to the turkey. It will incur a revision of belief.”“Read books are far less valuable than unread ones. The library should contain as much of what you do not know as your financial means, mortgage rates, and the currently tight real-estate market allow you to put there.”"
244,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82093-todd,4,"The Black SwanThis is one of those “must read” books that many more people will claim to have read than will actually slog through. Like with Fooled by Randomness, Taleb takes many more pages than necessary to get his important points across. Those points are that we have incredibly poor skills at estimating extreme events, we regularly abuse historical statistics in ways that set us up to fail miserably, and we should have a great distrust of most planning processes. The ultimate message is positive, however, since there are general guidelines on how we can do better (set yourself up for good extreme events while protecting the downside). The style will either excite or turn off the reader. 90% of the parenthetical phrases and footnotes add little except Taleb’s (often snarky) editorials. Traders are sometimes described as people for whom the only thing worse than losing money themselves, is watching others make money. Taleb writes as if the only thing worse than him not getting adequate attention for his ideas is watching others get lauded. He clearly wants this book to be considered scholarly as he has 19 pages of notes and a 28 page bibliography designed to demonstrate the depth of his own reading. Segmenting the personal prose from its academic foundation may have the effect of improving the accessibility to the ideas within, but the reader should be cautioned. Any author who, in the acknowledgements, states “…[the book] just wrote itself,” and then thanks his editor for protecting him from “the intrusions of the standardizing editors,” has probably produced a verbose, tangent driven effort rather than the perfect prose he imagines.If the style excites you, great. If it turns you off, try to work through it. The world is full of decision makers who rely on experts, statistics and intricate models that are built on soft sand. The risks they take affect all of us, and while this behavior will probably never stop, we can take steps to minimize the impact of their folly. Anyone who has been visited by a negative Black Swan will understand this implicitly. For the rest of us, the cost of this book will be a much lower tuition than we might have to pay learning the lessons first hand."
245,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30590986-laurent-michiels,4,"Idea 5 stars, style 2 stars.I am following Taleb for c. 5 years now, and his ideas, including the Black Swan-concept, have contributed significantly to how I view the world.A Black Swan is an event which is rare, has an extreme impact and is predictable in retrospect. Our problem is that we tend to be blind with respect to incomplete information and the unknown, and particularly to the large deviations. Yet, knowing the concept of Black Swan is one thing; leveraging on it is another. Acknowledging that we don't know what we don't know, it does not make sense to precisely predict Black Swans. Instead we should accept uncertainties and invest in preparedness. Taleb urges us to be aggressive when we can gain exposure to positive Black Swans and very conservative (i.e. prevention over treatment) when we are under threat from a negative Black Swan. Obviously, this holds for all nonlinear events, both predictable and unpredictable.But reader beware! I have mixed feelings with this book. As I similarly experienced with his other books (e.g. Skin in the Game), Taleb's writing style is often dismissive, unstructured, yet entertaining at times. Also, I think you can easily skip or skim through many (repetitive, off-topic, etc.) chapters to still grasp the main ideas.I picked up this book again in quarantine during the COVID-19 lockdown. Importantly however, Taleb called the COVID-19 pandemic a white swan as he deems it wholly predictable and thus can not be used as an excuse for our unpreparedness. I think this is especially true concerning the outbreak in Western countries (months after China)."
246,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4749980-jeroen-kraan,1,"Very nearly got to the end of part one, but then it just became too stupid. As others have pointed out, Taleb is an absolutely insufferable author. His arrogance and disrespect for others probably makes him the second least likable writer after Richard Dawkins.But this is not just a matter of personality. While there are some glimmers of insight in this book, they are covered by a thick layer of confused logic. I finally gave up reading the book when Taleb used two fictional characters' answers to a thought experiment to point out that people who think scientifically are less likely to be succesful in life than the good ol' Plumber Joe type who may not have the IQ on paper but has street smarts. ""Have you ever wondered why so many of these straight-A students end up going nowhere in life while someone who lagged behind is now getting the shekels, buying diamonds, and getting his phone calls returned?"", he asks. The assertion is not just incredible and unfounded (when was the last time someone without a traditional education became president?), but the assertion comes directly after a screed blasting people for giving in to confirmation bias, seeing a narrative where there is none and generally making assumptions without using the proper data.On top of all that, the editing is sloppier than what you might find in most self-published erotic fiction. Seriously, enough with the supposedly witty asides already. Someone with a really good pair of scissors could have turned this 400-page book into a really clever 10-page New Yorker essay."

""The first step to wisdom is knowing what we don't know"" may sound like a line from the 1970s TV show ""Kung Fu,"" but it is an important theme in NNT's book. It's hard for me (being a product of an MBA program where we learned to look at everything as a bell curve) to fully embrace his ideas, but I feel a better man for knowing his views. Uncertainty is a big part of my job as a financial advisor (fee only, no commissions) and NNT's perspectives are useful in my work. Taken to the extreme, one may feel that all life is in vain; I don't think he'd agree with that, but he does say very clearly that our lives are not the linear, well-planned stories that our personal histories might suggest. There is something about the human mind that craves the simple, logical narrative, whether it be about the history of nations or of a person. NNT accepts this craving, but then explains really what happens in life - we are more a product of the rare and unexpected events (cancer, early death of parent, etc.) in our lives than the planned ones. This book is likely to generate lots of discussion among friends who like to debate or some deeper introspection about your own life's trajectory. Highly recommended!!"
248,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9496879-michael-o-brien,5,"This is one of the most outstanding books I've read in a long time. As an undergraduate mathematics student, I was fascinated by the power of statistics and higher level mathematics to model and predict. Unfortunately, I never was introduced into its limitations ---- I don't remember them even being discussed.Taleb shows these limitations, and the way in which --- especially in the soft sciences of economics, finance, and psychology --- misuse of statistics or failure to understand the limitations of statistical methods can result in catastrophic results ---- namely via rare events with huge impacts arising well outside the possibilities predicted. In ""The Black Swan"", Taleb comes down especially hard upon economists, bankers, politicians, and journalists --- all of whom become enamored of methods they don't fully understand or short term thinking enabled by overreliance upon mathematical models unsuited for the dangerously random environment in which they work.This book should be required reading by every student of mathematics, economics, finance, or psychology in my opinion."
249,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237995-loyd,4,"No, it has nothing to do with the Natalie Portman movie. Researcher Nassim Nicholas Taleb's The Black Swan is a study of how unexpected, often tragic or shocking circumstances are the catalyst for positive change in the world. Here's the premise: an unexpected occurrence (like the discovery of an actual black swan in nature when none were thought to exist) jogs our thought processes, thus opening our eyes to a different future, for better or worse. I'm not sure every example in the book accurately supports the idea, but there is abundant proof that we constantly ""close the barn doors after the horse has escaped"" when it comes to national security, health scares, natural disasters, etc.In my mind The Black Swan ties to G.B. Shaw's quote: ""The reasonable man adapts himself to the conditions that surround him... The unreasonable man adapts surrounding conditions to himself... All progress depends on the unreasonable man.""We would like to think we don't have to be unreasonable—or victims of catastrophe—in order to progress. But the evidence might be against us."

The Black Swan is definitely a perspective changing book introducing a lot of fresh, powerful ideas and discusses the nature of uncertainty and the limits of knowledge i.e the unknown unknowns. It explains why predicting the future is a fundamentally hard problem and why projects with long timelines have to grapple with the unknown unknowns. Especially when living in a world containing millions of independent-decision making actors. Two actionable strategies which I've found interesting from this book include keeping shorter timelines and the barbell investment strategy."

I already was of the same opinion as Talib – that people who make predictions in economics and social sciences, or believe in social engineering and shaping the history, are full of hot air. I’ve been through mathematically rigorous training on the theory of random processes myself, and I know how largely irrelevant it is even in engineering. Forget about finance and economics. And I always laugh at the commentators who act like they’re explaining the instantaneous movement of the stock market or oil prices. NASDAQ is down 11 points right now because blah blah blah. They know that they’re bullshitting, but they still keep on bullshitting. "

It was just after the 2008 crisis and I had a vague sense that every authority figure I’d ever listened to was completely full of shit.The Black Swan convinced that was basically the case and I would have to build my own models and understanding of how things actually worked. The Black Swan itself contributed a lot to that new model and is still a big part of how I see the world.Re-reading it was well worth it. I picked up a couple of things I didn’t catch the first time around like the distinction between grey swans and black swans and the notion of “Platonicity.”If you haven’t picked up anything by Taleb, I think Fooled by Randomness is the best entry point."

It discusses how rare events have high impacts and that we are controlled by them, calling these events the Black Swans. The way we consider historic data to make decisions and forecasts is highly vulnerable to both the factors we cannot predict, and the factors we cannot measure. I was heavily involved in forecasting techniques and building basic/advanced mathematical models for forecasting,, and believe me it was hard for me to use these techniques while having the black swan theory ringing all the time in my mind :)"

However, to me the book felt as an accusation of scientist/academics, who allegedly think too highly of themselves, ignore common sense and do research that is not useful in practice. In my perspective, that is a very exagorated, limited and unnuanced view of academia .

All his books should be required reading for anyone in business, policy making, decision making, or breathing. I really enjoyed the discussion about empiricism vs rationalism, and their strengths and limitations. The concepts of extremistan vs mediocristan are very useful. He goes over falsification, the scientific method, the filtering effect on ancient processes, the problem of silent evidence, and a lot more. He discusses really well the phenomenon of why those who find cures are recognised and rewarded far more than those who find preventions, and how we should think about this (the answer is not to throw up our hands and say ""well what else can we do?""). I've always thought about these kinds of things, especially how someone who had implemented a policy of locked airline cabin doors on September 10, 2001 would never have been credited with saving 1000s of lives and preventing a long war, but would have actually prevented that nonetheless. I think we're often confused by the lack of empirical results of preventionism, so we give up. We need best practices, and robustness (aka antifragility), even when we can't show the results. We also can't be fooled by thinking that post-black swan fixes make us safe. Putting locks on cabin doors on September 12 would prevent another September 11 style takeover, but wouldn't prevent the next black swan. Locks are good, but feeling confident that we've fixed the problem is bad.Taleb talks about silent evidence, and naive empiricism, but I thought he should have covered (emphasised) beneficial empiricism, and when an argument from silence is valid, ie, when there's a lack of evidence when there shouldn't be (eg, finding no archaeological remains of a city in a particular place doesn't mean it's theoretically impossible that the place existed but was thoroughly and systematically erased, but its lack of evidence is so unexpected that we'd consider that to be a valid argument from silence that the place most probably didn't ever exist).Taleb's distinction of the 4 quadrants was also helpful, because it clarified when and how black swans are a problem.The other thing I really liked is the discussion about how some of the greatest scientific discoveries were serendipitous discoveries, not ones that the scientist planned to find. The trick is to put yourself in the path of good luck and not be too blinkered by your plan and projected outcomes, but be on the lookout for opportunities. I've found that some of the best opportunities in life and work have come when least expected and in a way that I could never have planned for. The trick isn't to plan to have a specific thing happen, but to put yourself in situations and frames of mind to recognise those opportunities. Sometimes from the outside this can look like wasted time because it's not following a specific plan, but it's very intentional. After a while people may wonder why you're so lucky, and it's hard to explain to them. You're no luckier than the next person, you're just more open to it and putting yourself in situations where more lucky things can find you, due to the laws of large numbers and probabilities.I'm not sure if this is a review anymore or a journal, but Taleb makes me think...."
266,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60222708-nati-s,5,"Philosophers talk about two types of reasoning: deduction and induction. In deductive reasoning the move from premises to conclusions is such that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In inductive reasoning, on the other hand, the conclusion follows from the premises not with necessity but only with probability. In a nutshell, this book is about the consequences confusing inductive reasoning for deductive reasoning and why the confusion occurs in the first place.Taleb states that probability is the mother of all abstractions. This is so because probability is a mode of thought/reasoning that attempts to capture uncertainty. Abstraction is sort of the construction of a mental model that represents reality in a general sense, such act requires a certain “amount”, or rather, “energy”. The mother abstraction, thus, being at the infinite limit, requires infinite cognitive energy. Hence, this particular abstraction is truly incomprehensible. To me this makes better sense when looked at via an example. Autistic individuals are not able to understand other’s emotions because they lack whatever is necessary to do that. This means such understanding is outside their mental scope, it’s something like sympathy-empathy abstraction that represents whatever allows this understanding. It is somewhat self-evident why said abstraction will not be comprehensible to these individuals. Somewhat similarly, all individuals are not able to comprehend uncertainty. There are two things needed in order for one to enjoy this book: curiosity and the ability to put aside, or rather be entertained by, the authors need to bash on academics and people associated with banks. I think it is beautifully written, insightful and humbling."

And was quietly pleased that I made some observations about the nature of economics as does Taleb when I wrote my 'Economics Debunked' course several years ago.Taleb does a great job of comparing the way our officially accepted economic and social risk and growth measures and models are built within something akin to a two dimensional world oblivious to the reality of their existence being in a three or four dimensional one. He is astounded that such an obvious failure is not accepted. This made me smile because of something similar I observed with the great science of mathematics. For almost 2000 years Euclid's theorem about parallel lines was accepted as an ideal truth, despite the inability of mathematicians to prove it. In the end, it was finally accepted as only true in two dimensions. In three dimensions it is basically the foundation of navigational mathematics.Delusion knows no bounds, and is somehow always the other person's problem.I have twenty-plus yellow sticky flags in the book. One of them is a remarkable synchronicity with the psychologist Carl Jung, which occurred, as synchronicities tend to do, with my randomly, and for no obvious 'good' reason, picking up a Jung anthology for a quick glance even with my wanting to get back to Taleb. (Taleb doesn't mention Jung.) The synchronicity involves epistemology and the unpredictable nature of the soul and numbers. For Taleb it was about the unpredictability of history. Taleb wrote:First, when you spend a couple of decades doing mass-scale empirical work with data and taking risks based on such studies, you can easily spot elements in the texture of the world that the Platonified 'thinker' is too brainwashed, or too threatened, to see. Second, it allowed me to become formal and systematic in my thinking instead of wallowing in the anecdotal. Finally, both the philosophy of history and epistemology (the philosophy of knowledge) seemed inseparable from the empirical study of times series data, which is a succession of numbers instead of words. And numbers are easy to process on computers. Studying historical data makes you conscious that history runs forward, not backward, and that it is messier than the narrated accounts. Epistemology, the philosophy of history, and statistics aim at understanding truths, investigating the mechanisms that generate them, and separating regularity from the coincidental in historical matters. They all address the question of what one knows, except that all are to be found in different buildings, so to speak (p20).Jung: ""The moment one forms an idea of a thing and successfully catches one of its aspects, one invariably succumbs to the illusion having caught the whole"" (Jung, cited in DeLaszlo 
Basic Writings of C. G. Jung. Modern Library No. 300
 (p38). The delusion that mathematical modelling can be applied to the complexity of life is simply an extension of this idea. Like it was with the belief in Euclid's theorem against all evidence. Jung elaborates that if the first numbers came from a string of peas laid out, that that was easily grasped as the true meaning of number, but missed out that that simple idea, while true enough, missed the meta truth of the properties of numbers, such as odd and even and irrational and well the entire edifice of mathematics!Jung continues: One never considers that a total apprehension is right out of the question. Not even an idea that is posited as total is total, for it is still an entity on its own with unpredictable qualities. This self-deception certainly promotes peace of mind: the unknown is named, the far has been brought near, so that one can lay one's finger on it. One has taken possession of it, and it has become an inalienable piece of property, like a slain creature of the wild that can no longer run away. It is a magical procedure such as the primitive practices upon objects and the psychologist son the psyche. He is no longer at its mercy, but he never suspects that the very fact of grasping the object conceptually gives it a golden opportunity to display all those qualities which would never have made their appearance had it not been imprisoned in a concept (remember the numbers!) (p38-9).This is a true book: it challenges what you think you know, and asks you to begin to see the world as it is, not as we want it to be. I will read this again, because it has too much knowledge to be fully understood with even two readings."
268,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4643358-dimitris-hall,3,"This was a smart book. The author, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, is one of these guys you come across sometimes who are smartasses and they know it, are in love with that smartass prestige of theirs, and who you can't help but sit and listen to because they're so damn interesting. Sometimes their smartassiness goes a bit overboard, similar to the scratching of an itch that at first is satisfying but can easily hurt if you don't stop at the right moment. However, albeit barely, most of the time they keep it under control.I have to tell the truth. Most of the Black Swan was too technical for me, too difficult. I caught the main idea but at some point I just didn't know what I was reading anymore. I wonder if Taleb would have had a bigger impact with his book (and he did a big impact as far as I can tell) if he had made it easier to read for a broader audience. I have the impression that the more sophisticated an academic or a specialist is, the more resistant to books such as this he or she is, whereasAnyway, Taleb's idea, the whole topic of this book, is rather simple: life is full of Black Swan events, and...Sod it, I'll let Wikipedia do the talking for a sec:The phrase ""black swan"" derives from a Latin expression; its oldest known occurrence is the poet Juvenal's characterization of something being ""rara avis in terris nigroque simillima cygno"" (""a rare bird in the lands and very much like a black swan""; 6.165).[4] When the phrase was coined, the black swan was presumed not to exist.[...]Juvenal's phrase was a common expression in 16th century London as a statement of impossibility. The London expression derives from the Old World presumption that all swans must be white because all historical records of swans reported that they had white feathers.[5] In that context, a black swan was impossible or at least nonexistent. After Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh discovered black swans in Western Australia in 1697,[6] the term metamorphosed to connote that a perceived impossibility might later be disproven. Taleb notes that in the 19th century John Stuart Mill used the black swan logical fallacy as a new term to identify falsification.[7][...]Based on the author's criteria:1. The event is a surprise (to the observer).2. The event has a major effect.3. After the first recorded instance of the event, it is rationalized by hindsight, as if it could have been expected; that is, the relevant data were available but unaccounted for in risk mitigation programs. The same is true for the personal perception by individuals.[...]The theory was developed by Nassim Nicholas Taleb to explain:1. The disproportionate role of high-profile, hard-to-predict, and rare events that are beyond the realm of normal expectations in history, science, finance, and technology.2. The non-computability of the probability of the consequential rare events using scientific methods (owing to the very nature of small probabilities).3. The psychological biases that make people individually and collectively blind to uncertainty and unaware of the massive role of the rare event in historical affairs.Basically, we can't predict things. We think we can, but we can't, and they are the ones we are most vulnerable to. What do we have to do to make ourselves more robust to Black Swans? Be aware of them. And screw banksters and speculators, they're frauds. There, I just summarised the whole book!Don't give Black Swan a read if you're a bankster or speculator and want to preserve your so-called self-respect. Do give it a read if you believe that the world is much more complex than any model we can come up with, but be prepared to skim, skim, skim."
269,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5685608-john-jr,5,"What you don't know can hurt you: that's a truism, which means that, however familiar and easily forgotten it may be, what it says is true. It's not an adequate summary of Nassim Nicholas Taleb's book, but one gets a little closer by saying The Black Swan will tell you why it's true, how it's true, where it's true, and even, in passing, a few places where it's not true. An example from Taleb of where it's not true: If your wife is pregnant, you may not yet know the gender of the child, but there are only two possibilities, and in practice it can be determined (through amniocentesis or ultrasound), and the answer is relatively inconsequential, won't really hurt anyone--except possibly the child, who may be born into one of those cultures in which the killing of infant daughters is surreptitiously practiced. Taleb omits the infanticide note, but adding it is entirely in keeping with the spirit of his book, for he's forever reminding us that life in the modern world is more complex than we're apt to think. Here's an example of an unknown that does matter, which makes one of the fundamental points of Taleb's book: A turkey who has been fed every day for 1,000 days by a kind farmer knows what to expect, and for the turkey life is good--until day number 1,001, when the farmer shows up with an ax. That day is both unexpected and highly consequential--at least for the turkey, though not for the farmer--and it's the kind of thing Taleb calls a Black Swan event.One difference between Taleb's argument and what philosophers have long called the problem of induction (which is basically that 1,000 examples don't tell you for sure what the 1,001st will be) is this: unexpected and highly consequential things can happen (which even the philosophers recognize), but it matters where you stand. The ax-wielding farmer is a Black Swan event only for the turkey. Similarly, the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, were a Black Swan event for almost everybody else, but certainly not for the men who planned them. (In case you wonder about the title and the concept: Taleb explains in his opening paragraph that people in the Old World thought all swans were white until the discovery of Australia revealed to them that some swans are black.) What can we do? Answers permeate the book, but in a sense it boils down to this: be the smart guy, not the sucker (Taleb, an elegant writer who keeps his feet on the ground, isn't afraid to put it like that); when you don't have much choice, look for ways to limit the consequences.The turkey problem is hardly the whole of his book. Another of Taleb's points is that we construct stories after the fact that provide causes and explanations and allow us to believe after the fact that the unpredictable could've been predicted. (He doesn't waste much time, nor will I, on 9/11; the now-famous Presidential Daily Briefing that warned ""Bin Laden determined to attack in US"" counts for little, because it said nothing about how, when, and where, yet that's the kind of prediction we would've needed.) Taleb calls this retrospective storytelling the narrative fallacy, and if you haven't already noticed that historians, as well as the rest of us, repeatedly come up with differing ""explanations"" after the fact for what happened in the past, which you'd think would cast doubt on many of their explanations, you'll start noticing it. There's more, such as: what casinos have to do with uncertainty, and whether the U.S. military has paid any attention to Donald Rumsfeld's ""unknown unknowns"" (he's not named, but his term is), and what went wrong with the Sydney Opera House, and what the smart answer would've been when Alan Greenspan said the recent financial crisis couldn't have been foreseen because it had never happened before. Here's something to try: estimate the answers, read the book, and see if you were right. Prediction is hard, even about knowable things, and humans, by nature, aren't very good at it.If you want a label, The Black Swan is an extended argument for what Taleb calls skeptical empiricism. It's also maybe the most entertaining and useful erudite book that I've ever read. Umberto Eco's erudite novel Foucault's Pendulum will teach you to be careful with stories you make up; it's vastly entertaining but maybe not that useful (except as a warning about what the crazies might do). Taleb goes farther, warning us repeatedly against the stories (and theories and financial models) that others make up, and giving me, among other things, ideas for reworking my financial plan. And there's nothing wrong with a book that inspires one to read more books. This one has left me wanting to read Montaigne (again), and Seneca, and Karl Popper, and Friedrich Hayek, and Keynes, and Poincaré. In a way, the statue on the campus in Animal House had it right: Knowledge is good, if it helps you be the smart guy."
270,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10931405-ardyn,4,"This book finally spoke to some of the concerns I've had about what I've learned in business school. It is a well written book that presents brilliant ideas. I could have done without the author's snide comments and condescending tone but if you can get past that the content of this book is insightful, well organized, and incredibly captivating. You won't see the world the same way once you're done with this ground breaking book. "
271,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43781060-anthony-degleris,3,"Great ideas throughout this book. Unfortunately the author is a prick, a mediocre philosopher, and a hypocrite throughout his unorganized tirade."
272,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4969387-john,5,"It’s books like this that make me feel justified in giving other very good books a 4 or 4.5 stars. For large sections, this book felt like a 6. I had to read slowly. It took time to process, digest and try to apply all that Taleb had to say. Some sections I spent as much time staring out the window as I did actually reading words on the paper. I limited myself in the number of pages I read in a day in hope that spreading it out would help me process is more.  Chapter 6, The Narrative Fallacy, was mind-blowing. The mind’s desperate hunger for narrative is not a new idea to me. It is one I have read before (The Storytelling Animal by Jonathan Gottschall was a great read on the idea). But Taleb drove it home, and showed how deeply it affects our thinking. A couple of quotes from it:P66 “Our propensity to impose meaning and concepts blocks our awareness of the details making up the concepts.” We no longer see what exists, but see our interpretations. P69 “The same condition that makes us simplify (how we see the world) pushes us to think that the world is less random than it actually is.” To save “space” in our brains, we simplify. That simplification produces profound blindness to uncommon events. It was just in the news today that there were reports of another police shooting in Baltimore, a cold-blooded shooting of someone in the back. Multiple witnesses spoke with conviction that they saw it. But it turns out it never happened. Some noise sounded like a gun (it might have been one), just the perceived victim fell to the ground, all while police were pointing their guns at him. Thus people were convinced they saw a shooting. An extreme case, but a great example of how our brain strains and simplifies what it sees all the time.  The author did not talk about this, but the need for a narrative is why politicians give examples of a specific person to tell a story. Instead of talking about how a new factory in town created 200 new jobs, they will say something like, “Look at Jane Doe, hard-working mother of 2. Thanks to her new job at the factory, she is able to help her oldest daughter become the first family member to attend law school.” The narrative brings is home. Another politically related take away for me was how America is stuck with a two party political system. Taleb talks about how a winner-takes-all competition leads to larger inequalities. No other parties can gain a foothold in the country because of the current winner-take-all format. If a party gaining 10% of the vote was given 10% representation, Democrats and Republicans would quickly change (adapt) or become dinosaurs. Another deeply enlightening concept was the information about how poorly humans estimate odds. The studies about how estimating odds changes when you are given a cause for what you are supposed to predict, was particularly insightful. Our ability to predict what will happen is the cornerstone of our species. But also it’s our Achilles heel. We blind ourselves by not seeing all that could happen. Another great quote: “We have a natural tendency to listen to the expert, even in fields where there may be no experts.” P189. People who know the most are not always “experts!” Art, music, and pop culture are all fields this applies to. And perhaps weather forecasting. I felt challenged to think about what I accept as the narrative of History as it was taught to me. Reconstructing the past is much, much, much harder than we think it is. Again, the narrative idea works against us. It’s easy to simplify, but dangerous. It leaves a lot out, and gives a false impression that since the past narrative is obvious, the present and future should be too.  I can’t say enough good things about this book. Read it! "
273,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15639925-t-nu-vahtra,4,"""Science is about how not to be a sucker."" “Prediction, not narration, is the real test of our understanding of the world.”I was not too much impressed by ""Antifragile"" and I liked ""Skin in the game"" even less, but this book is among the earlier of Taleb's books while he was still ""less angry"" and the style of the writing did not spoil the message (the style was still quite arrogant to say the least). Mainly the book provokes you towards more critical thinking, the enemy number one in this one is the Gaussian distribution (which is not relevant for black swan events) and anyone claiming that they have the theories and knowledge to ""handle"" black swan events VS just trying to acknowledge them and limit the maximum negative exposure. There is also quite a lot of praise for Kahneman here while I know thought leaders who disagree with both Taleb and Kahneman in most things. At times it felt that the same message could have been conveyed with less words and repetition from different angles but maybe such approach is inevitable for ""influencers"". “Missing a train is only painful if you run after it! Likewise, not matching the idea of success others expect from you is only painful if that’s what you are seeking.”“When you develop your opinions on the basis of weak evidence, you will have difficulty interpreting subsequent information that contradicts these opinions, even if this new information is obviously more accurate.”“The problem with experts is that they do not know what they do not know”“I propose that if you want a simple step to a higher form of life, as distant from the animal as you can get, then you may have to denarrate, that is, shut down the television set, minimize time spent reading newspapers, ignore the blogs. Train your reasoning abilities to control your decisions; nudge System 1 (the heuristic or experiential system) out of the important ones. Train yourself to spot the difference between the sensational and the empirical. This insulation from the toxicity of the world will have an additional benefit: it will improve your well-being.”“The strategy for the discoverers and entrepreneurs is to rely less on top-down planning and focus on maximum tinkering and recognizing opportunities when they present themselves. So I disagree with the followers of Marx and those of Adam Smith: the reason free markets work is because they allow people to be lucky, thanks to aggressive trial and error, not by giving rewards or “incentives” for skill. The strategy is, then, to tinker as much as possible and try to collect as many Black Swan opportunities as you can.”“Consider a turkey that is fed every day. Every single feeding will firm up the bird’s belief that it is the general rule of life to be fed every day by friendly members of the human race “looking out for its best interests,” as a politician would say. On the afternoon of the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, something unexpected will happen to the turkey. It will incur a revision of belief.”“Read books are far less valuable than unread ones. The library should contain as much of what you do not know as your financial means, mortgage rates, and the currently tight real-estate market allow you to put there.”"
274,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82093-todd,4,"The Black SwanThis is one of those “must read” books that many more people will claim to have read than will actually slog through. Like with Fooled by Randomness, Taleb takes many more pages than necessary to get his important points across. Those points are that we have incredibly poor skills at estimating extreme events, we regularly abuse historical statistics in ways that set us up to fail miserably, and we should have a great distrust of most planning processes. The ultimate message is positive, however, since there are general guidelines on how we can do better (set yourself up for good extreme events while protecting the downside). The style will either excite or turn off the reader. 90% of the parenthetical phrases and footnotes add little except Taleb’s (often snarky) editorials. Traders are sometimes described as people for whom the only thing worse than losing money themselves, is watching others make money. Taleb writes as if the only thing worse than him not getting adequate attention for his ideas is watching others get lauded. He clearly wants this book to be considered scholarly as he has 19 pages of notes and a 28 page bibliography designed to demonstrate the depth of his own reading. Segmenting the personal prose from its academic foundation may have the effect of improving the accessibility to the ideas within, but the reader should be cautioned. Any author who, in the acknowledgements, states “…[the book] just wrote itself,” and then thanks his editor for protecting him from “the intrusions of the standardizing editors,” has probably produced a verbose, tangent driven effort rather than the perfect prose he imagines.If the style excites you, great. If it turns you off, try to work through it. The world is full of decision makers who rely on experts, statistics and intricate models that are built on soft sand. The risks they take affect all of us, and while this behavior will probably never stop, we can take steps to minimize the impact of their folly. Anyone who has been visited by a negative Black Swan will understand this implicitly. For the rest of us, the cost of this book will be a much lower tuition than we might have to pay learning the lessons first hand."
275,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30590986-laurent-michiels,4,"Idea 5 stars, style 2 stars.I am following Taleb for c. 5 years now, and his ideas, including the Black Swan-concept, have contributed significantly to how I view the world.A Black Swan is an event which is rare, has an extreme impact and is predictable in retrospect. Our problem is that we tend to be blind with respect to incomplete information and the unknown, and particularly to the large deviations. Yet, knowing the concept of Black Swan is one thing; leveraging on it is another. Acknowledging that we don't know what we don't know, it does not make sense to precisely predict Black Swans. Instead we should accept uncertainties and invest in preparedness. Taleb urges us to be aggressive when we can gain exposure to positive Black Swans and very conservative (i.e. prevention over treatment) when we are under threat from a negative Black Swan. Obviously, this holds for all nonlinear events, both predictable and unpredictable.But reader beware! I have mixed feelings with this book. As I similarly experienced with his other books (e.g. Skin in the Game), Taleb's writing style is often dismissive, unstructured, yet entertaining at times. Also, I think you can easily skip or skim through many (repetitive, off-topic, etc.) chapters to still grasp the main ideas.I picked up this book again in quarantine during the COVID-19 lockdown. Importantly however, Taleb called the COVID-19 pandemic a white swan as he deems it wholly predictable and thus can not be used as an excuse for our unpreparedness. I think this is especially true concerning the outbreak in Western countries (months after China)."
276,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4749980-jeroen-kraan,1,"Very nearly got to the end of part one, but then it just became too stupid. As others have pointed out, Taleb is an absolutely insufferable author. His arrogance and disrespect for others probably makes him the second least likable writer after Richard Dawkins.But this is not just a matter of personality. While there are some glimmers of insight in this book, they are covered by a thick layer of confused logic. I finally gave up reading the book when Taleb used two fictional characters' answers to a thought experiment to point out that people who think scientifically are less likely to be succesful in life than the good ol' Plumber Joe type who may not have the IQ on paper but has street smarts. ""Have you ever wondered why so many of these straight-A students end up going nowhere in life while someone who lagged behind is now getting the shekels, buying diamonds, and getting his phone calls returned?"", he asks. The assertion is not just incredible and unfounded (when was the last time someone without a traditional education became president?), but the assertion comes directly after a screed blasting people for giving in to confirmation bias, seeing a narrative where there is none and generally making assumptions without using the proper data.On top of all that, the editing is sloppier than what you might find in most self-published erotic fiction. Seriously, enough with the supposedly witty asides already. Someone with a really good pair of scissors could have turned this 400-page book into a really clever 10-page New Yorker essay."

""The first step to wisdom is knowing what we don't know"" may sound like a line from the 1970s TV show ""Kung Fu,"" but it is an important theme in NNT's book. It's hard for me (being a product of an MBA program where we learned to look at everything as a bell curve) to fully embrace his ideas, but I feel a better man for knowing his views. Uncertainty is a big part of my job as a financial advisor (fee only, no commissions) and NNT's perspectives are useful in my work. Taken to the extreme, one may feel that all life is in vain; I don't think he'd agree with that, but he does say very clearly that our lives are not the linear, well-planned stories that our personal histories might suggest. There is something about the human mind that craves the simple, logical narrative, whether it be about the history of nations or of a person. NNT accepts this craving, but then explains really what happens in life - we are more a product of the rare and unexpected events (cancer, early death of parent, etc.) in our lives than the planned ones. This book is likely to generate lots of discussion among friends who like to debate or some deeper introspection about your own life's trajectory. Highly recommended!!"

As an undergraduate mathematics student, I was fascinated by the power of statistics and higher level mathematics to model and predict. Unfortunately, I never was introduced into its limitations ---- I don't remember them even being discussed.Taleb shows these limitations, and the way in which --- especially in the soft sciences of economics, finance, and psychology --- misuse of statistics or failure to understand the limitations of statistical methods can result in catastrophic results ---- namely via rare events with huge impacts arising well outside the possibilities predicted. In ""The Black Swan"", Taleb comes down especially hard upon economists, bankers, politicians, and journalists --- all of whom become enamored of methods they don't fully understand or short term thinking enabled by overreliance upon mathematical models unsuited for the dangerously random environment in which they work.This book should be required reading by every student of mathematics, economics, finance, or psychology in my opinion."
279,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237995-loyd,4,"No, it has nothing to do with the Natalie Portman movie. Researcher Nassim Nicholas Taleb's The Black Swan is a study of how unexpected, often tragic or shocking circumstances are the catalyst for positive change in the world. Here's the premise: an unexpected occurrence (like the discovery of an actual black swan in nature when none were thought to exist) jogs our thought processes, thus opening our eyes to a different future, for better or worse. I'm not sure every example in the book accurately supports the idea, but there is abundant proof that we constantly ""close the barn doors after the horse has escaped"" when it comes to national security, health scares, natural disasters, etc.In my mind The Black Swan ties to G.B. Shaw's quote: ""The reasonable man adapts himself to the conditions that surround him... The unreasonable man adapts surrounding conditions to himself... All progress depends on the unreasonable man.""We would like to think we don't have to be unreasonable—or victims of catastrophe—in order to progress. But the evidence might be against us."

Especially working at GoJek where a lot of people use vocabulary from this book. I'm a bit rebellious that way. About a week ago, I finally got to reading this. The Black Swan is definitely a perspective changing book introducing a lot of fresh, powerful ideas and discusses the nature of uncertainty and the limits of knowledge i.e the unknown unknowns. It explains why predicting the future is a fundamentally hard problem and why projects with long timelines have to grapple with the unknown unknowns. Especially when living in a world containing millions of independent-decision making actors. Two actionable strategies which I've found interesting from this book include keeping shorter timelines and the barbell investment strategy."

I already was of the same opinion as Talib – that people who make predictions in economics and social sciences, or believe in social engineering and shaping the history, are full of hot air. I’ve been through mathematically rigorous training on the theory of random processes myself, and I know how largely irrelevant it is even in engineering. Forget about finance and economics. And I always laugh at the commentators who act like they’re explaining the instantaneous movement of the stock market or oil prices. NASDAQ is down 11 points right now because blah blah blah.

It was just after the 2008 crisis and I had a vague sense that every authority figure I’d ever listened to was completely full of shit.The Black Swan convinced that was basically the case and I would have to build my own models and understanding of how things actually worked. The Black Swan itself contributed a lot to that new model and is still a big part of how I see the world.Re-reading it was well worth it. I picked up a couple of things I didn’t catch the first time around like the distinction between grey swans and black swans and the notion of “Platonicity.”If you haven’t picked up anything by Taleb, I think Fooled by Randomness is the best entry point."

It discusses how rare events have high impacts and that we are controlled by them, calling these events the Black Swans. The way we consider historic data to make decisions and forecasts is highly vulnerable to both the factors we cannot predict, and the factors we cannot measure. I was heavily involved in forecasting techniques and building basic/advanced mathematical models for forecasting,, and believe me it was hard for me to use these techniques while having the black swan theory ringing all the time in my mind :)"

However, to me the book felt as an accusation of scientist/academics, who allegedly think too highly of themselves, ignore common sense and do research that is not useful in practice. In my perspective, that is a very exagorated, limited and unnuanced view of academia . Taleb might want to update as well, e.g. He might want to discuss evolutionary economics, which solves a lot of his critique on neoclassical economics."

Please treat his books as a series of philisophical treatise, not, god-forbid, business books. We humans are excellent in explaining past events, but always tend to be surprised when highly improbable events impact us hugely. Then we go back to explaining how we saw this coming all along. Do not belive forecasts, do not believe in very precise mathematical models which promise to predict the future, and do not take risks which can make you go bust. Do not be a sucker."

The proximity of the 2 men is large. It is a little a popularizing work but this is not pejorative. Taleb has its own theories (mediocristan, extremistan…)Thanks to him, I think of having understood what escaped to me at Mandelbrot. The two works are complementary. Moreover Taleb has a true teaching talent, its writing is limpid."
288,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,3,The author rehashes his Black Swan idea wihtout really emotionally connecting the audience to the meatphor in my opinion. Also a lot of rehashed and reused anectodtes. It does seem to be his unique take on it and definitly from his own vantage point but that doesn't mean it was engaging enough to the reader which is sad becasue for the most part I agree with what he was trying to convey.

295,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7918888-michael,5,"Despite a few flaws and Taleb's characteristic and unapologetic meandering style, this was really good. All his books should be required reading for anyone in business, policy making, decision making, or breathing. I really enjoyed the discussion about empiricism vs rationalism, and their strengths and limitations. The concepts of extremistan vs mediocristan are very useful. He goes over falsification, the scientific method, the filtering effect on ancient processes, the problem of silent evidence, and a lot more. He discusses really well the phenomenon of why those who find cures are recognised and rewarded far more than those who find preventions, and how we should think about this (the answer is not to throw up our hands and say ""well what else can we do?""). I've always thought about these kinds of things, especially how someone who had implemented a policy of locked airline cabin doors on September 10, 2001 would never have been credited with saving 1000s of lives and preventing a long war, but would have actually prevented that nonetheless. I think we're often confused by the lack of empirical results of preventionism, so we give up. We need best practices, and robustness (aka antifragility), even when we can't show the results. We also can't be fooled by thinking that post-black swan fixes make us safe. Putting locks on cabin doors on September 12 would prevent another September 11 style takeover, but wouldn't prevent the next black swan. Locks are good, but feeling confident that we've fixed the problem is bad.Taleb talks about silent evidence, and naive empiricism, but I thought he should have covered (emphasised) beneficial empiricism, and when an argument from silence is valid, ie, when there's a lack of evidence when there shouldn't be (eg, finding no archaeological remains of a city in a particular place doesn't mean it's theoretically impossible that the place existed but was thoroughly and systematically erased, but its lack of evidence is so unexpected that we'd consider that to be a valid argument from silence that the place most probably didn't ever exist).Taleb's distinction of the 4 quadrants was also helpful, because it clarified when and how black swans are a problem.The other thing I really liked is the discussion about how some of the greatest scientific discoveries were serendipitous discoveries, not ones that the scientist planned to find. The trick is to put yourself in the path of good luck and not be too blinkered by your plan and projected outcomes, but be on the lookout for opportunities. I've found that some of the best opportunities in life and work have come when least expected and in a way that I could never have planned for. The trick isn't to plan to have a specific thing happen, but to put yourself in situations and frames of mind to recognise those opportunities. Sometimes from the outside this can look like wasted time because it's not following a specific plan, but it's very intentional. After a while people may wonder why you're so lucky, and it's hard to explain to them. You're no luckier than the next person, you're just more open to it and putting yourself in situations where more lucky things can find you, due to the laws of large numbers and probabilities.I'm not sure if this is a review anymore or a journal, but Taleb makes me think...."
296,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60222708-nati-s,5,"Philosophers talk about two types of reasoning: deduction and induction. In deductive reasoning the move from premises to conclusions is such that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In inductive reasoning, on the other hand, the conclusion follows from the premises not with necessity but only with probability. In a nutshell, this book is about the consequences confusing inductive reasoning for deductive reasoning and why the confusion occurs in the first place.Taleb states that probability is the mother of all abstractions. This is so because probability is a mode of thought/reasoning that attempts to capture uncertainty. Abstraction is sort of the construction of a mental model that represents reality in a general sense, such act requires a certain “amount”, or rather, “energy”. The mother abstraction, thus, being at the infinite limit, requires infinite cognitive energy. Hence, this particular abstraction is truly incomprehensible. To me this makes better sense when looked at via an example. Autistic individuals are not able to understand other’s emotions because they lack whatever is necessary to do that. This means such understanding is outside their mental scope, it’s something like sympathy-empathy abstraction that represents whatever allows this understanding. It is somewhat self-evident why said abstraction will not be comprehensible to these individuals. Somewhat similarly, all individuals are not able to comprehend uncertainty. There are two things needed in order for one to enjoy this book: curiosity and the ability to put aside, or rather be entertained by, the authors need to bash on academics and people associated with banks. I think it is beautifully written, insightful and humbling."
297,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2899659-guy,5,"I have just begun reading this, after it sat on my shelves for a bunch of years. I see immediately its importance and value both because of the points and quality of the writing — it has an irreverent humour I am enjoying — as well as having several immediate synchronicities with the Jordan B. Peterson lecture, The Maps of Knowledge, that I also just began listening to.Now I have finished it and have begun immediately to re-read it. This book is powerful and important and will likely have been and will continue to be totally ignored. Fascinating. A further review to follow my second read.And the second read was richly rewarding! Learned much more. And was quietly pleased that I made some observations about the nature of economics as does Taleb when I wrote my 'Economics Debunked' course several years ago.Taleb does a great job of comparing the way our officially accepted economic and social risk and growth measures and models are built within something akin to a two dimensional world oblivious to the reality of their existence being in a three or four dimensional one. He is astounded that such an obvious failure is not accepted. This made me smile because of something similar I observed with the great science of mathematics. For almost 2000 years Euclid's theorem about parallel lines was accepted as an ideal truth, despite the inability of mathematicians to prove it. In the end, it was finally accepted as only true in two dimensions. In three dimensions it is basically the foundation of navigational mathematics.Delusion knows no bounds, and is somehow always the other person's problem.I have twenty-plus yellow sticky flags in the book. One of them is a remarkable synchronicity with the psychologist Carl Jung, which occurred, as synchronicities tend to do, with my randomly, and for no obvious 'good' reason, picking up a Jung anthology for a quick glance even with my wanting to get back to Taleb. (Taleb doesn't mention Jung.) The synchronicity involves epistemology and the unpredictable nature of the soul and numbers. For Taleb it was about the unpredictability of history. Taleb wrote:First, when you spend a couple of decades doing mass-scale empirical work with data and taking risks based on such studies, you can easily spot elements in the texture of the world that the Platonified 'thinker' is too brainwashed, or too threatened, to see. Second, it allowed me to become formal and systematic in my thinking instead of wallowing in the anecdotal. Finally, both the philosophy of history and epistemology (the philosophy of knowledge) seemed inseparable from the empirical study of times series data, which is a succession of numbers instead of words. And numbers are easy to process on computers. Studying historical data makes you conscious that history runs forward, not backward, and that it is messier than the narrated accounts. Epistemology, the philosophy of history, and statistics aim at understanding truths, investigating the mechanisms that generate them, and separating regularity from the coincidental in historical matters. They all address the question of what one knows, except that all are to be found in different buildings, so to speak (p20).Jung: ""The moment one forms an idea of a thing and successfully catches one of its aspects, one invariably succumbs to the illusion having caught the whole"" (Jung, cited in DeLaszlo 
Basic Writings of C. G. Jung. Modern Library No. 300
 (p38). The delusion that mathematical modelling can be applied to the complexity of life is simply an extension of this idea. Like it was with the belief in Euclid's theorem against all evidence. Jung elaborates that if the first numbers came from a string of peas laid out, that that was easily grasped as the true meaning of number, but missed out that that simple idea, while true enough, missed the meta truth of the properties of numbers, such as odd and even and irrational and well the entire edifice of mathematics!Jung continues: One never considers that a total apprehension is right out of the question. Not even an idea that is posited as total is total, for it is still an entity on its own with unpredictable qualities. This self-deception certainly promotes peace of mind: the unknown is named, the far has been brought near, so that one can lay one's finger on it. One has taken possession of it, and it has become an inalienable piece of property, like a slain creature of the wild that can no longer run away. It is a magical procedure such as the primitive practices upon objects and the psychologist son the psyche. He is no longer at its mercy, but he never suspects that the very fact of grasping the object conceptually gives it a golden opportunity to display all those qualities which would never have made their appearance had it not been imprisoned in a concept (remember the numbers!) (p38-9).This is a true book: it challenges what you think you know, and asks you to begin to see the world as it is, not as we want it to be. I will read this again, because it has too much knowledge to be fully understood with even two readings."
298,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4643358-dimitris-hall,3,"This was a smart book. The author, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, is one of these guys you come across sometimes who are smartasses and they know it, are in love with that smartass prestige of theirs, and who you can't help but sit and listen to because they're so damn interesting. Sometimes their smartassiness goes a bit overboard, similar to the scratching of an itch that at first is satisfying but can easily hurt if you don't stop at the right moment. However, albeit barely, most of the time they keep it under control.I have to tell the truth. Most of the Black Swan was too technical for me, too difficult. I caught the main idea but at some point I just didn't know what I was reading anymore. I wonder if Taleb would have had a bigger impact with his book (and he did a big impact as far as I can tell) if he had made it easier to read for a broader audience. I have the impression that the more sophisticated an academic or a specialist is, the more resistant to books such as this he or she is, whereasAnyway, Taleb's idea, the whole topic of this book, is rather simple: life is full of Black Swan events, and...Sod it, I'll let Wikipedia do the talking for a sec:The phrase ""black swan"" derives from a Latin expression; its oldest known occurrence is the poet Juvenal's characterization of something being ""rara avis in terris nigroque simillima cygno"" (""a rare bird in the lands and very much like a black swan""; 6.165).[4] When the phrase was coined, the black swan was presumed not to exist.[...]Juvenal's phrase was a common expression in 16th century London as a statement of impossibility. The London expression derives from the Old World presumption that all swans must be white because all historical records of swans reported that they had white feathers.[5] In that context, a black swan was impossible or at least nonexistent. After Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh discovered black swans in Western Australia in 1697,[6] the term metamorphosed to connote that a perceived impossibility might later be disproven. Taleb notes that in the 19th century John Stuart Mill used the black swan logical fallacy as a new term to identify falsification.[7][...]Based on the author's criteria:1. The event is a surprise (to the observer).2. The event has a major effect.3. After the first recorded instance of the event, it is rationalized by hindsight, as if it could have been expected; that is, the relevant data were available but unaccounted for in risk mitigation programs. The same is true for the personal perception by individuals.[...]The theory was developed by Nassim Nicholas Taleb to explain:1. The disproportionate role of high-profile, hard-to-predict, and rare events that are beyond the realm of normal expectations in history, science, finance, and technology.2. The non-computability of the probability of the consequential rare events using scientific methods (owing to the very nature of small probabilities).3. The psychological biases that make people individually and collectively blind to uncertainty and unaware of the massive role of the rare event in historical affairs.Basically, we can't predict things. We think we can, but we can't, and they are the ones we are most vulnerable to. What do we have to do to make ourselves more robust to Black Swans? Be aware of them. And screw banksters and speculators, they're frauds. There, I just summarised the whole book!Don't give Black Swan a read if you're a bankster or speculator and want to preserve your so-called self-respect. Do give it a read if you believe that the world is much more complex than any model we can come up with, but be prepared to skim, skim, skim."
299,1400063515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5685608-john-jr,5,"What you don't know can hurt you: that's a truism, which means that, however familiar and easily forgotten it may be, what it says is true. It's not an adequate summary of Nassim Nicholas Taleb's book, but one gets a little closer by saying The Black Swan will tell you why it's true, how it's true, where it's true, and even, in passing, a few places where it's not true. An example from Taleb of where it's not true: If your wife is pregnant, you may not yet know the gender of the child, but there are only two possibilities, and in practice it can be determined (through amniocentesis or ultrasound), and the answer is relatively inconsequential, won't really hurt anyone--except possibly the child, who may be born into one of those cultures in which the killing of infant daughters is surreptitiously practiced. Taleb omits the infanticide note, but adding it is entirely in keeping with the spirit of his book, for he's forever reminding us that life in the modern world is more complex than we're apt to think. Here's an example of an unknown that does matter, which makes one of the fundamental points of Taleb's book: A turkey who has been fed every day for 1,000 days by a kind farmer knows what to expect, and for the turkey life is good--until day number 1,001, when the farmer shows up with an ax. That day is both unexpected and highly consequential--at least for the turkey, though not for the farmer--and it's the kind of thing Taleb calls a Black Swan event.One difference between Taleb's argument and what philosophers have long called the problem of induction (which is basically that 1,000 examples don't tell you for sure what the 1,001st will be) is this: unexpected and highly consequential things can happen (which even the philosophers recognize), but it matters where you stand. The ax-wielding farmer is a Black Swan event only for the turkey. Similarly, the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, were a Black Swan event for almost everybody else, but certainly not for the men who planned them. (In case you wonder about the title and the concept: Taleb explains in his opening paragraph that people in the Old World thought all swans were white until the discovery of Australia revealed to them that some swans are black.) What can we do? Answers permeate the book, but in a sense it boils down to this: be the smart guy, not the sucker (Taleb, an elegant writer who keeps his feet on the ground, isn't afraid to put it like that); when you don't have much choice, look for ways to limit the consequences.The turkey problem is hardly the whole of his book. Another of Taleb's points is that we construct stories after the fact that provide causes and explanations and allow us to believe after the fact that the unpredictable could've been predicted. (He doesn't waste much time, nor will I, on 9/11; the now-famous Presidential Daily Briefing that warned ""Bin Laden determined to attack in US"" counts for little, because it said nothing about how, when, and where, yet that's the kind of prediction we would've needed.) Taleb calls this retrospective storytelling the narrative fallacy, and if you haven't already noticed that historians, as well as the rest of us, repeatedly come up with differing ""explanations"" after the fact for what happened in the past, which you'd think would cast doubt on many of their explanations, you'll start noticing it. There's more, such as: what casinos have to do with uncertainty, and whether the U.S. military has paid any attention to Donald Rumsfeld's ""unknown unknowns"" (he's not named, but his term is), and what went wrong with the Sydney Opera House, and what the smart answer would've been when Alan Greenspan said the recent financial crisis couldn't have been foreseen because it had never happened before. Here's something to try: estimate the answers, read the book, and see if you were right. Prediction is hard, even about knowable things, and humans, by nature, aren't very good at it.If you want a label, The Black Swan is an extended argument for what Taleb calls skeptical empiricism. It's also maybe the most entertaining and useful erudite book that I've ever read. Umberto Eco's erudite novel Foucault's Pendulum will teach you to be careful with stories you make up; it's vastly entertaining but maybe not that useful (except as a warning about what the crazies might do). Taleb goes farther, warning us repeatedly against the stories (and theories and financial models) that others make up, and giving me, among other things, ideas for reworking my financial plan. And there's nothing wrong with a book that inspires one to read more books. This one has left me wanting to read Montaigne (again), and Seneca, and Karl Popper, and Friedrich Hayek, and Keynes, and Poincaré. In a way, the statue on the campus in Animal House had it right: Knowledge is good, if it helps you be the smart guy."
