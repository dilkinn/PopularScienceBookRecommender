I DO love his enthusiasm and agree with a lot of what he has to say in his books.He even, in this book, addresses his writing style:""Over the years, an undertone of emotion crept in, which was more in line with my personal thinking. In other words, I relaxed adn let my heart do the talking instead of my brain.""...And...""The language I use is too emotional, they said. My descriptions make trees and animals seem human, and that is not scientifically correct. But can a language stripped of emotion even be called a human language?""So, while I still will argue that anthropomorphizing trees and animals presents VERY real issues, Wohlleben has also recognized that the costs of doing it are worth the benefits (empathy with the situation of trees and animals). And, really, it is hard to argue with that.All that said, his curiosity and his ability to pull research and other ecological writing into a compelling narrative is amazing. My favorite part, however, is one that is often overlooked in both scientific studies and commercial lobbying. Wohlleben presents nature as complicated and inter-dependent and recognizes just how much we don't know about nature, let alone our impact on the trees and animals we interfere with everyday. His combination of curiosity and humility kept me reading this trilogy.The previous two books in his trilogy are:1. The Hidden Life of Trees: What They Feel, How They Communicate – Discoveries from a Secret World - my review2. The Inner Life of Animals: Love, Grief, and Compassion: Surprising Observations of a Hidden World - my review"
1,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2050909-tonstant-weader,3,"The Secret Wisdom of Nature focuses on the relationships between the flora and fauna of nature, things like how some plants, insects, birds, or animals interact with other plants, insects, or animals to survive, thrive, and multiply. Many of the relationships are fascinating and this book is full of “I didn’t know that” and “Hmm, interesting” information. This is the third in a series of books that began with “The Secret Wisdom of Trees.”Did you know trees affect the weather and change the rotation of the sun? Did you know they work in concert to react to threats and changes in their environment? Did you know the Brits love of feeding birds is changing the beak and wing shape of some birds? Did you know that for trees cannot “see” green so the daylight we see in the forest is dark for them? That is the kind of strange and surprising things you will learn reading this book.The Secret Wisdomof Nature is fascinating and informative. It is also maddening at times. Wohlleben anthropomorphized far too much. He attributes intention to biochemical responses and biologically-programmed instincts and behaviors. His nature is full of emotion. Of course, animals experience emotion. Anyone who saw the daily stories of J35 mourning her dead calf and her fellow Southern Resident orcas helped keep her and her calf afloat for seventeen days cannot deny the grief and emotional depths of animals. Wohllenben goes further than that, though, too far for me, describing plants and animals as emotional beings.I cringed sometimes when he described evolutionary processes, not necessarily because they were not happening but because he made them seem purposeful. His description of blackcap warbler evolution, for example, seems problematic. Some of them have taken to flying to England where people feed them rather than Spain where they eat berries and fruit, including olives. Natural selection has resulted in those with rounder wings and longer beaks doing better. But the way the author talks about it is far too intentional, not the random mutations turning out to be useful. There is an element of design in how he describes nature and that sets my teeth on edge.He also seems humanity as something apart from nature. He addresses this directly, writing we became separate from nature when we began farming. This is increasingly rejected by scientists and it’s a good thing, helping to understand the interdependence of humanity with the rest of the world. Still, I think many people will enjoy the book for all the “did you know” moments and his easy writing style. I can see people who see the world as designed really liking it.The Secret Wisdom of Nature will be published on March 5th.

2,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,5,"The Secret Wisdom of Nature is an easy-to-access book on ecology, similar to The Secret Life of Trees, but boarder. Peter Wohlleben tells excellent stories about nature and the interconnecting living things in nature, including humans. Some interesting learnings:1. Reintroducing wolfs to central European forests recovers the region's balance between predicators, trees and herbivores.2. The hunting practice where hunters feed their games causes more harm to forests than hunters would admit.3. Meadows where livestocks browsing is so bucolic to human eyes because it is a human invention. The success of grass as a species is due to our picking of grass over forest. 4. Human emotions and aesthetics affect our relationship with animals and plants. Some conservation projects can be swayed by our emotions and aesthetics and they may cause damage. 5.Trees don't like wild fire. Some trees, such as sequoias, adapt to regions where wild fires often happen, but it doesn't mean wild fire is necessary or even essential to the growth of forests.6. Climate change is not a new phenomenon on earth. It's the speed of change that is the problem. The climate change unleashed by humans is too fast, too drastic for animals and trees to adapt. Urbanization and rigid land planning give no space for animals and trees to migrate.His message: Nature is interconnected. Don't meddle with nature if you don't absolutely know what you are doing. Leave nature alone. The author does not address the damage of climate change in a way that might be considered as alarmist. Compare to other books on this topic I've read recently, his attitude is almost nonchalant at the first glance. However, it is not because he thinks climate change is a no issue. On the contrary, he is fully aware of and laments the damage we have caused to other species. It seems to me that he thinks in the geological timeline instead of human timeline--no matter what damage we impose on nature, nature will eventually bounce back. But humans? Perhaps yes perhaps no. We are not as important as we think. Perhaps we do not matter after all (otherwise why a species would bring demise to themselves?)."
3,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2949159-ray-lamanna,4,"This is the second book in Wohlleben's trilogy...his first was the excellent The Hidden Life of Trees (I guarantee you that you will never walk through a forest the same as you did after you read that book). This book extends his inquiry to all of nature...it's quite comprehensive, though a bit too strong on the science. But it is definitely worth the effort...here are the thoughts and suggestions of a man who walks through nature every day as part of his job as a forester."

6,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30276417-nancy-mills,4,"Very well-written and friendly book. Easy reading and moves along well, packed with interesting information on nature from trees to insects to human evolution. I can't imagine anyone finding this uninteresting. The author has an intimate connection to the natural world around him and does a great job sharing the wonders."
7,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96534946-l-g-cullens,4,"With all the hot buttons being pushed in scientific research papers, and distracting spin media, trying to sort out what is happening to our little blue canoe can be frustrating. There are, of course, major human proclivities we know of that need to be addressed if we are to stay afloat, but there is so much more that needs to be understood to maintain a biosphere that is conducive to human existence. That is, in how to traverse the evolutionary branch we are on without getting slapped up side the head by catastrophic events of our making. There is no simple recipe because the extent of Nature's complexity is beyond our perception, but there is much we can learn to ease our way.What this book does is present an overview of detailed considerations to help guide us. It does this by offering up stories of known science together with observations, and where differing viewpoints beg questions it includes relative pros and cons. The supporting detail included is abbreviated out of necessity, but can be explored with further research. An example being where the author mentions the intricate dance of life in the seasonal rainforest on the west coast of Canada. He notes the large predators such as Grizzly Bears feasting on the salmon, and a dizzying array of scavengers. What he does not delve into are the fly larvae, feeding on what the larger predators leave in their gluttonous haste; banana slugs decomposing and distributing the waste, and distributing fungi; flying squirrels, fond of truffles, distributing fungi; and fungi and microorganisms finishing the decomposition to enrich the soil, renewing plant life of the forest. The balancing process here is an example of life being fueled by life, with evolution's biodiversity providing the off-setting interactions. Looking at it from only the complexities of the food chains, with all the biodiversity of the seasonal rain forest involved, a fair bit of the balancing activity necessary to the continuity of all life is manifest.My take of this book is that such interrelationships exist in and between all ecosystems and biomes, to sustain the continuity of life on Earth. Also, as life forms and habitats change, effects cascade through all with evolutionary balancing and niche filling adjustments. To get a mental handle on such, think about what would happen to our food supply if pollinators disappear. This book is more of a call for increased wisdom than it is a condemnation of human activity, as any weedy life form that acquired sufficient capabilities would do the same given the natural order drives instilled in continuing life. We're but a liminal thread in Nature's fluid web-of-life, all sharing degrees of genes and basic inherent behavioral traits. All functional life forms share the basic natural order drive to not only survive but thrive. Our problem is that we are finding emerging hurdles ever more difficult, because the Earth is a closed system and we're struggling against natural processes we are but a part of."

9,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8525332-andrew,4,Back to classic Wohlleben exploring the interconnectedness of all living things. Much like trees there are some wonderful observations in here. But also some deeper questions about how humans can help nature or whether they even should.
10,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64777077-linda-mehus-barber,5,"As I raked up pine needles in our yard today, I found myself wondering if leaving them to decompose and add nutrients to the soil would be the better way to go. Anytime I read a book that causes me to consider changing my behaviour, I know it was a book worth reading. This is such a book."
11,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48482768-jonathan-tennis,5,"The last of the nature trilogy. Wohlleben sometimes repeats himself and so there is some info in this last book that was also in the earlier two. But he tells such a good story that it’s hardly noticeable. Recommend all three of these books.“Aphids attach themselves to the trees’ needles and bark, stick their mouthparts down to where the trees’ sap flows, and tap into the trees’ lifeblood. Thanks to photosynthesis, this “tree blood” has a high sugar content, but that’s not what the aphids are after. What they want is protein, which is found in this fluid in only very small quantities. Therefore, the aphids need to allow enormous amounts of the trees’ fluids to flow through their bodies so that they can filter out enough of the scarce substances they desire. Whoever drinks a lot must excrete a lot, and aphids excrete almost constantly. If you park under aphid-infested trees in summer, your windshield will tell you all you need to know—in just a few hours, it will be covered with sticky droplets. And because the little creatures are constantly eating and excreting, over time their rear ends can get gummed up with sugar. Some species resort to covering their excretions with wax so that they can expel them more easily; others enlist the help of ants. Ants lap up the sugary feces, because, like their relatives the honeybees, sugar is the most important compenent in their diet. Per season, a single any colony digests about 50 gallons of these sugary droplets.” – p. 70 “Dead animals are often the cause of fights, and wolves lost out when brown bears turn up. Then it’s best for the pack to head for the hills, particularly if they have pups, which a bruin could easily scarf down as a snack. Ravens have a role to play here: they spot bears from afar and help wolves by alerting the pack to approaching danger. In return, wolves allow ravens to help themselves to a share of the booty—something the birds wouldn’t be able to do without the wolves’ permission.” – p. 88-89“As researchers at Ulm University discovered, something else happens to the beetle mother: she loses interest in mating. Not only that, even if the male were to get lucky, it wouldn’t do any good, because his beloved is now completely infertile—at least as long as she has her full complement of babies. As soon as a couple of the little ones go missing (perhaps because they died or were eaten by some animal), her desire for sex returns. The male immediately gets wind of the change and goes beserk. The scientists observed up to three hundred copulations—more than when the male initially laid claim to the carcass. The female quickly lays new eggs to replace her loss. If, in this flurry of activity, she ends up with too many babies, she soon fixes things by killing the extras.” – p. 93 “Empathy is one of the strongest forces in conservation and can achieve more than any number of rules and regulations. Think of the campaigns against whaling or against the slaughter of seal pups—public outcry was so loud only because we all empathized with the animals. And the closer the animals are to us, the greater the empathy.” – p. 125 “A whole army of infectious agents has its eye on wild boar, including a large number of viruses. Viruses are remarkable, but what exactly are they? Scientists don’t include them among the living species of this earth, because they have no cells and can’t reproduce or metabolize on their own. All they are is a hollow shell that contains a blueprint for multiplication. Basically, they’re dead.” – p. 137-138 “There’s a very different kind of myth surrounding species diversity. When we save individual animals or plants, we really believe we’re doing something good for the environment. Yet this is rarely what happens, mostly because when we have to change conditions in the environment to ensure the survival of one species, the survival of many others ends up in jeopardy. But I’m getting ahead of myself. When we see just how multilayered the interactions between different species are, we have to ask, once again, whether we will ever be able to fully comprehend the connections in our environment.” – p. 146 **Arches National Park mentioned on p. 205 “Researchers tell us that every person alive can be traced back to one mitochondrial Eve, who is said to have lived 200,000 to 300,000 years ago. The variations in skin color and other characteristics that have developed since then are disappearing increasingly quickly. What some people mourn as a loss of diversity, others embrace as an opportunity for humanity to bid goodbye to racial differences.” – p. 213-214 “We don’t really understand how the clockwork of nature functions, and as long as we don’t, we shouldn’t try to fix it.” – p. 225“Of course, no one wants to return to times of famine, but our problem today isn’t cold but increasingly warm temperatures. The positive message from all of this is that not only can we win back the original forests, but doing that could also steer the climate in the right direction. And to achieve this we don’t even need to do anything. Just the opposite, in fact. We need to leave things alone—on as large a scale as possible.” – p. 232"

Plenty of information but not bogged down with science that would put off a person who has only reached as far as A-Level Biology and Geography, like me, and who wasn't up for wading through page after page of explanations. This was so easy to read (accessible to anybody with an interest really) and I never grew bored. The chapters were the perfect length and I love how the end of one connected to the beginning of the next...Almost like... a network! :O(my apologies)Maybe I'm biased, because ecology is one of my favourite things to learn about, but I found the 'networks' in this book fascinating. I had already read/heard about a couple of them (I think most people have heard about the Yellowstone wolves by now, which is great) but most of them were new to me and I enjoyed every one.It is wholeheartedly my opinion that the content of this book should be studied in schools. Children are, thankfully, taught more about climate change and their impact on their environment now than ever before, but more still needs to be done to highlight the issues (because my god, there are so many), a few of which are mentioned in this book.I agreed with the authors views on all the bigger topics, and gave a little cheer every time he described the rogue hunters and farmers and the politicians that support them as exactly what they are- selfish and destructive.I did disagree with the author slightly, on a few minor topics (owning wild animals etc) but I could tell by his writing, and the great translation I might add, that he cares so much about the world and its animals, and has only good intentions.I will definitely be reading his other books!"
13,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4448777-mike-radack,3,"I enjoyed the accent on the reader for the audiobook quite a bit. The writing was nice and breezy, but I ended up knowing a lot of the didja-know infofacts that he peppered throughout. I’m not really sure that I agree with the author’s thoughts on conservation vs preservation — which is to say that I found his argument for preservation not particularly persuasive. His final conclusion of “just do nothing” would be sweet if we didn’t live in a capitalist hellhole where “do nothing” almost always leads to increased exploitation of natural resources."
14,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37918781-melissa,5,"The message in this book? Leave nature alone. Stop meddling (for the most part, anyway). The author describes the beautiful complexity of nature, a complexity we don't fully grasp, with amazing simplicity that still conveys awe. Like his first book, The Hidden Life of Trees, beautifully written and makes you appreciate nature all the more."
15,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2584938-brian-callahan,4,"I am always interested in learning more about animals, plants, insects, humans, etc. and how they interact. This is one of those books that helps remind me that there is a lot going on around us. We often don't give this a second thought as we go through our daily routine."
16,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23982359-angelique-simonsen,2,The first couple of chapters are good and then I got bored....
17,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31175766-kathy,4,I did not read the first two books of this trilogy but enjoyed the contents of this third book. 
18,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20309006-ben-thomas,5,Another great book about the intricate relationship between all living things and how even small changes in our environment can have huge impacts in the whole system.

22,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3230899-george,5,"A very engaging, brief, and compelling anecdotal description of the interdependency of life"
23,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91427947-ed-stoddard,5,"Wonderfully written and brimming with anecdote and insights regarding the complex interactions of ecosystems. Wohlleben is a gifted story teller with an eye for telling examples. Take the blackcap warbler, a small bird that spends its summers in Germany and winters in Spain, where it feeds on berries and olives. Since the 1960s, a second migration route has been established - to Britain. The English are bird lovers and have long been avid bird feeders. This second migration group in recent decades has begun to change, with their beaks becoming narrower and longer while their wings have become rounder and shorter: adaptations to life at a bird feeder. The two populations seldom interbreed, so a new species is literally evolving before our eyes because of the British passion for feeding birds, especially in the winter. So next time you hear someone cast doubt on evolution (we have no known examples this really happening! It's all a satanic lie! Life is clearly designed! Blah Blah), tell them to put this in their pipe and smoke it. "
24,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3585516-chelsea-lawson,4,"“Everything is connected by a network so intricate that we will probably never grasp it and its entirety.”That is the central message of this book, though the author is certainly doing his part in trying to obtain and convey knowledge about nature. But ecosystems remain so wonderfully mysterious!The challenge with such complexity is that when we interfere even in a small way (and we are actually interfering in a big way), the fragile balance can collapse. Wohlleben gives several examples of this, shining a light on the unsung heroes of the forest like ants and fungi. The opportunity is that, left to her own devices, nature is really good at restoring balance that has been lost and adapting to change. We simply need to leave things alone- on as large a scale as possible. Protect National forests!! Protect the Amazon!It was especially interesting reading this while watching, Unnatural Selection, the four-part documentary on netflix. The book makes me much more reverent of and less inclined to tamper with nature. "
25,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5907289-suzanne,1,DNF - I loved the Hidden Lives of Trees and tried this one as an audio book. I got about 1/2 way through this book but could not finish. The narrator was boring and quite frankly putting me to sleep during my morning drive and the book itself was problematic for me. The book seemed to be a bit disconnected and choppy. It had more to do with the authors observations and the chapters themselves seemed incomplete and annoyingly seemed to anthropomorphize everything. In this book the author seemed to go off on tangents. It was as if the author was writing as a stream of consciousness rather than providing careful scientific analysis.
26,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11945397-margaret,5,Nature is pure magic; humanity is not. That’s it.
27,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3063573-sarah,5,"I love these books. They’re straight forward, without being dry, and always make me chuckle at cute turns of phrase throughout.

31,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58511199-franco-prontera,4,Good but basic read into the secrets and tidbits of your own garden. The part about the weather was the most compelling to me :-)
32,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1654645-deb-readerbuzz-nance,4,"To be honest, I liked this book, but I didn't love it as much as I loved The Hidden Life of Trees.This is a smorgasbord of a book about the wiseness of nature. Peter Wohlleben takes on wolves and ants and bark beetles and forest fires and deciduous vs. evergreen trees and climate change and species diversity...whew. There is a lot of great thoughts here. But it lacked focus and felt like a bit of a ramble to me. I couldn't decide---three stars or four? I finally settled on four, even though, in my heart, I felt like three would be more accurate. "
33,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4424810-jill,0,Audiobook. The information in this book is presented in a clear and pleasant way. It worries me if the basic science in here comes as something new to anyone. This is a book about understanding the natural world. I was fascinated by most of it.
34,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53509133-moushine-zahr,4,"This is the first novel I've read from German author Peter Wohlleben, but not the first book I've read this year about the same topic of nature, forest, trees...The first book was a Moroccan book, which I read and reviewed earlier and the second book is a French novel also read and reviewed earlier. When reading the first chapters about wolves I couldn't stop comparing it to the Chinese novel of The Wolf Totem, which I loved reading and I still consider to be the best novel about environment and impact of mankind on it.This novel is a non-fiction book about environment, more specifically about forests and the links between animals from different species and trees. Reading this book felt like reading a National Geography documentary, which I barely ever did. This book is a mix of documentary and class lectures. It is very interesting, but for the readers who are not very familiar with the subject like me, we'll remember the major essential points, but we will forget all the detailed info. This book is a must read once for all, but it will be better if it were actually taught in school. Having graduated from high school in 1992, I wonder wheter today there are classes dedicated to the environement just like mathematics, languages.... "
35,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34940715-jane-comer,5,"I'll read all of Peter Wohlleben's books. I'm not a scientist, but I'm concerned about the future of this planet and quality of life my grandchildren will have. I'm also awed by the intricate interactions within the ecosystem of the forest. The tiniest of beetles or flies can have tremendous impact. The miracle of all of this makes it impossible for me to deny the existence of a Creator who is still working to bring about the miracle of life on this planet. Wohlleben educates me and inspires me to do my part."
36,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4563355-libuniverse,5,"This elegant little book refined my understanding of the way the parts of nature work together, like a clock. I read a lot of nature books, but learned so much about forest conservation, the role insects play in the forest, and how trees are responding to and are affected by climate change. The account of agroforestry practiced by people in the Amazon rain forest 4,000 years ago was fascinating. Wohlleben's light, friendly tone and gentle humor make this a delightful read. "
37,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14848449-regina-mastrogiacomo,5,"A little dry, but great information about how and what goes on in nature. The health of nature has a lot to do with the interference of human in the process of insects, animal and tree to interact with each other and allowing natural process to work. I still found I like the book a lot even with all the depressing facts about what’s going on in nature.I really like the book about trees from the same author."
38,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2893093-chuck-erion,4,"From The Waterloo Record, April 6, 2019This book, the third in Wohlleben’s trilogy called The Mysteries of Nature, is already on the nonfiction bestseller lists. I reviewed both the others, The Hidden Life of Trees and The Inner Life of Animals, so was eager to read his latest work. All three are fascinating compilations of stories from his lifetime as a forester in Germany and science he has learned along the way. And all three are overshadowed by the threat that climate change is bringing to the Earth’s natural environment, which is our home no matter how urbanized and cut off from it we become.The Mysteries of Nature follows the Trees and Animals volumes by tying both botany and biology together in ecology. In the first chapter, ecology is explained through the lens of Yellowstone National Park and its reintroduction of wolves. A nature video on this topic has had more than 45 million views. When wolves were eliminated there in the 1930s, the elk population surged which lead to overgrazing of grasses and small trees, reducing the number of birds and beavers…which led to erosion, changing the river courses and the fish in them. Finally, a wolf pack caught in Canada was reintroduced in 1995. The result, called by scientists a trophic cascade, is still being felt.Wolves, being at the top of the food chain, triggered vast ripple effects through the eco-system. We would assume that by eating elk, the trees would recover. But nature is more complex than that. The surviving elk became more cautious, avoiding wide open riverbanks and not eating the willow and poplar saplings there. This stabilized the riverbanks reducing erosion, and providing a food source for beavers. Their dams created more ponds, home to more amphibians and fish. The birds returned to the thicker tree growth. Grizzly bears had more berries to eat, competing for them with fewer elk. In the next chapter, Wohlleben shows how salmon have a similarly complex role in the forest ecology. On the west coast of North America, aging salmon return to the stream of their birthplace to lay eggs. The bears eat the fish, leaving their carcasses to other predators (minks, foxes, insects, birds of prey), which in turn leave salmon bones to decompose, adding up to 70% of the nitrogen in the soil. This speeds up the growth of trees: Sitka spruce have been found to grow three times faster where nitrogen from the ocean is available. That nitrogen is found all through the eco-system, in dead leaves, in insect bodies, in other animals and in the tree fiber itself.The author them turns to the effects of reintroducing of wolves in European forests, leading to the return of Atlantic salmon in cleaned up waterways. But bears have not returned, and would not be welcome in urban areas along rivers like the Rhine. Cormorants have come back and their role in the ecosystem (caustic defecation, too many salmon eaten) is at odds with the conservationists’ efforts. Wohlleben’s expertise is strongest in his own backyard, both literally and Eurocentricly. His backyard is the beech forest he manages in Hummel, Germany, source of his own experience and anecdotes. His books have been translated and sold widely but I kept hoping for more Canadian, or non-European, content. His voice is folksy, like a guide taking us on our tour of his favourite woodland spots. The science he quotes is footnoted but there has been pushback from critics who accuse him of anthropomorphizing trees and animals.Nonetheless, this book shows that we still don’t know enough about the vast interconnectedness of nature, and our interference with it. I’ll take folksy anecdotes if they help us learn greater respect for the environment which, for now, sustains us."

The reason this is a 2 and not a 3 is the unconvincing (and mostly assumed) distinction Wohlleben poses between culture and nature. His argument begins and ends with - if we don't make this distinction ""oil palm plantations in Borneo will one day count as part of Nature."" He assumes the unintuitive nature of this argument sufficient. By that logic, however, why wouldn't a leafcutter ants fungal farm not count as culture? Why wouldn't a bird nest be considered unnatural? I can't even say why Wohlleben would agree or disagree with this because it's left as mere fact-of-the-matter and never broken down further. This underlying assumption leads him to wobble aggressively between anti-government regulation and an idealist ""we"" (whoever that is) that need to ""let nature be"" (whatever that means) so it can tend to itself. If nature and culture are distinct this is a coherent position: nature, being external to us, needs to be treated sacredly; never the two shall meet/don't cross the streams.It makes absolutely no sense if you treat the distinction as pointless - much as the vanished Brazilian ""indigenous forest settlers [who] carried out their system of land management"" mentioned in the final chapter of the book would not have made such a distinction. The problem, then, reflects back to something uniquely contemporary which Wohlleben hints at: the ""oil palm plantations in Borneo"" are odd not because they are not ""nature,"" but because they are the result of a system that evolved in homo sapiens and which acts like a cancerous cell hellbent on suiciding the body it inhabits. Capitalism, I mean. I didn't give this a one though because Wohlleben's heart is in the right place, he's thorough, and overall the book was not something I regretted reading. He is clearly more attuned to seeing the roots of trees' woes than the roots of our problems. However, I find his rhapsodizing last paragraph fantastic and a testament to the need for a broader understanding of nature:But can a language stripped of emotion even be called a human language? Don’t we function mostly in accordance with our emotions? Are descriptions of nature only reliable when all processes are presented in biochemical terms and are dissected so precisely that you get the impression that plants and animals are fully automatic, genetically programmed biological machines? After all, it would be possible to describe all our own feelings and activities that way, yet that would in no way describe what’s going on inside us and what enriches our lives. It is more important to me to state the facts so that people can understand them emotionally. And then I can lead them on a full sensory tour of nature, because that way I can communicate one thing above all: the joy our fellow creatures and their secrets can bring us."
40,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6771139-joseph-adelizzi-jr,4,"A disturbing number of decades ago I majored in Psychology. Since the older I get the more I forget, not many of those psychological tidbits are still retrievable. However, one concept which is still retrievable, at least my current understanding of it, is the idea of learned helplessness. Keeping in mind that at this point in my life the only connection I have to Pavlovian concepts is the fact that I drool more often than I’d like to admit, I see learned helplessness as the resulting psychological and physical immobility stemming from an inability to distinguish among stimuli. And ""learned helplessness"" is kind of what I came away with after reading Peter Wohlleben’s The Secret Wisdom of NATURE.The surprising thing about my take-away is it may be what Wohlleben wanted me to take away. He spends chapter after chapter telling us of the unfathomable level of interconnectivity throughout nature, showing how little changes, even well-intentioned changes, can have devastating ramifications for some species; figuring out if a certain change is “good” is so confusing, thus my ""learned helplessness."" He reminds us there are about 1.8 million known species on earth. Many of those species are on the verge of extinction, and many of those threatened species are not the “sexy” species that get our attention. However, Wohlleben points out that each species is significant because it performs one or more functions which other species are dependent upon, even if that function is “just” to be a food source for another species. So this interconnectivity runs deep in nature, so deep, in fact, that at this point in time no one truly understands nature sufficiently to be able to tweak and turn any control knobs for the greater good of nature. As Wohlleben puts it, “We don’t really understand how the clockwork of nature functions, and as long as we don’t, we shouldn’t try to fix it.” Factor in that Wohlleben previously stated that it is difficult to even define what we mean by “nature” and you can’t help conclude that Wohlleben fished his wish when he left me immobilized with that “learned helplessness.”Hold on. Wohlleben isn’t advocating we sit back in our comfy chairs and do nothing, is he? No. We can’t ignore and continue our actions which are having a significant impact on nature. Among other warnings, Wohlleben cautions frequently about the impact of rising temperatures. The ecosystem, nature, will adjust to any conditions in some way and in due time, and many species may be just fine, but the rub for us is the new normal may not be as comfortable for our species.One slight black mark against this book is the sometimes awkward sentence structure or flow, but I think that is to be expected in translated works. All in all, The Secret Wisdom of NATURE is a worthwhile read which raises many questions while cautioning us to find that fine line between not doing enough and doing too much. Continued research and learning is the key to progressing beyond a useful learned helplessness, to moving forward without missteps."

This is the 3rd book in Wohlleben's ""The Mysteries of Nature Trilogy"", but the first of his that I've read; not that I think you must read the books in chronological order to understand the concepts. I honestly did not realize this was part of a trilogy before I started reading it; I was drawn in by the title, as most books revealing the secrets of nature fascinate me. The Secret Wisdom of Nature did indeed fascinate me. Each chapter relates to a unique subject, which in my opinion helps to keep my interest fresh chapter-to-chapter; yet the subjects still circle back to how they relate to the ecosystem as a whole. I was reminded of certain natural processes that I was already familiar with, and introduced to some that I had never even thought to imagine (beetles feeding their young bits of meat, like baby birds being fed by their parents?! Who knew?). I think I rated the book 3 stars because when the author focuses on specific species, generally they are Central European species (understandable because the author is German) but not being from Europe they were less relatable to me; and most of the chapters found a way to circle back to how the processes mentioned affect trees and forests. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. Wohlleben was a forester for 20 years, and hey, you write what you know. At least it's evident that he is very passionate about the fate of trees and forests, and it actually inspires me to read his other book, The Hidden Life of Trees: What They Feel, How They Communicate – Discoveries from a Secret World. I do recommend this book to nature lovers, and those that misunderstand the natural processes of our ecosystems. With the continual industrialization of the world, and our ever growing presence as humans, I think it's important for more of us to truly understand that even little actions have wide reaching consequences for the natural world. So, I'll end with another line from Wohlleben: ""It’s important for us to realize that even small interventions can have huge consequences, and we’d do better to keep our hands off everything in nature that we do not absolutely have to touch."""
42,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32960023-judith,5,"The third in PW's series and again excellently translated from the German by Jane Billinghurst, with bibliography incorporating articles and sources attainable in the US. In discussing the ecology of the woods and forests (mostly, though also the water sources of these places and grassy plains and agricultural sectors), PW shows how interconnected the environment is. Our solution to a problem plant/animal non-native is to release a bug that feeds on it, and to the problem (in our eyes) of an animal/plant we want to have more of (e.g. deer for hunters) is to put out feed, decrease predators, create more habitat that that animal/plant prefers. Rather we should be happy with what population numbers we have and not interfere. As PW points out, for centuries there has been in a way little or no non-interfered by humans area in Europe, so much of what we have ---or had 100 years ago--was hardly ""native"" ""normal"" ""unspoiled"". PW makes clear just how interwoven things are--in his first book he talked about the wood wide web, e.g. mother trees feeding their seedlings, healthy trees helping to support ailing neighbors. Here, he goes farther to discuss how the prolific mast years of tree nuts result in earthworms controlling the number of wild boar that feed on the nuts, how forests affect their local climate, rainfall, and use of water, the effects of increasing heat on trees and animals--from what we know of the interconnections of living things--and there is much that we do not know, even about common plants and animals. We know some of the interconnections, but much more likely are the great numbers of interconnections we don't know and do not have the resources or specialists to begin to tease out these interconnections. This volume is, I think, necessary to read; his exposition is clear, and his passion for nature is captivating."
43,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32507760-starman,4,"""The Secret Wisdom of Nature"" by Peter Wohlleben is an easy-to-read discussion of various topics in nature, especially related to interrelationships and the results of human interventions by Wohlleben, who seems to be a bit of a rogue forester at odds with the establishment. I'll say right off that I don't like the title. ""Secret Wisdom"" implies too much. I think what the book discusses are the natural processes in the outdoors, especially in forests, but they are not ""secret"" per se and the word ""wisdom"" is simply not applicable. Just because a system in deeply interconnected and inclusive does not make it ""wise"" or even intelligent. It is nature, the product of billions of years of evolution.However, particularly interesting are Wohlleben's observations and opinions about the way trees ""communicate"" with each other, how they migrate and the effects of human activity in forested areas. He also discusses the role of insects and microorganisms in the trees and soil, and gives some consideration to larger creatures such as birds, bears and deer. While his perspective is mainly European (German), I feel that the general considerations should be valid around the world.He also gets into the ideas of climate change and evolution.One thing that I noticed was that the book really seemed more from an observational ""woodsman"" than from a scientist, meaning that much of it seemed based as much on opinion and not-necessarily properly documented facts. This does not invalidate his ideas, but means that I think further research is in order.Nevertheless, I feel that much if not most of Wohlleben's observations and claims are true and real, and deserve consideration."
44,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5863458-andrea-mcdowell,4,"*103rd climate book*It's not predominantly about the climate emergency, of course, but it comes up as a dominant theme about the adaptability of natural systems in an era of climate disturbance, so I'm counting it.Wohlleben's books are lovely, written in an engaging and accessible manner and about ecological phenomena that otherwise don't get much discussion or coverage. That we really have no idea what we're doing or what the consequences will be when we interrupt or disrupt functioning ecosystems, due to our profound and continuing ignorance about how they work, is not well enough understood and his books add to that conversation enormously. Some of his arguments against received wisdom (eg. the chapter on fire in forests) were thought-provoking and useful.His discussion about what nature is, how it should be defined, I thoroughly disagree with, on both practical and ethical grounds. Practically, I can't see how we can justify any division between humans or their products and nature, given that we and our very strange brains are 100% the product of evolution and other natural processes. Yet he defines nature as something other than human, and indeed this division underlies most of his arguments. Ethically, the consequence of his argument--in his books, and elsewhere in the real world--is to assume that nature is better off without us, and to remove us from conservation areas etc. It's not just that this is nonsense, but that this perspective has been used to fuel absolutely destructive and racist practices for hundreds of years (eg. removing indigenous societies from their lands when they've been designated ""parks,"" for instance, which works to the detriment of both the indigenous societies and the ecosystems we claim to be protecting). It's not a large leap from this argument to eco-fascism. Humans aren't the problem; industrial economies are the problem. I enjoyed his books, and recommend them for their accessibility and genuinely amazing stories, but this is a big caveat that should be kept in mind as you read."
45,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12213552-nancy,4,"4.5This is the third and final book in German forester Peter Wohlleben's trilogy, The Mysteries of Nature. His first was The Hidden Life of Trees, the second  The Inner Life of Animals. This final offering, The Secret Wisdom of Nature, discussed the inter-relatedness of these diverse life forms including their dependence upon each other and unexpected communication between species. Wohllenben is often criticized for the emotion and empathy he displays for his subjects in his writing, accused by some scientists of extreme anthropomorphism. He addresses this issue himself but believes that it is only human to relate to the other organisms we share our planet with. Readers themselves will have to judge for themselves.I have read a number of dispassionate pure science books on these subjects and respected their objectivity for the information they transmitted. And yet I also appreciated that this author was able to go beyond the bare facts and speak with the excitement, passion, and wonder that many humans experience when exposed to the beauty, complexity, and diversity of living things. This series, and perhaps especially this particular book, speaks to all of us whether we have training in the sciences or not. It may lead some to delve more deeply into these subject but it will make many of us at least appreciate nature and respect it enough to let it be, to avoid needless, greedy exploitation of the natural world. I enjoyed this entire series, but perhaps this book most of all."
46,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19238769-kristin-eoff,5,"This was a very interesting book, if a little dry. It gets more entertaining toward the end, when it starts talking about how ""intimate"" relations between Homo sapiens and Neanderthals have led to some intriguing surprises in DNA results. Because the author is a forester in Europe, he unsurprisingly writes a lot about forests in Europe. Some of the takeaways I got from this book are that nature includes millions of tiny creatures, plants and fungi that most people know nothing about, and many that no scientists even know anything about. These life forms are all crucial, interconnected parts of this immense web of life on this planet, and what humans do affects countless life forms in complex and unpredictable ways. It's nearly impossible to know the extent, the ways, and the history of how exactly humans have affected other life forms on this planet, but it definitely is happening, and the best thing we can do is try to leave nature alone as much as possible to regulate itself. It's a sobering but important lesson. Very enlightening reading! It makes me want to learn even more about nature and try harder to minimize my impacts upon it."

You know what kind of pile I'm talking about; we all have one, we say we're still reading them but, while not yet quite a graveyard, it takes an act of powerful necromancy to revive. That in itself speaks volumes. This book is bursting with forest imagery that takes me back to wandering the woods of Austria, it's about intricate ecology, it advocates for leaving nature to its own devices and yet, it took a near *nine months* to pick it up again. It had everything going for it, and yet, I can't seem to connect to Wohlleben's writing. When I do read, I am filled with a brimming excitement for nature but it doesn't take long until it's grating on me and I put it down - finishing the second half without replacing it on the Pile was an effort. At a best explanation, I would say that it's choppy, a little too tangential, somewhat superficial and not nearly scientific enough. I had the same problem with his animal book, so while I can objectively see his huge popularity with laymen and I will be popping out fun-facts for months thanks to it, it's just a style not for me..."

Here and there I discovered a few interesting facts, but most points were repeated ad nauseam (Beware of interfering with nature’s very long process, doing so may lead to failure or unexpected consequences). The discussion on flora-fauna relationship and interdependence is very unbalanced toward the vegetable kingdom (I wanted to know more about feathered and furry creatures, while the author preference, when talking about animals, is on insects, which frankly are not my thing). In addition, a lot of the information on trees was material recycled from the first book. Given that the second book seems to be about Wohlleben’s observations of animals, and not based on actual science, I’m probably skipping the last book in this trilogy."
49,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1408078-david,4,Wohlleben takes us through the forests he loves and examines the interconnected life that thrives there. His love for the forest comes through in every sentence. The web of live he describes is so complex and multifaceted that our understanding of it rudimentary at best. Our attempts to reclaim forests and to exploit forests disturb the web in ways we can see and many ways we can’t.Wohlleben sees the impact of climate change on the forest. He makes an interesting observation. There have been times when the amount of carbon in the atmosphere was much greater - an order of magnitude greater - than it is predicted to be in the next 50 years. Yet life thrived. Why? The carbon was added to atmosphere over millions of years. We’re loading carbon into the atmosphere in just a couple of hundred years. Too fast for most life - especially the trees of the forest - to adapt.Wohlleben recommends we leave the largest areas possible undisturbed and simply let nature take care of things.
50,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63272779-brandon-ramsey,5,"The final installment of this series is as insightful and thought provoking as I’d hoped it would be. Peter Wohlleben explores the interconnectedness and interdependency of living things in the context of a deeper examination of what it means to be good stewards of the environment. A poignant read at a time when many people are scrambling to do something - anything - to mitigate the impacts of climate change.There are many ‘somethings’ we can do, but the reader is tasked with discerning whether or not we should particularly without knowing all of the variables. Nature has a remarkable capacity to self-regulate and perhaps, in our hubris, we fail to recognize that even well intentioned conservation can be harmful. For example - even the simplest act of laying out bird seed in the winter can change migratory patterns and could prove detrimental to a species in the long term by preserving and proliferating traits which should be weeded out through natural selection. Through such interference, we not only place the target species at long term risk but this risk extends to all of the other species which depend on them in their natural state. Peter makes a strong case for leaving nature to its own devices through such examples and challenges the reader to consider whether our empathetic desire to help does more harm than good. "
51,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72224931-jamie,4,"Peter Wohlleben brings magic to the outdoor world again. His love of Nature is second to none and it shows. In this one, he discusses the intricate relationship between living things and how even minute changes in our environment can have significant impacts to the system at large. I gave this one 4 stars because A) he repeats himself with information discussed in his previous two books and B) he has a tendency to anthropomorphize trees and animals as if they are sentient beings. This is a testament to his awe and respect towards these creatures -- which I respect -- but the sentences come off as unscientific and a little bit distracting. I am no authority on consciousness, and he very well may be true. But unless data proves otherwise, I think the book would still have kept its wonder and respect if he changed phrases like ""trees understand when X happens"" to ""trees have adapted to respond when X happens.""Nevertheless, the book is still filled with interesting information and proved to be a worthwhile read. I look forward to my next trip out in the wild."
52,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11426356-jerrid-kruse,3,"I didn’t like this book as much as I have the author’s other books. The spirit of the book remained in a similar path as past books (i.e.., that everything in nature is connected in really interesting and sometimes surprising ways). However, The book seemed to be a bit disconnected. The subtitle, “stories from science and observation” should have tipped me off, but I kept looking for the connections across chapters. Several of the chapters seemed incomplete as well....almost as though the author was writing as a stream of consciousness rather than his usually careful approach. One theme in this book that seemed to go beyond the author’s past books is the far-reaching connections amongst nature (e.g., dust from the Saraha landing in the Amazon or reforestation causing climate cooling). I hope the author continues to use their unique lens to explore other areas of the world. Right now, the bias toward forests in Central Europe is too noticeable. "

It is a fascinating story about nature, told the way you imagine your nature loving grandpa would tell it, as it bobs and weaves from its main points with small anecdotes and engrossing examples. The author says that critics of his book say he writes too emotionally, that he imbues nature and the beings with emotion and motivation and therefore the account can’t be trusted. But Wohlleben argues that we as humans deal and live and experience in emotion, so writing about nature without emotion would be like writing about humanity without emotion, which is impossible as all of our experience are colored by emotion, so how can we have so much Hubris to think there is no inner life to other living beings? Also we can relate so much better to what he tells us if the story includes an emotional and motivational thread. I can’t wait to read his other two books in the trilogy."

The topics he discussed stayed around in my brain for quite some time after reading, and his simplified language helps to better understand the material. Near the later chapters, he starts to speak about humans and their role in nature. Being an ecologist, of course he approached this from an ecological, more scientific approach. But I think such a discussion really needs to be looked at through an anthropological lens. Understanding humans and their complex history with nature can’t really be boiled down to “did one subset of humans in a really specific time and place once make an animal go extinct?” As great a job he does including indigenous peoples into his discussions, he doesn’t not analyse indigenous practices and how they relate to nature in answering what our role in nature is. Daniel Quinn does an excellent job at exploring this question (albeit in a much longer form.) The last few chapters felt like deadweight on what is a magnificent book."
56,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3944079-caitlin,3,"Wohlleben does a great job at weaving in examples of nature from multiple places around the world, though his focus points seem to mostly be his native Germany and also the United States. I was originally planning on reading The Hidden Life of Trees after hearing about it on a podcast, but instead I started with the audio version of The Secret Wisdom of Nature. I think some of my friends who live much more closely with nature on a daily basis would find this book very compelling. For my part, I sometimes struggled to keep my attention on the narration as I listened to it, but definitely found many of the discussions noteworthy, like one about the impact of light pollution and how outside lights should—whenever possible—be directed downward and of a certain color so as not to create confusion among bug populations.I find that I struggle to remember the details of specific examples from the book, but overall found it worthwhile and plan on reading his other books in the future."

It demonstrates how environmental issues and problems are generally more complex than they seem on the surface or as reported in the media and by many environmental groups. He holds that nature itself can often bring about a better solution than human interventions, which are often superficial, addressing symptoms rather than causes, and which are often influenced by various special interests. It makes you realize how simplistic and knee-jerk a lot of popular thinking about environmental problems are, most of the problems arising because people have disrupted the natural order or want to keep the environment frozen in its current state. A worthwhile read though I enjoyed his first two books more."

But when he’s seeing the forest for the trees Wohlleben is at his best - unapologetically connecting emotions back to our primeval environment. His message is largely to leave nature alone and she’ll get back on her feet as she always has. It’s a tough if not impossible task, but something I’ll at least always have in mind when altering the landscape around me. And knee-jerk reactions to “save the environment” will take more thought. What are we trying to save? Which stage of our brutality towards nature was the perfect one? And if we don’t let nature have her say, eventually we’ll kill off our own aggressive species and then she’ll have some breathing room to work. "

I particularly enjoyed the discussions of over zealous conservationists trying to rearrange natural environments to 'restore' wildlife that was never actually there 10,000 years ago. This is because of the way the glaciers had stripped Europe of trees during the last ice age. Therefore Capercaillies would not have been in the areas these people are trying to reforest.Wohleben always looks to the future to discuss what humans can do to have less impact on wildlife. The idea of having street lights facing downwards and turned off sooner in mornings, to stop birds and insects being confused, is genius. I have one more book of Wohleben's to read and I can't wait."

This is due to the weight of the leaves being moved closer to the Center of the Earth. Another is that malls fly around lights because they're trying to keep ""the moon"" on one side for navigation purposes. Yet another is that bacteria deep in the earth can live to be over 2000 years old. The author's views on climate change and our role in it are also interesting.

He discussed the unintended (and some intended) consequences of humankind's actions when dealing with nature and how sometimes they can be overcome, and sometimes not. In the end, despite the many ways people have interfered with natural processes, it was a hopeful book. And it challenges the reader to think about trees, animals - all of nature, really - in a different way.Highly recommended and now I want to go back and read the first two books in the trilogy."
62,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79272479-excuse-all-the-blood,4,"Wohlleben’s charming observations and tales artfully puts nature on display as a intricately woven cloth - every strand reliant on a million others. His main concern here is to show how a single snagged strand can unravel the entire tapestry. As a conservationist, Wohlleben seems to struggle with his own career here in this book as he shows us the devastation any amount of human meddling can have on nature, even if the intents are “good”. The Secret Wisdom of Nature held me both in awe of the complexity and deep symbiosis of all parts of wildlife and sadness (horror?) in the irreversible parasitic effect man has on it. "
63,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51469023-rebecca,1,"DNF - This book should have been reviewed by a qualified ecologist. There are so many details I knew to be misleading that I started to doubt other details too. The book is poorly researched and biased. The humanisation, heralding and vilification of certain processes made it unbearable to read. Not to mention the fact that it’s so terribly written I had no idea what points the writer was trying to make sometimes. Some sentences didn’t even make sense in context. I majored in ecology and used to work for a university in that space. I was so excited to be reinspired by this book but I was only left disappointed."
64,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7333215-sandra-schonwetter,5,"There are more connections between expected things and unexpected things than we know in nature. And BTW, what is nature? What is the connection between nature and culture? Did you know that wolves and crows treat each other like family members? With a name like peter wohlleben, you are bound to learn about life. His silky smooth voice has magnetic qualities. I recommend to listen to this while walking in a forest. This is magical. The world opens up before your very eyes. There are connections before your eyes that you can never imagine. Nature is resilient and by the way, it doesn’t really need us. We actually need it. Let’s get that relationship aligned. I love these books!"

Sometimes I thought I could see him winking at me! In his acknowledgements, he praises the translator for capturing ""not only the meaning of the words I write, but also the tone I wish to convey."" I have previously read ""The Hidden Life of Trees,"" which put up my antenna for this book, a third in this series, ""The Inner Life of Animals,"" which is on my ""To Read"" list. He has a lot to say about how flora and fauna have adapted/evolved to protect themselves. How humans have or have not interfered with evolution was especially interesting to me. "

I always ending up learning something about nature I didn't know before - which is fun! The author focuses on European forests mostly, which means I can't apply everything I learn to where I live; but it's neat to read about it anyway. The author also somehow managed to make me feel a bit better about climate change, even if it's in an ""the natural world will outlive whatever we throw at it, even if we don't"" way!"

And the way this book was written made it easy for me to keep reading. I loved it. Definitely recommend this to anyone who's curious about how our ecosystems work and how things are actually changing and being affected by climate change. A lot to think about, and also a lot of hope that there are ways we can fix this that don't necessarily mean going back to the stone age. "
68,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7522543-roger-deblanck,4,"Wohlleben’s passion resonates in each of these stories for the conservation and preservation of the natural world and its marvelously delicate ecosystems. As a rancher and man of the outdoors, his observations and experiences allow us to see how human decisions impact the balance of the planet. With that said, some of the narratives felt a little piecemeal and disjointed in their composition. Nonetheless, Wohlleben shares fascinating details about how every plant and animal, big and small, can inherently impact our lives and how even the slightest imbalance can have profound ramifications."
69,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2340543-gabe-barber,4,"Full of insightful layers of understanding of the interconnected nature of all living and non-living things. A lot of food for thought and even a hopeful note at the end, amid a sea of devastation wrought by human interference with nature. Essentially we need to just leave things alone as much as possible, and in due time nature can and will correct itself. Far easier said than done, as humanities history clearly belies. I'm hopeful, not in a pollyannish way, that my sons will see the turning of the corner. If only because the alternative is far too horrible to imagine."
70,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19965638-meg-pierce,3,"I think I would’ve enjoyed this book more if I hadn’t majored in Biology. The stories included were well told, but unfortunately many of them were well-known to me. His personal stories were very enjoyable though. I much preferred the Hidden Life of Trees overall, since I never fully appreciated them and avoided plant biology as much as possible. Also, I believe the Hidden Life of Trees highlights the authors unique expertise. Highly recommend to those who simply enjoy nature and wish to know a bit more about what is going on around them. "
71,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51560330-rebecca-howe,3,"This novel is the informal ending to a trilogy by Peter Wohlleben about forests and the species that inhabit them. While I've found his view of animals a bit too anthropomorphic I truly enjoyed his first novel and thought his second was engaging. The Secret Wisdom of Nature is less organized than the first two books, and suffered for it. It is written on the themes of interconnections and appreciation, similarly to the other books, but jumps from topic to topic too frequently. While still an enjoyable book, I think this was the weakest of the three."
72,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5862514-cathy-gulkin,3,"Although this book has many charming stories and lots of very interesting information in it it, is nowhere near as well written as his previous two books: ""The Hidden life of Trees"" and ""The Inner Life of Animals"". It really feels like he phoned it in on this third book. It just jumped all over the place and was often confusing. I'd encourage everyone to read Diana Beresford-Kroeger's book ""To Speak for the Trees: My Life's Journey from Ancient Celtic Wisdom to a Healing Vision of the Forest"" if they want to go deeper into the scientific basis for the interconnectedness of all things. "
73,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38653357-anastasia,4,"I appreciate listening to books not based in North America. This non fiction title is a look at nature primarily in Europe and specifically Germany. He discusses so many topics about forests that I see in the news headlines: forest fires, logging, bird migration, conservation of animal species, changing weather patterns, animal feeding programs. All of it in relation to the forests and how they are managed today. One question that keeps surfacing is do we really know what we are doing? I found it thought provoking and will be listening to the other books in the series."
74,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15933073-emilee,5,"My absolute favorite thing about this author is his ability to speak to me through the book in such a way that feels as if i'm having a conversation with him rather than just reading his book. Some of the ideas he speaks of in this book were unheard of to me. For example, he talks about bark beetles not being inherently bad because they destroy many many trees. Instead, they are only taking advantage of the upper hand we, as humans, have given them through climate change and the industrialized forest industry. "
75,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6844864-mike,2,"Very...mixed. The first 2/3 were what you might expect - fascinating descriptions of the intricate connections among species. The last 1/3 was a sort of tangential departure into theories of historical human impacts on nature and the author’s weighing in on super deep questions of German forestry management. It felt like part natural history, part extended letter to the editor. I enjoyed it but would be hard to recommend. I found myself looking forward to it being finished. "
76,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1909242-dan-carey,4,"For me, this book only suffers by comparison with The Hidden Life of Trees: What They Feel, How They Communicate – Discoveries from a Secret World, which (at the risk of hyperbole) was life-changing. But there's plenty to mull over here, presented in Wohlleben's enjoyable style."
77,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9856237-valerie,5,"Nature Needs Nurture Another outstanding, amazing reading excursion deep in the world we share space with all life. We need to feel admiration, respect and gratitude for every species. The author’s passion is articulated by intense research and thought provocative ideas. The more I read it, the more I wondered who’s the wiser...trees or humans. His books raise questions that only time can answer."
78,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5564802-gail-richmond,3,"The third book in Wohlleben’s Mysteries of Nature trilogy, this title covers a lot of ground, perhaps a bit superficially with some references to his earlier works. This title did not hold my attention as completely as The Hidden Life of Trees, which was outstanding, perhaps because it tries to cover so many topics where further research must be done to reveal the answers to questions and to formulate solutions to continuing challenges."
79,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16694334-sherri-anderson,3,"I am not sure how to rate this book, 3, 3 1/2, 4. I got the unpublished edition so editing was still being done. The translation from German to English may have caused some confusion in the way things were discussed which made it frustrating. But once I got use to the style I started to enjoy the book more. It made me want to do more research in the various topics discussed. The strongest points were made in the forests sections. "
80,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3530440-anne,4,"This is part three of the nature trilogy written by the German forester Peter Wohlleben. This focus of this volume is the complexity of natural systems. The author makes it clear that we (human society as a whole, including scientists) have very little understanding of such systems and shouldn't mess with them because such interference will almost certainly have unintended consequences.Maybe we should listen to him?"
81,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97214200-anna-o-tarzewska,4,"3.5I really enjoyed ""Hidden life of trees"", but this book left me slightly dissapointed. There are plenty of intetesting facts and you can tell that the author is a real nature lover, but the whole thing seemed a bit chaotic to me. I had to reread some sentences to get their meaning, even though the book is pretty straightforward - I don't know if it's poor writing or just translation errors. Apart from that it's an interesting, light read."
82,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1300439-paula,4,"Wohlleben is one of the best nature writers that I've read. His stories draw you in, as he personalizes the facts with his experiences in the forest he manages. He also enlivens it by making endangered species into characters with which we can sympathize. His forest comes alive with interesting characters struggling for existence, and nurturing their children. A lovely portrait of what we should be striving to achieve."

I loved the first one (Hidden Life of Trees), was not as impressed with the second one (Inner Life of Animals), and really liked this one, but not al well as the first. He talked about the interconnection between trees, animals, fungi and people. There is much we do not know about this interconnection and since people are so self-oriented, will probably never be well known. I enjoyed this book."
84,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20084315-michael-parker,4,"I like this book a lot. It is one forest keeper's musings on the true nature of the forest, both original old growth and modern-day industry-designed. Everything is connected, and things are seldom as they seem, out there in what we deem ""nature."" Wohlleben's tract is a bold exploration down to the molecular nitty gritty of how it really is in the big green."
85,1771643889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64395852-david,3,I found parts of this book quite fascinating and other parts over my head. In truth I find his discussion of trees and forests quite intriguing but I an just not that interested in insects though I get it that they are all related.

Which is fine, but it wasn't what I was expecting or hoping for."

Ch. 2- Salmon in the trees. is worth checking out if nothing else! If you can't get your hands on the book, peep this article :) http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?..."

Maybe I read them too close together and they contained similar information in all three. Perhaps I'll go back and read it at a later time. "

His first book about trees is fascinating; this one seems to have been written to meet the demand of publishing deadlines."
