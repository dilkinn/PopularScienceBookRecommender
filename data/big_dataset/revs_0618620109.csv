0,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9968594-maria,5,"One of my most admired scientists is Dr. Eric Kandel, not only for his research work regarding the reductionist molecular approach of how our memory works (which got him the Nobel in Physiology or Medicine in the year 2000), but also for his remarkable ability explaining in such an elegant prose how our mind works through art perception. This book is not about Dr. Kandel's life or scientific contributions, but the reason I dare to open with this information is because the author, Jonah Leher worked in the laboratory with Dr. Kandel and Dr. Si during this pivotal time, reason enough for me to submerge into this book without hesitation and I can pleasantly say that it surpassed my expectations. Proust was a Neuroscientist is a book about artists, writers, musicians and painters, that anticipated many discoveries of our brain functioning through their work. This juxtaposition of art and science has now been used by many neuroscientists to understand more about our brain. But how is possible that artists such as Marcel Proust, Goerge Elliot, Paul Cézanne or Virginia Woolf could predict how our mind works? Can art give us a better closeness to our consciousness than the reductionist approach of neuroscience? On each chapter, the author introduces the reader with a short biography about the artist's life and their work to grasp a better understanding of the their insight and influence. Then, the author uses their contributions to explain a specific function of the brain and how these artists were right in their own way. I think Jonah Lehrer successfully accomplished to demonstrate through his prose, an ability to understand each of the artist's work and put in simple words its application in different areas of Neuroscience. All of the chapters are enjoyable and interesting. In George Elliot, I was surprised to know about Charles Darwin's influence on her writting after reading ""On the origing of Species"" and how she defied the social physics of her day, more specific positivism through ""Middlemarch"". After a good insight about her work Leher brings the association of Middlemarch's characters and neuroplasticity. As George Elliot says: ""It's never too late to be what you might have been"".As with George Elliot and Neuroplasticity, with Marcel Proust the reader will de introduced into the complex and fascinating topic of Memory; which I honestly expected an extension of Dr. Si and Kandel's research work on memory as being part of the laboratory staff working on this project. Nevertheless, the information it is accurate and perfectly ending with the CBEP proteins in memory, a protein that (according to Kandel Journal of Neuroscience 2009) functions like a Prion. The chapter on Gertrude Stein is also fascinating, her social life surrounded by people such as Picasso, Hemingway or Matisse and other intelligentsia learning from each other is almost like a dream which reminds me of early Vienna 1900's when artists and scientists met to exchange ideas. Gertrude Stein, was a medical student but loved the art of writing, as she enjoyed playing with words she approached linguistics and preceded Noam Chomsky, who sayd that Stein was right.... ""A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose"". Virginia Wool, an admirer of Albert Einstein, approaches consciousness through her characters but, albeit scientific explanations of our mind, she never stopped believing in the importance of what art can say about us, au contraire of evolutionary psychologists such as Steven Pinker. Also, through the chef Auguste Escoffier, the sensation of taste and the umami receptors is also a delight!As I previously mentioned, Eric Kandel also approaches the function of the mind through expressionism art In Vienna and its impact on Psychology and Neuroscience. Through artists such as Klimt, Kokoschka, Schiele, Schnitzler and Freud, Kandel explains how our perception of artwork can lead us to understand the way we think and feel. If you liked ""Proust was a Neuroscientist"", you do not want to miss ""The Age of Insight"" by a genius in the field of Neuroscience. I'm unaware of Kandels influence on Lehrer towards this book, but as his mentor and similitudes of both books I suppose there obviously is one. This one being a lighter version. Both are highly recommendable to anyone interested in science and art history and in understanding a little more about how our mind works! I enjoy this kind of books for two reasons. First, because Im fascinated in understanding more about how our brain functions, how we think, how we feel and how each one of us apart from being formed basically by the same chemical formula, we are completely different in our own way. Genetics, epigenetics, environment, neurochemistry... all of these define who we are but it is through art that we get to understand how each one of us think and behave the way we do, individually. Art + science, a hedonistic and interesting combination. Secondly, it gives me a different and wider perspective of an artist's work and enhances me to put attention in details that I might have been missing. Now, I know what to expect from Proust or Gertrude Stein, and what to look for when I re-read Virginia Woolf or enjoy the musical dissonance my brain goes through each time I play Stravinsky's ""The Rite""."
1,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,3,"I went into this thinking 1) it was going to be ALL about Proust and 2) I kinda know what Jonah Lehrer is going to say and 3) it will maybe be 3 to 4 stars. But damn. I both over and underestimated it. Crazy brain. I REALLY liked its structure: Proust was one chapter, but there were chapters on Virginia Woolf, Gertrude Stein, Walt Whitman, Paul Cézanne, Igor Stravinsky, etc.. He exceeded my expectations, kept me engaged, and even his Coda at the end was strong. Sometimes, it did feel a bit forced. Like he REALLY wanted Virginia Woolf to be able to explain the self so bad, but it was enjoyable as far as delivering an argument (with few citations). It wasn't a perfect little book, but it was fun. HOWEVER --I DO, unfortunately, have to re-evaluate an author by his later looseness with Bob Dylan*. See:https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news...* thanks Maukan"
2,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"Lehrer used to be a lab technician in a neuroscience lab. His lab work involved investigating memory. He would read Proust while waiting for his experiments to finish. Then it dawned to him that Proust was right about memory long before modern neuroscience got it right. And that was the forming idea for this book. Lehrer describes a few artists and their works to show that a lot of times artists discover truths about human nature while scientists of their time still have it wrong. Art foretelling science. These are the artists that he discusses and their particular insight into human mind.1. Walt Whitman’s poetry implies that our emotions and sensations are not solely produced by the brain, but involve our entire body. There’s a body-brain loop that goes both ways between sensations and emotions. 2. George Elliot rejected the mechanical and deterministic worldview of her time and believed in something that is close to what is now called neuroplasticity.3. The French chef Auguste Escoffier (he’s the guy who invented menu) was ahead of the narrow understanding that the biologists of his time had of the sense of taste. 4. Marcel Proust knew that recollection is inseparable from memory. The act of remembering can alter the memory. 5. Paul Cezanne’s painting tried to show that vision is not like a picture getting sent accurately to the brain through camera-like eyes. Seeing involves a great amount of post-processing by the brain of the signals that eyes send. 6. Igor Stravinsky understood how the brain expects patterns and how denying these pattern causes conflict and pain. He also knew that the mind was plastic and over time dissonance becomes consonance.7. Gertrude Stein’s deliberately “nonsensical” writing was an attempt to show that the structure of the language was unavoidable. This was 50 years before Chomsky and at a time when behaviorism claimed to explain language as well.8. Virginia Wolf’s characters demonstrate the idea of an emerging self. We continually emerge and construct our self from the scraps of our sensations. Self is an illusion that we invent by turning our sensory inputs into consciousness. Most chapters are an interesting and informative mix of art history and science. As for the Lehrer’s main thesis – artists being ahead of science of their time – in some chapter you can see a case, but in others Lehrer just seems to be forcing it. I have an issue with Lehrer's overall methodology to begin with. If you pick any artist (doesn’t have to be Proust – any half-decent one will do as well) and study their works and look hard enough, you’ll find something that they were right about and arguably ahead of their time. So what? What does it really prove?"
3,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1098175-tim,5,"Proust Was a Neuroscientist turned out to be the book I'd been looking to read for a long time. Apparently there have been quite a few books prior to this one about the ""third culture,"" the bridge between art and science (and unfortunately I've not read any of them) —Lehrer mentions E.O. Wilson's 
Consilience
 and Ian McEwan's 
Saturday
 (a kind of update on Virginia Woolf's 
Mrs. Dalloway
) as unsuccessful and successful works on the subject, respectively— but I was very pleased with the scope and depth of this book, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the workings of the human brain, memory and perception, especially as they apply to the arts. I found it super fascinating, and a very rewarding read. Lehrer writes the concepts with enough detail to be interesting, but in language plain enough that you won't have to spend time looking up extra information or texts unless you want to.I did feel that Lehrer romanticizes the artists in the book slightly, (possibly because he's less an artist than a scientist?) the artists surely receive less criticism for their ideas (which in the book are usually validated decades later by science, oops, spoiler) than the equivalent scientists which in some cases are painted as misguided logicals swayed by the slightest change in fashionable thought. I'm not saying I disagree completely, just that there isn't as much criticism of the prevalent arts assumptions as there could be (there is some, particularly around Cezanne and the attitudes of the Impressionists) and it may be slightly misleading.I do very much agree with Lehrer's main idea in the book: Science is a kind of foreign language, a type of overlay built on to the human experience—molded by humans but external, separated from humans by it's precision: mathematics, theorems, equations. It speaks of what we experience but not in the way we experience it. Art, on the other hand, far more fluid and subjective, speaks in the terms of humans. It allows us to use our own internal language to express and understand the world, in context, in focus, and in the most meaningful way possible. Our way. For me, an entire book about that— the single most important thing in my life, was really excellent."
4,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2801988-k,2,"This book appeared unsolicited in my mailbox from a bookworm friend and instantly, I could tell, I would consume it in one sitting: a slim paperback with a commercial-pop cover design, Oliver Sacks endorsement, and incongruous title-cum-slogan. Ah, yes, every nerd’s most guilty pleasure – an instantaneous sugar high of easy information. Intrigue me with the revelation of some vague underlying life pattern! Enlighten me with the minimum amount of detail! Break down this world into consumable nuggets and spoon-feed it to me bit by bit! But then, like with any sugary treat, the pleasure ends with the final bite. Jonah Lehrer’s Proust Was a Neuroscientist ambles through the highlights of turn-of-the-century artistic modernism in celebration of the artists (Walt Whitman, Cezanne, etc.) who hit upon a basic series of now-proven neuro-truths (the body is governed by electric pulses, our brain translates sight into what we see, etc.), and what a lovely idea – this English degree is worth something after all! Art and literature are worthy teachers of human behavior, as sharp as any scientist. I hummed happily through, put the book down, and couldn’t name all eight featured artists for all the beer in Belgium.PWAN is a brief and friendly jaunt, direct and subtly repetitive, with all the trademark short sentences and clipped humor of a well-studied Gladwellian. Lehrer may have taken a few English classes in college between lab periods, but his literary influence is much more Contemporary Middlebrow than Modernist. The Library of Congress lists PWAN under “neuroscience and the arts” when truly it belongs under the category we can surely by now recognize as “instant non-fiction best-seller – life’s complexity simply explained.”PWAN belongs on the American coffeetable besides The Tipping Point, The Black Swan, The Wisdom of Crowds, The Long Tail, The World is Flat, Outliers, Better, Blink, Sway, Nudge and, of course, Freakonomics, that smug schoolboy, the sly pied piper that started it all.I don’t really mean to be flip or dismissive. Like I said, this stuff is genuine candy to a bookgeek – so light and tasty! But so not filling. It must be said once and for all that the non-fiction best-seller list has turned into a literary manifestation of every yuppie’s most loved/hated cocktail game: the Smartest Guy in the Room. I can’t wait to sit around some IKEA’d studio with a bacon-wrapped date and a glass of screw-top red and hear someone mention off-hand that they simply cannot stand Gertrude Stein, but then again wasn’t she prescient? “Anticipated Chomsky, I believe.” Freakonomics, what hath you wrought? Lehrer might resent the Freakonomics classification. He wants to be taken seriously – academically seriously. His coda addresses the tired Two Cultures debate made widespread by scientist and novelist CP Snow’s 1959 assertion that the academy falsely separates science and art into distinct and distant categories. Lehrer notes the increasing salability of “the third culture,” a series of science writers like Richard Dawkins and Brian Greene who make bank translating black holes and genes into accessible prose. But Lehrer wants to be distinct from them as well. These writers are a bridge between the scientific community and the ignorant public, not between the two cultures. These writers want to dominate the humanities’ view of the world, not welcome it. Lehrer advocates a fourth culture, one that recognizes the limits of science because “we now know enough to know that we will never know everything. This is why we need art: it teaches us how to live with mystery. […:] Sometimes there is no answer.” Lehrer wants this book to show “how art and science might be reintegrated into an expansive critical sphere.” Then why does its back cover crow that the book he produced is “a riveting tale of art trumping science again and again”?The thing is, Lehrer doesn’t integrate art and science. He pits them against each other. He wants “to tell a different story,” not investigate the true subject matter at hand – neurology. Lehrer has taken a wide gamut of fascinating material and worthwhile connections and shoehorned them into a simplified narrative as if he’s revealing a new story of science: Look, these artists anticipated science! They hit upon concepts that big bad serious science is only re-discovering now! Lehrer is trying to prove the validity of art by virtue of its prescience, and it’s all marketing spin job. In truth, of course, art and science have been grappling with the nature of being for literally ages. There is no reason to boost up French chef Auguste Escoffier as the inventor of umami when in reality he was simply another contributor to our general understanding of taste, so why not simply fold in Escoffier and to a chapter about taste? This is where a smart, non-mainstream editor steps in. The needless narrative frame exacerbates PWAN’s cutesy Gladwellian tone, and a mound of promising material is boxed into something false and mass-marketable. It’s also a false opposition. Art v. science is meaninglessly broad. There’s literature, and there’s physics, and there’s politics, and there’s chemistry, and there’s cinema, and there’s sociology and all the other various soft and hard and imaginary departments in between. These distinctions are arbitrary and fluid – thus the ever-popular interdisciplinary studies – Lehrer himself ought to realize this. His interest in “bridging the culture gap” stems from his own multi-disciplinary education. The Times’ DT Max fills out Lehrer’s distinguished background: Rhodes scholar, neuroscience lab fellow, and Le Cirque line chef, not to mention magazine editor and New Yorker contributor and all by 25. (Max aptly sums up Lehrer as “one of those young people who turn up in articles on how life is now so competitive that children no longer have time for jump-rope or adolescents for baby-sitting,” and I confess, my own knee-jerk eye-rolls are 100% petty.) What hobby more full embodies the twin loves of science and art than gourmet cooking?Really, I don’t think Lehrer means to create a “fourth culture,” or even prove to an indifferent public that Stein anticipated Chomsky. Lehrer’s main case here is for how clever he is. He is so clever, in fact, that he’s changed the rules of our unceasing parlor game. The Smartest Guy in the Room is no longer the sly explicator of behavioral anomalies a la Leavitt or Gladwell or Sunstein. He’s the guy who’s fluent in science and art. He’s the scientist who escapes the monotony of the lab with long sessions of Proust (as if that’s any less monotonous).The book, meanwhile, deserves a little more summary. My highlights: - Walt Whitman,”The Substance of Feeling” – Whitman emphasized a physical mind-body connection now being elaborated by Antonio Damasio. Rather basic. Fun fact: who knew that Whitman was a volunteer nurse in the civil war? (or, rather, “wound-dresser,” as Lehrer so masculinely puts it)- George Eliot, “The Biology of Freedom” – Eliot “believed that the mind’s ability to alter itself was the source of our freedom”; neurogenesis and neural plasticity suggest that biology thrives on disorder. Rather tenuous. Fun fact: Eliot was a famously ugly woman – “magnificently ugly,” according to Henry James. “Deliciously hideous.”- August Escoffier, “The Essence of Taste” – Escoffier soaked everything in veal stock because he loved him the savory even though it wasn’t recognized as one of the four flavors. Meanwhile, in 1907, Kikunae Ikeda distilled MSG from seaweed and dubbed it umami. Awesome intro to umami; not really so much to do with Escoffier.- Marcel Proust, “The Method of Memory” – Our brain create our memories with every recollection. Yep. Hate to say duh.- Paul Cezanne, “The Process of Sight” – Our brain creates our sight by interpreting our visual input. Sounds good.- Igor Stravinksy, “The Source of Music” – Holy cow am I happy that I’ve never heard the Rite of Spring. This douche sounds like the kind of artiste that needs a good punch in the face. The sound of music “before the arising of beauty”? Count me out; check, please.- Gertrude Stein, “The Structure of Language” – I’ve never understood the allure of Stein’s gibberish and Lehrer comes as close to explaining it to me as any unlucky English prof. Stein wanted to separate language from the yoke of “having to say something,” but found that she couldn’t. Chomsky looked at how words are inescapably attached to meanings and came upon the concept of innate grammar. Compelling, but oh so very boring and even more useless. Fun fact: Who knew that Gertrude Stein got her start in the psych lab of William frickin James? - Virginia Woolf, “The Emergent Self” – I wrote my own pompous thesis about Woolf and Dalloway in college and Lehrer expands commendably on one of my favorite moments, when Clarissa looks in the mirror and sees that “some effort, some call on her to be her, drew the parts together.” Lovely, and very descriptive of the self, of the many parts and pieces that pull in so many different directions. And some or other neuroscientist then backs her up.So, congratulations, Lehrer, add “published best-seller” to your meaty young resume. But a final note for future publications. They say to never judge a book by its cover. I tend to go ahead and judge anyway, because whatever, but in any case the title is always fair game for judgment. And this title, it must be said, is tellingly insipid. Proust wasn’t a neuroscientist. Proust was fanatically neurotic. Proust was a megalomaniacal whining momma’s boy. This would have been a far more fascinating book if Lehrer would not have skimped over such context but instead gone in without a point to prove. Forget the scientific method and go in like a good historian: draw the conclusion from the facts, rather than rearrange them for the sake of the hypothesis."
5,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/798965-jenna-los,3,"The premise of this book is great, but the author fails to make good enough connections half the time. A few of the chapters are fabulous and he should have quit while he was ahead, but I suppose that would have left a short book. My advice is to only read these chapters: 3 - Auguste Escoffier and The Essence of Taste (best chapter); 4 - Marcel Proust and The Method of Memory; and Igor Stravinsky and The Source of Music (2nd best chapter). Chapters 5 & 7 are also okay if you have more time, but skip the rest."
6,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/533671-steve,4,"A fun and quick read that attempts to show how late-19th and early-20th Century artists presaged modern neuroscience. Each artist gets his or her own chapter and is paired with a scientific correlate. Here is the order of the pairings:1) Walt Whitman - Feeling2) George Eliot - Freedom3) Auguste Escoffier - Taste4) Marcel Proust - Memory5) Paul Cezanne - Sight6) Igor Stravinsky - Music7) Gertrude Stein - Language8) Virginia Woolf - SelfMy only major problem with the book is that the author repeats his distaste for scientific reductionism. By the final chapter, there was no need to describe his beliefs about reductionism that had become clear from the preceding 8 chapters. "
7,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1392534-catherine,1,"You have no idea how much it pains me to dislike a book that Oliver Sacks hails as brilliant, but dear god, I found this tepid, unproven, and faintly ridiculous in turn. Lehrer never actually proves his thesis - that artists of several kinds anticipated the discoveries of neuroscience by several decades. Instead he describes a neuroscientific discovery and reads back into the work of selected artists a definitive revelation they never sought or articulated - the cause and effect he sees plainly does not match. Worse, he locates those revelations entirely in the Western world - the idea that Walt Whitman understood that the brain and body are mutually dependent in creating our experience of the world and - he intimates - understood it first would likely come as quite a shock to, say, the Buddhists and Hindus of the East who have been exploring the mind-body connection in practice, song, chant, and art for centuries. Similarly, Escouffier made fantastic stock - I am quite convinced of this fact. That Escouffier did so because he understood something about how the brain works rather than because he just thought things tasted better with bouquet garni, however? I'm unconvinced.There's also some shady science in this text, although I'm not sure if it's because Lehrer is getting the science completely wrong or simply because his writing is imprecise. When talking of Civil War soldiers experiencing phantom limb pain, for example, Lehrer argues that the persistence of pain in no-longer-existent body parts showed that ""Since soul is body and body is soul, to lose a part of one's body is to lose a part of one's soul. . . . The mind cannot be extricated from its matter, for mind and matter, these two seemingly opposite substances, are impossibly intertwined."" (14-15) I don't question the sentiment, but I do question its applicability to phantom limb pain, which neuroscience has proven to be wholly and irrevocably a matter of the brain acting alone - of over-active cells, of physical memory, all of which can be erased if the brain is tricked into thinking it has a limb again (mirror therapy is used to treat the phantom limb pain of amputees returning from Afghanistan and Iraq). Similarly, he writes that early 19th century scientist LaPlace ""knew that two astronomers plotting the orbit of the same planet at the same time would differ reliably in their data. The fault was not in the stars, but in ourselves."" Yet we know, thanks to quantum physics, that two astronomers plotting the orbit of the same planet can differ reliably in their data because time does not move in all places and at all times at the same pace. Is Lehrer claiming only that LaPlace put things down to human error, or that we still consider ourselves to be the problem, and not the stars (and, clearly, not the space-time continuum, which is the real issue).I am no scientist - all of this knowledge is gleaned from a somewhat obsessive love of the science articles in The New Yorker - but this (and Lehrer's claim that a bird is a mammal) made me question his other scientific claims.I was also bored. But that almost seems by the by."
8,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a truly perceptive book, about the linkages between art/language/music/cooking/writing and the science of the brain. Each chapter focuses on a different artist, and the insights of his/her artistry into the workings of the brain. I especially appreciated the chapter about Escoffier, the French chef who invented the concept of a restaurant menu. He discovered and put to use the taste of umami, a distinct reaction of taste buds to glutamate. He had a deep understanding about the effects of the smell and appearance of foods on people's appetites. His ideas preceded their acceptance by scientists by many years. The chapter on Igor Stravinsky was also fascinating. He realized that the sense of dissonance in music is temporary. Over time, exposure to dissonance makes the dissonant sound become acceptable, and even beautiful. Therefore, he composed The Rite of Spring to be utterly shocking to the tastes of the contemporary public. He wanted to ensure that the shock value would last for some time, before his music had a chance to become ""beautiful""."
9,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155124-jennifer-guzman,4,"Jonathan Lehrer examines the avante garde work of eight artists -- one poet (Walt Whitman), four novelists (George Eliot, Marcel Proust, Gertrude Stein, and Virginia Woolf), one painter (Paul Cezanne), one composer (Igor Stravinsky), and one chef (Auguste Escoffier) -- and shows how it anticipated scientific principles that would later be discovered. The eight essays are absorbing, and Lehrer writes about science in a way that is accessible and enlightening for those more familiar with the humanities. His literary interpretations of works like Middlemarch, In Search of Lost Time, and To the Lighthouse do not stray from traditional readings and offer anything new as far as literary criticism goes, but that's not really in the scope of this book.The weakest chapter is that on George Eliot, in which he seeks to show that Eliot's rejection of the determinist philosophy of her time is borne out not only in her writing but in the science of DNA. However, in seeking to show that we have biological freedom, Lehrer overlooks that we, like the characters in Eliot's novels, have free will but are born into unalterable circumstance and are affected by forces outside our control -- such as the choices of others and nature (as the characters of Eliot's The Mill on the Floss could tell us).The balance of the book is very strong, however, and I particularly enjoyed the chapters on Whitman, Stravinsky and Woolf. The inseparability of body and mind, the neuroscience of music, and the construction of consciousness are all elegantly explored and explained.The final chapter is a ""coda"" in which Lehrer expresses a wish for a ""fourth culture"" that will ""freely transplant knowledge between the sciences and the humanities, and will focus on connecting the reductionist fact to our actual experience."" He is very persuasive, and a desire to better understand how science can enlighten art and art can enlighten science is what led me to his book in the first place. I do find, though, that Lehrer can be too positive about the limits of science; he writes, ""It is naive to think that science can solve everything by itself, or that everything can be solved."" Too often I've seen in centuries-old writing the opinion that we would never discover something that today we have, such as what stars are made of and how they burn. I agree that there are limits to our knowledge now, and that art helps us delve through those limitations, but I do not think it follows that we will not someday understand and know what we don't today. I think it is better to say that art helps us to discover what we do not yet understand and know, and once those problems are solved, it will discover more. Art is the guide for our increasing knowledge, leading us to new paths of inquiry.I do not agree with Lehrer on everything, but I value this book for that very reason. Where I disagree with him leads me to think things out for myself, and the fascinating work he does linking art and science inspires me to read more, to learn more."
10,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4005044-oroboros72,2,"I think that Lehrer's thesis is flawed. When he says that art is ahead of science, it doesn't really mean anything to me. Proust describes a connection between smell and memory before neuroscientists demonstrated that there was one, but that is not because he is an artist or because he had some special insight into memory that scientists couldn't or didn't have. He describes memory in this way because he is a human and that is how the memory system is set up. Before Proust, I am sure many many people observed that smells could evoke strong and overwhelming memories. It's not that art is ahead of neuroscience, it's that humans with brains do art and the way the brain works determines how art comes out. The thesis seems like this to me ""cave men made pictures using red and green, and color science later showed that green and red are complimentary colors, so cave men were way ahead of science."" It's just a pretty meaningless thing to say. Despite my disagreement with the thesis, I actually really enjoyed reading the book. As a story about certain artists and how their work fit in with the science of their day and how it can be understood in terms of current science, it is really entertaining (I would also recommend ""The Disappearing Spoon"" for some fun stories about the elements of the periodic table). But the weight and importance put on the fact that these 'discoveries' were made by art before they were made by science is tangential to what is actually interesting in this book. It seems like Lehrer is just trying to play to people who want to feel smarter than scientists, and sell more books by making it sound like he has discovered something exciting (that art is so much smarter than science).  "
11,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2971567-k-m-weiland,5,Incredibly interesting on so many levels. The science was interesting. The art was interesting. The history was interesting. But in the end the link between art and science is really where the whole thing came together in a transcendent way.
12,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1419068-elaine,4,"What an unusual book, about art and science, and how artists:poets, novelists, painters and even a chef intuited how the self sees and feels long before scientists did. The book Age of Wonder shows that 18th and early 19th century poets and scientists considered themselves collaborators.Those happy days had ended by the time Walt Whitman arrived on the scene, allowing nothing to be deemed truth unless it could be observed, measured and manipulated.Nevertheless, Whitman, who cared for soldiers in hospitals during the Civil War, put forth, in his poetry, the relationship between the body, the whole body, and emotion. Likewise, Proust was prescient about the nature of memory. George Eliot, an avid reader of science, explored human nature and the malleability of the mind. Escofier, French chef extraordinaire, not only discovered the 5th taste but also much about the physical origins of appetite, besides hunger, of course. Cezanne, to me, was the most amazing. He noticed that the mind sees what it is trained to see. In other words, reality is in our brains. It's not out there. If you read just one piece of nonfiction this year, make it this chapter. By all means, read the others, too, but this, to me, is essential.Unfortunately, I can't say the same for Lehrer's chapter on Gertrude Stein who, to me, was an arrogant talentless bore. She was famous because she knew famous people and bought a lot of paintings. Since she wasn't averse to gossip, people accepted her invitations. That's my take on her fame, anyway.What galled me about Lehrer's assertion that Stein ""discovered"" deep structure in language 50 years before Chomsky was that neither Stein nor Chomsky did so. Chomsky learned structural linguistics, which focused on syntax, and stressed the self-evident fact that we change the deep structure of assertion, for instance, to create questions. Thus, ""He did go"" becomes ""Did he go?"" More interestingly, ""Jack went"" becomes ""Did Jack go?"" Since anthropological linguists were examining such phenomena by the opening of the 20th century because they were busy writing grammars .of tribal peoples. What Chomsky did that was noteworthy was to show that Behaviorism is grossly wrong. He also used mathematical notations to describe syntax.Lehrer claims that Stein's writings were an attempt to show how syntax governs what we say. Scholars in the Middle Ages knew that. They studied Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. They had to compare the syntax of these languages to English to learn them. Lehrer can claim ignorance on the grounds of not knowing the history of Linguistics, but to quote Stein's unlovely, unclever, and unmeaning prose as an example of showing deep structure is silly. He quotes her sentence, ""The care with which incredible justness and likeness all this makes a magnificent asparagus."" This is not pushing syntax, uncovering its role in language. Before Stein, Lewis Carroll did that superbly in Jabberwocky. Since he apparently wanted a writer to illustrate how we are governed by syntax, Lehrer could have used e.e. cummings, ""Anyone lived in a pretty how town with up so many floating bells down...he danced his didn't...""Except for the Stein chapter, this is a great and unusual read"
13,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4963801-daniel-m,3,"Lehrer does a clever thing by taking a slice through contemporary neuroscience as seen from the perspective of different authors. Considering the nature of emotions by reading Whitman’s “Leaves of Grass” or memory by looking through the eyes of Proust’s “Remembrance of Things Past” allows the author to weave together science as revealed by art. I’m not sure I believe his basic argument that art precedes science—he’s cherry-picking the data here to only show positive examples and ignores the vast number of writers who are blatantly wrong about the nature of mind. Still, I enjoy the combination as providing some illumination. Great writers DO provide new language that gives us a way to think about and consider phenomena, especially the slippery, indescribable sensations that flit through our consciousness. Considering the process of visual perception through Cezanne’s point-of-view brings a historical perspective to the front. In Cezanne’s day, perception was thought of a “perfect reflections of the outside world. The eye was like a camera: it collected pixels of light and passed them passively on to the brain.” His artwork is clearly NOT that, but plays with the difference between what’s actually there and what’s perceived. (p. 97) I also learned a few things that I really hadn’t known. Example: The idea that the CPEB protein can exist in multiple stable configurations, but can be flipped from one state to another by a neurotransmitter (the basis of long-term memory encoding?) was astounding. (p. 93-94)Lehrer gets a little fuzzy and over-the-top in the last chapter. Virginia Woolf is a great writer that really does try to be internally introspective, but Lehrer seems to over-value her perspective as telling us that consciousness is fundamentally unknowable. For all his railing about post-modernism as a language trick that devalues rigorous thought, it feels to me as though he does the same thing in end. In discarding reductionism as a methodology for understanding, I think he overdid it and fell into a pool of abstractions that don’t carry his argument forward very well. But I still think it’s a great book. Just don’t take the last 12 pages too seriously. "
14,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2986010-francisco,5,"A very interesting, well written well researched book about the parallels between art and neuroscience as shown in the works of artists such as Whitman, Proust, Stravinsky, Cezanne. Woolf's treatment of the self and Proust's treatment of memory, for example, correspond to the discoveries about how our brain works. If you believe, as I do, that science is an art and that art is a science, this book will be fascinating. Not the least of it's merits are the light it sheds on the life of the artist's discussed."

I love the insights into both momentous modernist creative works and science.

16,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4069534-ross-bennett,1,This was a magnificently enjoyable book when we all still believed it. It was fun to read and one that you'd go away talking about for ages. Then Jonah Lehrer was found to be making up fictitious events and false assertions in a subsequent book. It was terribly embarrassing to all of us who had been citing his works.
17,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10445857-bill,4,"Proust Was a Neuroscientist is more of an expository piece comparing artistic visions of the late 19th and early 20th centuries with recent discoveries in neuroscience than it is an argument for any direct connection between these two ways of seeing the world. It is broad in its scope and offers much food for thought along the course of the book. The main body of the book is made up of chapters juxtaposing a particular artist and his or her subjective insights with objectively observed functionings of the brain. Some of the comparisons yield more insight than others, such as the exploration of the discovery of L-glutamate receptors on the tongue with the innovations of pioneering chef Auguste Escoffier or the comparison of the mechanics of vision with the art of Paul Cezanne, but even the weaker chapters, such as the Walt Whitman chapter, have enough interesting observations to keep the reader engaged. In the final chapter, ""Coda"", Lerner brings the book together with an appeal to both scientists and students of the humanities to refrain from writing the understandings of one another off. Postmodernists, he says, can write off the discoveries of science as ""nothing but another text"" while scientist can write off the humanities as ""hopelessly false."" Lerner reminds us that no one has a monopoly on the truth, and calls for a sort of middle path between the two to help us understand our lives and the world around us."
18,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26573870-feisty-harriet,5," I have wanted a book like this for a VERY long time, Lehrer writes eight essays about groundbreaking artists and their work as it is reflected in neurology principles, most of which weren't discovered and principle-ized until well after the artist's work was published (and, more likely, the artist was long dead and gone). This bridge of art and science was glorious in every way and I think I must own this book to flip back through my favorite sections again and again. (Featured artists: Walt Whitman, George Eliot, Marcel Proust, Virginia Woolf, composer Igor Stravinsky, Gertrude Stein, painter Paul Cezanne, and chef Auguste Escoffier.)More extended review (and a bunch of other neuro-ish book) here: https://www.feistyharriet.com/2017/03..."
19,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1074042-amanda,5,"I rarely read nonfiction. When I do I expect it to be accessible, interesting, and to inform me. The best kind of books, fiction or nonfiction, are the ones that make me think differently. This book completely changed the way I thought about literary heavy hitters and artists of all kinds. It concerns a subject near and dear to my heart: the relationship between art and science. Being an English major, I'm more often than not spotted with a Stephen King novel in my hand, Hemingway or McCarthy if I'm feeling terse, Austen if I'm feeling romantic. However, it's not so rare for me to be reading WIRED or DISCOVER magazine. I watch NOVA regularly and some of my favorite blogs are science blogs. I've always considered literature to be the expression of the practice of living. Every single thing that science discovers or philosophers theorize about are exemplified in literature. So, I was extremely pleased to find Lehrer articulating all my thoughts and suppositions in a voice that is remarkably accessible and beautiful.You pretty much feel like you're talking to a particularly passionate friend, and then he'll say something that sounds uncommonly like this guy's a real writer. Then you remember, oh yeah, he is. That kind of tone is particularly effective at putting me at ease and making me receptive towards new information. Then you've got all the crazy research, the extremely orderly and sensible format, and it's pretty much a home run. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who thinks that fiction is useless, but also for people who love art and love asking questions. It's a tribute to the brilliance of the human brain. When I read these kinds of books, my belief in the extraordinary miracle of the human race is reaffirmed and celebrated."
20,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/426277-james,4,"Lehrer argues that many 20th and 21st-century discoveries of neuroscience are actually re-discoveries of insights made earlier by various artists, including Gertrude Stein, Walt Whitman, Paul Cézanne, Igor Stravinsky, and, as mentioned in the title, Marcel Proust. It is really an exploration into the old Science vs. Art debate. As such it has some refreshing and thought-provoking ideas, although they are somewhat speculative. Lehrer takes the reader into the dusty corners of literary history, pondering over the musings of poets, writers, artists and composers in order to prove his theory – not just that Proust was a neuroscientist, but that artists are the innovative crowd in matters of science and, in particular, the human brain. Leher argues that it is through the boundless freedom at the heart of these artists’ work, that they have uncovered truths about science before the scientists themselves have had a chance to catch up. The artistic hypothesis which forms the foundation of the work of these creative thinkers is based on ‘measuring the immeasurable’. They attempt it by treating their art as a living entity – exploring the ‘anatomy of emotion’ rather than treating their art as pure surface matter. In this fascinating and unusual book, Lehrer makes an insightful case for Art triumphing over Science, selecting visionary thinkers to illustrate his very valid points. Whether this speculation holds any water is something else. Even if it does not the book presents an interesting hypothesis and is enjoyable to read."
21,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4074574-jan-priddy,5,"PROUST WAS A NEUROSCIENTIST by Jonah Lehrer (editor at large for SEED with a blog: “The Frontal Cortex”) documents how “science is not the only path to knowledge” since the arts (novels, symphonies, poetry, paintings, cookbooks!) often precede scientific discoveries. It seems almost everything I learned about the nervous system is wrong, and artists knew this at least a hundred years before science. Lehrer argues for C.P. Snow’s “Third Culture” as a celebration of pluralism and equitable dialogue between the arts and sciences. “Unfortunately, many of the luminaries of our current third culture are extremely antagonistic toward everything that isn’t scientific,” he writes (192). And that is a pity, because human beings are more than charts and numbers; we are creative and denying this, blinds us to our imaginative capacities. Do I need to add that I loved this book?"
22,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56201438-lina-slavova,4,"The author of the book, Jonah Lehrer, used to be a technician in a neuroscience lab where he was trying to understand how the mind remembers. It was at that time that he began reading Proust. He realised, to his surprise, that what Proust was describing in prose coincided with the new neuroscientific discoveries about memory. This lead to his basic idea of the book: there are many ways of describing reality and each of the methods is capable of generating truth. He goes to show that neuroscience is useful for describing the functioning of the brain and that art is useful for describing our actual experience of the brain. To prove this assertion Lehrer shows the reader how eight artists: a poet, a chef, a composer, a painter and four novelists each described accurately an aspect of the mind that modern neuroscience is now explaining in scientific terms.  This book is original and well written. I would definitely encourage you to read it. Below is a brief summary but obviously, there is a lot more  information in the book and you might be inspired by different aspects or pieces of information.  Walt Whitman served as wound dresser during the 1862 Civil War. During that time he encountered many soldiers with amputated limps but who were still able to “feel” their missing parts. It is because of this experience that he came to see the interconnection between mind and body. Now modern neuroscience explains that feelings emerge from the interaction of our brain and our body and not form any single place. This is the theory of the Body Loop elaborated by Dr. Antonio Damasio. George Eliot was a mid-nineteen century novelist that believed our human nature is malleable and that we can willfully transform ourselves. She believed that the source of our freedom is the ability of the mind to alter itself. Neuroscience now knows that our brain is far from being fixed and is  constantly giving birth to new connections and that the amount of neurogenesis is directly influenced by the environment.  Auguste Escoffier, the French chef who invented the veal stock, was the first to take full advantage of the sense of smell and that is why he served his food hot.   Today, neuroscience findings suggest that up to 90% of what we perceive as taste is actually smell. Escoffier also believed in the plasticity of the sense of smell and its ability to be remodeled by new experiences. This fact is also confirmed by neuroscience. When we sense something the sensation is immediately analyzed in terms of previous experiences. Our individual and subjective brain interprets the sensations. Marcel Proust realised that our senses of smell and taste are closely linked to our memories. Proust used the taste of a madeleine and the taste of tea to reconstruct his childhood. Scientific research indicates that memories are not stored somewhere in our brain but reconstructed each time, and that with each reconstruction we alter the structure of the memory. How exactly we reconstruct the memories is still a mystery, but it appears that our knowledge influences our recollection. We alter past memories to reflect our current understanding of the recollected circumstances, just as Proust’s writing technique, always altering his past words to reflect his present circumstances.  Paul Cezanne felt that to see, the eye is not enough. We need out minds, we need to interpret our impressions. The information captured by the retina is sent into two separate pathways in the brain, one slow and one fast. The fast pathway sends a blurry picture to our prefrontal cortex who then decides what we have seen, it edits the information. We see twice and everything we see is an abstraction. Cezanne’s goal was to give the brain just enough lines to decipher the image. He broke all the laws of painting of his time in order to reveal the laws of seeing. The mind imposes itself on the eye. Igor Stravinsky believed that our sense of sound is malleable. He believed in the limitless possibility of our minds. Neuroscience confirms that our brain is obsessed with order and constantly seeks patterns. A symphony is simply vibrating air that we have learned how to hear, a melody with predictable patterns. Stravinsky intentionally broke down the known patterns and was first rejected for doing so, but then the audiences proved him right by getting used to the new patterns and appreciating his creations.  Gertrude Stein was fascinated by the subject of language. For a long period of time she studied automatic writing and came to the conclusion that the structure of language is built in our brains. Most of her time she wrote about absolutely nothing but that nothing somehow remained grammatical.  Many years later Chomsky in the 1950’s articulated the theory of the universal grammar. Our words are symbolic and gain meaning by the use we make of them. What is permanent is the stricture that binds these words. It is an invisible grammar imbedded in our brain. The structure exists independently of the words.   Virginia Wolf was affected by mental illness and her way of dealing with her condition was to look inside her own mind. What she found was a mind that never stood still. She realised that what makes us whole is the self and that the self is composed of many different fragments that we somehow experience as one. She believed that the self is the story we tell ourselves about our experiences. We emerge from our own fleeting interpretations of the world by paying attention to what we perceive. Although the self is still an elusive concept, the study of split-brain patients (patients with severed nervous tissue that connects the left and right hemispheres) has proved that each lobe has a unique self, a distinct being with its own desires, talents and sensations. Our consciousness seams to emerge form the multiple parts of our brain, we are plural but have the sensation of being whole."

24,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1343721-becky,5,"What was great about this was how it sent me on tangent to explore the various artists I had not previously encountered. The artists I was already familiar with I enjoyed seeing in a new light. Highly recommended! Very accessible—need not be a neuroscientist, author, poet, composer, chef, or painter to make sense of this book. Three cheers for the human experience!"
25,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41821997-neuravinci,4,"Being a neuroscience major, I'm a sucker for anything to do with the brain, even pop science books. This is the second time I'm reading Proust was a Neuroscientist, the first time being when I was in college. Yet again, Jonah Lehrer had me hooked. Beautiful poetic prose coupled with what is clearly a ton of literature research on his end, Proust was a Neuroscientist is the perfect merger of art and science. What I loved is that Jonah Lehrer so clearly believes in the marriage of art and science, how one fuels the other, and neither can live without the other. In Proust was a Neuroscientist, Lehrer forges the connection between what writers, artists, painters, musicians, and chefs intuited through their art, and how science is figuring out that they were right. What these 'creatives' understood and felt through their art about the mind, the brain, and what it means to be human, science is now understanding in a lab with controlled experiments and methodologies. I loved most all the chapters, even the ones I didn't think I would care about because I know nothing about painting or postimpressionism, for example. But Lehrer's writing makes it clear the creatives contribution to neuroscience, and gives a background on their personal and professional context. The book ends up reading less like history and science, and more like art itself. Though Jonah tends to have some strong opinions on certain subjects, like epigenetics and how we're not genetically predetermined, I still enjoyed his views based on the research literature. He makes strong cases for much of what he says, and has clearly done his readings, providing in-depth bibliography and notes at the back of the book. Regardless of his current status as writer renegade (based on some plagiarism and misquoting), I think Jonah Lehrer is a talented writer. He writes as smoothly as an orator would speak, and I learned much from Proust was a Neuroscientist. I plan on reading more of his other books, including How we Decide and Imagine: How Creativity Works. I don't think I could possibly read Virginia Woolf or George Eliot the same way again. And I may never eat a madeleine without thinking of Proust and his contribution to our understanding of human memory. "
26,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/917269-thomas,3,"This one started well, but damn if it didn't get tedious in the end."
27,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7070851-jakub,3,"Yes, Jonah Lehrer is a gifted writer. He has a wonderful way with words. He’s extremely knowledgeable and well-read, and he’s also very good at discussing a variety of complicated topics. I should have fallen in love with this book. It attempts to combine my two great loves: the arts, and the sciences. It covers a diversity of creative enterprises, from autobiographical writing to cooking, and connects them to fascinating new insights provided by neuroscience, biochemistry, and so on. So what the hell went wrong? First of all, I have a passion, and what I like to this is a decent general knowledge, about science, and scientific topics. I also happen to have a degree in philosophy. In both those spheres, precise language is crucial, and here Lehrer really annoyed me. When he tries to argue that human brain plasticity allows us to “find our freedom” and steal it back from deterministic physics, all I can say is “What?” What kind of freedom do you mean? How does the fact that the brain adapts to environmental inputs, or the fact that there is randomness in natural selection, in any way mean that we are “free” in any meaningful way? In another part of the book, he says that a hand was sweating because of something that the brain was not aware of, and as a consequence he says that the hand “knew” something that the brain did not. Again, by what definition of “know” did the hand know something? Because to me it seems like the hand was sweating because of an unconscious brain process, and if that’s the case then it makes no sense to say that the hand “knew” something! Amidst these small infractions, there are also sentences like this, that left me banging my head against a wall: ""Since soul is body and body is soul, to lose a part of one's body is to lose a part of one's soul.” Who does he think he is, Deepak Chopra?!But, much worse than imprecise language and a haphazard usage of important terms, was a problem that I found completely and utterly unforgivable. You see, I read Discover, and the New Yorker, and Wired Magazine, and I’ve listened to every episode of Radiolab. And unfortunately for me, and others like me who decided to pick up this book, is that a lot of this book is a retread of topics that Lehrer has already covered in other publications or mediums. Basically, he repeats himself. A lot. There is a chapter in this book, from 2007, that covers something that he talked about on Radiolab last year, which he also wrote about in an article for Wired magazine this year! So while I wanted to get into the book and really enjoy it, and after I’d decided to forgive him for trying to sexify and dumb down his language to appeal to more people, I kept turning the page and realizing that I’d already read large sections of it. Which was a disappointment, to say the least. This book was not marked as a collection of previously published essays. It’s supposed to a new book, with new writing in it, not a twice-reheated collection of articles I’ve already read or heard!Still, the parts that were new were interesting, and he really does connect some very interesting dots. And he really is a damn good writer. More importantly, he does make his point, which is that ""there are many different ways of describing reality, each of which is capable of generating truth."" I just wish he'd be a bit less haphazard with his writing, and a bit less willing to copy & paste. "
28,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1183993-nathan,4,"Lehrer has a clever idea for a nonfiction book: take a retroactive scan across the arts and expose scientific visionaries who ""predicted"" neuroscientific theory ahead of their time. Sampling mostly from popular 19th and 20th century artists (Woolf, Cézanne, Stein, Proust, etc), Lehrer's greatest feat is to successfully find the red thread tying together post-impressionist painters, upscale French chefs, modernist writers, composers, and poets. His main thesis is that each of these arts have contributed understanding and exploring the human condition that served as a (often ignored) precursor to modern scientific discoveries of how the brain works. Along the way, he introduces the artist, their main philosophies and mediums, and how their work ties and taps into our current understanding of cerebral processing.As a semi-artiste and semi-neuroscientiste, this book definitely contains a certain allure; it promises to find a union between Art and Science. I applaud Leher's attempt and ambition, but I couldn't get over his University-thesis-driven report style of writing. His essays become repetitive (his main point is made early in each essay, then is subsequently beaten in like a nearly-dead horse). I got the impression (from the acknowledgments section) that his editor already chopped the book in half; I feel like she was perhaps still too generous. The book isn't necessarily too long, it just could use less repetition. Lehrer is stylistically green (this is his first book). He's still finding his own approach in a non-trivial attempt to mix fine literature (some of his sentences are spectacularly poignant and insightful) and popular science (it shows that he has worked in neuroscience). Unfortunately, it wasn't until the coda that Lehrer came clean with his true purpose in writing such a novel: he's trying to promote a class of thinkers/writers who balance both contributions from art and science in equal stride. I found this final chapter to be one of his most thought-provoking contributions. Lehrer's message is that science and art have been segregated too long and that no proper discourse/research is being performed to tie the two together. He decries the modern-day popular science writers (Dawkins, Pinker, etc) for further polarizing the devide between the arts and science. Despite a tip of the hat for popularizing science to the masses, he claims that they are unwarranted in demanding a reductionist account of all humanities. All artists should learn from modern developments in science, all scientists should look to art for fleshing in the (permanent?) gaps in our knowledge. It is here that Leher's latent anti-reductionism then comes out in full, undisclosed form: he says science can only take us so far in knowledge. The arts are there to fill in the gaps that science will be inevitably unable to explain.As I've reached the end of this long-winded thought dump of my time spent in Leher's world, I have upgraded my rating from 3 to 4 stars (3.5 would be ideal). There aren't many books make me reflect on the state of Art and Science and their mutual interaction. I support Lehrer's current efforts, but anxiously await his development as an effective writer. With his cleverness and passions bridging art and science, I'm sure his upcoming books will be fantastic."
29,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3209040-courtney-johnston,3,"Jonah Lehrer argues through eight case studies - Walt Whitman, George Eliot, Auguste Escoffier, Marcel Proust, Paul Cezanne, Igor Stravinsky, Gertrude Stein, Virginia Woolf - that ""celebrated artists discovered truths - real, tangible truths - about the mind, anticipating the findings of neuroscience."" From the blurb:We learn how Proust revealed the fallibility of memory, how George Eliot understood the brain's malleable nature, how the French chef Escoffier intuited umami (the fifth taste), how Cezanne worked out the subtleties of vision, and how Virginia Woolf pierced the mysteries of consciousness.I just didn't buy it. At most, these artists made use of human phenomena - the way taste and smell can trigger memories, the fact that denatured proteins taste delicious, the way that our brains take time to understand how ""noise"" = ""music"", the way that our eyes can build a recognisable image from almost abstract elements - in their work, but they don't predict how scientists will test and describe the brain's behaviour.I will make an exception of Escoffier and Stein. Stein pushed language as far as she could, producing senseless sentences that were still grammatically correct, prefiguring Chomsky's 'Colourless green ideas sleep furiously' and theory that we are born with an inbuilt understanding of grammar. Stein herself had been through medical school and worked in neuroscience; some of her first writing experiments turned her clinical notes into gibberish.Escoffier to seemed to have almost a scientific method - trying to delight his guest, he refined and codified recipes, and turned established practices upside down. Grand food, for example, had previously been served cold, as its grandness was partly derived from its preposterous presentation, which would have been ruined by heat. Escoffier realised that hot food releases smell, and smell is important to taste. He was also a stock an sauce master, deglazing pans and boiling things down - the practices which denature proteins and creates glutamate, the amino acid our body craves (we produce more than 40 grams of glutamate a day, and so we need our Marmite top-ups). At the same time though, Escoffier was hardly peering around the human tongue looking for the tiny areas that would respond not to salty, sweet, bitter, sour but to rich savoury glutamate.I guess I don't see the difference between Cezanne and the ancient Egyptian brewers who passed wooden spoons down from generation to generation, believing they had the magical power to start beer (which they did, through the microorganisms that lived in the cracks of the wood). Both are concerned with the end product, not necessarily the phenomena that produces it. Cezanne was interested in how the eye works and how the mind builds up shapes, sure - but really how close was he to the five steps of visual processing?Lehrer is very sincerely trying to bring the arts and science back together - to repair the right of C.P. Snow's two cultures. I'm not sure this book does it though. The art sections end up feeling like illustrations of the neuroscience - entertaining introductions, but not intellectual equals. Having said that, it's a perfectly enjoyable book, very readable, and packed with snippets and tidbits of information."
30,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13733795-stefanos,4,"Jonah Lehrer,admittedly,tried to make an original case that i found rather flawed and his argumentation weak.He claims that science is not,and should not be,our only method/source of ‘objective’ knowledge.On the contrary we should consult the arts and create an inbetween communication bridge in order to discuss and exchange ideas.Firstly,i’m unable to imagine how someone lacking the qualification,unfamiliar with the literature could contribute to any of the hard sciences let’s say quantum physics,biology or chemistry.(maybe i’m lacking the required imagination!?)Furthermore,i’m also unable to understand why one should pursue such an encounter of the two disciplines.Everyone is free to acquaint his insights/findings and make suggestions by publishing a scholarly paper and similarly,every scientist is free to undertake fiction writing - fortunately some,such as Arthur C Clarke and Isaac Asimov,did - with excellent results.The reasons for forcing such a meeting are unclear to me.On top,Lehrer argument is based on weak foundation.It’s easy to find from hindsight a historical person to fit your data and with a bit of exaggeration make a case.Performing a quick memory search i could claim that Dostoevsky was the father of behavioral economics.He wrote in the Notes from the underground that humans usually act against their interest as a demonstration of their free will,thus implying that we do not fit the rational-agent model of standard economics and that we are predictably irrational.Followed by some references to Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky i could move on to the next artist.Of course, Lehrer’s demonstrations are not that shallow but even so,what would this show?That Dostoevsky was a intelligent man?Undoubtedly.That he was revolutionizing economics and psychology?This i doubt(although he greatly influenced Freud).Or does it show that Lehrer went a bit too far to make a soundly-interesting case but failed?I’d go with the second.Proust wasn’t a neuroscientist afterall.He undoubtedly was a brilliant mind that turned out to be right.So what?That being said and put to the side,i admit that i,actually,enjoyed the book quite a lot.It’s filled with very interesting biographical information and historical context of many great artists i knew little if nothing about - followed by an introduction to some of modern psychology’s and neurology’s topics.For example,how George Eliot rejected the deterministic views of her time and that we now know about the ‘biology of freedom’ that consists of neuroplasticity and epigenetics or how Marcel Proust sensed the unreliability of our memories and other.I learned quite a few new things and it heated my lost interest for modernist literature.Hopefully the interesting content of the book over-weighted an overall indifferent case."
31,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8034519-india-braver,5,"THIS BOOK IS WHY WE NEED TO FUND ART PROGRAMS AND NOT FOOTBALL TEAMS- or like, at the very least, let's fund both. (Sorry, my high school principle cut art classes my senior year to fund our losing football team, and I'm still bitter.) Despite all the controversy surrounding the author, I loved this book. It attempts to bridge the gap between the arts and sciences; its thesis is simple: neuroscientists now are only scientifically discovering what artists managed to intuitively learn years and years ago. This book is essentially divided into essays about various (famous) artists- writers, composers, chefs, poets- and how things they wrote or spoke about are just now being proved true. Some people might feel that this book only shows a tenuous connection in half the cases, and that Lehrer romanticizes the artists too much to prove a point (he was a double major in English and Neuroscience) as well as cherry picking data, but this book confirmed a lot of thoughts I've personally had whirling around in my head, about topics like memory and language. Also, the science parts are engaging and very accessible- fellow listeners of RadioLab will recognize a lot of the work of the neuroscientists being explored! Also, I imagine if you listen to the audio book version instead of reading it, it would be well suited to this medium since it was similar to RadioLab in lots of ways.I loved how this book shows artists through a new lens- a scientific one. Even though the only artists I really knew much about were Whitman (who I love) and a bit about Stravinsky and Woolf, the material was still captivating and exciting to me- even though I've never read Proust or Stein. Also, I thought this book was very well-written, making it an easy read for such a complex subject matter. Loved it. Generally, I have very unusual standards for books like this- I'm talking about your nonfiction books like Freakonomics or Malcolm Gladwell types, where there is some sort of lofty thesis that is supported by empirics, and although the empirics might have been lacking here more so, I think I loved this book the most simply because l did really enjoy the way it was written. Also, I think I loved it because as I said, I did have lots of my own theories about subjects it discusses, like consciousness and linguistics, and so that alone made it a very rewarding read for me. I've always found arts and sciences to be very connected in my own life as well, so I almost felt to a degree that this was the book I had been waiting and wanting to read for years. Even if you don't buy the thesis and think it seems forced - I admit, Lehrer must have selectively chosen stuff to prove his point, this book is so interesting anyways.If you want to read the best chapters, you can skip around and read Proust, Stravinsky, Escoffier, and Stein. Would recommend."
32,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2422276-mag,5,"The profound understanding of human nature we feel good art shows is officially not an illusion. Lehrer discusses the intimations great artists had about the nature of the brain, consciousness, perception, and senses that have been confirmed by recent scientific research. In particular, he chooses a few great writers, a painter, a composer, and a chef and shows how their insights proved to be true in light of modern experimental science. He talks about Walt Whitman, and his insight into the lack of duality between the mind and the body (mind is the body) and importance of feelings in our intellectual functioning, Proust and the nature of memory, George Eliot and free will, brain plasticity, and our ability to change, and Virginia Woolf and her great insights into consciousness and the nature of human ‘self’. Then he shows how Cezanne intimated the true nature of visual perception and Stravinsky of how we apprehend music. And, the part I found the most interesting and novel of all, how a French and then a Japanese chef came to find the essence of ‘deliciousness’, and how it related to the research on how we perceive taste.Lehrer’s insight is that there are many ways that may be equally valid to lead us into the nature of things. Art may offer a profound understanding into the workings of our brain, the understanding that’s in no less true and legitimate than quantifiable scientific research. To take matters further, he speaks about the limitations of science and about the inadequacy of the third culture (and science popularizers like Pinker, Dawkins, Wilson, for example) to embrace the more ambiguous realms. He advocates the necessity of a ‘fourth culture’- the bridge between humanities and experimental science.The whole book signals a recent noticeable departure, notably in The Head Trip as well, of some of the younger generation scientists from what Lehrer calls ‘reductionist science’. He means science that concerns itself only with the measurable and observable, and which ignores its own limitations and solutions and insights offered by other, less measurable sources like art, even though art can comfortably live with uncertainty to which much recent and not so recent research points as a fact of existence. Some truths may never be fully known through scientific means, yet each part of our existence (feelings and subjective insights included) can offer truths that are equally scientifically valid.A great read. I loved how it wove literature, art, brain research and a broader humanistic view of human nature together."
33,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3558741-laney,5,"Really fascinating combination of neuroscience and art. I know that many would argue that by all laws of probability, some artists (chefs, writers, painters, etc.) would have to be right about the way that the human brain worked, and that likewise, there are probably 1,000 times more who got it wrong. That being said, the complexity of perception, taste, and senses that these artisans got right makes for a fascinating narrative, with the research science layered on top. Particularly, the sections on Proust, Matisse, and Virginia Woolf fascinated me personally, but the entire book is chock full of fascinating factoids about the human mind. Particularly, the entire section on prions and how it is that we retain memories at all in an ever-changing brain was my favorite.However, I will say that I was reading this, Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain and You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, and 46 Other Ways You're Deluding Yourself all at the same time and it it took me a bit to remember which book talked about what neurocognitive study because there was a HUGE amount of overlap! Lehrer and Sacks cite the same studies, and McRaney references both Lehrer's work and Sacks, so it was a mind-boggling amount of science and art combined.I will forewarn it's a slow read because each chapter challenges you to think about your own experiences and perceptions, as well as the complexity that is art and the human mind. It's a fun intellectual conundrum!"
34,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931498-jessica,5,"I really loved this book. Then again, I am a geek. Anyone who is a dedicated RadioLab listener will recognize many of the stories of neuroscience that Lehrer tells, as several have been featured on that program, as has Lehrer. And actually, as a reader, this is a good thing. It's kind of like when you'd hit a new topic in a class in school and you'd already had some experience with that topic from somewhere else, so you didn't have to start from ground zero. And with tough content, that's helpful. It was like that. RadioLab was the preview, and the book took me deeper. And, most interestingly, the book connects the neuroscience with the work of related artists. For me, the science geek, that added a new dimension and depth, learning about science and art at the same time.But the part that made me really love this book was the Coda at the end. As someone whose recent work has been in an arena called ""public engagement with science"" and ""public understanding of science,"" and who is becoming familiar with pros and cons of the current set-up and conventions of this world, I think Lehrer's arguments about what is missing in society in this area is right on the money. And he says it so much more articulately than I could. I want to make copies of it and pass it around at every science education conference I go to from now on (you know, if that weren't a blatant violation of copyright law, of course).Note: ""Read"" as an audiobook. (I'm doing a lot of road trips these days.) Actually, it was well-suited to audio, since it was similar to RadioLab in so many ways (my usual road trip fare). Perhaps not the best way to commit all of the details of neuroscience to memory, but an engaging way to keep one's brain active on the Pennsylvania Turnpike."
35,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42572371-prima-seadiva,1,"Audio version. Reader so so. To me the book was not well written and incredibly dull. The author alternating lists of scientific facts I didn't remember 5 seconds later (usually I can at least manage 10), applying neuroscience theories to past events then stating (to me at least) the most obvious notion that artists,writers and cooks access the non-logical sides of their brains in their art before scientists knew. Since I did not finish I never did find out why the author thought Proust was a neuroscientist and the impact of other artists but I found I didn't care. I would guess the famous description of the power of memory via madeleine and tea. Most people know from experience that a smell, taste or sound can stimulate an intense memory such as Proust describes. We just can't turn it into classic literature or parse it into neuroscience data. So much science and writing about science today seems to try to be philosophy but ends up seeming bit self aggrandizing. Perhaps because we live in a society that worships science as reality and as a god, to make the artistic process ""real"" it has to be quantified with facts and formulas. I'm not adverse to scientific investigation but so much of it seems pointless. I just could not plow through to the end. One disadvantage of audio books is it is more difficult to browse sections.I did not know about the author's background and the plagiarism issues in his other writing until after putting this book aside. "
36,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7276011-shelley,3,"That artists frequently have insights which scientists later verify is no groundbreaking idea. Some of the case studies in this book, i.e. the chapter on George Eliot (including an unforgivably bad misreading of Lydgate's story, a veritable half of the main plot of Middlemarch), are rather silly. Others, the chapters on Proust and prions, or the search for umami, or the workings of the visual and auditory cortices as revealed by the works of Cezanne and Stravinsky, are rather interesting and compelling.I do think it is harder to make a case for writers, not because they do not have brilliant insights, but quite the converse: anyone who makes the study of the human condition a vocation will necessarily include psychology at some point in their writing exercise. However, they are ""cases"" and ""case series"" at best, the fruits of an invalid lying in bed doing nothing but thinking about his memories: magnificent as those fruits are, they but reveal the inner working of one being. It is very fortunate that Proust's experience of memory is so universal and relatable by all of us one hundred years later, enjoying a type of hustle-bustle that he has not dreamt of. However, it is the job of science to make sure that Proust's revelations has external validity, so to speak. Happily, the prion hypothesis is fantastically persuasive and intriguing."
37,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/292668-jane,4,"This book says a lot of fascinating things, but I can't escape the feeling that it is watered down science and simplified literary criticism. All in all, it is a good read with plenty of thought-provoking topics condensed into eight chapters. Not too challenging of a read, but it points to and references works that are more challenging and sheds some light on the ridiculousness of the ""cultural divide"" between sciences and humanities. The problem with this book,is that it assumes the popular take-away message about C.P. Snow's article. But an actual reading of that article reveals a different attitude: one of the role of science in industrialization and nuclear proliferation and the increasingly marginalized role of art/humanities in the world. C.P. Snow mostly bemoans the fact that ""soft"" humanists could not recite the second law of thermodynamics if you asked them to. Lehrer largely ignores this, as most of us who have heard of C.P. Snow do. He does make some beautiful points, however, and I am sure his call to arms for a ""fourth culture"" will not fall on deaf ears. I certainly felt inspired by this book, and by anyone who can explain Heisenberg's uncertainty principle as eloquently as he can explain Virginia Woolf's ""To the Lighthouse."" Take that, C.P. Snow!"
38,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5793988-trisha,4,"""It is imperative that we give up the idea of ultimate sources of knowledge, and admit that all knowledge is human; that it is mixed with our errors, our prejudices, our dreams, and our hopes; that all we can do is grope for the truth even thought it is beyond our reach. There is no authority beyond the reach of critcism."" Karl PopperThe overall theme is that art and science need each other to form the most complete picture. Although I enjoyed the whole book, but I really identified with Chapter 3: Escoffier. The writing was so well done that my mouth watered at the mere description of the way in which Esoffier took painstaking detail, time, and effort to create the perfect taste experience--or perhaps I was just hungry. :) His methodology was compared with the scientific creation of MSG and how both came to the same conclusion, but in very different ways. If you like to read about psychology and art, this is a must read. Grow from it, I know I did and I certainly left with a greater appreciation for all disciplines."
39,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7302401-sheri,3,"Although Lehrer sets up the argument that the arts are important investigations akin to scientific investigation, he doesn't really back up his thesis statement in the text itself. Mostly this book is his love letter to particular artists. He tends to focus on one artist per artistic discipline, and in focusing on that one artist's contributions he sets up that artist against all of art history prior to him or her. The result is that we get the sense not that art is an ongoing investigation, but that there have been a handful of artists with unusual insights into human perception. If you are looking to read critical analysis of art from a scientific perspective, this is the book for you. If you want to learn about how science and art can learn from one another and are both important to humanity's quest to understand ourselves, read Margaret Livingstone's Vision and Art: The Biology of Seeing."
40,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12942555-paula-cappa,4,"Jonah Lehrer writes a book here that relates art to science in a very compelling way. Of course, it's entertaining but also enlightening. I found this book to be about truth and while there are absolute truths and relative truths, this book is about the relative truths. Reading the chapter on Walt Whitman ""The Substance of Feeling"" (""we do not have a body, we ARE a body"") is something I will read again and again for its insightful and literary thinking. In the chapter on Proust, the questions are ""What sort of truth did Proust discover?"" or ""Why is the act of remembering a labor in vain?"" If art and science are mysteries to you, this is the book that will bridge the mysteries in a vivid way. Enjoy it as a delicious meal to be savored that you can taste when the need arises for mental stimulation. I keep it on my nightstand and open it at random first thing in the morning and just a line or two will give me food for the day."
41,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3419677-deb,5,"This book was well-timed for reading now in my life. I have been probing the roots of depression, both on personal and cultural levels, and I appreciated the historical context brought to several artists I admire (Walt Whitman, Virginia Woolf) as well as the insight and attention raised on ones I didn't appreciate enough (George Eliot, Stravinsky), some of whom also have struggled with the the suffocation of melancholy. I found as I read this that sections of it would occur to me in my daily life, for example as I moved to change a song that I didn't recognize but then stayed my hand and listened to the novelty, just for its ability to ""shake me up."" I celebrate Lehrer's call for a ""fourth culture,"" since the third one has failed us in its hoped-for (and dearly needed) bridge building between the sciences and the humanities. Certainly my own experience has shown that without both, I am often deeply and almost irretrievably lost. "
42,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1561354-adam,3,"I'd have to say I have pretty mixed feelings about this book. Some of the vignettes were very interesting, some of them not so much. Some of the vignettes were exceptionally incisive in their commentary, some of them not so much. Two things you could be sure of: they'd be written as if they were the cleverest things put to paper and there'd be a chunk of scientific jargon that i wouldn't understand after the part that made some sense.Personally, I found the Stravinski piece the most interesting, but that might be because I have some grasp of the technical aspect of music and its affects on the listener, having read about it in the past. The book also made me want to read Gertrude Stein and give Proust another chance, so there's that. All in all, it was something I'm glad to have read, which is saying something. "
43,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4960360-rae,4,"In this collection of artists and scientific explorations, Lehrer attempts to show how art can explain what science cannot. Cezanne painted swatches of color that show how our eyes really do see - not as pixels but as swatches. Virginia Wolfe knew the mind was a fragmented collection of sensations held together by a self that arose from that and science has still not been able to find if there is a where for that greater self.Very enjoyable book and unlike How We Decide, not filled with scientific stories that I had already heard. Made me much more interested in some of the classic writers and artists of our day. Although I probably won't read Gertrude Stein, I have a greater appreciation for George Elliot, Virginia Wolfe, Cezanne, and many others in that when/if I ever read/see/hear them, I will have a new perspective to enjoy them from."
44,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1858836-heather,5,"This book was fascinating in that two of my passions are neuroscience and art, the topics studied in Jonah Lehrer's writing and the main reason that I chose this book. It focused mostly on authors, painters, a chef and a musician whose perspectives on the mind far preceded their time and were ahead of the ongoing studies and findings of neuroscience in general. For example, Virginia Woolf's thoughts were somewhat progressive for her era. They came primarily from her own experiences and the endless thoughts on which she ruminated while she was confined in a mental hospital. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in either neuroscience, art, or both. They can actually be intertwined when one dissects the compositions of these artists with the constantly emerging discoveries in neuroscience."
45,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/801171-lisagarden,5,"This is one of the most interesting books that I have read in a long time. A great read for right and left brain thinkers. Initially I was not sure where it was going but once I gave into the process of integrating science and the arts and their relationship to each other set in an unusual context and with an unusual but excited writer who is passionate about his beliefs and observations of writers and scientists. Proust,Thoreau,virginia Wolf, Escoffier are just a few of the artists that reveal visionary insight into the science of today. I am reading it for a second time...much to learn. It will stimulate your mind and your creativity/intuition. Looking forward to reading more by this author. He evidently has another book out next year."
46,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2086353-christine-dionese,5,"This is the most romantic approach to the brain I've come across yet. Lehrer's writing style captures the essence of a classically poignant author while describing the intricacies of brain science. Each chapter is a sociological reflection and excellent introduction to bring those in the mainstream a closer look at how our actions parallel our internal intrinsic processes.While Lehrer's book is being judged somewhat harshly by the hard-science crowd, it's an excellent bang to what will be a long-lasting career for this author. This book is most noteworthy because it acts as integrative cross-over literature suitable for anyone interested in the blending of both artes liberales and science. "
47,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1414667-vicky,4,"Here is a smart and fascinating book about the parallel between the art and science. What genius perceived by insight and intuition, today neuroscience proved to be true. Proust understood how our memory worked, Cézanne created a new way of paintings to change our perception of a human sight, Stravinsky changed the concept of a sound and Virginia Woolf tried to understand the construction of our self as a process. Auguste Escoffier, famous chef, created the modern ""French cuisine"" based on the veal stock and brought the idea of ""umami"" or the fifth taste into life. Many great minds intuited what modern science can prove by experiment today. The author shows that art understands life on multiple levels and science often rediscovers what artists knew and expressed through their vision. "
48,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2289972-sylvester,3,"The premise is that artists of varying professions (poet, chef, painter, musician, writers)communicated their visions of reality which were later confirmed by science. So, Whitman's sense that the mind depends upon the flesh turns out to be quite accurate, as does Proust's belief that memories are of our ""invention"". Enjoyed this book. The science was good, but most of all I appreciated getting reacquainted with Whitman and Eliot, not to mention Proust (whom I will never read, but wonder at), and Woolf (whom I have always disliked, but am softened to somewhat, after reading the chapter on her), and Stein. The science part of the chapter on Cezanne made my eyes glaze over, but over all, an engaging read for anyone interested in the convergence of art and science."

And I find it absolutely startling how i stumbled upon this book at this specific stage of my life. To give names to things I thought of or experienced , To know that we are not alone in our specific form of experimentation made of the book a really rewarding experience for me. As with every book, it is not for everyone. It depends on what they have read before, where are they in their journey , etc .. I am not going into details. However, one thing worth mentioning is his beautiful use of the english language. I didn't expect it from a scientist. Not sure my review is of any use to anyone. "
50,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57264678-hannah,2,"While at times hard to follow and not entirely coherent, I nevertheless found this book a delightful collection of art and science history with a dash of modern neuroscience. It raised some interesting epistemic questions across the humanities' vs. science's ability to uncover truth, between science's reductionist limits and art's difficulty confirming its own hypotheses. The thesis I found convincing was not that art ""discovered an essential truth about the mind that neuroscience is only now rediscovering"" (from the blurb), but rather that we need both the humanities and science to reach a more cohesive understanding of the human experience."
51,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7683957-anne,1,"  Half-read. he gets some facts wrong right off the bat-Emerson was hardly the dour, anti-social neo-Puritan he's made out to be, and he closes the chapter on George Eliot with ,""There is grandeur in this view of life"" without even a slight nod to,the author of those lines, Charles Darwin. One could argues that everybody knows Darwin said that, but one would be wrong. I quit in the chapter on Proust, the key chapter, the one that gives it's name to the book after all, when young Mr. Lehrer couldn't even get the madeleine right. ""Buttery cookie"" indeed."

I love Jonah Lehrer whenever I hear him on the radio, and I really respect his incredibly thoughtful and serious approach to science writing, but in general—though many of his descriptions of the work of the artists and writers he's dealing with truly sparkle—I found this book in particular unconvincing and overreaching. Worst of all, I was a little bored. :( "
53,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4886007-lorette,3,"I wish this book hung together better than it did, as the premise is interesting: how artists, through their various artforms, demonstrated what science is only bearing out now: the malleability of memory, a sense of self, how we smell, taste and listen. I enjoyed the sciencespeak, and I like learning about the artists highlighted. Some of the writing, however, veers off into MFA-candidate thesis writing - a little purple for my taste."

65,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1275149-cheryl,4," There is endless debate about the function and importance of art, and for each of the eight artists that are in this book, there are hundreds if not thousands whose work is not as meaningful. Those in this book are brilliantly illuminated by the author and confirm the need of art in our lives, and the magic of their ability to discover and say truth in a new and unique way. What I loved most was the explanations of why these works of art were so groundbreaking in their day. The author combines neuroscience, psychology, philosophy, and chemistry in beautiful ways to explain why a piece of art can affect you from your brain to your toes. You can tell me endlessly that Stravinksy’s Rite of Spring caused riots when it debuted, but I have grown up listening to it distilled for Disney’s Fantasia, so I can’t visualize it. The author’s genius lies in the fact that he can explain the pathways of hearing and interpretation of music and show how people were physically disturbed by the dissonance of a symphony. It was painful and it hurt! The author is able to draw from his background in a neuroscience to dissect our brains and the pathways and plasticity that makes it so versatile and alive.  Walt Whitman introduced free verse in poetry, as well as his idea of the fusion of body and soul. “We do not have a body, we are a body.” Our body and emotions are intertwined and of each other; the body causes emotions and emotions cause bodily reactions and sensations. This was a strange idea in his time, the mid 1800’s, as well as the backlash against what was considered his “pornographic” celebration of sex and the flesh. As many Eastern religions preconfigured neuroscience’s discovery that the body is truly electric, so did Whitman. The skin conducts electricity which can signal anxiety or calm, or even more delicious, the maxim to ‘go with your gut’ is proved to be sound advice as your body can give you signals and signs that make rational decisions. In a study of patients with brain damage, with damage to their emotional centers, they made irrational and chaotic decisions. Without emotions, we are chaos. I fight against the cynicism and bleakness of our day where some of us are told we feel too much, need to protect ourselves and not let emotions dictate our actions. I believe it can be taken too far, I don’t let them dictate, but I do know the fullest and richest decisions and times in my life were made in the spirit of listening to my gut or heart or how peaceful a decision made me. There is that delicious chemistry between people that falls into this category as well, and the electricity of skin on skin was something Whitman knew of intimately. A Taoist equivalent:“Situations produce vibrations. Negative, potentially harmful situations emit slow vibrations. Positive, potentially life-enhancing situations emit quick vibrations. As these vibrations impact on your energy field they produce either resonance or dissonance in your lower and middle tantiens (psychic power stations) depending on your own vibratory rate at the time. When you psychic field force is strong and your vibratory rate is fast, therefore, you will draw only positive situations to you. When you mind is quiet enough and your attention is on the moment, you will literally hear the dissonance in your belly and chest like an alarm bell going off, urging you from deep within your body to move in such and such a direction. Always follow it. At times these urges may come to you in the form of internally spoken dialogue with your higher self, spirit guide, guardian angel, alien intelligence, however you see the owner of the “still, small voice within.” This form of dialogue can be entertaining and reassuring but is best not overindulged in as, in the extreme; it tends to lead to the loony bin. At times you may receive your messages from “Indian signs”, such as slogans on passing trucks or cloud formations in the sky. This is also best kept in moderation, to avoid seeing signs in everything and becoming terribly confused. Just let it happen when it happens and don’t try looking for it.” ― Stephen Russell, Barefoot Doctor's Guide to the Tao: A Spiritual Handbook for the Urban Warrior George Eliot’s genius lies in her skill to write about the human ability to change whether in beliefs, or characters, or thoughts. At the time, evolution was being developed and there was a strong belief that the brain could not regenerate itself, that we were born with a complete “machine.” She rejected the view of positivism that life was a fixed and ordered process without free will; that physics could be the ultimate theory and explain it all. She wrote of characters that were based on real people such as a love that rejected her since he wasn’t attracted to her, which he believed was based in biology and could not be swayed from that viewpoint. It wasn’t until 1989 that researchers were able to prove that the brain is plastic, that we can regenerate neurons and develop new pathways. The discovery of DNA and gene translation with junk DNA (DNA without specific purpose) found that “retro transposons- junk genes that randomly jump around the human genome- are present at unusually high numbers in neurons. In fact, these troublemaking scarps of DNA insert themselves into almost 80% of our brain cells, arbitrarily altering their genetic program…. The scientists realized that all these genetic interruptions created a population of perfectly unique minds, since each brain reacted to the junk DNA in its own way. In other words, chaos creates individuality…. All this mental anarchy is adaptive, as it allows our genes to generate minds of almost infinite diversity.” My brain is unique to me in the infinitely diverse world. It makes me laugh to finally understand why it is sometimes so hard to understand those that walk alongside me every day. I don’t think it promotes loneliness to think of our brains like this, there are usually enough kindred souls in a forest or a bar to communicate with.  Proust wrote gorgeous long intricate sentences that last hours about memory, and how it can be edited and changed over time by our subconscious, which is proved later on, after Freud breaks open all these memories of women who were abused or molested in order to explain their hysteria, which is then cyclically shown to be false memories. He predicts the science that found that only smell and taste are connected to our long term memory centers. The discovery of neurons and the spaces between them led to a discovery of the synapses where chemicals like dopamine bring messages. The brain has constant electricity circulating. “What Joseph Conrad said about maps is also true of the brain: the most interesting places are the empty spaces, for they are what will change.” I love the imagery of how the brain works, of the different areas illuminated with each thought and memory, and how each thought and memory can light up new areas or make new associations. For example, my memory of the day I brought my puppy home doesn’t just light up my long term memory of a particular day in a particular year, but also the areas for love and happiness and laughter. I am still trying to make my way through his 1 and ¼ million words that make up In Search of Lost Time. Sometimes it is enough to get lost in his sentences for a while, even as I can’t seem to retain the plot.   Cezanne was a brilliant artist who tried to break down seeing into parts, to stimulate the brain to make connections by filling in the blanks. Annie Dillard writes of a similar thing, the struggle to interpret sight by the newly sighted: “I chanced on a wonderful book by Marius von Senden, called Space and Sight. . . . For the newly sighted, vision is pure sensation unencumbered by meaning: ""The girl went through the experience that we all go through and forget, the moment we are born. She saw, but it did not mean anything but a lot of different kinds of brightness."" . . . In general the newly sighted see the world as a dazzle of color-patches. They are pleased by the sensation of color, and learn quickly to name the colors, but the rest of seeing is tormentingly difficult. . . . The mental effort involved . . . proves overwhelming for many patients. It oppresses them to realize, if they ever do at all, the tremendous size of the world, which they had previously conceived of as something touchingly manageable. . . . A disheartening number of them refuse to use their new vision, continuing to go over objects with their tongues, and lapsing into apathy and despair. . . . On the other hand, many newly sighted people speak well of the world, and teach us how dull is our own vision.” Cezanne did the same thing for us, just as I had an epiphany once about impressionism; without my glasses, I see the world as a fuzzy Monet. Cezanne went a step further and painted canvases that had obvious spaces, and obvious holes or missing parts and allowed our brain to fill in the rest. A patient with a lesion in his brain separating his visual cortex from the rest of his interpretative brain saw reality as it was, “labyrinths of light and masses of color.” He could not make the connections, and could not describe a picture as a whole; for example, he could pick out some shapes and colors on a Nat Geo photo, but could not say it was a landscape.  Regarding music, the author writes, “music is a pleasurable overflow of information. Whenever a noise exceeds our processing abilities- we can’t decipher all the sounds hitting our hair cells in the ear- the mind surrenders. It stops trying to understand the individual notes and seeks instead to understand the relationship between the notes….but before a pattern can be desired by the brain, the pattern must play hard to get. Music only excites us when it makes the auditory cortex struggle to uncover its order. If the music is too obvious, if its patterns are always present, it is annoyingly boring.” It also is why listening to classical music and new genres of music helps to sophisticate the music palate, and now explains why certain terrible pop songs hurts me like Stravinsky’s innovation hurt concertgoers long ago in Paris. He created a work of dissonance, where chords played together frustrated the brain which couldn’t listen to both at the same time and couldn’t make the connections. He merged sounds together that had never been merged together, and never let them fade or end in a pretty tonal resolution. “The emotions generated by musical tension…throb throughout the body. As soon as the orchestra starts to play, the flesh undergoes a range of changes. The pupils dilate, pulse and blood pressure rise, the electrical conductance of the skin lowers, and the cerebellum (movement center) becomes unusually active. Blood is even redirected to the leg muscles. (As a result, we begin tapping out feet in time with the beat.) Sound stirs us at our biological roots.” Stravinsky also knew people would be able to learn to appreciate his music; he in a sense erased the brain’s pattern making machinery and once cleared, forced the listeners to listen harder, more deeply and follow the patterns he was making, and eventually we have Disney’s Fantasia. I am listening to portions of it now (Rite of Spring) and it sounds complex and like a horror movie theme a bit, but I like it. It is true then, that even the bizarre can become commonplace.  My best example in music comes from Jane Siberry’s Love is Everything. At first, nothing seems melodic, she seems off key against some quiet guitar chords, and her voice is reedy and thin. My sister hated the song when I first played it for her, and she even played it for other people who agreed with her. At first, listening, it did sound unusual, atonal, off in some way I couldn’t discern. Eventually, it became absolutely lovely and different than any other music. I missed that feeling of strangeness and exoticism, and it can be hard to find. I love to sing along with songs, which probably makes my listening experience different than the people who do not sing, but love love love when I find a song that challenges my ability to sing to it. It is like I need to figure out a new way to sing, new notes and chords and emotions. An example is a Colorado group Paper Bird who has 3 female lead singers who harmonize; one of their songs (Lost Boys) has a complicated 3 part harmony, and I heard myself off key over and over, but with practice, I was able to somehow synchronize my voice. The complexity challenged my brain and made the song even more linked to my emotions. Now it is easy, and familiar, although if I haven’t heard it in a while, I screech through the first round and have to repeat at least once. This makes me want to try to absorb even more innovations in music, even as I admit to a reluctance when it sounds like noise, and I hate it.  “From the three minute pop songs to the five-hour Wagner opera, the creations of our culture teach us to expect certain musical patterns, which over time are wired into our brain…Once we learn these simple patterns, we become exquisitely sensitive to their variations… Music works by subtly toying with our expected associations, enticing us to make predictions, then confronting us with our prediction errors. In fact, the brainstem contains a network of neurons that responds only to surprising sounds. When the musical pattern we know is violated, these cells begin the neural process that ends with the release of dopamine, also the chemical source of our most intense emotions, which helps to explain the strange emotional power of music, especially when it confronts us with newness and dissonance.”Other little gems: Gertrude Stein combined language in ways that were nonsensical and extremely difficult to interpret, again challenging the brain to think about the structure of language and how it seems hard wired into us somehow. Yes we have to learn grammatical rules, but if you watch the progression of language in children, they figure it out on their own. They mimic at first, and then just name things, and then make senteneces of 2 words, gradually adding complexity before they even get to the English class at school. With Stein, she is so obscure and impossible to read, but again, reading her will develop some new pathways in your brain! “A kind in glass and a cousin, a spectacle and nothing strange in a single hurt color and an arrangement in a system to pointing. All this and not ordinary, not unordered in not resembling.” For example. It does make you want to play with language, though. Even when I try to think in non-grammatical ways, I fail. One of her influences was William James who said, “We ought to say a feeling of and, a feeling of if,a feeling of but, and a feeling of by, quite as readily as we say a feeling of blue, or a feeling of cold.” From Gertie: “red roses are a pink cut pink, a collapse and sold hole, a little less hot.” I think reading some of her sentences makes me appreciate more abstract poetry also.  Virginia Woolf decided to write about “only thoughts and feelings, no cups and tables.” This is so prevalent nowadays, the “mind’s interiors” laid bare, but Woolf was the first to be able to write an entire novel about a day in the life of an ordinary woman. “The mind receives a myriad of impressions. From all sides they come, an incessant shower of innumerable atoms; and as they fall, they shape themselves into the life of Monday or Tuesday…let us record the atoms as they fall upon the mind in the order which they fall, let us trace the pattern, however disconnected and incoherent in appearance, which each sigh or incident scores upon the consciousness.”"

67,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22994712-katrina-sark,2,"Not as good as ""How We Decide,"" but a few interesting points: Preludep.vii – I began to see a surprising convergence. The novelist had predicated my experiments. Proust and neuroscience shared a vision of how our memory works. If you listened closely, they were actually saying the same thing. This book is about artists who anticipated the discoveries of neuro-science. It is about writers and painters and composers who discovered truths about the human mind – real, tangible truths – that science is only now rediscovering. p.ix – We now know that Proust was right about memory, Cézanne was uncannily accurate about the visual cortex, Stein anticipated Chomsky, and Woolf pierced the mystery of consciousness; modern neuroscience has confirmed these artistic intuitions. p.x – Every brilliant experiment, like every great work of art, starts with an act of imagination. Chapter 1 –Walt Whitman, The Substance of Feelingp.1 – “The poet writes the history of his own body.” (Henry David Thoreau) Whitman’s revelation, which he had for the first time at a New Orleans slave auction, was that body and mind are inseparable. To whip a man’s body was to whip a man’s soul. Whitman’s fusion of body and soul was a revolutionary idea, as radical in concept as his free-verse form. At the time, scientists believed that ur feelings came from the brain and that the body was just a lump of inert matter. p.2 – so the poet turned himself into an empiricist, a lyricist of his own experience. Emotions are generated by the body. Ephemeral as they seem, our feelings are actually rooted in the movements of out muscles and palpitations of out insides. p.3 – The story of the brain’s separation from the body begins with René Descartes. The most influential philosopher of the seventeenth century, Descartes divided being into two distinct substances: a holy soul and a mortal carcass. The soul was the source of reason, science, and everything nice. In Whitman’s own time, the Cartesian impulse to worship the brain and ignore the body gave rise to the new “science” of phrenology. p.5 – Without Emerson’s mysticism, it is hard to imagine Whitman’s poetry. “I was simmering, simmering, simmering.” Whitman once said, “and Emerson brought me to a boil.” p.8 – It was during these difficult years when Whitman was an unemployed reporter that he first began writing fragments of poetry, scribbling sown quatrains and rhythms in his cheap notebooks. With no audience but himself, Whitman was free to experiment. While every other poet was still counting syllables, Whitman was writing lines that were messy montages of present participles, body parts, and erotic metaphors. p.9 – At the time, Whitman was an anonymous poet and Emerson a famous philosopher. His letter to Whitman is one of the most generous pieces of praise in the history of American literature. “Dear Sir,” Emerson began, “I greet you at the beginning of a great career.” p.19 – Modern neuroscience is now discovering the anatomy underlying Whitman’s poetry. It has taken his poetic hypothesis – the idea that feelings begin in the flesh – and found the exact nerve and brain regions that make it true. How does the brain generate our metaphysical feelings from the physical body? According to Damasio, after an “emotive stimulus” (such as a bear) is seen, the brain automatically triggers a wave of changes in the “physical viscera,” as the body prepares for action. The heart begins to pound, arteries dilate, the intestines contract, and adrenaline pours into the bloodstream. These bodily changes are then detected by the cortex, which connects them to the scary sensation that cause the changes in the first place. The resulting mental image – an emulsion of thought and flesh, body and soul – is what we feel. p.22 – The moral of Whitman’s verse was that the body wasn’t merely a body. Just as leaves of grass grow out of the dirt, feelings grow out of the flesh. What Whitman wanted to show was how these two different substances – the grass and the dirt, the body and the mind – were actually inseparable. You couldn’t write poems about one without acknowledging the presence of the other. Chapter 2 – George Eliot, The Biology of Freedomp.38 – If science could see freedom, what would it look like? If it wanted to find the will, where would it search? Eliot believed that the mind’s ability to alter itself was the source of our freedom. p.42 – The hippocampus, the part of the brain that modulates learning and memory, is continually supplied with new neurons, which help us to learn and remember new ideas and behaviors. Chapter 3 – Auguste Escoffier, The Essence of Tastep.60 – Embarrassed food manufacturers often hide the addition of MSG by calling it autolyzed yeast extract on their labels (other pseudonyms for MSG include glutavene, calcium caseinate, andsodium caseinate). p.69 – In 2001, Frederic Brochet, of the University of Bordeaux, conducted two separate and very mischievous experiments. In the first test, Brochet invited fifty-seven wine experts and asked them to give their impressions of what looked like two glasses of red and white wine. The wines were actually the same white wine, one of which had been tinted red with food coloring. But that didn’t stop the experts from describing the “red” wine in language typically used to describe red wines. One expert praised its “jamminess,” while another enjoyed its “crushed red fruit.” Not a single one noticed it was actually a white wine. The second test Brochet conducted was even more damning. He took a middling Bordeaux and served it in two different bottles. One bottle was labeled as a fancy Grand Cru. The other bottle was labeled as an ordinary vin du table. Despite the fact that they were served the exact same wine, the experts gave the differently labeled bottles nearly opposite ratings. The Grand Cru was “agreeable, woody, complex, balanced, and rounded,” while the vin du table was “weak, short, light, flat, and faulty.” Forty experts said the wine with the fancy label was worth drinking, while only twelve said the cheap wine was. p.70 – What these wine experiments illuminate is the omnipresence of subjectivity. When we take a sip of wine, we don’t taste the wine first and the cheapness or redness second. We taste everything all at once, in a single gulp. Our human brain has been designed to believe itself, wired so that prejudices feel like facts, opinions are indistinguishable from the actual sensation. If we think a wine is cheap, it will taste cheap. And if we think we are tasting a Grand Cru, then we will taste a Grand Cru. Our senses are vague in their instructions, and we parse their suggestions based on whatever other knowledge we can summon to the surface. As Brochet himself noted, our expectations of what the wine will taste like “can be much more powerful in determining how you taste a wine than the actual physical qualities of the wine itself.” Chapter 4 – Marcel Proust, The Method of Memoryp.80 – Neuroscience now knows that Proust was right. Rachel Herz, a psychologist at Brown, has shown – in a science paper wittily entitled “Testing the Proustian Hypothesis” – that our senses of smell and taste are uniquely sentimental. This is because smell and taste are the only senses that connect directly to the hippocampus, the center of the brain’s long-term memory. Their mark is indelible. All our senses (sigh, touch, and hearing) are first processed by the thalamus, the source of language and the front door to consciousness. As a result, these senses are much less efficient at summoning up our past. p.81 – An honest chronicler of his own brain, Proust embraced such strange associations precisely because he couldn’t explain them. He understood that idiosyncrasy was the essence of personality. Only by meticulously retracing the loom of our neural connections – however nonsensical those connections may be – can we understand ourselves, for we are our loom. Proust gleaned all of this wisdom form an afternoon tea. p.82 – Simply put, he believed that our recollection were phony. Although they felt real, they were actually elaborate fabrications. Take the madeleine. Proust realized that the moment we finish eating the cookie, leaving behind a collection of crumbs on a porcelain plate, we begin warping the memory of the cookie to fit our own personal narrative. We bend the facts to suit our story, as “our intelligence reworks the experience.” Proust warns us to treat the reality of our memories carefully, and with a degree of scepticism. Chapter 5 – Paul Cézanne, The Process of Sightp.97 – Reality, is not out there waiting to be witnessed; reality is made by the mind.p.99 – The story of abstract painting begins with the photograph, which literally means “light writing.” "
68,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5474373-tokreads,3,"The book Proust was a neuroscientist by Jonah Lehrer allowed a comprehensive insight into what he describes as the “4th culture” – a merging of the natural sciences and the arts. Lehrer explores various artist’s works, from the cook to the painter, musician and writer and their early discoveries of the complex workings of the brain. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the book lies in the connections that Lehrer draws between these works of artists and the history behind the neuroscience, which they explored (whether consciously or unconsciously) to a rather distinctive degree. Hence, the focus is on the often-diminished ‘scientific credibility’ of art. Rather than seeing the work as entertainment only, Lehrer comprehensively describes the aim of the artists in exposing new discoveries to how the senses function, to what extent a ‘self’ can be discovered, how memories are formed and retrieved and several more crucial aspects of neuroscience.Lehrer breaks down the book into a prelude, followed by eight chapters, each one focusing on a specific artist, and a coda. The prelude outlines the major points of connecting natural science and art as mentioned before: ‘What science forgets is that this isn’t how we experience the world’. He follows this initial thesis throughout the book. At times, the countless repetition of (almost) precisely these words could make it somewhat monotonous, though I thought it was quite a wonderful way of reminding the reader what exactly we are looking for in these works – the connection between the scientific explanation of the world and the way we actually experience our environment!The chapters follow in chronological order, beginning with the writer Walt Whitman and his discoveries concerning the link between the material body and the mental experiences of a soul. This chapter was interesting in the simple sense that it was an introduction into Lehrer’s writing. He uses many rhetorical questions, which he follows up with explanations, either immediately or after a little discourse. It might be a subconscious pleasantness throughout but it would be rude not to mention his own writing style. Varied vocabulary, both for the scientist and the student, wordplays and stylistic elements such as alliteration or similes add to the whole. Back to Whitman…Whitman’s conviction that ‘body and mind are inseparable’ struck me as a basic observation. It was interesting to follow his own journey through revelations. From working at the camp sites of the soldiers during the Civil War to his old age at which he declared: ‘the only answer is that there is no answer’. ‘Stop thinking of the scientific theories as mirror of nature’, was one of his opinions on science. Though an interesting observation for the time of the scientific revolution, I thought his thoughts on poets even more inspiring: ‘Science and religion might see the body in terms of its shameful parts, but the poet, lover of the whole, knows that the human body and soul must remain an entirety.’ A thought that occurred to me towards the end of the chapter addressed his stance on phantom limbs. If the body and the soul are bound together in their entirety, then why would one not loose part of the soul when one looses part of one’s body? Just a thought…The chapter on George Elliot caused a great deal of thought on the subject of free will but also on the subject of a great respected female writer of her time. Lehrer portrays George Elliot, Maryann Evans, Marian Evans, Mary Ann Cross, whatever name you choose, as the strong woman, the independent woman, the revolutionary of her time, always a step ahead. I guess, as a woman, it makes it all the more interesting to hear that she managed to explain, before science had the means to do so, neuroplasticity. It might be her ebullient personality that allowed her to see more potential in the brain than what it was given credit for. Most interesting for me, was the discussion on free will and her personal relation to the experience of this phenomenon. It was intriguing to read about her observation of herself. The way in which she took a step backwards and gained a more objective view of her mind than what would otherwise have been possible.The chapter on Auguste Escoffier was perhaps the most interesting one for me. The ingenious discovery of a taste bud for protein as part of his art, the creation of hot dinners and a fine dining culture in France does not just seem like quite the big feat, but like the ultimate goal of a designer: to combine the arts and the science to a medium in-between that is useful to us in our everyday life! Umami today, broth back then – his creation offered an insight into the world of the olfactory senses we are only gaining today in neuroscience. It is therefore a wonderful opportunity to read about both sides, parallel in Lehrer’s book. He chooses clever examples and several studies to support his own as well as Escoffier’s own thesis on food: we love umami and we eat with our nose!Marcel Proust – the one person, who’s name got to land on the cover of the book. Personally, I am not quite convinced that his insight was the most profound or the most revolutionary. Still, it is fair to say that his observation of the Madeleine came a long way! ‘He wanted to show how his current condition distorted his sense of the past’. This insight on memory alongside other statements such as ‘ If you prevent the memory from changing, it ceases to exist’ allows us to grasp a little of what Proust was getting at: that our memory is not a picture, just as science is not a mirror! Again, Lehrer made Proust’s discoveries much more interesting by informing the reader about the current developments on the understanding of memory. He rounds up the discussion on prions with: ‘ Every time we conjure up our pasts, the branches of our recollections become malleable again’As an artist, it was fascinating to read about Cezanne’s discoveries regarding our vision. Lehrer explores the cultural circumstances in which Cezanne developed his unique painting style, exposing critical misconceptions on our vision. The camera, a major new invention at the time, is described as being a liar: ‘Because the reality did not consist of static images’ the camera can never really reflect reality. Cezanne was far more interested in what we do not see, what our eyes miss or our brain fails to process. The most interesting aspect of the examples given by Lehrer was the aspect of unfinished lines and shapes that we manage to complete into one comprehensive picture! The chapter on Igor Stravinsky explored the same aspects of misconception of the auditory cortex of our brain that Cezanne had done for sight. Again, Lehrer introduces various studies to help understand how flexible our brain can be. The most prominent point might be that we can change our preference for certain notes or intervals with enough training and exposure!Gertrude Stein was perhaps the most stunning persona I encountered in Lehrer’s book. Her personality, her relationships, her influence – she was a lady of great impact in her time as today. Then, the people might have failed to acknowledge her revolutionary thoughts on grammar but, still, she was respected by all her fellow artists (and credited as mentor after all). The most interesting point was her failed attempt to prove that words are merely words: ‘ Because words are always interconnected by syntax, they can never say nothing.’ Surprisingly, on a hunt for a Stein poem on the internet, I came across one that I thought utterly beautiful, even though her aim might have been to dispose of all connotations and images related to the words used.The final chapter dealt with Virginia Woolf and her insight on the ‘emergent self’ – the source of an identity, which can (as Lehrer concludes) never really be located in our brain. Her observations of her own flow of thoughts allowed her to write as we think. Again, I admire the combining of immediate thought and art, the inevitable reality and the timelessness of the end product. Also, Lehrer gives a wonderful description in support of his thesis that science cannot describe reality fully: ‘Your head contains a hundred billion electrical cells, but not one of them is you or knows you or cares about you. In fact, you don’t even exist. The brain is nothing but an infinite regress of matter, reducible to the callous laws of physics.’To conclude, I should say that I greatly enjoyed reading Proust was a neuroscientist. Jonah Lehrer did a wonderful job of merging the works of some of the most wonderful artists of the last century and the newest discoveries in neuroscience. It shows us again and again: Existence is a miracle!Julia A."
69,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11424703-chad,4,"A beautiful book that seeks to create a space for science and the humanities to meet. Lehrer selects a handful of artists and writers from the 19th and 20th centuries that through their own insight into human nature were able to intuit scientific facts years before they were discovered. To summarize,Walt Whitman's poetry show how our body and mind are a unity, not separate entities. George Eliot's novels show how we are not a biological clock, but a cloud; the randomness in the system leave room for freedom.Auguste Escoffier's recipes anticipated the fifth taste, umami.Marcel Proust's semi-autobiographical novels illustrate how memory isn't linear and pretty random.Paul Cezanne's art shows how our mind stores visual information not as a whole, but as strokes and angles.Igor Stravinsky's music shows how music is defined by its tension rather than its harmony.Gertrude Stein showed how language can't be completely divorced from its meaning.Virginia Woolf's books show how our minds are a few fragile shards held together by an imagined self.I appreciated the author's understanding of both science and art. Similar to another book I read recently, ""The Emperor of Maladies"", Lehrer is able to craft a story from scientific discovery. However, also similar to a book I read, ""Sapiens"", I think Lehrer is tinged with a bit of academic hubris. It comes out in passages like these:Of course, the one thing neuroscience cannot find is the loom of cells that creates the self. If neuroscience knows anything, it is that there is no ghost in the machine: there is only the vibration of the machinery. Your head contains a hundred billion electrical cells, but not one of them is you or knows you or cares about you. In fact, you don't even exist. The brain is nothing but an infinite regress of matter, reducible to the callous laws of physics.I would also remark that Proust really wasn't a neuroscientist. The author had to do a lot of interpretation to connect the dots. Lehrer's choice to focus on postmodernists is fine and dandy, but postmodernists also seem depressing. You can write a book about how St. Augustine was a neuroscientist, or Chesterton, Lewis. Or Beethoven. In his chapter on Stravinsky, Lehrer made Beethoven out to be too mainstream. But Beethoven was pushing the boundaries of music in his day, even if he didn't embrace dissonance. Lehrer ends with this thought: ""We now know enough to know that we will never know everything. That is why we need art: it teaches us how to live with mystery.""I would agree. But even more so, I would agree with Abram Hershel that religion supercedes art in teaching man how to live with mystery."
70,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15971935-mark-stidham,3,"My main question before writing this review is, why did I choose to read this? I cannot imagine that I came upon it, let alone bought it, from random perusal. Who told me to read this?As for the review, I found it an interesting read. The central theme is that artists in visual, musical, and literary media have a more accurate sense of cognition. By 'cognition,' I mean thought processes in the broadest sense. I have long believed all perception and understanding is an interplay of sensory input and subsequent re-creation. That is, all of our awareness is a product of neural interplay involving different parts of the brain. Each person creates their own universe in this way. The author argues that 'science' dictates there is an external reality, including our brain. To understand thought, one must dissect the processes and reassemble them. In the humanities, various artists, mainly emerging in the late 19th and early 20th century, have discovered a deeper truth. It is that human thought is ever plastic, and even our efforts to understand the physical universe are confined by the neural processes. The interesting parts for me are studies on Stravinsky and Cezanne along with various oddities from neuroscience, such as 'blindsight' (the condition of people who are cortically blind due to lesions in their striate cortex, also known as primary visual cortex or V1, to respond to visual stimuli that they do not consciously see). I'm afraid the literary references are far outside of my experience. Gertrude Stein, George Elliot, and Proust are discussed, and unless their works are know to the reader, these passages are opaque. There is a puritanical streak in me that makes me want to be at least familiar with these iconic figures, but life may be too short in these cases. Even a description of their works sound so abstract as to be useless. I have a long running discussion with a friend concerning art and cognition. We once visited the Rothko Chapel in Houston, leaving as puzzled as when we entered. Nearby we visited the Menil Collection featuring works by Cy Twombly. More puzzlement. I am closer to appreciating cubism, but this is not to say I understand it as beauty. And yet I readily accept that these works could be, must be output of deep conviction and perhaps even skill. It is my own path that limits my appreciation of their creations.Well, back to the book. It is well written and interesting, but not for everyone."
71,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1232354-jessica-l-pez-barkl,5,"I usually take a long time to read any books dealing with the mind...and this one was no exception. I wonder sometimes in the aftermath of the killings in Colorado whether or not the shooter ever took the time to realize that reading books on the brain does things to the brain and allowing the brain rest and restitution will keep one saner...I suppose it's too soon to wonder those things, but I definitely know that in some of the chapters of this book, I felt as though I needed a mental hour, day, week, or whatever to process what I had read. This book was so amazing that I want to point out each amazing thing I learned from each chapter. The basic premise is that Jonah Lehrer is trying to suss out is the connection between the humanities and the brain and how artists often are ahead of the scientific world. The Walt Whitman chapter offers the idea that Walt knew that the mind and the body were inextricably linked. I think this is the first chapter because most of us now know that that has been proven, but I don't think most of us knew that it wasn't until after Walt, and Walt definitely rocked a few worlds with his poetry...In the chapter on George Eliot I was struck by the section subtitled ""The Blessing of Chaos"". George knew we are happier in a state of chaos. I really thought this was a great discovery and yet it really wasn't proven until 2002. It makes sense because when we are just learning something, we are, indeed, happier, a sedentary lifestyle will just bore the brain, literally, to death. I guess they are now looking for a way to make this as an anti-depressant...a chaos inducing drug instead of trying to set off more serotonin...which never seems to sustain.The chapter on Auguste Escoffier has invaded my cooking life lately, so much so, I should probably go out and get one of his books. But the idea of umammi (or yummy) based on what he could taste when he was making his famous sauces and not based on fact until 2002 and 2004 respectively when scientists finally found two more taste buds on the tongue. Anyway, I loved this chapter, and I strive to create umammi every time I cook now because it also create happiness in the brain.Proust, the eleven o'clock hour song in this book, and, I'm assuming the inspiration for the title...duh! ""The Remembrance of Things pas is not necessarily the remembrance of things as they were..."" But, what a wonderful way to live when in the creative state. What a memory creates for us, is ours, and belongs to no else. It is weird, though, when I think of memories I have of my father, and then they seem almost sullied when they don't match the ones my siblings have, however, his existence is plural in that way, so...it's also beautiful. ""This is what Proust knew: the past is never past. As long as we are alive, our memories remain wonderfully volatile. In their mercurial mirror, we see ourselves."" (95)Paul Cezanne's chapter talks about what we actually see...and how it is processed. Most people did not appreciate his paintings while he was alive, but they inspired many to reexamine what we see. What we actually see is artifice because when the eye was studied they discovered that it actually sees what Cezanne was painting, but that the rest of our mind fills in the blanks. I'm still sitting with this chapter because it makes a lot of sense when I think about how to ""fill"" a line or ""fill"" the feeling of a song or even a choreographed sequence. We need to ""fill"" in the blanks, apparently, and we do it all the time. Igor Stravinsky realized that even though his initial premiere of ""The Rite of Spring"" might cause a riot, and it did, that eventually the brain would adjust and it would just be music. He was right, and this led people to discover all sorts of things about the way our brain memorizes patterns and that music is really what the mind thinks is music...as long as it hears it enough to convince itself. I was reminded that a bunch of the prisoners I used to teach were outraged by an early sequence in the film LATCHO DROM where the Roma tribe ululated in very high pitches, and then later in the film the commented that they didn't mind it as much anymore. Stravinsky knew that the mind was limitless and just needs patterns to be repeated enough to delve into something new.The Gertrude Stein chapter also touched on patterns, but this time in the literary world. Gertrude Stein tried very hard to destructure language, but by destructuring our language, she discovered that you can't, language is never pure and never stands alone...the mind will always fill in the blanks with some sort of context, no matter how much a writer tries to abstract it. Scientists also discovered truly how much we have a need for language and that need surpasses any destructuring...we always need context, which is why two-year-olds can learn a new word every two hours.The last chapter is Virginia Woolf, and this is the chapter that hasn't been proven because scientists know that she was right, but they haven't found the place in the brain where her observation occurred. She supposed that our true self is illusory and exists only when it is ""at attention"". This idea of an illusory consciousness drowned all of her writings...and yet, it's true...our true self emerges...it doesn't just exist. I think of this a lot when I'm teaching your actors. I remind them that life is more interesting to watch on stage when the character make a discovery before a decision. A decision cannot exist on its own...it has to have a transition...somewhere, however subtle that transition is. I especially like a quote on page 180-1 that I will end this longer than usual review... ""In her art, Woolf let life break in. She shows us our fleeting parts, but she also shows us how our parts come together. The secret, Woolf realized, was that the self emerges from its source. Emerge is the crucial word here. While her characters begin as a bundle of random sensations, echoing about the brain's electrical membranes, they instantly swell into something else. This is why, as Erich Auerbach pointed out in MIMESIS, Woolf's modernist prose is neither a continuous transcription of the character's self-consciousness (as in Joyce's ULYSSES) nor an objective description of events and perceptions (as in a typical nineteenth-century novel). Woolf's revelation was to merge these two polarities. This technique allows her to document consciousness as a process, showing us the full arc of our thought. The impersonal sensation is always ripening into a subjective experience, and that experience is always flowing into the next one. And yet, from this incessant change, the character emerges. Woolf wanted us to see both sides of our being, how we are ""a thing that you could ruffle with your breath; and a thing you could not dislodge with a team of horses."" In her fiction, the self is neither imposed nor disowned. Rather, it simply arises, a vision stolen from the flux."""
72,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27986103-mike,4,"Lehrer’s idea for this book is to compare the thinking of various artists (Walt Whitman, Virginia Wolff, Gertrude Stein and Paul Cezanne to name just a few) with the discoveries science has been making about the brain. In relation to each artist he focuses on a particular aspect of the way (we think) the brain works and shows that often an artist has already ‘gone ahead’ and intuitively understood these things. It’s an intriguing idea and one that comes off well in some chapters and not so well in others. As a musician I found the chapter on Stravinsky less than satisfactory. He insists on calling The Rite of Spring a symphony and writes as though all (actual) symphonies before this composition appeared were classical in structure. And while Stravinsky was certainly an iconoclast, he was by no means the only person changing the shape of music around that time. Nor did he suddenly begin his musical career with a work that was completely off-the-wall. That quibble aside, the book is full of fascinating stuff, both scientifically and artistically. As always, we meet scientists who would rather cling to a theory than allow someone else to prove them wrong, and inevitably their goal becomes the quashing of the younger scientist’s findings. We read about all manner of discoveries in relation to the brain, in areas as varied as the memory, how we perceive feeling, taste, sight, language and what the self is...or isn’t. Many of these discussions are fascinating, and, for the most part, quite accessible. Lehrer’s book is one of a number on neuroscience that have come out in the last short while. V S Ramachandran , Iain McGilchrist and Nicholas Hum¬phrey have all written on the subject. Consequently, while Lehrer often convinces in his discussion of the brain and the mind, it needs to be remembered that what he’s saying is by no means the last word on the topic. Our current state of neuroscientific thinking is in an extraordinary state of forward movement on one hand and dismay at how little we know on the other. "
73,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/167566-neil-white,4,"I see a lot of varying opinions on this book, and I'm honestly not sure what some people expected. Some say he's not scientific and academic enough, some say he's too hard on science, some say his claims are specious at best. I didn't find any of this to be the case.I was familiar with the name Jonah Lehrer from his frequent contributions to the wonderful show/podcast RadioLab, and it was with that approach that I went into this book. If you're familiar with RadioLab, you know it's a science-based show that removes the hard science, and focuses on the wonder of curiosity and discovery. That pleasure that comes from realizing the unexpected connections between things, explaining the unexplainable, and just trying to make sense of it all. It's a fantastic show, and if you've never listened before I urge you to - it's not a stretch to say it might just change how you think.But I digress - this book isn't RadioLab, and never claims to be. Instead it's about how certain scientific discoveries, some of which are considered basic knowledge now, were often precluded or overlapped by similar artistic discoveries. Artists, Lehrer argues, often ""knew"" things about the human condition before scientists did, even if they couldn't necessarily articulate and explain it like science eventually did.He focuses on eight examples, or claims:Walt Whitman's poetry first explored the idea of the ""human body as an irreducible whole"", upending the conventional wisdom of the time that the body & mind/spirit were separate entities. Scientists such as Antonio Damasio later proved this with experiments that showed that our bodies/nervous system can learn and be aware of things long before our conscious mind is.George Eliot's ideas of individual freedom and insistence on the ability to change ourselves presaged ideas of neuroplasticity, and the brain's ability to do just that. It's difficult not to think of such things nowadays as common sense, but the ""nature"" side of ""nature vs nurture"" was very in vogue at the time - the modern idea of ""becoming a new you"" just wasn't there.Auguste Escoffier was insistent before almost anyone that taste involved a ""fifth taste"" of savory sensation, as well as the sense of smell, played a huge impact on a person's ability to enjoy food. It seems crazy to think that back then, most food was served cold, and flavor combinations weren't taken into account. This was later vindicated by the discovery of umami, and findings on the power of sense of smell, and how it is tied directly to the hippocampus - the oldest part of the brain, unlike the other senses.Marcel Proust wrote almost exclusively about memories (sickly and confined indoors most of his life, it was all had). Therefore he understood its fallibility, as well as its ability to spring forth unexpectedly from the strangest of sensory stimuli (such as the famous madeline in his masterpiece ""In Search Of Lost Time"") - long before neurologists caught up to him about just how memory works, or often doesn't work.""[Paul] Cezanne's epiphany was that our impressions require interpretation; to look is to create what you see.” His masterful post-impressionist works seem to understand that perception is such a huge part of seeing – his paintins (especially his later ones) at a glance seem incomplete – like blurry, unfinished sketches. Our mind fills in the blanks, which neuroscientists later discovered is exactly what happens all the time, anytime we perceive just about anything. (See for yourself - http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/...)Igor Stravinsky’s masterpiece “The Rite Of Spring” literally caused a riot when it first debuted. It was screeching, cacophonic noise unlike anything anyone had ever heard before. It was punishing and ugly, exactly how Igor wanted it. The brilliance of this work is that now it is considered a masterpiece – our brains have in effect “learned” that this is music. Stravinsky seemed to have an understanding that our brains can take even the harshest dissonance and make it music if it’s done right.Gertrude Stein attempted to deconstruct language to make it meaningless. She failed, but in doing so found a larger truth about language and its inextricable ties to brain itself. Even her most wild subconscious, free-form ramblings make grammatical sense, if not cognitive sense. (He gives the famous Chomsky example of “Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.”) Linguists like Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker are still championing this idea of a language instinct.Virginia Woolf was one of the famous pioneers of stream-of-consciousness writing in the early 20th century. Before this time, most novels were the standard third-person omniscient narrators, but Woolf challenged this idea by not just getting directly into her character’s narration, but into their deepest selves, and showing that the “self” as many neurologists and psychologists now think of it, may not be more than the random firing of synapses, impulse after impulse, not at all separate from the body or mind. (This idea of the self is still up for contention more so than the others.)I see a lot of laughable reviews along the lines of “No he was NOT a neurologist!” that make me think the point here was missed entirely by some. This is not equating art with science, nor is it championing one over the other. What Lehrer here is doing, in layman’s terms, with little hard science (yet another criticism I see a lot of) is illuminating certain paths which art and science have both crossed. To say that Cezanne was specifically thinking of ocular nerves refracting and processing light rays, or that George Eliot was contemplating neuroplasticity while writing her novels is ridiculous. They weren’t, and nobody is saying otherwise, Lehrer is just showing how these two branches, which too often have little to say to each other, may cross each other in some sort of Venn diagram more often than either realizes.I will admit I was doubtful about some of the connections made, and some of them worked better than others – the Cezanne and Proust chapters worked much better than George Eliot, for example, but as I read on I began to realize Lehrer wasn't actually claiming artistic discovery as much as insight. No, Proust was not a neuroscientist, but as it turns out, he had a few ideas in common with them. The epilogue really summed up Lehrer’s aim with this work, which was to show how art and science aren’t always mutually exclusive, and could benefit from each other immensely. In that respect I think Lehrer has succeeded admirably in his debut. If you’re a fan of nontechnical “pop-science” you’ll find a lot to enjoy here."
74,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78342970-nina,5,"This is another book from my 'avoiding reading Proust by pretending to lead up to reading Proust by reading things about Proust which then turn out not really to be about Proust at all' list. This is the second book I've read that concerns the workings of the brain and a reference to Proust (the other being Proust and the Squid: The Story and Science of the Reading Brain), which is interesting in itself. These sciency types do like their Proust.I liked the idea of this book very much, that many artists predicted what scienstists would discover later. I'm not entirely sure that theory is proved though. To me it seems that the artists he discusses are exemplary of when human reflection touches upon unknown knowns. I'm not sure the works of the artists in themselves predict anything. Reading into the works backwards, they can probably be held up as examples of 'oh, that's why!' like the chapter on Igor Stravinsky, when Lehrer talks about cognitive dissonance, or the chapter on Auguste Escoffier talking about the brain lighting up at certain tastes. I didn't think Escoffier predicted that MSG is like gunpowder for the synapses, but clearly he cottoned onto the fact that certain tasts produce certain pleasures (same with music). It's science that later reveals the underlying reason we feel those pleasurers. All art says something about the way we percieve the world, but science takes that perception and dissects it further. So, I wasn't really on board with what Lehrer was saying, however, I enjoyed the hell out of this book."
75,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66622014-jemma-dixon,4,"Interesting to hear about Stravinsky . . . how when everyone first heard his music there was actually a riot! How the brain releases dopamine when we are in anticipation of finding pattern/ rhythm - and the more that is withheld, the better the music is perceived. Didn't realise how inextricably entwined music was to art, art to literature, music to literature etc. Of course, art doesn't exist just for the purpose of aesthetics - it pursued/ pursues some of the questions science and modern neuroscience are just starting to catch up on. Loved the bits on Virginia Woolf, the philosophy of the self, and parts explaining how we have fragmented minds etc but those fragments conglomerate to find form, and that form (whether being matter or pure thought/ synaptic impulse) blend into each other - but we can't quite capture it; we struggle to see how fragments make the whole. This helped me piece together my shallow understanding of Modernism. Also loved the history of artists - very cool to see how lives intersect. http://flungmagazine.com/2016/04/19/f... Note to self: See article for insight into where inspiration originates for writers through artists. Contrast w Gertrude Stein & then remember Helene Cixous: ""There is no end to writing or drawing. Being born doesn't end . . . Drawing, writing, what expeditions, what wonderings, and at the end, no end, we won't finish, rather time will put an end to it.""

Each chapter focuses on a different artist and how she or he changed the way we think about our mind processes and also changed the history of art. The book focuses mostly on writers exploring how Proust first revealed the fallibility of memory, how Virginia Woolf explored the way we think and how Gertrude Stein explored and revealed the deep structures of language. Another chapter explores how Igor Stravinsky changed the way people thought about music and how as people listened more to his music it became less discordant and ugly as their ears attuned to the new combinations of sound. There's a chapter on how Cezanne tried to show reality as it really is rather than as we see it, thus paving the way for abstract art. Each chapter is fascinating in its own right but together they add up to a very strong argument that the arts are as important for understanding life as are the sciences. This is reflected in the latest policy report from educational charity The Edge Foundation, Towards a Twenty-First Century Education System, which calls for dramatic changes to the UK's current national curriculum and argues that creativity should be at the heart of all learning.

I had already given myself a reading challenge this year to read 12 classics and from this book I discovered Middlemarch by George Eliot and the stories of Virginia Woolf. I adore symphony music and was transported by the music of Igor Stravinsky. I was introduced to art by painters I knew virtually nothing about. In other words, it broadened my horizons. However, the intent was something different. Lehrer’s intention was to explain the connection between the arts and the brain. This he did well. To conceptualize the creation of art, the crafting of music and the ephemeral ‘Self” was fascinating. To learn that artist were doing it long before it became a focus of science was even more fascinating. This book wraps a cord at the nexus of art and science in a way that is readable, enjoyable and reflective. It invites learning and creativity as an approach to understanding one’s self and the world we live in. I have nothing but good to say about this book and hope readers and authors of all genres, artists of all styles and musicians of every class will spend some time with this book to gain a better understanding of why and how we do what we do.

The author did a very good job making connections between the arts and sciences in a way that shows respect and deep appreciation. I don't quite understand the his arrangement of the chapters. Starting with Whitman did not provide any kind of ""hook"" for the readers. In fact, I stopped mid-chapter and skipped to the next chapter and didn't find my way back to complete the Whitman chapter until just before the Woolf chapter. I also wish the author provided more notes or in-text citations for interested readers to dig a little further into the primary research. The chapter titled ""coda"" at the end is kind of like the thesis statement of the entire book. I understand why it is at the end but I could also see it as an introduction to provide a guiding framework for readers to think about the lives and works of these influential artists.

I recommend it to anyone who pursues any creative hobby or profession, be it writing, composing music, painting or cooking. It is an inspiring look at the way each of these art forms is processed by our brains and bodies neurologically. Each chapter focuses on a certain artist who innovated within their art form by looking inward and engaging with a deeper understanding of their human mind—an understanding that the science of the time had not yet discovered.

Also, there a whole section bashing Zola, an author who claimed to write fiction scientifically; this is strange since the author later advocates for a “fourth culture, one that seeks to discover relationships between the humanities and the sciences.” Zola would seem to be a good example of this."
89,0618620109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7118702-loy-machedo,2,"I do not want to sound crafty – at least more than I actually am nor do I want to portray that I have apprehended something I found a bit hard to fathom. Proust was a Neuroscientist is one such book – which is pretty incredible in its composition but can get you sapped in its pages. I had to read and re-read the book, including getting help from others to checking out reference materials online just to get this Book Review in place. Let’s see if I can decipher the book in the most simplistic form. Proust Was a Neuroscientist by Jonah Lehrer is a collection of true stories and its biographical translation by the author who attempts to reveal ideas from artists about the mind that neuroscience is true. It is more like building an analogical bridge between scientific concepts and artists.The characters in the chapters pay homage to a poet, four novelists, a chef, a painter, and a composer. The sequence in each chapters follow the predicted path -a brief biography at the beginning followed by a description of their creative contribution and finally the expose into the neurological insights of the artists. Once that pathway is established, Lehrer translates discoveries in neuroscience that pertain to the artist's ideas. Finally, towards the end Lehrer attempts to draw similarities between what the artist believed and what neuroscience has discovered.So here are the characters that come into the descriptive plot of scientific analogies. Walt WhitmanBefore and during Whitman's time, the common belief was that the body and spirit were two separate entities. Lehrer supplements Whitman's idea that our feelings are due to interactions between the mind and body by citing the work of Antonio Damasio. Damasio used four decks of cards where two decks contained big payouts and even bigger punishments and the other two decks had smaller payouts and very few punishments. He tested the electrical conductance of a test subject's palms and found that the subject's hand would get ""nervous"" just reaching toward the negative decks, long before the subject's mind understood. George EliotGeorge Eliot stated an idea that our ability to change ourselves gives us an innate freedom and then goes into details about neurogenesis and the fact that DNA does not determine our brains. Steps following protein transcription from RNA involve plenty of changes that DNA does not determine, and the environment around any organism plays a huge role in how it behaves. Auguste EscoffierCan you believe that before Auguste, Umami was never considered in existence? Escoffier's was the person who discovered the presence of umami in taste as well the involvement of smell and the power of suggestion. Two studies, one on cheap red wine and the other on white wine with red food coloring, revealed what had to be an embarrassing truth about the power of suggestion to a decent number of wine experts. Marcel ProustProust's thoughts on the memory meshed well with the discoveries in neuroscience. His verbose recollection of eating a madeleine and the memories that sprang from it match perfectly with the smell and taste ""connect directly to the hippocampus, the center of the brain's long-term memory"". The fallibility of memory that Proust realized is another intriguing aspect of neuroscience, the idea that we can ""remember"" something without actually experiencing it or the notion that ""we have to misremember something in order to remember it"". Paul CezannePerception is such a huge part of our senses; Cezanne used his paintings to show us that we can use our minds to complete the picture. Lehrer's inclusion of two of Cezanne's paintings helped to supplement this idea. ""His art shows us what we cannot see, which is how we see"". Igor Stravinsky, Gertrude Stein, and Virginia WoolfStravinsky ""knew"" that people's plastic brains could be taught to enjoy and feel new music. Gertrude Stein attempted to show that the structure of language is built into us by making words meaningless. And Virginia Woolf's ideas about the self were all connected to the concepts of Neuroscience. But now the moment of truth.I have read Jonah’s other books - How We Decide & Imagine: How Creativity Works. And I will admit, I am a fan of his work. But this book got me confused many a times. Personally, I felt though he was intellectually making a point, many a times he would go round and round to the point it left you dizzy and lost wondering what was he trying to say the first place. He does cover an incredible amount of ground with his research but towards the end, I personally do not believe he makes his case obvious. And to be honest, None of the names – apart from George Eliot, Virginia Woolf was familiar to me. So if you are looking at being enlightened by a Great Communicator who makes a Complex Subject easily understandable to Common Laypeople like myself – well this is not the book for you. Overall Rating.Given the complexity of the subject, the amount of data and the confusion I experienced while reading the book, I would have to give this book a 3 out of 10. It is only because I was a fan of his did I go through the whole book – otherwise I doubt I would have completed it the first place. So if you are planning to buy this book – I suggest you check out if you identify the character mentioned in the review. If you do not know them – don’t bother purchasing this book.
