0,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10571559-hana,3,"The Mamas and the Papas! Three and a half stars.This was a really fascinating story and for the most part very well told. Sykes' descriptions of the geologic upheavals and the great moving ice sheets that shaped 'The Isles' (Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England) were thrilling.He paints a magnificent picture of the tiny bands of pioneer humans who braved tundra and seas to migrate from Iberia, the first around 10,000 years ago in the Paleolithic era. They were followed by a second small group of sea faring people who had some agricultural skills and had been in Iberia since Neolithic times. This second group joined the pioneers as the ice receded and apparently coexisted fairly peacefully. Sykes makes a very strong case that the genetic bedrock of all of the Isles, including England, was firmly established some 6,000 years ago by these two related peoples and, at least on the maternal side, is solidly ancient Celtic. The most genetically significant exception is the maternal ancestry of Orkney and Shetland, where a large settlement of Viking women from Norway were the ancestral mothers of as much as 30-40% of the current population.The second exception to the Celtic mother-lineage is in eastern and northern England where a group of women of Germanic-Scandinavian heritage helped people about 5-10% of the region. Sykes demonstrates that it is very difficult to distinguish between Saxons, Danes and Normans on a genetic basis, but based on location, he thinks these women were Viking Danes. That devilish Y chromosome is another story altogether. Here, Sykes reaches back into Celtic, Viking and Saxon legends of feuding clans and conquest to trace the patrilineal history of the Isles. Remarkably, a great many of the men of the Isles carry the Celtic Y-chromosomes of a mere handful of reproductively successful men and their sons like the Macdonalds and Macleods in Scotland and the Ui Neills in Ireland. Pockets of Saxon/Danish Y-chromosomes paired with Celtic maternal mitochondria hint at 'male-driven settlement' with some signs of a partial displacement of the indigenous Celtic men. Yet only in East Anglia does the proportion of Saxon/Dane Y-chromosomes reach 20%. Sykes estimates the contribution of Norman males at an amazingly low 2% (genetically, the Normans seem to have been Vikings who absorbed the indigenous language of the time). The Isles, including England, are deeply rooted in a genetically Celtic past.I loved the tour of the Isles pre and ancient history and Sykes' conclusions are a sobering reminder that many of the world's worst feuds are family feuds. On the negative side, I could have lived without the dumbed-down genetics and molecular biology lessons. I do understand that Sykes was trying to humanize the science by giving made-up clan names to various Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA sequences rather than using the now standard letter and number designation, but he just made it frustratingly difficult for serious family genealogists like myself to figure out how their own DNA fits into the story. "
1,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/159587-kelly-vincent,5,"Several years ago, when I was in Scotland, I took a class on the Picts. They are a very elusive people surrounded by mythology and historians have had trouble pinning down realistic information about them, so there have been numerous myths about them propagated over the years. Serious historians of the Picts have fairly recently decided they were almost definitely a Celtic people who were related to more to the Celts of southern Britain rather than the Gaels (who are the primary ancestors of modern-day Scots, and came over from Ireland). Several years ago I realized it would probably be possible to do a genetic study to see if this theory could be supported more definitively. But obviously I did not have the capability to do this on my own. So I was hugely excited when I stumbled across this book in the bookstore (especially when I checked the index and saw multiple references to the Picts, and then even an entire chapter dedicated to them!). I was a teeny bit disappointed in the results relating to the Picts, but so be it. The book is an unusual mix of archeology, history, science, and even methodology and a little bit of history of science. The first chapter starts off with an account of the author's experience successfully extracting DNA from the Cheddar tooth (a 12,000-year-old specimen found in Somerset, England) and then from Cheddar Man (Britain's oldest complete skeleton, dating to about 7000 BC). He then discusses the historical (archeological) context of these specimens in Britain. Chapter 2, Who Do We Think We Are?, discusses the origin myths held over history in Britain, including Arthurian lore and the Teutonic myth which fell by the wayside as it grew in Germany to morph into the Aryan movement. Chapter 4, The Skull Snatchers, is a brief history of the ""science"" of heredity practiced in the 19th and early 20th centuries, including a discussion of the practice of phrenology. Chapter 5, The Blood Bankers, includes an interesting explanation of blood types and a short history of blood transfusions. The next two chapters help the reader understand the science of the research Sykes carried out. Chapter 6, The Silent Messengers, discusses aspects of DNA, including mutations, mitochondrial DNA, and chromosomes. He also introduces his original idea of the seven(+) matrilineal ancestors of modern Europeans (to whom he dedicated an entire book: The Seven Daughters of Eve The Science That Reveals Our Genetic Ancestry). Chapter 7, The Nature of the Evidence, talks about the collection of samples and statistical and other analysis methods. Sykes goes on to tell the history of all of the major peoples (nations, mostly) who have lived in the British Isles (in the following chapters: 3. The Resurgent Celts, 8. Ireland, 10. Scotland, 11. The Picts, 13. Wales, 15. England, and 16. Saxons, Danes, Vikings and Normans). Then there is a specific discussion of the DNA of the four nations, with a chapter for each. The book concludes with a chapter tying everything together. So, this book did have a lot of personal significance to me (in addition to my interest in the Picts, I focused on Irish and some British history while doing my history BA and also studied Scottish Gaelic), although it did not necessarily tell me much about my own heritage because I know few specifics. Clearly this book will be highly enjoyable to the many Americans obsessed with their Irish or Scottish heritage, as well as to other people with ties to or interest in the British Isles."
2,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,4,"Lots of History to Go With the Genetic ExplorationsI listened to this after finishing The Seven Daughters of Eve: The Science That Reveals Our Genetic Ancestry. Once again Sykes revisits history using the the tools of DNA and genetics to explore some common assumptions, this time about the origins of the people that populated the British Isles, namely the Picts, Celts, Romans, Normans, Angles, Saxons, Danes, Vikings, etc. He gives a heavy dose of historical background on each of these groups before discussing the genetic studies done by his research team, which went around different parts of the British Isles, such as the different regions of England, Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, including the Islands such as the Hebrides, Orkneys, and Shetlands. They joined blood transfusion donation drives and set up shop at country fairs, asking to collect DNA samples from the local populaces in order to trace DNA through the matrilineal line via mitochondrial DNA (mDNA), along with patrilineal lines via the y-chromosome. What this reveals is a very fascinating and different set of data about bloodlines and heritage depending on which line you trace. If you follow mDNA back through the generations, you can trace it to specific female ancestors of different haplogroups thanks to the frequency of mutations in mDNA, whereas for y-chromosomes there is very little change over time, and there is also the Genghis Khan founder-effort, in which a dominant male line that fathers many descendants will dominate a given gene pool. What we learn is that the Celtic-speaking peoples that first populated the British isles do not trace their heritage to the many waves of invaders in the past two millennia as is commonly thought, but rather entered the British Isles about 10,000 years ago when other neolithic farmers migrated across the land-bridge from Europe after the end of the most recent Ice Age, and that the various invaders, while intermingling with the local populations, did not decimate and replace them despite the common image of Viking, Norman, and Anglo-Saxon raiders killing all the men and ravaging all the women. There is also the common misconception that the central European Celtic peoples of the Hallstatt and La Tene cultures in the neolithic age are the same peoples as the prehistoric Celtic peoples of the British isles, but Sykes suggests that while these groups may have shared similar languages, they are genetically distinct. He also spends a fair amount of time discussing the amount of Norse/Danish/Viking blood that has remained in the Orkney and Shetland islands and northern part of England, and how much Norman/Roman/Anglo-Saxon blood populated the Southern part of England. If you want to know more, I suggest you read the book. It's a fairly accessible style that doesn't overwhelm you with too many technical details of the DNA analysis, but provides plenty of explanation of the fundamentals so that you will understand why tracing male/female DNA lines produces such interesting and revealing results. Overall I enjoyed it quite a bit."
3,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21998440-irish-smurf-tt,4,"History + genealogy = nerd-gasm! Or puzzle lover's delight. Orrrrr family lore. :)And we get all of this by way of a talented storyteller in Bryan Sykes.This is notchur grandma's dry just the facts ma'am kinda scientific examination: there be mystery, drama, discovery, humor and more up in this ancestral joint. There are many 'wow' moments, and theories that cause the thinky thoughts. I know a decent amount of history about various areas in England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. I've added even more during the last five years or so in working my family tree: some of my ancestors mentioned as a part of providing context for Sykes' genetic research are 27th great grandfather William the Conqueror, 29th great uncle Edward the Confessor, 1st cousin Cnut King of the Danes, 33rd great grandfather King Alfred the Great of Wessex, 31st great grandfather Hrolfe aka Rollo of Norway, 22nd great grandmother Marjorie Bruce, 23rd great grandfather Robert the Bruce, 43rd great grandfather Aidan King of Dal Riata, and more. Through genetics, we get a better idea about different migrations, origins and patterns both. Or, even better, we're permitted to ponder some interesting possibilities. In example of the former: one of the Y-chromosomes widely found in Ireland also crops up among the Basques and Galicians of northern Spain. On a macro level, this could be another peg in the board of truth that ancient peoples traveled quite far along their shared Atlantic coastlines in exploration, trade, and most likely habitation. On a micro level, I have ancestors from northern Spain back in the middle centuries, the same time as some of the aforementioned forebears: like 2nd cousin Urraca of León, Queen of León, Castile, and Galicia, and 3rd cousin Alfonso X King of Castile, Léon, Galicia, among others.As for the latter, here is one of the intriguing questions Sykes asks, almost a 'which came first, the chicken or the egg': ""It was the coming of agriculture to Scotland, beginning about 6,000 years ago, that boosted the population so that, only a few centuries later, there was enough manpower to construct these vast monuments [large stone structures]. But did this evidently greatly increased population mean the immigration of large numbers of people, or did the original Mesolithic inhabitants adapt and proliferate?""He goes on to say that there isn't a lot of archeological evidence to lead us in either direction with any certainty, but maybe DNA will shed some steadier light. A $64,000 question, indeed.Sykes takes us through the methodology used in collecting these thousands of bits n bobs of genetic samples in a lighthearted, open, and conversational way. We get local color and cultural flavor, with observations on human nature that are probably universal, now and 8,000-10,000 years ago when we bipeds first arrived in these here parts of the world. He goes through the main mDNA haplogroups, the history of what used to pass for cultural historical research and the often patriarchal and racist conclusions of such, and the fact that these sub-microscopic proteins we all carry around have been handed down thanks to a handful of original ancestors shared by millions and millions of people. None of us is that different from the next person. Regarding the 7 major mDNA origins of over 95% of Europeans: ""I realized at once that these clan mothers, as I called them, were not some kind of theoretical ancestors, but real living, breathing women. No, not just women, they were mothers as well.""And through their daughters, and each generation of daughters after them, here we are.As much as I love history, there were times when I wished for more exposition on the sciencey side of life. Sykes would get going on a description of one of he and his colleagues' sample collecting tours, or a set of results, and then head back to the lives of our long-dead clanspeople. His bias that clearly favors England also comes through now and then, if only in hints. Given the rich, lengthy, and interesting history of all of the regions on which he spent his energy in studying, it would have been quite the feat to lessen the awesomeness of Wales, Scotland, and Ireland.**I did not want this to end! I put off reading the last 20 pages or so for several days. I want more! This is such an enjoyable read, and I wrote notes, reactions, and questions throughout. Please give me more of this:On the numbers part of the genetic equation: ""Like so many tabulations, the numbers disguise individual stories of heroism and betrayal, triumph and defeat, and force them into bleak summaries. This is no way to treat our ancestors and you will be glad that I shall not insult them, or you, in this way again.""Cheeky! And 100% truth: the numbers often don't tell the whole story. ** I have my own ""biases"" considering my love for and having spent time in Ireland and Scotland, and England, and my extensive ancestry from these three places, along with Wales. ;)"
4,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1053206-ryan,2,"""Saxons, Vikings and Celts"" wants to be a hybrid of history, science and memoir. Instead it is a book with an identity crisis as pronounced as anything suffered by the Scottish malcontents who agitate for secession from the UK. That's a shame, because the book has a fine premise and Bryan Sykes is a respected authority in his field. The problem lies in execution. Whereas the best science writers make their ideas digestible with clear prose and grounded examples, Sykes relies on lengthy tangents and a chatty voice. This makes the early chapters endearing but eventually clouds the science at the book's core. Sykes devotes entire chapters to anecdotes about his colleagues and obscure Celtic mythological heroes, some of which comprise needed background, but most of which do not. Excluding the prologue, he doesn't get around to discussing genetics until the halfway mark. The payoff is underwhelming because the actual material pertaining to the genetic history of the British Isles could fill a magazine article. Borrow this one from the library and read the first chapter and skim the last half. You'll quickly get the gist of this well-intentioned but sloppily assembled book. This topic deserves better and Sykes, with a skilled editor, could easily deliver it in a revised edition."
5,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1502451-angiea,5,"This excellent book by Bryan Sykes was a really great read about my own ancestors. I have always been interested in the history of Britain and Ireland and was always curious about the allure of the tiny little isles in the North Sea. Sykes documents the ancestry of the Isles by volunteer DNA samples through blood donors and booths at country fairs. Some of the people in these areas haven't moved in generations and many of the strains are surprisingly consistant. It was revealing to learn that some inhabitants of the Isles would prefer to be of Viking ancestry than Gaelic! And that Gaelic itself may be a cultural invention! I found this the natural follow up to ""Deep Ancestry"" and ""Journey of Man"" as well as ""The Seven Daughters of Eve"". It brought it all so close to home. And helped solidify the realization that each of us is descended from a long line of real people who lived real lives. It is my personal opinion that all of this scientific research is a result of the ""spirit of Elijah"" that is turning the hearts of the children to the fathers. I can see the Lord's hand in this interest by scientists and their effort to make it accessable to the general public.UPDATE 2017: I had my DNA tested by Ancestry.com and the results were that 90% of my DNA tested as from Britain, mostly England and Scotland. I found this a little surprising since my sister (we share both parents)had hers tested and came back over 70% Scandinavian! I wasn't going to have mine done until a friend pointed out that even full siblings can have differences in their ancestral DNA due to the way the chromosomes from each parent line up, especially if the generations have been in the States for awhile. I can trace 3 of 4 lines back to the 1600s in North America, so we should be quite a mixed bag. Well, except for me! No wonder I am so drawn to that little island in the North Sea!"
6,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15843630-stephen-dawson,3,"The author, billed as the world's first genetic archaeologist, describes a multi-year project to examine the DNA of the people of the (British) Isles. The DNA of the Y chromosome reveals hints at where our male ancestors came from, and the mitochondrial DNA where the female ancestors originated. He mixes an abbreviated scientific summary with the earliest history of Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England, and attempts to look at how the evidence fits with what we know and the legend of our ancient history.Is it really true that the ancient Britons were driven westwards? Are the Shetland Islanders really Vikings? Were the Viking invasions solely raping and pillaging, or did they bring their womenfolk with them? These and many more questions are addressed.The style of the scientific sections was sometimes a bit hard work, not terribly well presented, with clan names and statistics being thrown around, and the scientific methodology rather glossed over, but the history was well written and the conclusions fascinating. Well worth persevering with the harder reading sections as overall the book is really quite thought-provoking, if leaving you thinking that the story might have been better presented."
7,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51196399-gary,5,"This is a totally engrossing book for anyone interested in British history or in genetics. The crux of the book is DNA and the genetic origins of the British people but is explained in such a beautiful way that you do not need to be a genetic scientist to understand it. In fact, myself, who has no scientific background fully understood it and found it extremely fascinating.As Bryan Sykes explains 'this is living history, told by the real survivors of the times. the DNA that still lives within our bodies. This really is the history of the people by the people'The author combines the findings of his genetic studies with the history, legend and folklore of the islands, Great Britain and Ireland.He explains how in his first book The Seven Daughters of Eve: The Science That Reveals Our Genetic Ancestry he discovered concrete evidence that Europeans have a predominant hunter-gatherer ancestry from people who settled on the continent 40 000 years ago or more and NOT as was commonly disseminated , by farmers from the Middle East who were supposed to have entered Europe 10 000 years ago.In the second Chapter of the book 'who do we think we are' Sykes examines the prevailing beliefs, dogma and myths of the past about British history and origins, including the false understanding that the English are close cousins of the Germans through being descended from the Anglos-Saxon invaders who conquered what is now England in the 500-700s CE/AD.The DNA findings effectively debunk these beliefs (espoused by among others Nazi sympathizers who sadly still exist in England, who believe the Germans are the closest cousins of the English and it was a travesty that the English fought their German brothers in the two world wars (or were tricked into doing so in the case of World War II by the 'wicked Jews')Instead he reveals that almost the entire mitochondrial DNA (DNA passed down from the females genes) in England is from the Ibero-Celtic peoples that arrived in Britain 10 000 years ago and is fundamentally the same as that in Scotland, Wales and Ireland.'Even if the entire population of Jutes, Angles and Saxons arrived in Britain, that that could have exterminated all of the Britons, , with their centuries of experience of Roman military tactics. Even if they had managed to kill all the men they would not have managed to kill all the women'And hence how the DNA proves this. The overwhelming majority of the matrilineal descent of the people in England has stayed constant for ten thousand years, from the original inhabitants of Britain , who were there 8000 years before the Anglo-Saxons settled in what is now England.As Sykes clearly states ' 'On our maternal side almost all of us are Celts''The matrilineal history of the Isles is both ancient and continuous. I see no reason at all from the results why many of our maternal lineages should not go right through the millennia to the very first Paleolithic and Mesolithic settlers who reached our islands around 10 000 years ago. The average settlement dates of 8000 years ago fits in with this.'As for the Y chromosome (passed down through the male gene) 'still there are far more people with Celtic ancestry in England, , even in the far East of England, than can claim to be of Saxon or Danish descent. In the west of England, the patrilineal line too is almost all Celtic, while in the south approximately 10% of the men now living in the south of England are the patrilineal descendants of Saxons or Danes, this increases to 15% above the Danelaw line, and at the most in England in East Anglia is 20%. So so much for the article in the Daily Mail entitled 'We are all Germans' - that is simply not true.'Overall the genetic structure of the Isles is overwhelmingly Celtic, if by that we mean descent from those who were here before the Romans and who spoke a Celtic language' All the invasions and opposed settlements since Julius Caesar have barely scratched the surface.Each chapter on the genetics of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales is preceded by overall histories of these country's in the early periods, and their mythology and folklore (even if you know most of the information Sykes writes in a way which is a pleasure to read.)I was intrigued to read that there a small number of people in the south of England who can trace ancestry through mitochondria (therefore the female line unbroken) to subsaharan Africa and the Middle East, most likely descendants of slaves brought by the Romans, whose lines have carried on through the generations through unbroken lines of women . As a Jew , I find the idea that there may be found in some people in England who do not know it who carry mitochondrial DNA from generations ago from Jewish women intriguing.He traces the main ancestry of the Shetland and Orkney islands to Vikings. His style is always engaging and chatty, I enjoyed the anecdotes, and the humour. This is one of the better books on the topics for laymen and historians without degrees in genetic science.In the field of DNA and history would also recommend the work by Rabbi Yaakov Kleiman DNA and Tradition: The Genetic Link to the Ancient Hebrews to the Ancient Hebrews which traces the ancestry of modern day Jews to ancient Israel."
8,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5555043-the-pirate-ghost-formerly-known-as-the-curmudgeon,4,"I was not sure what to expect with this one. I've read a lot of articles about genetic archeology leading up to opening this book and I have already had some idea of how gentic science works. I have also read other critiques of Sykes as a scientist and researcher as well as critiques of other books he's written by other scientists. So far, few doubt the completeness or impact of his work in Europe, especially in the United Kingdom. I will admit when I saw his website and the prices for having your own DNA anylized I wondered if he had gone over to the darkside of commercialism or the even darker side of commercialism mixed with science rather than science mixed with anthroplogy. This book and other critiques of Bryan Sykes works, including being able to read the published scientific studies, have cleared up most of those concerns. Bryan Sykes is a notable expert in his feild and, though he could have, he barely mentioned his ""fee for service"" sideline. I would note that this mention came as one of the ways he has been able to expand his database. So, where as most of my concerns were quickly dispelled my worries that this might turn into an advertisement for his Oxford Group linger, though greatly diminished, in the back of my mind. One of the things that I liked about the book is how sykes made some attempt to keep it interesting without crossing over to fictionalizing the past which is the knock on his book The Seven Daughters of Eve: The Science That Reveals Our Genetic Ancestry He payed more respect to myths, legends and origin stories than many writers who specialize in that type of history and, through science, he dispelled some common misconceptions of what humanity was like before Summeria and Rome and shored up some concepts that had been weak theories using genetic science as the glue. Respect to cultures, beliefs, heritage, but still, this is a book about science. Perhaps one of the strongest, though shortest, discussed points, came early on where sykes explains what we can learn through Genetic Archeology and what we cannot. I was particulalarly greatful for his paing attention to the rise of racism. Despite so-called claims, racists have little or no science to support their clams and no effective means of studying anything scientifically. Racists often argue their case as a genetic issue. Bryan Sykes stabs this concept through the heart. The idea of that there is anything that remotely resembles genetic superiority is completely despelled by genetic science. Race as it pretans to racism, predjudice and bias is a function of culture. The entire human genetic spectrum including the gene sets that are farthest apart from eachother is barely distinguishable from one end to the other. This is not so in other species. What a great thought? Genetic Archeology, rather than seeing a superior genetic string, finds that we are even more alike physiologically than ever believed possible before. Sykes takes care, when explaining genetic science, to make sure he is not speaking over the knowledge level of his average reader's head. Sometimes he's too careful about that. Trust me, if I'm reading a book about the genetic history of the British Isle, then I am likely capable of understandign deeper explaination than what Sykes gives. On the other hand, I'm glad that I didn't have to stop listening (audiobook) and look stuff up to understand what he's talking about as I have other non-fiction books. He also did a good job of putting genes in context so that, after his explaination, I was ready climb to the next scientific tier and less likely to make the gross leap to faulty conclusion. So, though I wanted more, good job on that too, Dr. Sykes. I liked the stories Sykes added about conducting his research except for one part. Apparently he's read Robert Cialdini. The hot science ladies were the best he had at convincing people to give up their DNA for science. Uh...yeah, no kiding ""Bryan."" What does that say about the genetic advancment of the ""Y-chromisome?"" I am glad that his realization of how effective the two Attractive ladies of science were at recruiting volunteers (ever seen the add for ""Meet Farm Girls dot com?"") came well after he applauded their ideas and intelligent decisions. At least he had the good sense to notice that the people who worked at the inns and bead and breakfast establishments where they stayed were less excited to see him return than them. It was a cute story and, as a holder of the inmfamous (notorious in some circles) Y chromisome myself, I completely get how it's great to be in the car with the hot science Ladies. Unfortunately, as much as Sykes sought to express his grattitude at their ""developed skill in recuriting donors"" this anecdote probably does give us a hint at why one is now a lawyer and the other a forensic specialist rather than staying with the program as Genetic Research Scientists. What was their value to the team again? Good ""Recruiting?"" or were they intelligent scientists? What about their contributions to science and to your ground breaking study? So, I took a star away for Y-Chromisomic attitudes and behavior even though I'm not sure I am in anyway immune to it. That said, most of this book was about science, history, archeology and mythology and most of it was entertaining, enlightening and worth reading. I am going to read the book he wrote about his work in North America though I have heard that it is not nearly as thurough as his genetic archeology in the United Kingdom and Europe.I also wonder why he did not make some connections between his work and findings that have kept me curious about migration of humans such as: how the genetic history of Helenas clan matches the Brutus origin Legend or how the Sonorri history/legend matches both the migration of the Viking clans (Sigurd) and gives a different take on the spread of what we understand as the Norse mythos that suggests that Odin (a person) might have been more influential than Jesus in the development of Western culture and our moral pshychology and ethics. At any rate, this is a good read, and very interesting, even enlightening. The science is good and appears sound. Though it is told in an almost story like narrative, that narrative is supported by science, not fictionalized in the way that he ended his last book. I'm not sure what it tells us, but I'm reasonably certain that it tells us something important about ourselves... even if it's about you beautiful British people and not us Ugly Americans. "
9,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/762314-walt,2,"I am clearly in the minority when I give this book a low rating. It has a fascinating premise and some interesting parts; but so much of the book felt like a sales pitch mixed with academic lectures and senseless banter. Each chapter was more like a teaser for something further along. Finally, everything is brought together in the final chapter...and....very little enlightenment. The concept of tracing people around the globe to seven matriarchs and twenty-plus patriarchs is an interesting idea embedded in genetics and science. However, there is a common sense problem with the idea: inbreeding. The children would quickly corrupt the gene pool even if each matriarch had a child with each of the twenty-plus patriarchs. The result of the 'Seven Daughters of Eve Theory' is that it sounds a lot like Biblical allegory. Of course, when I first read about tracing my ancestry back to Helena or Ursula, I was very intrigued until I kept seeing references to customers, companies, and similar topics that give a vague veneer of a sales pitch. Once irritated over this subtle thread, I began having overall doubts. A second major distraction was the crude travel commentary about the British Islands. I do not care if the author works in Oxford and lives on the Isle of Skye. I do not see the point of stories about people who never left their small communities, or if his assistants quit the project because they watch Ally McBeal. Maybe this style is intended to relate to the readers; but the affect is a random narrative that breaks suddenly between genetics, folklore, history, mindless banter, and teasing the reader about future analysis....just read some more....Another major drawback for me was the lack of references. Not one! I was interested in several of the folklore and historical works he references in multiple passages. But to read them require more research. At one point the author says he will spare us the science. I want the science, even if it is just one chapter. The science gives the project that much more credence. I want to believe.Finally, I am a bit discouraged by the results. It is interesting to know that the Vikings peacefully settled the Orkneys and Shetlands. It is a bit more interesting not to find any genetic trace from the Romans. They did occupy Britannia for about 400 years, much of that time with Latins from Italy. It is a little surprising to note that the background on nearly everyone is overwhelmingly Celtic / Pict. But even the author acknowledges that mDNA mutates slowly making it more difficult to use in the short history of the Islands. The y-Chromosome DNA allows for more mutations in a shorter period and these reflect the Genghis Khan Effect of kill the men and ""keep"" the women. The result is a strong presence of German-Viking genes in the East and less along Ireland and the western coasts. So, in sum, an interesting premise full of potential, but the awkward and too informal writing made it all the more difficult to accept and endorse. "
10,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/217079-amanda,5,"Even though this was not fiction, this was really a page-turner for me. Most of my heritage is English-Irish-Scottish, so I was incredibly intrigued to read about the studies that Bryan Sykes and his colleagues have been involved in regarding the genetic history of the British Isles. I've always had a keen interest in both my personal genealogy and in genetics in general, and this brought it all together for me, as well as placing it in an historical frame of reference. Based upon previous research Mr. Sykes has performed and published in both The Seven Daughters of Eve (also an excellent book) and Adam's Curse, the genetic foundation of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and England were further investigated with the aim of determining if perhaps the legends and oral histories of the Isles do indeed have any roots in fact. I won't give away the results here, but I will say that I was really surprised by some of the outcomes, and it certainly gives me a new perspective on my own genetic past. "
11,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1231154-william-shep,4,"Fascinating study presented in layman's terms explaining the genetic history of the British Isles. Probably the most startling result of his work, and that of other geneticists as well, is that 'lost' peoples such as the Picts of Scotland or Celts generally in England did not vanish genetically even if they did culturally. They live on in all of us of British descent. Other points of interest include the apparent confirmation that legends of Celtic migration from the Middle East through Iberia to the British Isles are based upon fact, that there are close genetic connection between the Picts and the British Celts, and that the Vikings made largely peaceful settlements in places such as the Shetland and Orkney islands as well as, to a lesser extent, East Anglia in England. My only caveat is that, not being an expert on genetics, it is difficult to verify all of his claims. "
12,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29160274-czarny-pies,4,"This is an extremely important book that all history lovers should read. The author demonstrates that the genetic profile of the population is highly similar throughout all of the British Isles. This suggests that the various invasions that England underwent (German, Norse, and Norman for example) touched primarily the government and the elites. The actual population of England was barely impacted.The similarities in the genetic profiles of the people living in the celtic regions of the British Isles also suggest that the spread of languages occurs independently of population movements. This point is of enormous importance as it undercuts a 200 year old practice of assuming that a migration of a language meant also a demographic migration.I plan to watch this debate carefully in the future although Mr. Sykes view for the moment is clearly in the ascendant."
13,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6305538-dan,4,I really enjoyed the history and scientific data parts of this. I think this could gave been much shorter if the author didn't include stories about their journey to collect the DNA. I don't care to hear about how a lab assistant quit to pursue a career in law.This book takes a look at what makes someone who they are and contributing factors such as war and invasion.

Hawakiki, the legendary homeland of the Polynesians, was said to be located among the islands of Indonesia, and genetics proved it. The Hazara tribe of north-west Pakistan had a strong oral myth of descent from the first Mongol emperor, Ghengis Khan, and his genes are still there to this day. These are just two examples.""A scientist after my own heart!The book is full of myth and the early history of the Isles - all of it fascinating reading, even for one already far more familiar with myth than history. It's the way he tells it. The serious genetic information comes later and makes the book practically unputdownable to the very end. But be warned - if you haven't already done so it'll make you long to order a test kit to find out about your ancestors and their amazing journeys. "

Just plain badly written. And yet the idea of mixing the history, stories and myths with the location of differences of mutation in genes in a particular place, is an awesome one. And yet the science and the statistics of the book itself should have been so much better. I learned quite a bit from this one, but there was quite the opportunity to learn more."
16,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51196399-gary,5,"This is a totally engrossing book for anyone interested in British history or in genetics. The crux of the book is DNA and the genetic origins of the British people but is explained in such a beautiful way that you do not need to be a genetic scientist to understand it. In fact, myself, who has no scientific background fully understood it and found it extremely fascinating.As Bryan Sykes explains 'this is living history, told by the real survivors of the times. the DNA that still lives within our bodies. This really is the history of the people by the people'The author combines the findings of his genetic studies with the history, legend and folklore of the islands, Great Britain and Ireland.He explains how in his first book The Seven Daughters of Eve: The Science That Reveals Our Genetic Ancestry he discovered concrete evidence that Europeans have a predominant hunter-gatherer ancestry from people who settled on the continent 40 000 years ago or more and NOT as was commonly disseminated , by farmers from the Middle East who were supposed to have entered Europe 10 000 years ago.In the second Chapter of the book 'who do we think we are' Sykes examines the prevailing beliefs, dogma and myths of the past about British history and origins, including the false understanding that the English are close cousins of the Germans through being descended from the Anglos-Saxon invaders who conquered what is now England in the 500-700s CE/AD.The DNA findings effectively debunk these beliefs (espoused by among others Nazi sympathizers who sadly still exist in England, who believe the Germans are the closest cousins of the English and it was a travesty that the English fought their German brothers in the two world wars (or were tricked into doing so in the case of World War II by the 'wicked Jews')Instead he reveals that almost the entire mitochondrial DNA (DNA passed down from the females genes) in England is from the Ibero-Celtic peoples that arrived in Britain 10 000 years ago and is fundamentally the same as that in Scotland, Wales and Ireland.'Even if the entire population of Jutes, Angles and Saxons arrived in Britain, that that could have exterminated all of the Britons, , with their centuries of experience of Roman military tactics. Even if they had managed to kill all the men they would not have managed to kill all the women'And hence how the DNA proves this. The overwhelming majority of the matrilineal descent of the people in England has stayed constant for ten thousand years, from the original inhabitants of Britain , who were there 8000 years before the Anglo-Saxons settled in what is now England.As Sykes clearly states ' 'On our maternal side almost all of us are Celts''The matrilineal history of the Isles is both ancient and continuous. I see no reason at all from the results why many of our maternal lineages should not go right through the millennia to the very first Paleolithic and Mesolithic settlers who reached our islands around 10 000 years ago. The average settlement dates of 8000 years ago fits in with this.'As for the Y chromosome (passed down through the male gene) 'still there are far more people with Celtic ancestry in England, , even in the far East , than can claim to be of Saxon or Danish descent. In the west of England, the patrilineal line too is almost all Celtic, while in the south approximately 10% of the men now living in the south of England are the patrilineal descendants of Saxons or Danes, this increases to 15% above the Danelaw line, and at the most in England in East Anglia is 20%. So so much for the article in the Daily Mail entitled 'We are all Germans' - that is simply not true.Each chapter on the genetics of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales is preceded by overall histories of these country's in the early periods, and their mythology and folklore (even if you know most of the information Sykes writes in a way which is a pleasure to read.)He traces the main ancestry of the Shetland and Orkney islands to Vikings. His style is always engaging and chatty, I enjoyed the anecdotes, and the humour. This is one of the better books on the topics for laymen and historians without degrees in genetic science."

The book itself was actually very good, but I gave it a four due to the fact that my librarian brain-power wasn't handling the talk of genetics very well.Bryan Sykes, a geneticist in the UK, takes the reader on a journey of the history of the Isles through genetics. He starts by giving the written history we know through people such as Geoffrey of Monmouth (King Arthur), then the Saxon ideal. From there he discusses the beginning of genetically profiling people through history. It started with skull shape and physical traits, moved to blood typing, and finally DNA.Finally, Sykes takes us through different regions and shows us the manner of DNA profiling everyone and the results. The book was absolutely fascinating to read. I was particularly floored with his use of mDNA and the y-chromosome to show how people are related. If you follow mutations back on these items, they will eventually point to one common ancestor. There are roughly 8 women that are the ""Eves"" of the women living in the Isles and about 5 men who correspond to the ""Adams"" of all the men living in the area. However, this is the type of book you have to read while awake and alert because it is very easy to skim over the pages and realize you don't remember a think you just read. I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in history, genetics, or the British Isles... preferably an interest in all three. I thought it was worth the struggle."

Fascinating premise I must say.I started thinking 4.5 star rating, but this book really is amazing, so I upped it to 5. A complicated subject - the DNA of the British Isles - written is so comprehensible a way that even I understood most of it - a good percentage at least. I am NOT a scientist, but Sykes writes so well, and warns you when he might need to be a bit more scientific in what he's writing, that it's easy to follow along. Now, I really want to find out my mitochrondrial DNA, although since most of my ancestors (female and male) came from Ireland, Scotland, England and maybe Wales, I'd take bets it would turn out to be Helena - she's the predominant Celtic mother of the British Isles.Now I really want to find his book ""The Seven Daughters of Eve"" to read."

It contains enough historical and archeological background to put the genetic data in context and is packed with anecdotes and stories from the coal face of population genetics. Anyone from Britain or Ireland who is interested in their roots should read this. I've had my genotyping done by the National Genographic and I've spent the last few months immersed in academic papers trying to make sense of everything. It's a confusing and difficult field to jump into, even for someone like me who has a PhD in the biological sciences and who has studied genetics as part of my degree. The best compliment I can pay this book is to say that I should have started here and then set out into the deeper waters."

Without compromising his own intellect or patronizing his readers, he relates complex concepts in simple, jargon-free English – and tells an absorbing, scientific ""detective story"" in the process."
21,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3727468-andrew,4,"Absolutely fascinating - our genes don't lie and by mapping the genetics of the British Isles we can get some idea of where the people come from. The old theory of the previous inhabitants being replaced by waves of invaders appears not to be the case. A more likely scenario is that the original inhabitants that settled in the British Isles after the end of the ice age are still there. The waves of invaders had some impact but not to totally replace the previous population. All this is borne out by the genetic evidence from analysing the DNA of the current population. The book is a mixture of science, history, legend and myth and it's a very good read. Will definitely get hold of some of Bryan Sykes' other books such as the Daughters of Eve etc."

It's not like we're squirming in our seats every time we read the word ""mitochondria."" At least, I hope not.Other reviewers of this book stated that it isn't necessary to have read ""The Seven Daughters of Eve"" to enjoy this book. Respectfully, I disagree.

25,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2014250-tim-martin,5,"_Saxons, Vikings, and Celts_ by Bryan Sykes is the author notes on page one the first book of its type, one on the genetic history of Britain and Ireland (which he refers to as the Isles throughout the book), using DNA as the main source of information. Having looked at much larger issues in the human past he wanted to ""dissect the intimate genetic make-up of a smaller region,"" to look at the truth behind some of the popularly held ideas and myths about the Isles.Throughout the centuries monarchs have used myths and legends about the origins of various peoples to justify their leadership and to bolster their policies. Several kings used Arthurian legends to justify their reign, believing the Britons, personified by Arthur, to be the truly indigenous people of the whole of Britain and the later Saxons ""treacherous imposters,"" despite evidence for Arthur's very existence being on shaky archaeological ground (questions about him were raised at least as far back as the early 1500s by Renaissance scholar Polydore Vergil). Edward I said he was merely fulfilling Merlin's prophecies in his campaigns in Wales and Henry VII used Arthurian myth effectively in his defeat of Richard III.In a complete about face, Henry VIII, after his bitter break with Rome, instead pushed forward the idea that the original Britons had been wiped out and the English were in fact the linear descent of Saxons, who of course now were no longer vilified but lionized as ""strong, self-confident, and adventurous,"" who had triumphed over the weak Britons and who possessed the stout spirit of Protestant independence of the Teutonic Germans.What began as part of a declaration of religious independence from Rome transformed into a ""virulent doctrine of Saxon/Teutonic racial superiority over the other inhabitants of the Isles,"" one that was to have far-reaching consequences. The Teutonic Myth and ""Teutomaniacs"" encouraged racist and divisive policies against the Welsh, Scots, and Irish, a mind-set that only began to fade with Germany's enthusiastic embrace of the myth themselves.The pendulum seems to have swung the other way again - albeit with considerably less racist overtones -with a virtual Celtic Renaissance and the rise of the ""Celtic brand,"" as people throughout Scotland, Wales, and Ireland but also among those of British descent in America enthusiastically buy ""Celtic"" jewelry, play ""Celtic"" music, and celebrate ""Celtic"" holidays, all this despite the fact that the notion of the Celts as separate people and the idea of any similarities between the Welsh, Scots, and Irish didn't really arise until the 1700s. Nevertheless, this hasn't stopped concepts of being Celtic from serving as both political rallying cry and tapping into feelings of displacement and affinity with aboriginal peoples.Sykes wanted to cut through all of these myths. To what degree are the people of the Isles really Saxon or Celtic (or in the north Viking)? Are these purely cultural movements, myths put forward by kings to serve political ambitions, or is there some grain of truth to these eagerly embraced (and exploited) beliefs?Sykes wasn't the first to begin delving into the origins of the British people in a scientific manner. Even at the height of Saxon mania in the Victoria era, one individual, a barrister by the name of Luke Owen Pike, was questioning notions of racial superiority and purity and the very idea of the complete extermination of native peoples by invaders, putting forth the way-ahead-of-his-time notion that what would result would be the creation of a hybridized racial mixture, one in which the indigenous component would generally predominate. Although amateur naturalist John Beddoe struggled to come up with an impartial system of classifying physical appearance into different groups and early work with human blood groups (the famous types A, B, O, and AB) went a long way towards removing prejudice and human error from investigating the origins of various populations in the Isles, it took the discovery and analysis of DNA to make real strides. The blood groups studies were a ""blunt instrument,"" lacking the finesse of the detailed findings of later DNA work and unfortunately tempted researchers to either fabricate arguments to explain their findings or were often so broad in outcome as to justify preconceived notions.Sykes and his team used two tools. One was mitochondrial DNA (or mDNA), which has two outstanding properties for its use to analyze the human past. First, it mutates twenty times faster than regular DNA (by comparison the rate of nuclear DNA mutation is so low that we are virtually all the same), and second all mDNA comes only from the mother, who got it from her mother (men do not pass down mDNA). Amazingly, at any time in the past, be it 100 or 10,000 years ago, there was only one woman alive at the time from which you have inherited your mDNA from.This of course only tells the female side, what about the male? For that Sykes looked at the Y-chromosome, found of course only in men. It is a mirror image of the inheritance pattern for mDNA and fortunately does vary enough genetically over time to be useful in a study.So what did the study reveal? Is evidence of Saxon, Viking, and Celtic culture in the Isles the consequence of large-scale immigration or instead the result of indigenous people copying and adapting new styles, perhaps imposed by a small conquering minority? To vastly oversimplify this wonderful book, overall the genetic structure of the Isles is ""stubbornly"" Celtic, if by Celtic one means the people who were here before the Romans and who spoke a Celtic language. While the people of the Shetland and Orkney Islands do have a substantial Viking genetic presence (40% and 30% respectively), surprisingly 10% in the east and 5% in the north of England owe their genetic heritage to Saxons, Danes, or Normans, ""only denting the Celtic substructure."" There is also no genetic evidence of any large-scale Celtic immigration from central Europe to the Isles either."

28,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/595788-alex-telander,5,"SAXONS, VIKINGS, AND CELTS: THE GENETIC ROOTS OF BRITAIN AND IRELAND BY BRYAN SYKES: Bryan Sykes, author of The Seven Daughters of Eve and Adam’s Curse, professor of human genetics at Oxford university, has spent many years of his life studying genes, chromosomes, and DNA; specializing in collecting data from all over the world and tracing ancestral lineages back thousands of years. Sykes was one of the instrumental geneticists in tracing all Europeans back to seven ancestral women. From this, Sykes now takes on the challenge of determining the ancestry of the British Isles. How much Saxon, Viking, and Celtic DNA is left in a modern day Englishman? Saxons, Vikings, and Celts is a bold and ambitious embarkation that reveals the astounding results of Sykes many years of study; while the facts may present more questions of why than answers; Saxons is one of the most important books of the twenty-first century.Do not be daunted by the prospect pages of DNA statistics, Sykes goes out of his way to break everything down and explain it in a detailed and simple way; he even warns the reader before the “part with all the numbers.” Saxons, Vikings, and Celts apart from being a book about DNA and genetics of the British Isles, is also an amazing source for history. The first chapter is spent setting the scene with Sykes’ career and research. Chapter two is one of the most brilliant summaries of British history: from the end of Roman rule, through the history of King Arthur, past each important monarch, on to the present status quo; Sykes has an innate ability for explaining things in a way that make their connections obvious to everyone. The next few chapters are spent explaining his process for collecting the genetic data throughout the British Isles, first with blood samples from schools and blood banks, and then with plastic brushes that are scraped on the inside of the cheek to get skin samples -- an easier method better received by the people donating their samples. Sykes then dedicates a chapter for each country covering it’s history of immigration with Celts, Saxons, Vikings, and Normans, with the successive chapters covering the genetic correlation of these specific countries.The last five pages of the book are what the reader has spent the last two hundred and fifty pages reading to get to; here Sykes correlates all the data together and explains the results, which are astonishing to say the least. They essentially boil down to this: the genetic makeup of the British Isles mainly consists of the Britons and Celts who have lived there for thousands of years, while the invading Saxon, Viking, and Norman people are but a minor percentage of the total. What does this all mean? Sadly, Sykes doesn’t really explain this at all – perhaps he is saving it for another book? – nevertheless, the reader is left coming up with his or her own ideas of what these results mean. Were the invading peoples not that great in number? Did they not actually settle in such large numbers, as we think?While Saxons, Vikings, and Celts may not answer every question you have, the facts that it brings to light with the irrefutable certainty of DNA evidence are enough to spend many years contemplating. Sykes has even started his own company, Oxford Ancestors (www.oxfordancestors.com), where one can sign up and with a sample can have their DNA traced through ancestors who lived, walked, and breathed thousands of years ago. For those seeking more facts and answers from Saxons, Vikings, and Celts, they should visit www.bloodoftheisles.net.For more book reviews, and author interviews, go to BookBanter."

30,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116812917-ctep,0,"The two-fer as previously promised.Saxons, Vikings, and Celts: The Genetic Roots of Britain and Ireland by Bryan SykesOver the past two years in our discussions of white privilege at Corps Days we have discussed debunking the myth of white as normative and lacking in diversity. Each time this has been mentioned I've thought about the ways in which my own family has spats over our differing backgrounds despite the fact that they really aren't that different (My grandmother has never forgiven my mother for marrying a Celt and sullying our fine English stock. If only this were a joke.) As a result when I saw this book on using science and technology as a way to uncover genetic commonalities and differences throughout the UK I thought what better way to break the myth of a monochromatic white landscape even within an admittedly pale set of nations. I was hoping by uncovering the diversity of genes within such a confined area I could more greatly appreciate the broad range of genetics across more visibly diverse spectrums.Syke's book proved to provide some very different and interesting information, however. Sykes has created his own field. Beginning as a geneticist and finding it too dry and lacking in creativity, he decided that scientists were missing the cultural and historical implications of their work. As a result he created a field in which scientists use data from genes to better understand anthropological patterns throughout history- most of this is focused on understanding the spread of DNA and the migrations of peoples. The first fascinating discovery that he shares after some lengthy descriptions of admittedly interesting DNA structures, is that in most of Europe (A region he has selected due to his own location in England and the helpful state of laws crossing over the EU) each female is directly descended from one of 7 women over time. It's pretty astonishing to think that the spread of life in such a large area can be narrowed down to just 7 women. And directly. Meaning most of Europe shares an infinitely ""great""-ed grandmother somewhere along the lines. Similar results are found for men with 7 serving as direct ancestors. (The reason for the division of sexes is explained in pain staking detail- however, it is quite hilarious to read the differing ways that male and female DNA function and are passed along).From this conclusion he is able to take swabs of people from differing areas and match them to one of the 12 original parents- he then takes his findings and compares them to the myths of each region. This results in either the tearing down or upholding of century long assumptions thanks to scientific study. For instance one such finding is that Vikings actually settled peacefully in Northern Scotland. This is unearthed thanks to the high presence of DNA from both the male and female Scandinavian ancestors. Had it been a hostile take over the rate of Celt female DNA should be much higher in the area. This goes on for some time and is in fact very interesting. After reading this I have come to a few different thoughts- first being that I'd love for them to study my own DNA. After hearing the ways that people have moved from place to place over time and realizing that these cultural ties aren't quite so clear as are often presumed I can't help but wonder if my dear grandmother would be shocked to find that she is more of traditionally French or Scandinavian descent than this pure English idea that she has somewhere picked up on. I also wonder what we would look like as a society here in Minneapolis if we chose to look at the ways in which the Earth can be rooted back to the genes of a few dozen people. How would we behave differently to one another if we discovered that we are genetically closer to being family with someone across the street than some of those in our extended branches?Overall a terribly interesting read and thought provoker- I look forward to hearing more from this author as he explores other areas of the world.ACLU Internet Privacy Blog As the NSA leaks started to come to light I began to wonder what other technological privacy issues have we been neglecting to discuss as a nation. After much research I happened upon the ACLU blog, which is likely known to all of you, tracks rights infringement issues throughout the nation. It was interesting to read the responses to the NSA discussions which mostly mirrored the responses I had heard from varying media outlets- some combination of outrage and yet understanding that most people don't seem to mind (The judgement of the last fact being that this lack of interest is going to be one of the most detrimental aspects to society over the next few years in regards to privacy and the growth of technology).The most interesting element of my perhaps too extensive blog reading however was the discussion of some recent cases in federal court regarding the no-fly list. The article discussed the ways in which the government gets around disclosing the information and reasoning for why a person is placed on such a list. Though this article in particular was discussing an ongoing court case involving former military personnel being banned from travel, other discussed that sometimes the only apparent connection is a name that is similar to that of a suspected terrorist. In doing Step-Up interviews I am often astonished at how many youth across Minneapolis have similar if not the same names. Sometimes a single letter makes all the difference in an entire name and therefore in an entire file. Though I have often bemoaned the hand-file process of Step-Up application acceptance and recording of job dispersal, I had never considered the trouble that could arise from a computer based system. Although technology is incredibly helpful, it functions entirely based off of the information we give it. If we place in information on a youth with the same name or perhaps if we mistype just one letter in a name, a system could easily misplace the information of a youth. The double-check and nature of human interactions and intuition allow us to properly file. This realization after reading the article made me wonder just how much processing of information done by the government occurs in large quantities without much human review thanks to the increase in technology. The ease technology can provide is very helpful and often efficient but I have to wonder if there are some unintended effects that our legal system makes it difficult to reverse. Overall reading the differing responses to technology privacy made me question the ways in which we perhaps can misuse our technology- or perhaps it is simply that we are too eager to put it into place. Too caught up in the rush of newness and the latent Cold War-esque desire to get ahead and be the best. Perhaps if we treated our technology production and implementation in regard to becoming a structural norm more like a drug that we need to test for side effects we could effectively use our scientific advancement in ways that positively effect communities with lessened errors.

40,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/782114-nathan-albright,4,"For the most part this is an enjoyable book.  The author is in charge of Oxford Ancestors, one of the many companies that seeks to build an understanding of the genes of men and women for profit and research, and this book follows in the author's previous work on the subject in books like the Seven Daughters of Eve.  As is often the case in a book like this [1], the author weaves as great deal of his own story into the obvious larger story of population movements and how they can be traced.  This is certainly not objectionable, the author is humorous and it is deeply fascinating to see how he turned to blood donors as early adopters for genetic research in the days where blood was necessary before the cheek swabbing that I did became popular and less painful for those who wished to have their gene markers better known and understood.  And since the story is generally intriguing and mixes an interest in narrative story and myth (although selectively) with his interests in genetic genealogy, all of which provides an intriguing picture.This particular book is organized in a geographic way, breaking up the British Isles into four large regions and numerous smaller ones that are based as much as possible on history with an eye towards distinguishing these regions based on their history and determining at least some of the influences that they were faced with.  Beginning with Ireland and then moving on to Scotland, Wales, and England, the author finds a dominant Celtic mDNA pattern (along with a healthy amount of Middle Eastern Atlantic farmers in the west) throughout the Isles except where there has been some Viking women, such as in the Shetland and Orkney islands off of Scotland.  His efforts at understanding the y-DNA picture are a bit hampered by the Genghis effect which shows mostly Celtic ancestry throughout the isles, with Gaelic replacement of Picts in much of Western Scotland and a notable spike of Danes and/or Saxons in the Danelaw.  These conclusions, along with the process by which the author sought enough genetic evidence to be able to come to his conclusions, is told with a good deal of verve and gentle humor throughout, and summarized at the end as well.Even if I don't agree with all of the author's conclusions or with his belief in a supposed genetic clock, there is still a great deal worthy of insight here.  The author notes that the different way that y-DNA and mDNA are spread, whether on the strict paternal or maternal lines, tend to give very different results, as sex-selective patterns appear to have been far harder on men, and the competition for women led certain genes (like the Clan Donald and Dougal or the Ui Neill) to be particularly common but with a great deal more consistently Celtic stock among women, who presumably were less able to establish competitive lines that had the same difference in prestige as was the case among men.  If the author seems particularly disinclined to ponder about the relationship between the biblical history and the Isles, and the way that small elites were particularly important in leadership, there is still at least some worth in the author's approach.  If he finds a compelling story, it is at least one that he considers to be evidence based, although he appears to underestimate the importance of interpretation to his own approach, even as he gently chides such writers as Gildas for exaggerating the effects of the Saxon invasion, for example.[1] See, for example:https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2018...https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2018...https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2017...https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2017..."
41,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72202595-dylanmorrison,4,"The Celts carried the early Y chromosome, which provides the first clear evidence of a close relationship in the paternal heritage of Basque and Celtic speaking populations. “They were statistically indistinguishable’, we also noticed that there’s something quite striking about the Celtic populations, and that is that there’s not a lot of genetic variation on the male Y-chromosome, We conclude that both the Basques and Celts are reflecting pre-farming Europe.Somehow these people have remained in isolation from the rest of Europe up until the Bronze age where their genes begin to indicate an influx of female genes from mainland Europe” said Prof Goldstein.Geneticist Prof Steve Jones, who recently published a book called Y – The Descent of Man, said;“Genetics provided more reliable clues to the distant past than language did”. He and colleagues at University College, London, have spent years creating a genetic map of the Y chromosome, which is passed by males from generation to generation. The results show that the Welsh are related to the Basques of northern Spain and southern France and to native Americans. He said: “There has been much less interbreeding in Wales than you might expect. Wales and Ireland have the most homogenous group of males of anywhere in the world, from the research that’s been done so far”.He said; “The Y chromosome common among Welsh males was an ancient one. Most native Americans have the same oneThe Solutreans of Spain are now believed to have crossed the Atlantic using the southern Equatorial current and entered the Caribbean and Central America between 18,000 and 12,000 years ago to become known as the Clovis hunters of America. Recent genetic findings suggest that the people now known as Gaelic speaking Celts (including Irish, Welsh, Scots, Basques and Berbers) are a remnant of a group of people who also left Spain between 18,000 and 12,000 years agoDuring the most recent ice age (at its maximum about 20,000 years ago) the world’s sea level was about 130 m lower than today, due to the large amount of sea water that had evaporated and been deposited as snow and ice, mostly in the Laurentide ice sheet. The majority of this had melted by about 10,000 years ago.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_leve...Recent studies of the tool kits of the first Americans suggest an entry from Spain and not from Siberia. Not only this, but paleolithic Caucasian genes appear to form the basal layer of the genetic makeup of many native Americans, helping to confirm a trans-Atlantic entry into Central America between 18,000 and 12,000 years ago. Recent discoveries of three 13,000 year old Cro magnon man skeletons in an underwater cave in the Bahamas suggests that the above is true and correct.In 1977, University of Kentucky archaeologist Thomas Dillehay began excavating this ancient settlement, which had been remarkably preserved under a blanket of peat. Radiocarbon dating fixed the site at 14,850 years old, centuries before the Clovis had even begun their trek southward.“There was considerable diversity among the early people(of America); they were much more diverse than Native Americans today. So somehow that diversity was reduced,”says Richard Jantz, the University of Tennessee anthropologist who has been studying these ancient crania."
42,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"So many people trace their heritage back to the Saxons, Vikings, and Celts. However, so much of the ""evidence"" for ancestry came from boasts of victories and made up or embellished stories about who one's ancestors were. Everyone wants a good origin story. Kings and Queens especially needed a very good origin story, one that would convince their subjects that they were indeed chosen by God to rule over entire kingdoms. Back in the days before genome sequencing, or any real science in general, it was easy to make up these origin stories and have people easily believe them. King Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine miraculously found and dug up the bones of King Arthur, long after his death, and claimed him as their ancestor. Other royals, nobles, and common folk alike have bought into these stories. Now we have the technology to sequence people and find out if they have descended from who they think they did or if they will find out that their origin stories are very different from the ones they have been told. Bryan Sykes deliciously dissected various tales of battle and tested the genetics against the tall tales. Usually when a land is invaded, the conquering men spread their seed among the native population. As a result, genes are changed along with the culture. It was very satisfying to take the trip along various historical routes with Sykes and find out who lied, who told the truth, and what the migration and conquering pattern of people really was. To provide the sweeping narrative of the book, Sykes and other researchers sequenced  whole groups of people to trace their true origins. One of the most satisfying aspects of this book were the tales Skyes told of blatant charlatans and the efforts made by them to fool the public. I would like to think I would be too savvy to fall for some of these tricks, but if I were brought up in a time of such ignorance about the world, I might have fallen for it. For example, if someone wrote it down in a book, whether it was true or not, the public saw it as absolute fact. 'It is in a book; therefore it must be true."" So an author could say what they wanted. They didn't have to back anything up with actual evidence. There was one scholar who was studying Aryan language and concluded that since there was a pure Aryan language, there must be a pure Aryan race. It was nonsense but history shows us how much people bought into that myth-- and how much far too many people still do buy into it. Sykes did a great job of presenting various histories of the Saxons, Vikings, and Celts and then confirming or modifying these histories to, for the first time, provide the reader with the most up to date and accurate understanding possible. "
43,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10900218-anthony,2,"Trying to review this book brings up conflicting opinions. On one hand, it is interesting, and the information contained should be out there to more people. But on the other hand, I found the actual writing disappointing. The work is a bit wondering and flabby. The author have a tendency to go on tangents. Each tangent is somewhat related to the next, but usually in stream of consciousness sort of way that someone would construct a sprawling story after a few drinks. Related to this, I also felt that there was a shortage of core material as compared to what I felt was filler. Typical popular science (or history for that matter) focuses on the results and discussion part of the process, but this work has included the equivalent of a motivation and methods sections. These particularly suffered due to the combinations of the need to talk around technical jargon with imprecise but more understandable analogies and the author’s tendency to reader a bit.The shortage of materials is probably related to the relatively narrow focus as compared to the same author’s previous works. Not only does it mean less core content, it also starts to push the limit of what DNA studies can do (as of writing anyways), as the author admits that DNA of Saxons and Scandinavians (Vikings) cannot be reliable separated from each other.Finally, the author is a geneticist first and it shows in the book. This wouldn’t typically be a problem if not for the fact that the point of the book is to draw connection from DNA results to historical events. His treatment of related subjects such as history and archeology is a bit casual and some times outdated. While never outright wrong (I think), it still detracted from the experience. However, the final epilogue where the author summarizes the key findings and lessons learned was actually quite good in my opinion, and I am genuinely interested in if further research have yielded more precise results. Though it didn’t quite redeem the book for me."
44,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2096885-jeffrey-williams,3,"This is a book of missed opportunity. While he starts with a good premise, there are too many anecdotal stories and too little science. Plus, it was presented backwards in a confusing manner. It took me to the end of my second read before I understood why I wasn't ""getting it."" He should have started from England, then gone on to Wales, followed by Ireland and Scotland. Sequentially, starting with Ireland didn't mesh with the human migration patterns coming from the European continent through the land bridge. I will give him credit for trying to include history, archeology and genetics into one volume. If he had a better editor who understood how to organize the material into a way in which is made sense to the reader, it would have been better. Lastly, I wish he would have stuck to the traditional forms of the haplogroups instead of inventing groups out of wholecloth. I understand why he did what he did, but as someone who is trying to use genetics to follow history through a wide variety of authors, his is the only one that doesn't fit unless you do some extrapolation (Wodan being Haplogroup I, for instance). Still, despite its nuances, his book does make sense in uncovering some of the genetic origins of the old Roman ""Brittania."" Now that a decade has passed, it would be nice to see him come up with an updated version, written correctly, to determine whether his original conclusions hold with access to more data. "
45,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74973533-franz,3,"This book was not at all what I expected. I thought it would be as academic and in-depth as Anthony's ""The Horse, The Wheel, and Language"", but instead, many concepts were grossly oversimplified, and Sykes assigns haplogroups cute little pet names, as he does in ""The Seven Daughters of Eve"". Perhaps this is my fault - perhaps I should have researched the book more thoroughly before reading it. One of the most disappointing things about this book is that it is more of a general history of the British Isles than it is a book about the genetics of the British Isles. I feel duped by the title - the portion of the book that actually discusses population genetics is vanishingly small. And what's even weirder is that the part that discusses England - the most interesting and diverse region of the Isles - is only about the last tenth of the book.Sykes' conclusion that the Isles is mostly genetically Celtic, both matrilineally and patrilineally, is a dated one that has been superseded by recent developments in our understanding of the field. Oddly enough, I think this book will be most useful to future historians who are curious about how the field of population genetics began. For the modern reader, it is a quirky, outdated text, often entertaining but not particularly informative."
46,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4996855-timothy-riley,4,"After some Paleolithic peoples walked over from the continent, most of modern Britain can trace their ancestors from a more coastal route of migration mainly from Iberia-Basque country and Atlantic coastal France. Most of British are strikingly similar though differences have been accentuated over time. Maternally, almost everyone in the isles is Celtic. Picts, Gaels, English and Welsh only mutated and diversified after their arrival regionally. Also surprising was that the Romans left almost zero DNA in Britain after having occupied all of present day England for centuries. Many parts of northern Scotland that claim to be mostly Viking were found to be at most 70% of that DNA. In addition, almost an exact amout of mitochrondrial DNA is present as Y Chromosome DNA, so the theory of raping and pillaging Vikings is put to rest. Once they commanded a foothold in the islands they brought their families and started farming and settling. And you can still see a fuzzy line from the Danelaw demarcation with a higher percentage of Norwegian DNA north of it, though Sykes says it is difficult to differentiate between Saxon, Dane, and Norman DNA because of the Germanic regions they hail from. "
47,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3660346-pam-shelton-anderson,4,"Since most of my genealogy and DNA comes from the British Isles, I was very interested in this book and overall found it fascinating. There was a lot of work to develop this information and understanding how that work has evolved was quite interesting. I would have preferred a little more straightforward information on the genetics part and not the genetics-for-dummies version; I suspect people who would read the book would already be someone informed on the basics. I didn't really understand the clan names and had thought there were other standards for that, though he did make it easy to see the classifications and referenced them clearly. I was just getting ready to lament the lack of maps and charts and then found them at the end of the book. I did find them quite helpful though colored maps might have been even clearer. I would also not discount the value of mathematics as that is how we understand large amounts of data and the relationships and validity of the data. The author's passion and love of his work and his subject matter comes through very clearly and is very appealing. Well done. "

The genetics are explained very simply, making this book really accessible for anyone without a scientific background, and I find Sykes has a real gift for bringing the past to life. He addresses the specter of racism and its relationship to genetics and the study of our ancestors without giving an inch, which I really appreciated.Sykes was also deeply helpful to me in trying to understand my own genetic history. I took one of these ancestry DNA tests a while ago and found it interesting, but lacked detail in some areas - all I had was '77% British ancestry, and this is the maternal haplogroup'. It was incredibly helpful to put all this in the context of Sykes research which looks at the genetic history of the British Isles in far far more detail. I absolutely encourage anyone with an interest in the subject to read this excellent primer."
49,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83289346-tiana-montgomery,3,"A book where science and history collides to give a very detailed genetic study of the Celts, Vikings & Anglo-Saxons. Bryan Sykes is a Professor of Genetics at Oxford University and has led the way in using DNA to better understand the past. For this reason alone my interest was sparked. To me ""science is just magic that has been explained."" There are so many unknowns in history. When we get given the opportunity to see history through a scientific lense, more information or evidence becomes available to us and more can be explained. When we find new information or new details, we can use that to either bridge a gap, or write an entirely different story. This book shows a comparative and crossing over of each group and its history backed up with archaeological findings and DNA testing. It's a fascinating read, its very interesting to see where historical theories are confirmed or debunked. Definitely recommend the read for any history buff."
50,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1300439-paula,3,"Sykes apologizes frequently for the technical aspect of the work, but I did not read anything herein that was technical at all. The closest he comes to being technical is explaining on a very rudimentary level where mitochondria and Y-DNA come from, and how mutations help to differentiate families. The majority of the book contains brief histories of Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England. There are only small sections that locate major families of DNA (which in his usual fashion, he names with call names rather than their scientific designation) within the various counties. I would like to have seen maps of the areas that he is naming, since I live in the USA not on the British Isles. I would also like to have seen a list of his call names with the scientific designations clearly identified. Otherwise, I don't have any complaints."
51,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17525671-andy-m,5,"Published in 2006, this book certainly shows its age twelve years later. To an admirable degree, Sykes doesn't make his revelations in any blunt way meant to set his own ideas apart as more valuable. Among a few surprises, Sykes makes the case (with the available tools and understanding of his time) that there aren't really any genetic markers setting apart Picts from the Celtic tribes. Sykes' work is a thesis built on a large collection of specimens Y-DNA and mDNA over a wide range of Britain and Ireland. He considers the insights found in the archaeology, history, and even the legends and myths, but ultimately his own argument is based on own original research."

It has sections on Ireland, Scotland, England, Wales and the Northern Isles, with even a bonus piece on Iceland. It dramatically improved my understanding of the British Isles. Not light reading, this is a serious book with some difficult passages when it gets down to the brass tacks of the genealogy, but if those passages are too tough, his summaries and conclusions on genealogy would suffice and a reader could skip lightly through the hard bits."

I recently had my DNA tested, which piqued my interest in genetics. This book answered many questions I had about Saxons, Celts and the history of the British isles. Sykes masterfully summarizes the complex history of his homeland, weaving in mythology, sociology, and scientific methods. His casual, yet enthusiastic style of writing makes genetic history very entertaining!"
54,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22979707-thomas-lang,4,"What is most striking about this book is how well written and lyrical the writing is, given that it is done so by someone trained in the hard sciences. The paragraphs describing the varied landscapes of Britain or the colorful mythical origins are a joy to read. The next most striking aspect if this book is how many topics are covered. This book brought a lot more than expected - concise history, ancient lore, basic biology and genetics, and a virtual travelogue of the various people and regions of the islands. I'm not sure I've read a book which enlightened me on so many varied subjects."
55,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42594900-joel-adamson,5,"An excellent book for any level of British history buff. The classic stories of England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland are recounted for neophytes, and done well to please the aficionados. The motivation for the book is explained in the early chapters in terms of Victorian popularity of Saxon racial identity in England's ruling classes. Also woven throughout is the story of how Sykes and his team collected their data and excellent explanations of what the DNA data means. I'm not just a British history guy, I used to be a biologist, so I can attest that from both angles, this is a great book."
56,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8204846-victor,2,"Hasn't kept well. The authors ego intrudes everywhere and the book can't decide if it is a novel, general history or a research project.I know Sykes was a pioneer in this field but his use of personal names to describe DNA groups is irritating to me. Like his own private language. Could do with a cross reference somewhere to scientific terms for them. The web site mentioned in the appendix may have had this but is no longer there."
57,0393062686,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50686717-joe,4,"Easy to read and follow for what can be a complex topic. I find though there were areas of the Isles completely ignored, such as lower Scotland. He concludes everone is basically Celtic, except SE England which had similar genetics he suddenly concluded more closely related to Belgium across the channel. Not saying he is wrong, it just seemed to be a leap that could've been more fleshed out."
