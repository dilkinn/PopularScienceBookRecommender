This is what Alex Bellos tells us through many stories ranging from ancient Sumeria to today's computer geek centres. I learned so much with this book, and at the same time it was such fun. I will be getting back to it often. My last read of the year was surely one of my best reads of the year!"
1,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6297140-lili,5,"*I received this book thanks to Goodreads First Read program and I am giving it a fair review*Once in a great while I run into a book that I want to savor like fine chocolate. Usually I am very much so a speed reader and just zoom through a book, The Grapes of Math was an entirely different thing. I found myself pausing frequently after sections lost in thought about the material presenting, absorbing the concepts and ideas. I loved it!Math and I have a very love/hate relationship, to me it is very much so a beautiful language that I only half understand. It has never come easy to me...blame me being an impatient learner, poor teaching, having an 'abnormal' way of looking at the world and needing things explained differently...whatever...it has been a source of wonder and intense frustration my whole life. As an adult I find myself more and more irked that I did not work harder to master the art of numbers, so of course I was more than thrilled to read this book. It is exactly the kind of reading material I would suggest to someone who has the same 'learning disability' (not that it really is, it is more a learning hiccup) as me. This book takes at times very advanced concepts and explains them in ways that actually make sense. It uses history, real life, art, and some awesome illustrations to make things like calculus and trigonometry approachable. True this book is not a textbook, I did not walk away from it knowing how to do calculus, but I did walk away from it knowing how to approach it, how to think mathematically. I am going to go out on a limb and say this is the best book I have read this year, possibly the best book I have read in years. I am most certainly going to read Here's Looking At Euclid now. "

But we are surrounded by numbers, they are in the things that we read, play a key role in everything we do online and the wonders of a simple cone.In this book Bellos draws out the stories behind the numbers. We learn how simple triangulation allows us to move around the country with maps and sat nav. How exponential growth is the key number behind You Tube sensations and Catalan architecture. We meet those playing the game of life are beginning to understand the deepest complexities of life from a simple computer programme and how a simple mathematical law can catch the financial crook, and we discover just what peoples favourite number are.It is a reasonably accessible book too, even for those that normal turn a paler shade when the word maths is mentioned. He does drift of into the delights of calculus in one chapter, but all of the others are well explained, understandable, and may even make you smile every now and again."
3,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22457802-anthoney,4,"My memory fails me most of the time when it comes to having read and comprehended science and maths. It is a curse but has a silver lining in that I get to reorient with the fascinating world of maths and the concepts and the theorems and the deep insights seems wonderful again and I am like ""Wow"" again.Not that reading such stuff makes me any smarter, in fact it makes me feel like a dunce that I haven't comprehended this stuff in spite of being introduced to these. I envy those who have been able to tame these wild beasts and domesticated them for our application and contributed to the development of the modern Scientific world. But the joy in reading about mathematical gems and treasures is so rewarding that I almost weep with joy at some of the discoveries, some of the outcomes of some equations just hit you ""boom"", I swear I am left shocked and thunderstruck.The book covers the usual suspects of the genre related to mathematics - pi, exponential constants, trigonometry , calculus, factorials - sounds intimidating but Bellos explains it well and connects the subjects. After 25 years finally figured out trig basics of sin cos tan better. Regret I didn't pay attention in school. Got to know the beauty of Mandelbrot set, catenaries that inspired Gaudi architecture (have to know more of him), the fascinating Game of Life. Great introductions.Having read a few pop maths book, feel that such Pop book writing seems to have evolved. Writers seem to have developed in their translation of technical concepts and present it more palpably. This book is an example. But alas I will have to come back to it cos I already seem to be forgetting some concepts. Maths will always be elusive to me but I will make that pilgrimage again. "
4,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21092934-eleanor,5,"I received this book for free through Goodreads: First reads.I really enjoyed reading this book and, contrary to my fear that I might lose heart with it, I found myself more and more intrigued by each subsequent chapter. Bellos deals with maths in a wonderfully playful fashion. His attitude shines through in the chapter illustrations as well as some charmingly phrased analogies and segues into the next discussion.""Speaking of long tails, Godzilla had one""The text is written in a casual and friendly 1st person which guides you through the different topics. I found this a little strange at first, as I am used to formal scientific articles and textbooks, but I soon tempered to it. Also, this happily separated it from associations with hard work.The book gives us glimpses of Maths' progression in history and introduces us to key players both historical and contemporary including interviews/quotes and pen pictures of the persons in question.""Cédric Villani is no ordinary-looking university professor...He always wears a three-piece suit, starched white collar, lavaliere cravat - the kind folded extravagantly in a giant bow - and a sparkling, tarantula-sized spider brooch.""Effectively it is the exploration of Mathematics with the personality left in.As someone already enthusiastic about Maths, I was pleased to discover new laws and the ""Game of Life"" as well as concepts with which I was already familiar presented in a new way. However, I did find something a little troubling in the tone of the introduction; a suggestion that I, the reader, would be reluctant to engage with this book and needed persuading.A note on the book's physical appearance: I am disproportionally enraptured by the archer on the spine of the book shooting an arrow into a beautiful parabola, but I could not conclude without mentioning it. It is excellent. Though, Alex, how many times is it necessary to print your name and image on the dustcover? I know you must be proud, but it is a little much.4.5 stars (though rounding up only seemed fair)"
5,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3013648-priya,3,"This book is strictly for the Math enthusiasts and can make for some difficult reading for the uninitiated. While the author tries to make it fun, most of the book still feels very 'text-bookish' and may not appeal to everyone. This is quite unlike his other book - Alex's adventures in Numberland which is easy and fun for everyone to read."
6,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24831615-thebookwarren,4,"“Alex through the looking glass” (missing from Goodreads?!?!) is the prize novel from Bellos thus far, but the constant treasure throughout is the witty charm of Alex Bellos. Bellos then weaves & intertwines that humour & crafts a narrative that almost steals the show.. But not quite - Numbers still, are King & there’s no shortage of truly remarkable numbers to become absorbed in.No page is complete without a relaxed flow of eccentric & quirky undertone. Overall, humour & numbers may not be used for fun in today’s society, but Alex Bellos proves you sure can make some incredible links & tell some incredible tales by simply making each mathematical equation or data far more real & interesting by soaking and absorbing it into real life narrative. Whether one is engaged in a passage about the mathematical code behind a park bench to breaking up mathematics & delving deep into the world of algorithmic breakdowns & trigonometric theory."
7,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/800857-dave,4,"A really enjoyable, readable exploration of some higher math that I haven't thought about since the dark days of high school trig and calc. There is a lot of cool stuff for the math curious in here (Benford's Law, Conway's Game of Life, how to fairly divide a cake between three people) presented in a lively manner that I wish I'd seen in my math textbooks. Still, if you never want to see an equation again, this book may not be for you. A notation-heavy dive into calculus about two-thirds of the way through nearly lost me, but Bellos bounces back with a fascinating look at arcane math theory and computing. "
8,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2945070-thom,3,"Really enjoyed this author's previous book, Here's Looking at Euclid: A Surprising Excursion Through the Astonishing World of Math, which was a lot of fun to read and very accessible to the math-challenged. This book has about the same amount of humor but dives a little deeper into complicated math.Really enjoyed the sections on triangles, e, and i, the latter including the Mandelbrot set. I believe the author went a little too far into cones, and the chapter topics as a whole feel more scattered than the previous book. Good, but not great."
9,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27494376-spencer-broadley,5,"I fortunately got this through goodreads.com and am pleased about thatI saw Alex Bellos on BBC Breakfast News being interviewed and was very impressed - I knew I had won a copy at that time, but was hoping the postman would bring it quickly. 2 days later I received my copy.What a book!!!! I have some statistical/mathematics background, but the book will - should - be interesting and useful for all-comers, whether number minded or not - in fact, I believe it will be great to increase people's abilities with numbers.I must recommend it fully to anyone, well written, well explained and certainly interesting. - 5 stars all the wayNow I will be hunting more of Alex's books out"
10,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2295979-eric-roston,4,"I read a bunch of these pop math survey books, and this one is somehow better. Great e examples, and playful language. I haven't read his first, Here's Looking at Euclid, but look forward to it as the title is a five-star pun."
11,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32469983-germae,5,"This book explains how basic mathematical concepts were initially conceived and the ideas behind it all (think the ancient Greeks, Egyptians, Arabians as well as the esteemed mathematicians of the 1400-1800s). He also explains how these same concepts are used in everyday life, ranging from statistics, calculus and geometry (yes, the very fundamentals of Mathematics). Sprinkled throughout are also facts about some of these concepts that are inexplicably interesting, and how nature have always had these concepts ingrained in its very core.Make no mistake: this book isn't written for seasoned mathematicians, but it is written with laypersons (or those who rote-learn maths in school, *like myself*) in mind. If mathematics isn't your thing, I would still recommend this book if you're feeling curious to know all the things you learnt before (or didn't) at school but never really understood how it came to be and what uses they possess.*spoiler* Some interesting facts:~The Fourier Transform (frequency domain) is exhibited in the cochlea of the human ear.~The catenary, when upside-down, is the most stable shape for a free-standing arch (and why this is so)~The mathematical constants pi and exponent 'e' are intertwined in so many mathematical formulas and even in nature~To measure the approximate height of a mountain, or the radius of the earth, all you need to measure is the distance between two points and the angle it makes at that point - basic geometry!I enjoyed this book very much as it was like journeying through a mathematical text book with more fun, and ultimately more appreciation for the subject matter (i.e. doesn't read like a text book!)"
12,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8427813-jessica,4,"This was a nice book. It's a bit high-level at times... I'm definitely in the upper tail of ""people who understand mathematics"" and some of this went over my head. But it wasn't a huge hinderance to my own enjoyment of the book, though I will say that if you're math-phobic there are a couple better choices out there than this one.Most of it was pretty standard. Stuff I've read and thought about before. However, this was honestly my first exposure to the Game of Life. It's the last chapter and I was completely fascinated by it! I don't usually read about math things and wish that I'd been there (hexaflexagons, YES), but this one really got me. I could feel the desire to tinker with something so simple, but so fascinating. Another thing that's great about it is how it stretches your idea of what ""math"" even is. There aren't any numbers or variables to be found, just tetris-like shapes that morph into different patterns before your eyes. I dunno, I just couldn't stop thinking of Boxes and Chips Challenge and how a game built on a simple square grid can yield so many hours of interest.The parabola multiplication also caught me off-guard. It's something I may try to work into my future algebra classes, just because it feels so surprising... though there is a proof included in the appendix which was helpful to me for making sense out of it. Maybe I'll give extra credit to any of my students who can generate the proof?Anyway, solid read, despite the chapter on conic sections (one of my least favorite units in my own math education and which I am loathe to teach to my juniors... so it gets the brunt of my disdain in my curriculum)."
13,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10546973-jacqueline,5,"this was so, so much fun. it was challenging, but not so challenging I gave up. I learned so much. I wish I'd been taking notes."
14,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"Alex Bellos does it again with The Grapes of Math. Throughout ten chapters Bellos goes through interesting and practical mathematical ideas. For example, people develop emotional attachments to numbers. Perhaps that is not the correct way to phrase it, but people have preferences when they choose random numbers. Cultural differences pop up as well. The floor numbers for buildings is an excellent example. In the United States, the number thirteen is considered unlucky, and due to this fact, the thirteenth floor is often omitted from skyscrapers or tall buildings. If you go to some Asian countries the number four sounds similar to their word for death so they omit the fourth floor. On the opposite end of the spectrum is the number seven in the United States which is considered a ‘lucky’ number. The number eight is lucky in China for a reason similar to that of four being unlucky.The book explores Benford’s Law to some extent, talking about how it was discovered and why it matters. The idea is that in any random sampling of numbers you will tend to find the numeral one in the leftmost position more often than not. You will find it almost twice as often as you will find the number two. He doesn’t go into the formal proof of this since the reason relies on Ergodic processes and is beyond the scope of the book, but he does provide a good starting point.Continuing, we find out about trigs, which are posts that were used to make maps back in the olden days. Before the advent of satellites and lasers and other modern surveying equipment, maps were woefully inaccurate. You had people that went out and had to survey the land. I believe George Washington did that for a while back before the French and Indian War, but please correct me if I am wrong. With accurate maps, it was possible to do a lot of things related to areas and land deeds. Trigonometry also made it possible to measure the size of the Earth. The first somewhat accurate measurement was approximated by Eratosthenes who used the information available to him to great effect. Trigonometry brings Trig tables, which confounded me when I was younger. How do you calculate a trig table without a calculator or some other device? I always wanted to know that. I already found out a calculating method to find the square root of a number, so a method of finding a trig ratio would be interesting.Chapter four discusses Conic Sections; parabolas, ellipses, circles, and hyperbolas. It talks about how to calculate them and how to use them in mechanics. I am quite familiar with the humble parabola being used to describe the motion of a projectile, but going back a few centuries we find that this wasn’t always the case. It took someone with an inquisitive mind like Galileo to come up with an experiment to show that projectiles follow parabolas. Before this, they were merely interesting figures to make. Without Cartesian coordinates and the powers of analytic geometry, it is easy to not know such things. The same idea applies to the ellipse. Before Johannes Kepler was around and came up with the three laws of planetary motion, the ancients assumed that the paths the planets took were circular since the circle is so perfect.Chapter five brings up oscillations and rotations. The ideas come from things like sine waves that translate themselves into other forms via the Euler Identity. So if you have a wave, any wave at all, you can decompose it into simpler equations. This was first discovered by Fourier and is named after him. It bothered his contemporaries, but it turns out that even square waves can be turned into a series of sinusoidal waves.Chapter six brings in Euler’s constant. Exponential Growth is on full display in this chapter, showing that there is a limit to how much you can earn through interest. Bellos demonstrates this using the tried and true method of a crazy money lender willing to give you 100% interest. So if you don’t compound it at all, one dollar becomes two dollars at the end of the year. It is quite simple. If you double your money twice in one year, that value is increased to 2.25. This is because you have to halve the rate along with the period to get 0.5 added in the first half and 0.75 added in the second half. As you continue this process of compounding the value more and more often, you reach a limit. This limit is a fundamental constant known as e. It pops up all over the place and is the same kind of number as pi. That is, it is a fundamental constant that is transcendental and irrational. You can’t define it exactly with an equation, but you can come very close.Chapter seven discusses negative numbers and how their development was hampered by suspicion and superstition. Negative numbers are unusual to the layman. They don’t work the same as positive numbers and the rules used to manipulate them can confuse people. Of course, we find a treasure trove of ideas behind the negative number, but that wasn’t always the case. The same goes for imaginary numbers, the numbers that contain the square root of negative one. So this chapter also explores fractals, mainly the Mandelbrot set. Before the age of computers, this would be written off as nothing more than a little diversion. The calculations to make such a thing are tedious, requiring millions of iterations. Once the 1980s rolled around though, computers were able to do it. It helped that computers were now powerful enough to be of use and ubiquitous enough to not have just a giant mainframe.Chapter eight introduces us to Calculus, a highly useful tool. It allows us to calculate change. Most people know of Calculus, even if they never took it before. It talks about the development of Calculus as a tool and the various jealousies and arguments that came along with it. The battles over notation for example. It set Great Britain back for 100 years since they stubbornly stuck with Newton’s clumsy notations.Chapter nine discusses proof. How do you prove that there is an infinite number of primes? You can’t just count all of them, that would take forever. So Euclid or someone devised a method using mathematical induction. He was quite clever in what he did. Now computers are used to aid in proofs, but the first one was not accepted as readily. That was for the four-color theorem back in 1976.The final chapter mentions Conway’s Game of Life. It was originally played on Go boards, but as computers became more powerful and commonplace it became easier to use computers to plot them out. The Game of Life is really simple, it only follows four rules. However, this simplicity leads to remarkable complexity.So this book was amazing. I enjoyed reading it and learned a little bit that I did not know before."
15,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18838479-andrew-davis,4,"One of the few ""popular"" maths books that turned out to be quite interesting.Introduces such topics as:- Benford's law, also called the First-Digit Law, is a law about the frequency distribution of leading digits in many (but not all) real-life sets of numerical data. That law states that in many naturally occurring collections of numbers the small digits occur disproportionately often as leading significant digits. For example, in sets which obey the law the number 1 would appear as the most significant digit about 30% of the time, while larger digits would occur in that position less frequently: 9 would appear less than 5% of the time. If all digits were distributed uniformly, they would each occur about 11.1% of the time.- Zipf's law states that given some corpus of natural language utterances, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. Thus the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc.- Conic sections with interesting exposition on ellipsis, parabola and hyperbola.- The catenary curve- Complex numbers and fractals.All those subjects were presented in very interesting manner. A good book, highly recommended"
16,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1058994-ryan-mishap,3,"Not unlike many people, I have not the fondness for math. I also have this unfortunate tendency to explore things I don't like to test my level of discomfort. Thankfully, there's writers like Alex Bellos whose sheer enthusiasm for a topic compels them to create books for the casual reader and engage them in a fun, interesting, and excited manner. Sure, my eyes go out of focus when reading 2x + 2i = *&%^&** or what have you, but Alex provides not only the numbers but the history of the people and the times where our concepts come from.The title bears no relation to anything in the book, though, but I think it is a warning about how much he loves bad puns."
17,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2715373-dan,4,"A great Math primer that discusses the role that mathematics plays in western civilization and how we got to where we are. A lot of the topics here are covered in the excellent youtube channel ""Numberphile"". While those videos are superb, the additional coverage here is a great expansion on the ideas.

26,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50614697-sb,3,"An incredibly interesting book regarding numbers and their role in our lives. For marketing purposes, Bellos argues that certain number sets are preferable, e.g. £7.99 over £8. The brain processes numbers from left to right, so £7.99 will register as cheaper than £8. In addition, prices ending in .99 are easier to forget and therefore harder to compare with other items that may be cheaper. For this reason, if you're selling something relatively cheap, it helps to sell at a round number, like £5 to help the consumer better remember the item and return to purchase. Brands that have numbers in their name should think carefully before choosing even or odd numbers; odd numbers (as the name suggests) are noted for ""not fitting in"" and being different. Odd numbers are also associated with rebelliousness and not following the crowd; Bellos uses the examples of Levi's 501, Levi's 500 just wouldn't have the same ring to it and that extra 1, is delivering to the customer that little bit more. However, when it comes to domestic products and items that you can't afford to have fail (condoms, domestic products, cleaning agents) your numbers need to communicate strength, competence and being able to get the job done. He uses the example of WD-40, arguing that no one would have enough faith in WD-39 (""why not 40?"") For household products, divisible numbers are more attractive to consumers than indivisible ones.Bellos notes that in both the East and the West, odd numbers are imbued with more spiritual significance than even ones. Perhaps it is because the brain processes even numbers a lot quicker than it does odd numbers. 7, for example, is a much loved number the world over and is seen as a mystical and magical number in many cultures. Bellos thinks it is because 7 is unique among the first 10 numbers, as it is the only number that cannot be multiplied or divided within the group. When 1,2,3,4 and 5 are doubled, the answer is less than or equal to 10. 6,8 and 10 can be halved and 9 is divisible by 3. It's also a prime number and people generally tend to prefer lower numbers (perhaps because they're easier for us to understand?) From very early on, the number 7 has been loved and praised by many cultures; the Jews declared that it took God six days to make the world and we still have a seven-day calendar, the Aztecs had a seven-day calendar too, though this was likely based on the amount of planets observed in the sky. Restaurants should also leave the £ sign out of their menus if they want customers to spend more (£ being a painful reminder of having to pay) and should refrain from listing their dishes on one side and having a column of prices on the other side; a quick scan of the prices will quickly force price-sensitive customers to read the menu from right to left. It is far better to list prices after the description of the item and customers will spend more, e.g.:Roast fillet of smoked haddock with warm potato salad and crispy onions 7.50Round numbers are more upmarket; a posh restaurant should never price a main dish at 34.99, as this appears a bit bargain and a bit cheap.Benson's Law states that the most common leading digit in any set of random data will be 1 and the least common 9; the order of probability of these numbers occurring decreases, the higher the digit. So, 2 as a leading digit is more common than 3, which is more common than 4 etc. This law holds true whether you're looking at newspaper numbers, sports scores, share prices or death tolls; this is surprising, as we would intuitively expect every number to have an equal chance of occurring. This law has been used in fighting financial crime, as sets of numbers that do not conform to Benson's law can show that data manipulation has occurred. Bellos gives examples of voting numbers falsified in Iran and companies manipulating their financial data for gain. In animals, metabolic rate does not rise as fast as mass, showing that animals get more efficient at producing energy as they get bigger; lifespan is directly proportional to mass, so the bigger the animal, the longer its life."
27,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12454900-brad-eastman,3,"This is a fun book to read for those of us who have some background in math from a long time ago, but don't use it very often. I took a year of high school calculus and a semester of university calculus more than thirty years ago. I work with lots of engineers who are for more intimately acquainted with mathematical concepts. Mr. Bellos explains concepts in mathematics in a historical fashion, but also shows how the concepts were used to solve real world problems and create new applications. Mr. Bellos starts with a fascinating discussion of the psychology of numbers, showing how knowledge of human reaction to certain quantities can be used for marketing, detecting fraud and understanding behavior. He then proceeds to explain how are understanding of triangles, comics and circles grew throughout time and how that growing understanding led to amazing inventions and understanding of our world. He discusses exponential growth, calculus, differential equations, trigonometry and the rise of mathematical models of life and the universe. Along the way, he incorporates interesting biographical details making the book a fun read. Me. Bellos clearly marvels at the coincidences of numbers and the underlying rationality of mathematical systems. His enthusiasm is infectious. Do not skip,the footnote material where Mr. Bellos incorporates a lot of interesting etymology of mathematical terms and other historical facts."
28,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16065798-sam,5,"Thoroughly enjoyed this 2014 book about numbers. Explains in plain English complex mathematical concepts, including historic and philosophical dimensions. Somewhere in the last 2-3 chapters I got quite out of my comfort zone and started to wonder - just what is mathematics good for? Is mathematics really of any relevance to my life anymore?But Alex Bellos was able to retain enough relatedness and good humour for the book to land despite the stretch at the end. If it lacked that stretch it might lack endurance as a book. Writers in STEM often take a particular perspective on the field, inevitable given the breadth and depth in the current era. Bellos is an Oxford graduate of Mathematics and Philosophy - a terrific combination, but he works as a numerate foreign correspondent in Argentina. He performed many interviews for this book.I did find the mathematics history and philosophy more interesting than some of the current advanced mathematics, and mathematicians.

This one focuses on exactly what the sub-title describes: how we're involved with numbers on a daily basis, how we interact with them, what they mean, how wonderful and elegant all of this is, and how excitingly self-referential the more you explore.This books goes a bit further than most in exploring the wacky gamesmanship lives of the several personalities who explored numerical phenomena and its manifold depths - and it barely scratched the surface. There's so much more to explore, and to know, and to apply.I think our school system has this all backwards. Books like *this* should be part of curricula, whetting appetites, and once whetted, a curious ambitious sort could grab a textbook and learn more if he or she wishes, and parlay to discovery and advancement.Would that it were so."

263,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2791785-jason-keglovitz,4,Far better than the typical pop-math book
264,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10887408-sweemeng-ng,5,Very good good book on the introduction to maths. If I read this book in school I probably will develop more interest in maths.

268,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5254180-atti,5,"One of the best books I read so far, wish i had found it sooner. I read the UK edition 'Alex through the looking glass'"
269,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27365529-ivan-taylor,5,"I loved this book. Having done my undergraduate degree in Mathematics and working for 33 years in Operational Research, I knew some of these stories but others were new to me and fascinating."
270,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5433361-linda,4,"This title has been tantalizing me since I added it to my To-Read list in May 2014. Having finished it, I now feel a bit like Aesop's Fox (""The Fox and the Grapes""). Here are these beautiful mathematical truths (the ""grapes"") and I cannot grasp them all. I was familiar with some of them, such as pi, and e, and i (the square root of -1), and Euler's Identity (e^i*pi +1 = 0), but others were totally new or only marginally familiar. Not that the book was BAD, it just seemed to be written for professional mathematicians rather than laypeople. (What was really discouraging? The fact that, 49 years ago, I graduated from the University of Utah with a BA degree in mathematics. Guess I should have tried to keep up with advances in the field.)"
271,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10174911-syed-ashrafulla,3,"This is meant to be a fun book about some of the more whimsical parts of mathematics. The problem for me is that it's too trivial. It's enough to look at the chapter on logarithms. Every three paragraphs ends with ""isn't this neat!?"" like it's a TV show. That doesn't belong in a book. Books are active engagement mediums, I'm already interested, sentences like those interrupt what is being told. It's the equivalent of breaking the fourth wall.I'm ok with the higher level descriptions and I believe laypeople can pick up the math. I just dislike the presentation and as a result the book."
272,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8197573-kari,5,"I never thought I’d say I loved reading about math, but here we are. There are complex ideas in this book, ranging from geometry all the way to derivatives and integrals. With a basic understanding of math through calculus, this is a great book. It’s beautiful and fun and educational and funny all in one. He provides clear concise explanations, with appendices to explain more in depth if math wasn’t to it thing. He provides real life examples and takes you through history from Ancient Greece to computers. It’s amazing and I loved it. "
273,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1849937-yofish,4,"A dozen (basically) independent chapters, each on a different math topic. A pretty good description for the layman. Lots of stories about the personalities involved. I liked how he would start a chapter with a fairly straightforward topic and just sort of let it lead to wherever it led. For example, negative numbers lead to imaginary numbers and eventually to the Mandelbrot set. Trigonometry leads to the measuring of Mount Everest. I also really liked the chapter on the Game of Life, which one doesn’t often see addressed in these “Math for the Layman” books."

Purchase Alex Through the Looking Glass here for just $12!

Translating complex mathematical concepts and ideas using examples across art and history to demonstrate how they apply to life and the world around us. You don’t need to be good at maths to be completely enthralled with this book. Hermann- The Book Grocer"
275,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46616940-oscar-despard,5,"This is a fascinating book, which describes simply the mathematical concepts which govern our world. Bellos strikes the right balance between being patronisingly simplistic and being excessively professorial, and thus manages to create this compulsive read. The book’s explanations of famous mathematical concepts, interspersed with entertaining anecdotes, are accessible and mind-boggling in equal measure, and produce a book that could be recommended to anyone."
276,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4764429-liz,3,"I really enjoy Bellos' writing (also having read his previous book Here's Looking at Euclid). I think he's really good at writing about math in a way that can be understood by a layperson (can't confirm since I have a math degree, but I THINK he does this well) but also doesn't lose the intricacies and rigor of the content described. He also makes really good math jokes. "
277,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76492198-phil,4,"This is s great book if you like anything about science or math. You don’t need to be a savant to understand the concepts. I gave a copy to my sister in law, a math teacher, as I think some of the information might be used as special topics in a high school math class. It may just excite a few young minds to pursue math. "
278,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82351125-eric,4,"Very good. Would have wanted it to go into more detail in places, but this is a very good place to start when trying to work out which areas you want to do further research into. Probably not quite as good as numberland. It’s also nice that it can be read without knowing any of the content in numberland."
279,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7214023-jake-cooper,2,"Assumes readers are very novice at math (okay), and tries to make them say ""wow"" rather than ""aha"" (less okay). I much preferred his earlier Here's Looking at Euclid."
280,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9764243-angela,4," A it more complicated from the math point of view that the first one, so I really need to take my time understand it ( it could not be read before going to bed ). Full of details about the live of mathematicians and insights about how they manage to make discoveries in a lot of math branches.I really liked the conclusion:""Math is, and always has been, a game. it's the game of life."""
281,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/315151-art-king,5,"Alex starts the book with ""Math is a Joke"" and ends with ""Math is a Game"". In between is a wonderful romp through the lives of the people who have illuminated many amazing mathematical things. The best science and discovery book I've read in a long while.																							"
282,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55586171-kyle,5,"Great book on math for all backgrounds. If you don’t know math, it’s a good educational book. If you enjoy math and love it, it is quite interesting and intriguing; providing a deeper understanding and different perspective on some things with a lot of humor. Best math book I’ve read so far!"
283,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72960748-ryan,4,"I picked up Grapes of Math long ago and finally sat down to read it. I wish I had been shown some of these chapters going through school, as I think it's eye opening. It's also quite interesting of a read for a math book."
284,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7596560-stefan,2,"Not for everyone. If you already heard most of the stories, this will not grip you. If you don't have a basic grasp on math, this will go over your head. Maybe recommended for mid- to late school age?"
285,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95713748-rolande,5,"Brilliant. If you love numbers, or maths, then you'll love this book. This is definately one of the best books I've ever read. Some parts are difficult to get your head round but the author does make allowances for this. "
286,1451640099,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20488652-catherine,4,"I loved this book, particularly the beginning (the ending probably gets a little too dense for me).
