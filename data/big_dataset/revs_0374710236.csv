0,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,1,"This book contains memoirs of a mathematician, Cedric Villani, a recipient of the Fields medal. Originally written in French, I read a version that has been translated into English. The translation seems to be excellent. VIllani collaborated with Clement Mouhot, to derive and prove a theorem related to Landau damping. This is not a pure-mathematics theorem. It is based on a real physical phenomenon that occurs in plasmas. So, it is of great interest to physicists, as well to mathematicians.The main problem with this book, is that the author does not know who its reader should be. Should the reader be a professional mathematician? Perhaps, but then why would half of the book be devoted to an exploration of how a mathematician works day-to-day? Mathematicians already know that.Should the reader be an informed layman, with some interest in mathematics? In that case, why are there so many pages scattered throughout the book, filled with very esoteric formulas that only a true expert will understand. Many full pages in the book are filled with equations like this:  The words that accompany these pages are not of any help in understanding the equations.The book also contains many pages of e-mail correspondence, mostly between Villani and Mouhot. This correspondence sheds a little bit of light on how a mathematician might operate during a collaboration. But again, unless you are a professional mathematician, you don't stand a chance in understanding most of the correspondence.And besides all this, the author makes no effort at all to explain Landau damping, let alone its relationship to his theorem. Landau damping is a real physical phenomenon, with applications in several areas of physics. But having read the book, I still have no idea what it is all about. A quick glance at Wikipedia helps to understand it. But, the book does not even devote a single paragraph to explain what it is about."

2,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3674147-ismael-mejia,4,"If I tell that the subject of the book is 'the daily life of a mathematician during the conception of a theorem'. Everybody would agree that it sounds intimidating, but it is not. Villani is not only a top-class mathematician, but a nice writer and an 'agreable' author. The book is a nice read, and the inclusion of letters, photos and other notes make of it a really pleasant experience.The only lacking part of the book is in the explanations about the math of his own work, I know the theorem he conceives during the story is almost half the size of the book (and that assuming mathematical notation means it's longer than the book), but he could have presented it more clearly, and even include an extra appendix for advanced readers."
3,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7753364-pratyush,4,"Cédric Villani is a flamboyant character. If you happen to catch any talk by him on the internet, you'd always find him in a three-piece suit with a scarf and a spider brooch taking in a raspy French accent. Talking of mathematical genealogy, he is a direct descendant of such greats as Jacob, Euler, Bernoulli, Lagrange, Laplace, and Poisson. Big names.Wouldn't it be interesting to open the mind of such a person and peer into it as he went about his day ? This book gives you the closest possible approximation to such an experience.The book is divided into chapters corresponding to various dates during a two year period, which ends with (surprise!) him winning the coveted Fields Medal. There is not much else in terms of structure to it. The text, written in first person, keeps going astray. One moment, he'll be telling you about an important unsolved problem in mathematics and the next he may have moved on to complaining about the lack of good cheese in New Jersey. There's an entire page containing just a comma separated list of his favourite songs. While such indiscipline may seem unpardonable for most authors, Monsieur Villani has the effect of keeping one utterly engaged. Some of the most illuminating thoughts can be found in the transcripts of the author's correspondences with his research partner.It is fascinating to see how perspiration, perseverance and inspiration combine and feed off each other, seemingly at random to give something really beautiful. And all this in an otherwise normal human being with hobbies and worries similar to everyone else.The book also contains interesting portraits of mathematicians and mathematical problems, giving context to the world in which the author lives and works.I would recommend the book to anyone working in a quantitative or creative field or anyone who appreciates the labour of love.PS - Some of the sections in the book contain really heavy mathematics, which was beyond me and as I read later, most professional mathematicians. Don't let it dissuade you from going through the rest of book. I'd say it serves to highlight the abstractness of the author's work."
4,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12830647-saman,5,"Someday in our university I saw a proclamation about a Math Seminar, the subject was very tempting ""The Planet,Stars And Eternity"" By Cedrik Villani, fields Medalist. And I went to that seminar, He was one the most inspiring mathematicians I've ever seen, He spoke about Universe, What we know about it, Newton ideas about the world, How Poincare was thinking about universe, What Equations (like boltzmann equation) tell us about our world and even, what really Math is about !After his fantastic speech I bought his book and it took me a week to read it carefully. It was not just inspiring and enlightening about Math and science but also it was very artistic and beautiful."
5,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10145524-charles-daney,3,"It's not entirely clear what the theorem is that the title refers to. And that's the biggest problem with the book: there's just too much left unexplained.In 2010 Villani won a prestigious Fields Medal for the work covered in his book. He had enough self-confidence to make that award consciously his goal. The citation for his award reads that it is ""for his proofs of nonlinear Landau damping and convergence to equilibrium for the Boltzmann equation"". Unfortunately, if you want even a layperson's account of either of these topics, let alone a more detailed technical account, you'll need to search the Web. It's not in Villani's book.A brief but helpful overview is in the award citation itself:One of the fundamental and initially very controversial theories of classical physics is Boltzmann’s kinetic theory of gases. Instead of tracking the individual motion of billions of individual atoms it studies the evolution of the probability that a particle occupies a certain position and has a certain velocity. The equilibrium probability distributions are well known for more than a hundred years, but to understand whether and how fast convergence to equilibrium occurs has been very difficult. Villani (in collaboration with Desvillettes) obtained the first result on the convergence rate for initial data not close to equilibrium. Later in joint work with his collaborator Mouhot he rigorously established the so-called non-linear Landau damping for the kinetic equations of plasma physics, settling a long-standing debate.There's a lot of detail in the book on the day-to-day struggles of Villani and his collaborators to deal with these problems, but there's no simple statement, like the preceding, what it's all about. It's not even made clear that one of the theorems proved is about an equation known as the ""Boltzmann equation"" (after Ludwig Boltzman who discovered it in 1872), while a different theorem was about ""Landau damping"" (after Lev Landau who made the conjecture in 1946). These two problems in thoretical physics have a lot in common, since both deal with the behavior of nonsolid bulk matter (gases and plasmas). And their mathematical treatment involves complicated partial differential equations, of which Villani is a master. However, despite the similarities, the subject matter here is not just one single theorem. That's OK, but it's probably going leave readers a bit confused.Partial differential equations (PDE) are ubiqitous in theoretical physics, and their study is an entire distinct and active field in mathematics. Any PDE describes how several related physical quantities change due to changes in several independent variables. A solution of a PDE isn't a single number, but rather a function whose value depends on the independent variables. One of those independent variables is usually time (""t""), and the functions also depend on the specific values of independent variables at a particular ""initial"" time t=0. There are several especially important questions about a function that's a solution of a PDE – about the long term behavior of the function. Since the function represents a physical quantity, it cannot, in a finite time, increase in value without limit. (If it did, there would be something wrong with the equation of which it is a solution.) But in applications it's important to know how slowly or how rapidly the function changes over time. Another question is whether or not the function's values eventually settle down to a relatively stable value. Mathematicians address these issues by trying to discover specific limits that the values of a function should not exceed. The approach is to use measures on a function, called ""norms"", that quantify the limits. There are many different norms that can be used, and the choice of a norm has to be based on how easy it is to use known techniques to estimate the value of the norm. Knowing how to do this effectively is the bread and butter of mathematicians who specialize in PDE, and Villani is certainly one of them. He is clearly a master at this kind of work. But even for mathematicians who aren't PDE specialists, let alone for general readers, it's hardly possible to understand the intricacies that are involved. The book is packed full of equations. This is ordinarily considered a huge impediment to book sales, for good reasons. In the present case, most readers may overlook the bewildering profusion of formulas in the hope of understanding better what it is that mathematicians actually do. And indeed, the book is usefully read if the equations and formulas are largely ignored. Mathematicians who aren't PDE specialists will be able to understand the symbols and general form of the equations, even if they have no clue about how to analyze them. But most readers will quickly give up on trying to follow the details as being (literally) ""Greek to them"".The problem here is that the book purports to help understand not just the quotidian work of mathematicians. It does that to some extent. But it sheds very little light on the creative aspect of mathematical work. Yes, Villani and his collaborators had to struggle for months with their equations to achieve significant results. But the reader is left wondering what kind of a struggle it was. Did it involve only the masterful and dogged deployment (""like a bull at a gate"") of existing specialist techniques that are known to the most highly skilled in the craft? Or did it involve breakthrough creative conceptual leaps that opened up really novel perspectives on the subject matter? Was the mountain climbed through sheer strength and stamina? Or did it require the invention of entirely new methods? (And if so, how?) Most importantly, were useful techniques invented that would allow others to solve similar but different problems?There just doesn't seem to be enough information in the book to answer these questions."
6,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35747916-joost,2,"A fun read, but utterly disjointed. Mathematical formulas stuffed in seem to only serve to make the work seem more like magic and less like work. The author or the translator seemingly cannot make up their mind on whether they want it to be a story of someone with a cool job or of the mysterious mathematical savant. I have the sneaking suspicion that you're not actually supposed to be able to read the LaTeX codes or know what an integral is when you read this book. Gotta keep up the mystery!It's littered with translated lyrics from French songs, only tangentially related to the story. Two full pages are just a list of songs the author likes. Sure, music may be relevant to his process, but then explain! I'd rather hear what three songs really do to you, as a person, or as a mathematician, than what dozens of songs you like.The story never really comes together, the author seems to be trying too hard to be interesting. Frankly, he almost certainly is - which is why the desperate attempt to come across as such in this book is such a waste."

Cedric Villani aptly comments on a mathematician's quest as 'a search in a dark room for a black cat which in fact isn't even there', reading his story will make you believe it.There are multiple sections in the book every now and then on famous mathematicians and their equally interesting stories & mathematical ideas. They are a treat for anyone who simply wants to admire sheer passion and imagination with which these priests of the most pristine branch of science work with. One can safely ignore the equations and technical commentary which may seem daunting to any outsider or even to a professional mathematician outside of author's field of expertise. In spite of that, every bit of this story is enjoyable and inspirational."

11,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20069551-davide-nole,3,"This is a meta-book, I shall say, because it puts together different styles and pieces of information that wobble around the figure of the author, as well as its main interest in life, and what got him the Fields Medal*, Boltzmann’s Equation.The idea behind the book is to show what happened inside Villani’s head while he was actually developing his theorem, in order to give an insight into the thought processes and style of a great mathematician. In this attempt, we are thrown into a multi-dimensional world full of different experiences, from reading manga, to listening to some particular kind of music, from childcare to administration of high-level institutes. I am going to say that sometimes this book is plainly describable as an ordered mess, but a great mess. On one page you are shown a very important theorem, and on the next one you are discussing about why L, M and N are great characters for a manga.One of the perks of the book is the fact that ...(continues here davidhooksite.wordpress.com/2017/03/1...)"

13,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7834273-sukyna,5,Didn't want it to end.
14,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28512615-maddy-hutter,4,"By chance, I heard Cedric Villani speak at Powells a couple of weeks ago, and it was a wonderful experience. This ""rock star"" mathematician is charismatic, charming, and eccentric as well as brilliant. His latest book, Birth of a Theorem, is about the journey he and his colleague take as they work to write the proof of their theorem which concerns something to do with plasmas called Landau damping. I understood nothing of the mathematics, but the talk Villani gave that enticed me was much more about the creative process, and this was the thrilling part of his story. Written in diary format, there are emails that document the frustratingly tedious and challenging mathematical exploration, and potted histories of relevant mathematicians along with delightful pencil sketches of the same. There are also musings on literature, art, and music about which Villani is an enthusiast. True, there are many italicized pages of impenetrable mathematical notations and explanations, but I simply skimmed right over them. Villani takes the reader into his own marvelous life as prize winning scholar, but he is always an appealingly normal person who misses French cheese when in Princeton, must get away to think for hours in a dark closet, and works with his papers spread all over the living room floor. Villani's book is a testament to collegiality, innovation, optimism, courage, self-awareness, and affection. Plus, he is one heck of a character. Just google the guy!"
15,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56253068-shreeyesh-menon,3,"It's an absolute pleasure as Cedric Villani walks you through his mind, complete with his inner monologues as he encounters the many demons in his quest for mathematical glory. The book is written as a very personal account of a mathematician's life, in a sense that you see the passion for discovery and the disappointment at encountering failures from very close quarters. The emotion comes through in Villani's masterful writing, or at least the English translation does a good job in preserving the emotion from the original text. One amazing thing about the book is that it doesn't try to dumb things down for the casual reader at all. Every theorem, every complex idea and every academic exchange between Villani and his colleague Clement Mouhot is served to you in its pristine. At the very outset, it is made clear that the book is not a mathematical treatise. The only negative about the book is that it may be too disorganized, and there are parts of a mathematician's life (or just anyone's life) that are not too engaging to read, so it does have dry patches. What else might irk you is that the actual ""birth"" of the theorem is rather unceremoniously presented, and hurried through. But I guess that's the best he could do, speaking to a largely illiterate audience. As far as the objective of the book is concerned, if it was to make the general reader appreciate the path to mathematical discovery, it does a splendid job. "
16,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23211705-cristian,5,"This is a truly beautiful book. I heard about it during a podcast and I bought it in pre-sale straight away. I am not familiar with mathematics at the level of the author, yet I was extremely curious about the creative process leading the ""discovery"" of a theorem. I can say the book do not disappoints. The author is extremely generous with his thoughts, ups, downs and even ""off"" time when working. From living in a secluded place, to manga, music or being a dad, every page its interesting and adds value to the whole.For me, it was a great experience. I learn a lot and I really enjoyed entering the mind of a genius such as Cédric Villani."

Villani doesn’t skimp on mathematical details, almost all of which will be beyond the ken of all but a handful of readers, but he is nevertheless able to convey an appreciation of the wonder and excitement of mathematical discovery, as well as the hard work associated with the field. In addition to his own mathematical work, Villani shares stories of other mathematicians as well as his favorite songs, his love of manga, and his interactions with his wife and children."

Also, to be fair, I am not sure of Cedric's intentions. For all his joy of mathematics, he has left it behind for first administration, and now politics. I enjoyed the book. It was a good read. The mathematical mysticism was unnecessary, but fun, like an insider joke. I don't think I would have enjoyed this earlier. This book took a while to finish, because it would frequently make me stop reading and mail a bunch of my colleagues about current projects. It's been fun. Flawed, but fun. Really gave me a sense of having people who share my obsession for work."

(And yes, I do realize that we privilege mathematical thinking but even if math were held as ""only"" as important as writing, or art, or teaching, Villani is clearly thinking things that I have no idea how to think, and that's amazing, and cool to spend time with."

His dreams, his favorite music, some fun and relevant poetry, his hatred of air conditioning, his utter disrespect for American bread and cheese and chiefly his worshipping of other mathematicians, many of whom are granted a short portrait, often accompanied by a literal one.Does not help to know math, this is unspeakably difficult stuff. You could be a math professor, and unless your research is to do with Landau damping or the Boltzmann equation you will be no wiser than a high school dropout as to what the author is talking about.It is however a massive, unadulterated stream of consciousness attack, and for that I totally loved it. Small confession here: I do hold a couple math degrees, and I'm totally inured to the fact that math professionals are totally self-centered. One more thing: I'm in total awe of the fact that the guy seems to be the head of a normal, healthy family, puts the kids to bed, the works. That's highly nonstandard for a young mathematician at the leading edge of his field.Oh, and the endorsement by Patti Smith on the cover is by the Patti Smith we all know and love; ""because the night"" gets mentioned around page 160 and the publisher probably thought it would be a bit of a coup if he could get her to say a nice word.It was overall a fun read.

This book is unique, it is neither a pop math nor a research monograph but a journal entry from one of the top minds of mathematics writing about the events surrounding his proof ( with his student ) of “landau damping” and subsequent events leading to his fields medal win. Here one can witness what it means to be a lifelong student of mathematics. The book is playful and contains a window into other artful side of his including playing/listening to music, food (bread, cheese), nod to books he read and liked, importance of chance, coincidences and serendipity in proving a theorem, his homage to mathematicians that inspired him etc. There were heavy doses of mathematics in the book (Norm, functional analysis, intersection of analysis and geometry and physics, Boltzmann equation) which are really not needed to be understood to appreciate the book."

27,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15785230-paulo-glez-ogando,4,"Here Cédric Villani tries to answer what it's like to be a mathematician, what a mathematician's daily life is like, or how a mathematician's work gets done. He is a world-class mathematician, top in his specialty, so who better than him to tell about it.This book covers from March 2008 to November 2010. Back then, Villani was working around the effect known as 'Landau damping', though he mentions other of his works like the one involving the Boltzmann equation. The book ends basically when he was awarded with a Fields Medal, an honor publicly announced in the 2010 IMC celebrated in Hyderabad.In fact, Villani devotes many words to the Fields Medal, both when he finally gets it and also when it was just a personal objective in his mind, but unmentionable in public. Here Villani is clearly honest, recognizing his taste for awards.And this is the main virtue of this book, how Villani brings us the daily life of a world-class mathematician. His longings, his opinions in different topics, his relations with other mathematicians (he makes very clear that John Nash is perhaps his mathematical hero) his problems and bumps in the road, his (many) travels, the difficulty in reconciling family and professional life... all these sounds to me very real and Villani makes you feel very close even if your life has nothing to do with his.I enjoyed very much reading about a world that I find a bit alien, but that attracs me greatly. I lover the way Villani explains how he is working in a theorem, and in the meantime there are other passions to indulge, like adding an appendix to a paper written several years before or making an attempt to combine kinetic equations and Riemannian geometry. It was fascinating to follow the evolution of his article (co-authored with Clement Mouhot) about the Landau damping through the emails sent between Villani and Mouhot.The book includes that emails, and also photos of many mathematicians named in the text, letters and technical explanations about his own theorems and mathematics (a bit too technical to me, I must say).Finally, I bring a quote from the book that I especially liked: «apprecianting a theorem in mathematics is rather like watching an episode of Columbo: the line of reasoning by which the detective solves the mystery is more important than the identity of the murderer»."
28,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7283807-ben,3,"The book gives a great feeling for the process of mathematics, and for the lifestyle of a mathematician. It is hard to give a sense of the actual mathematical research, but everything around that is conveyed well. For example, Villani gives a fantastic sense for developing the main theorem, sketched out in emails with his collaborator, as they write a LaTeX paper (by emailed drafts, without version control) and develop the proofs simultaneously. He conveys the ups and downs, the false breakthroughs, the mistakes as well as the actual breakthroughs. He also gets across the social life and itinerancy of a mathematician, traveling the world between institutes with few solid relationships outside his immediate family. It mixes in some history of mathematics (with brief portraits of famous mathematicians). It does not really attempt to convey any of the mathematics itself, except in a very sketchy, impressionistic way; this was fine for me. The writing is extremely overindulgent. I could do without reading his random dreams, or the stories he reads to his children, or the list of all his favorite songs on Spotify (with an explanation for why he likes each song, and the lyrics for some of them!). There is lots of filler! His language is often overly flowery; for example, he describes a math conference with, ""Revelers swanning about from one event to the next in luxury limos and romantic rickshaws, everywhere celebrating the unity and diversity of mathematics, its ever-shifting shapes and forms; everywhere overcome with joy at what has so far been accomplished and wonder before all that yet remains to be discovered; everywhere, day and night, dreaming of the unknown."" Perhaps this was his honest experience—who am I to say? He had just won the Fields Medal. But it rings false. Additionally, Villani has an incredible ego. He tries to disguise it to some extent, but it still comes through very strongly. He is obsessed, for example, with the Fields Medal, and is convinced that every other mathematician is equally obsessed. (In fact, I think he is in small minority.) I am not sure of his professional ethics—several times he announces a result without having a proof—but he is obviously brilliant."
29,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18370648-mishehu,1,"Book reads as though it was churned out by a 'completely-useless-book' algorithm. Seriously, this may be the worst pop math memoir I've ever read. Among the flaws: *the math goes almost entirely unexplained*the math is, in a fairly short book, extensively quoted. Since even professional mathematicians unfamiliar with the author's area of expertise are, so the translator informs us, unlikely to grasp the math, one can only assume the march of equations throughout this book is intended for aesthetic effect only. Or to underscore the author's genius. *the author's email correspondence (abstruse mathematical) is likewise impenetrable to all but a handful of readers. Yet, it too is liberally quoted.*the author's many asides, about music, his family, etc., and the poems he quotes in full are, like the above, another instance of pure filler*the book has a totally useless endnotes section. (Ironically, it wasn't part of the original French edition; it was added for the supposed benefit of a non-French readership.)As if all this weren't annoying enough, Villani comes off as a raging egomaniac. I don't doubt Villani's immense talent, and the significance of his work (not that Villani himself deigns to explain its importance). But I found it distasteful how many times and ways he found to shout ""look at me! I'm so smart"", and how singularly focused on winning awards (the Fields medal in particular) he made himself appear to be. Perhaps a lot was lost in translation. Maybe Villani, in addition to being a brilliant mathematician, is a humble and sparkling individual. Got me. I only have the evidence of this quick reading loser of a book to go by. If you're a professional mathematician, perhaps you'll get some pleasure (and edification?) from this book. If you're not, I'd recommend you pass. About the only takeaway from the book is this: math is hard. Sometimes mathematicians take 3 steps forward and 2 steps back. Oh, and Villani's the greatest thing since sliced bread.Still interested?

The idea is as follows: Cédric Villani, who was recently given the highest award in mathematics (the Fields Medal), tells the story of a theorem - from the beginning of the investigation to the publication in a prestigious journal. This includes email exchanges (many are reproduced verbatim in the book) with the co-author of the theorem Clément Mouhot, meeting other mathematicians, giving talks about intermediary results, juggling with other professional and familial obligations, etc. We learn a lot about a lot of topics, mostly in terms of how mathematics functions as a community of researchers. Unfortunately we learn very little about the individual mathematical work which each mathematician does on his own, and which still makes up most of their time: this would necessitate more complicated mathematical explanations. Instead we get 3 or 4 pages about Villani's musical preferences. Ugh.It's a pity that so little effort is put into offering accessible explanations of some of the mathematics involved. Explaining the theorem itself is out of the question - the demonstration takes hundreds of extremely dense pages; the average reader would never understand it if they dedicated their life to it. And there are in fact some vague attempts at popularizing certain basic notions of mathematics at certain points in this book. But the author does not look for a middle ground. So we are left almost entirely in the dark as to what this theorem is about, or rather, we're given just enough that we can intuit a probably mistaken, vague impression... which might be worse than nothing.Anyway, this should be an interesting read for people who have an amateur interest in the sociology of sciences and mathematics."

90,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9114047-wanda,3,"There were certainly high-points in Villani’s memoirs regarding his work with Clement Mouhot on Landau damping that contributed to his being awarded the Fields medal in 2010, but I also found there to be quite significant flaws in the structure of this book.Like other reviewers have mentioned, there a serious deficiency in the exposition; there are very few informal explanations for terms, and the significance of the work is not detailed. As someone with a(n albeit amateur) background in mathematics, I even found it hard to even gain a foothold into those brief, dense interludes into the theory developed by Villani and Mouhot. Heck, some of the indices weren’t quantified, sometimes the spaces over which functions were defined weren’t given, and I found it hard to follow the logic of the inequalities derived due to how opaque some of the constant terms became. Also, if you haven’t been rooting a round in LaTeX for a while, you are almost certain to be be stumped by the correspondence between Mouhot and Villani. Given how terse these passages are and how little context is actually supplied (e.g. illustrations, physical examples, analogies), they can be relegated to filler (which is so frustrating, as someone who loves to read about mathematical discoveries and the process by which professional mathematicians arrive at their results!) Finally, some of those “a ha!“ moments really lost their impact as they relied on results whose relevance wasn’t explained thoroughly (e.g. KAM was poorly defined; the definition of a norm wasn’t given, nor why having a norm with 7 features rather than 5 was relevant; etc.)What I *did* appreciate was how sweeping the scope of this memoir, touching on so many domains that fed into the final result and giving brief biographies of those who had contributed to such work. However, sometimes these interludes were jarring; perhaps they would have been better suited to appendices or footnotes unless directly “encountered” in this telling?In all, this is an inspiring book which captures the spirit of academic collaboration, and gives insight into the way in which modern mathematics is being developed."
91,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68389739-david,4,"You gotta love a mathematician who wears a jeweled spider pin.In his own infectiously enthusiastic words, the French mathematician Cedric Villani describes his 20-month effort to prove a landmark theorem in analysis, with collaborator Clement Mouhot. Along the way, we get a glimpse of how this modern genius lives, loves, laughs and thinks. Not only does he give us a virtual tour of many historical and contemporary mathematicians, but we are also there with Villani as he takes catnaps on his office floor, as he tells tall tales to his ""lambkins"", as he risks his reputation announcing results he has yet to prove, as he e-mails Mouhot with the latest rewrite of their paper, as he heaps incredible pressure on himself to deliver time and again, and even as he wins the 2010 Fields medal, math's Nobel prize, given only to those under 40.This is not a book that shies away from mathematical notation, but truth be told, you can ignore all the Greek symbols and TeX, and still come away inspired. Villani goes a long way toward humanizing that rarified breed of world-class mathematicians. Here is a man who loves his family, binge-watches anime, dives into manga and Neil Gaiman and Ray Bradbury, adores music from electronica to opera, quotes poetry, and expounds on the dearth of good cheese in Princeton! An underlying theme of the book is how Villani's wide interests in life mirror the breadth of his intellect, and indeed, how he leverages both to discover deep mathematical connections where none thought they existed. ""I believe in miracles---and I shall uncover more of them,"" he claims with trademark optimism. I for one can't wait to hear what he comes up with next.Four of five Landau dampings, docking unfairly out of frustration that I couldn't follow most of the proof. Grrr."
92,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195330-tomq,2,"(Read in the original French)It's a quick read and it tells us much about the day-to-day life of a mathematician. The idea is as follows: Cédric Villani, who was recently given the highest award in mathematics (the Fields Medal), tells the story of a theorem - from the beginning of the investigation to the publication in a prestigious journal. This includes email exchanges (many are reproduced verbatim in the book) with the co-author of the theorem Clément Mouhot, meeting other mathematicians, giving talks about intermediary results, juggling with other professional and familial obligations, etc. We learn a lot about a lot of topics, mostly in terms of how mathematics functions as a community of researchers. Unfortunately we learn very little about the individual mathematical work which each mathematician does on his own, and which still makes up most of their time: this would necessitate more complicated mathematical explanations. Instead we get 3 or 4 pages about Villani's musical preferences. Ugh.It's a pity that so little effort is put into offering accessible explanations of some of the mathematics involved. Explaining the theorem itself is out of the question - the demonstration takes hundreds of extremely dense pages; the average reader would never understand it if they dedicated their life to it. And there are in fact some vague attempts at popularizing certain basic notions of mathematics at certain points in this book. But the author does not look for a middle ground. So we are left almost entirely in the dark as to what this theorem is about, or rather, we're given just enough that we can intuit a probably mistaken, vague impression... which might be worse than nothing.Anyway, this should be an interesting read for people who have an amateur interest in the sociology of sciences and mathematics."
93,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50173583-andrew-litfin,3,"I went into this book thinking it was going to be something along the lines of ""Love and Math,"" by Edward Frenkel. Boy, was I wrong. This book is not at all a pop math book like I am used to.Most pop math books I've read and enjoyed attempt to make the mathematics presented accessible to a lay audience. This book does no such thing. Admittedly, the work documented in this book did win the author a Fields Medal, one of the highest honors in mathematics, and the titular theorem in its proper form is unreadable except to a professional mathematician.Rather, the book is a journal of Villani's life from the time he begins working on his theorem to the time it is published. He describes his ups and downs, his work, his communications with other professional mathematicians, et cetera.I happened to find the book interesting enough, despite it not at all being what I was expecting, because I am an undergraduate mathematics student. Those who are not probably would find portions of the book unreadable, as the author makes no attempt to make some of the technicalities accessible to a lay audience. In particular, if you are scared easily by mathematical jargon, you might want to avoid this book, as it doesn't really hold your hand.Overall, it was interesting enough, but I wouldn't recommend it as a ""must-read."""
94,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104663342-fernando-pestana-da-costa,4,"This is the Portuguese translation of the french original Théorème Vivant, a personal description of what it means to do mathematical research at the highest level: Cédric Villani guides us in a kind of diary (complemented with reproduction of emails and a few more technical notes the detailed understanding of which are not strictly necessary to appreciate the rest of the book) covering the two years of intense work with his co-worker Clément Mouhot on the mathematical analysis of Landau damping that resulted in the one hundred and seventy two pages long breakthrough paper in Acta Mathematica that earned him a Fields Medal in 2010. One must not read this book with the objective of understanding every single line (not if one is not an expert in kinetic equations, that is), but with the goal of getting the feel of what it is like being totally immersed in a difficult mathematical research problem: the importance of getting the right ideas (sometimes coming from unexpected sources), the need to have an extremely strong technical background (without which no idea can ever be of any use, or even occur), and then the painstaking slow and usually intermittent pace of progress, full of dead ends, sometimes with severe setbacks, before the final goal is achieved. A very captivating book. "

This work was done in collaboration with Prof. Clément Mouhot.The book flows very nicely and portraits in a very detailed way how the author is consumed and obsessed by his problem and how he eventually conquers it. It is a story of confidence in the face of failures and uncertainty, making progress in chaos, and collaboration.Apart from the general commentary, this book includes the detailed email exchange between Prof. Villani and Prof. Mouhot regarding the problem they were solving. Another important thing to note is their 100 page paper was not written at once after they had done all the work. Rather, a draft was continually improved right from the beginning until the paper was submitted; one finds references like second theorem in section 5 and so on right from the beginning of the collaboration.To enjoy this book though, I felt the need to skip the parts where technical details were involved. Once you ignore those parts though, this book is a joy to read."

Maybe professional mathematicians, as he describes the process of developing the tools to prove a big theorem. The ups from finding new methods, the downs, from realizing that your new methods don’t quite work. (And eventually, what it’s like to win the Fields Medal.) Of course, professional mathematicians know what that’s like. (Except for the Fields Medal part.) Or maybe it’s for non-mathematicians, who don’t understand what mathematicians actually do. There’s plenty here to appreciate even if you don’t understand the meaning. Heck, I didn’t understand most of it, and I am a professional mathematician. (It just happens that I don’t specialize in statistical physics.) But is it clear to someone even less comfortable with the mathematical material what is OK to ignore? Maybe. I could be overthinking it…."

Why accept a post of administrative responsibility when it probably means abandoning his research? How important are these international collaborations and how does the system help or hinder them? The relationship to teaching with research, its practical implications (nuclear fusion?) if any, the ultimate goals of mathematical research, the rate of progress in mathematics.So many questions that remain unanswered and unaddressed in such a great read.

Boy, was I wrong. This book is not at all a pop math book like I am used to.Most pop math books I've read and enjoyed attempt to make the mathematics presented accessible to a lay audience. This book does no such thing. Admittedly, the work documented in this book did win the author a Fields Medal, one of the highest honors in mathematics, and the titular theorem in its proper form is unreadable except to a professional mathematician.Rather, the book is a journal of Villani's life from the time he begins working on his theorem to the time it is published. He describes his ups and downs, his work, his communications with other professional mathematicians, et cetera.I happened to find the book interesting enough, despite it not at all being what I was expecting, because I am an undergraduate mathematics student. Those who are not probably would find portions of the book unreadable, as the author makes no attempt to make some of the technicalities accessible to a lay audience. In particular, if you are scared easily by mathematical jargon, you might want to avoid this book, as it doesn't really hold your hand.Overall, it was interesting enough, but I wouldn't recommend it as a ""must-read."""

One must not read this book with the objective of understanding every single line (not if one is not an expert in kinetic equations, that is), but with the goal of getting the feel of what it is like being totally immersed in a difficult mathematical research problem: the importance of getting the right ideas (sometimes coming from unexpected sources), the need to have an extremely strong technical background (without which no idea can ever be of any use, or even occur), and then the painstaking slow and usually intermittent pace of progress, full of dead ends, sometimes with severe setbacks, before the final goal is achieved.

This work was done in collaboration with Prof. Clément Mouhot.The book flows very nicely and portraits in a very detailed way how the author is consumed and obsessed by his problem and how he eventually conquers it. It is a story of confidence in the face of failures and uncertainty, making progress in chaos, and collaboration.Apart from the general commentary, this book includes the detailed email exchange between Prof. Villani and Prof. Mouhot regarding the problem they were solving. Another important thing to note is their 100 page paper was not written at once after they had done all the work. Rather, a draft was continually improved right from the beginning until the paper was submitted; one finds references like second theorem in section 5 and so on right from the beginning of the collaboration.To enjoy this book though, I felt the need to skip the parts where technical details were involved.

Maybe professional mathematicians, as he describes the process of developing the tools to prove a big theorem. The ups from finding new methods, the downs, from realizing that your new methods don’t quite work. (And eventually, what it’s like to win the Fields Medal.) Of course, professional mathematicians know what that’s like. (Except for the Fields Medal part.) Or maybe it’s for non-mathematicians, who don’t understand what mathematicians actually do. There’s plenty here to appreciate even if you don’t understand the meaning. Heck, I didn’t understand most of it, and I am a professional mathematician. (It just happens that I don’t specialize in statistical physics.) But is it clear to someone even less comfortable with the mathematical material what is OK to ignore? Maybe.

As someone with a(n albeit amateur) background in mathematics, I even found it hard to even gain a foothold into those brief, dense interludes into the theory developed by Villani and Mouhot. Heck, some of the indices weren’t quantified, sometimes the spaces over which functions were defined weren’t given, and I found it hard to follow the logic of the inequalities derived due to how opaque some of the constant terms became. Also, if you haven’t been rooting a round in LaTeX for a while, you are almost certain to be be stumped by the correspondence between Mouhot and Villani. Given how terse these passages are and how little context is actually supplied (e.g. illustrations, physical examples, analogies), they can be relegated to filler (which is so frustrating, as someone who loves to read about mathematical discoveries and the process by which professional mathematicians arrive at their results!) Finally, some of those “a ha!“ moments really lost their impact as they relied on results whose relevance wasn’t explained thoroughly (e.g. KAM was poorly defined; the definition of a norm wasn’t given, nor why having a norm with 7 features rather than 5 was relevant; etc.)What I *did* appreciate was how sweeping the scope of this memoir, touching on so many domains that fed into the final result and giving brief biographies of those who had contributed to such work. However, sometimes these interludes were jarring; perhaps they would have been better suited to appendices or footnotes unless directly “encountered” in this telling?In all, this is an inspiring book which captures the spirit of academic collaboration, and gives insight into the way in which modern mathematics is being developed."
151,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68389739-david,4,"You gotta love a mathematician who wears a jeweled spider pin.In his own infectiously enthusiastic words, the French mathematician Cedric Villani describes his 20-month effort to prove a landmark theorem in analysis, with collaborator Clement Mouhot. Along the way, we get a glimpse of how this modern genius lives, loves, laughs and thinks. Not only does he give us a virtual tour of many historical and contemporary mathematicians, but we are also there with Villani as he takes catnaps on his office floor, as he tells tall tales to his ""lambkins"", as he risks his reputation announcing results he has yet to prove, as he e-mails Mouhot with the latest rewrite of their paper, as he heaps incredible pressure on himself to deliver time and again, and even as he wins the 2010 Fields medal, math's Nobel prize, given only to those under 40.This is not a book that shies away from mathematical notation, but truth be told, you can ignore all the Greek symbols and TeX, and still come away inspired. Villani goes a long way toward humanizing that rarified breed of world-class mathematicians. Here is a man who loves his family, binge-watches anime, dives into manga and Neil Gaiman and Ray Bradbury, adores music from electronica to opera, quotes poetry, and expounds on the dearth of good cheese in Princeton! An underlying theme of the book is how Villani's wide interests in life mirror the breadth of his intellect, and indeed, how he leverages both to discover deep mathematical connections where none thought they existed. ""I believe in miracles---and I shall uncover more of them,"" he claims with trademark optimism. I for one can't wait to hear what he comes up with next.Four of five Landau dampings, docking unfairly out of frustration that I couldn't follow most of the proof. Grrr."
152,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195330-tomq,2,"(Read in the original French)It's a quick read and it tells us much about the day-to-day life of a mathematician. The idea is as follows: Cédric Villani, who was recently given the highest award in mathematics (the Fields Medal), tells the story of a theorem - from the beginning of the investigation to the publication in a prestigious journal. This includes email exchanges (many are reproduced verbatim in the book) with the co-author of the theorem Clément Mouhot, meeting other mathematicians, giving talks about intermediary results, juggling with other professional and familial obligations, etc. We learn a lot about a lot of topics, mostly in terms of how mathematics functions as a community of researchers. Unfortunately we learn very little about the individual mathematical work which each mathematician does on his own, and which still makes up most of their time: this would necessitate more complicated mathematical explanations. Instead we get 3 or 4 pages about Villani's musical preferences. Ugh.It's a pity that so little effort is put into offering accessible explanations of some of the mathematics involved. Explaining the theorem itself is out of the question - the demonstration takes hundreds of extremely dense pages; the average reader would never understand it if they dedicated their life to it. And there are in fact some vague attempts at popularizing certain basic notions of mathematics at certain points in this book. But the author does not look for a middle ground. So we are left almost entirely in the dark as to what this theorem is about, or rather, we're given just enough that we can intuit a probably mistaken, vague impression... which might be worse than nothing.Anyway, this should be an interesting read for people who have an amateur interest in the sociology of sciences and mathematics."

As someone with a(n albeit amateur) background in mathematics, I even found it hard to even gain a foothold into those brief, dense interludes into the theory developed by Villani and Mouhot. Heck, some of the indices weren’t quantified, sometimes the spaces over which functions were defined weren’t given, and I found it hard to follow the logic of the inequalities derived due to how opaque some of the constant terms became. Also, if you haven’t been rooting a round in LaTeX for a while, you are almost certain to be be stumped by the correspondence between Mouhot and Villani. Given how terse these passages are and how little context is actually supplied (e.g. illustrations, physical examples, analogies), they can be relegated to filler (which is so frustrating, as someone who loves to read about mathematical discoveries and the process by which professional mathematicians arrive at their results!) Finally, some of those “a ha!“ moments really lost their impact as they relied on results whose relevance wasn’t explained thoroughly (e.g. KAM was poorly defined; the definition of a norm wasn’t given, nor why having a norm with 7 features rather than 5 was relevant; etc.)What I *did* appreciate was how sweeping the scope of this memoir, touching on so many domains that fed into the final result and giving brief biographies of those who had contributed to such work.

Along the way, we get a glimpse of how this modern genius lives, loves, laughs and thinks. Not only does he give us a virtual tour of many historical and contemporary mathematicians, but we are also there with Villani as he takes catnaps on his office floor, as he tells tall tales to his ""lambkins"", as he risks his reputation announcing results he has yet to prove, as he e-mails Mouhot with the latest rewrite of their paper, as he heaps incredible pressure on himself to deliver time and again, and even as he wins the 2010 Fields medal, math's Nobel prize, given only to those under 40.This is not a book that shies away from mathematical notation, but truth be told, you can ignore all the Greek symbols and TeX, and still come away inspired. Villani goes a long way toward humanizing that rarified breed of world-class mathematicians. Here is a man who loves his family, binge-watches anime, dives into manga and Neil Gaiman and Ray Bradbury, adores music from electronica to opera, quotes poetry, and expounds on the dearth of good cheese in Princeton! An underlying theme of the book is how Villani's wide interests in life mirror the breadth of his intellect, and indeed, how he leverages both to discover deep mathematical connections where none thought they existed. ""I believe in miracles---and I shall uncover more of them,"" he claims with trademark optimism. I for one can't wait to hear what he comes up with next.Four of five Landau dampings, docking unfairly out of frustration that I couldn't follow most of the proof. Grrr."
182,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195330-tomq,2,"(Read in the original French)It's a quick read and it tells us much about the day-to-day life of a mathematician. The idea is as follows: Cédric Villani, who was recently given the highest award in mathematics (the Fields Medal), tells the story of a theorem - from the beginning of the investigation to the publication in a prestigious journal. This includes email exchanges (many are reproduced verbatim in the book) with the co-author of the theorem Clément Mouhot, meeting other mathematicians, giving talks about intermediary results, juggling with other professional and familial obligations, etc. We learn a lot about a lot of topics, mostly in terms of how mathematics functions as a community of researchers. Unfortunately we learn very little about the individual mathematical work which each mathematician does on his own, and which still makes up most of their time: this would necessitate more complicated mathematical explanations. Instead we get 3 or 4 pages about Villani's musical preferences. Ugh.It's a pity that so little effort is put into offering accessible explanations of some of the mathematics involved. Explaining the theorem itself is out of the question - the demonstration takes hundreds of extremely dense pages; the average reader would never understand it if they dedicated their life to it. And there are in fact some vague attempts at popularizing certain basic notions of mathematics at certain points in this book. But the author does not look for a middle ground. So we are left almost entirely in the dark as to what this theorem is about, or rather, we're given just enough that we can intuit a probably mistaken, vague impression... which might be worse than nothing.Anyway, this should be an interesting read for people who have an amateur interest in the sociology of sciences and mathematics."

Boy, was I wrong. This book is not at all a pop math book like I am used to.Most pop math books I've read and enjoyed attempt to make the mathematics presented accessible to a lay audience. This book does no such thing. Admittedly, the work documented in this book did win the author a Fields Medal, one of the highest honors in mathematics, and the titular theorem in its proper form is unreadable except to a professional mathematician.Rather, the book is a journal of Villani's life from the time he begins working on his theorem to the time it is published. He describes his ups and downs, his work, his communications with other professional mathematicians, et cetera.I happened to find the book interesting enough, despite it not at all being what I was expecting, because I am an undergraduate mathematics student. Those who are not probably would find portions of the book unreadable, as the author makes no attempt to make some of the technicalities accessible to a lay audience.

One must not read this book with the objective of understanding every single line (not if one is not an expert in kinetic equations, that is), but with the goal of getting the feel of what it is like being totally immersed in a difficult mathematical research problem: the importance of getting the right ideas (sometimes coming from unexpected sources), the need to have an extremely strong technical background (without which no idea can ever be of any use, or even occur), and then the painstaking slow and usually intermittent pace of progress, full of dead ends, sometimes with severe setbacks, before the final goal is achieved.

This work was done in collaboration with Prof. Clément Mouhot.The book flows very nicely and portraits in a very detailed way how the author is consumed and obsessed by his problem and how he eventually conquers it. It is a story of confidence in the face of failures and uncertainty, making progress in chaos, and collaboration.Apart from the general commentary, this book includes the detailed email exchange between Prof. Villani and Prof. Mouhot regarding the problem they were solving. Another important thing to note is their 100 page paper was not written at once after they had done all the work. Rather, a draft was continually improved right from the beginning until the paper was submitted; one finds references like second theorem in section 5 and so on right from the beginning of the collaboration.To enjoy this book though, I felt the need to skip the parts where technical details were involved.

Of course, professional mathematicians know what that’s like. (Except for the Fields Medal part.) Or maybe it’s for non-mathematicians, who don’t understand what mathematicians actually do. There’s plenty here to appreciate even if you don’t understand the meaning. Heck, I didn’t understand most of it, and I am a professional mathematician. (It just happens that I don’t specialize in statistical physics.) But is it clear to someone even less comfortable with the mathematical material what is OK to ignore? Maybe.

The relationship to teaching with research, its practical implications (nuclear fusion?) if any, the ultimate goals of mathematical research, the rate of progress in mathematics.So many questions that remain unanswered and unaddressed in such a great read.

As someone with a(n albeit amateur) background in mathematics, I even found it hard to even gain a foothold into those brief, dense interludes into the theory developed by Villani and Mouhot. Heck, some of the indices weren’t quantified, sometimes the spaces over which functions were defined weren’t given, and I found it hard to follow the logic of the inequalities derived due to how opaque some of the constant terms became. Also, if you haven’t been rooting a round in LaTeX for a while, you are almost certain to be be stumped by the correspondence between Mouhot and Villani. Given how terse these passages are and how little context is actually supplied (e.g. illustrations, physical examples, analogies), they can be relegated to filler (which is so frustrating, as someone who loves to read about mathematical discoveries and the process by which professional mathematicians arrive at their results!) Finally, some of those “a ha!“ moments really lost their impact as they relied on results whose relevance wasn’t explained thoroughly (e.g. KAM was poorly defined; the definition of a norm wasn’t given, nor why having a norm with 7 features rather than 5 was relevant; etc.)What I *did* appreciate was how sweeping the scope of this memoir, touching on so many domains that fed into the final result and giving brief biographies of those who had contributed to such work. However, sometimes these interludes were jarring; perhaps they would have been better suited to appendices or footnotes unless directly “encountered” in this telling?In all, this is an inspiring book which captures the spirit of academic collaboration, and gives insight into the way in which modern mathematics is being developed."

Along the way, we get a glimpse of how this modern genius lives, loves, laughs and thinks. Not only does he give us a virtual tour of many historical and contemporary mathematicians, but we are also there with Villani as he takes catnaps on his office floor, as he tells tall tales to his ""lambkins"", as he risks his reputation announcing results he has yet to prove, as he e-mails Mouhot with the latest rewrite of their paper, as he heaps incredible pressure on himself to deliver time and again, and even as he wins the 2010 Fields medal, math's Nobel prize, given only to those under 40.This is not a book that shies away from mathematical notation, but truth be told, you can ignore all the Greek symbols and TeX, and still come away inspired. Villani goes a long way toward humanizing that rarified breed of world-class mathematicians. Here is a man who loves his family, binge-watches anime, dives into manga and Neil Gaiman and Ray Bradbury, adores music from electronica to opera, quotes poetry, and expounds on the dearth of good cheese in Princeton! An underlying theme of the book is how Villani's wide interests in life mirror the breadth of his intellect, and indeed, how he leverages both to discover deep mathematical connections where none thought they existed. ""I believe in miracles---and I shall uncover more of them,"" he claims with trademark optimism. I for one can't wait to hear what he comes up with next.Four of five Landau dampings, docking unfairly out of frustration that I couldn't follow most of the proof. Grrr."
242,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195330-tomq,2,"(Read in the original French)It's a quick read and it tells us much about the day-to-day life of a mathematician. The idea is as follows: Cédric Villani, who was recently given the highest award in mathematics (the Fields Medal), tells the story of a theorem - from the beginning of the investigation to the publication in a prestigious journal. This includes email exchanges (many are reproduced verbatim in the book) with the co-author of the theorem Clément Mouhot, meeting other mathematicians, giving talks about intermediary results, juggling with other professional and familial obligations, etc. We learn a lot about a lot of topics, mostly in terms of how mathematics functions as a community of researchers. Unfortunately we learn very little about the individual mathematical work which each mathematician does on his own, and which still makes up most of their time: this would necessitate more complicated mathematical explanations. Instead we get 3 or 4 pages about Villani's musical preferences. Ugh.It's a pity that so little effort is put into offering accessible explanations of some of the mathematics involved. Explaining the theorem itself is out of the question - the demonstration takes hundreds of extremely dense pages; the average reader would never understand it if they dedicated their life to it. And there are in fact some vague attempts at popularizing certain basic notions of mathematics at certain points in this book. But the author does not look for a middle ground. So we are left almost entirely in the dark as to what this theorem is about, or rather, we're given just enough that we can intuit a probably mistaken, vague impression... which might be worse than nothing.Anyway, this should be an interesting read for people who have an amateur interest in the sociology of sciences and mathematics."
243,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50173583-andrew-litfin,3,"I went into this book thinking it was going to be something along the lines of ""Love and Math,"" by Edward Frenkel. Boy, was I wrong. This book is not at all a pop math book like I am used to.Most pop math books I've read and enjoyed attempt to make the mathematics presented accessible to a lay audience. This book does no such thing. Admittedly, the work documented in this book did win the author a Fields Medal, one of the highest honors in mathematics, and the titular theorem in its proper form is unreadable except to a professional mathematician.Rather, the book is a journal of Villani's life from the time he begins working on his theorem to the time it is published. He describes his ups and downs, his work, his communications with other professional mathematicians, et cetera.I happened to find the book interesting enough, despite it not at all being what I was expecting, because I am an undergraduate mathematics student. Those who are not probably would find portions of the book unreadable, as the author makes no attempt to make some of the technicalities accessible to a lay audience. In particular, if you are scared easily by mathematical jargon, you might want to avoid this book, as it doesn't really hold your hand.Overall, it was interesting enough, but I wouldn't recommend it as a ""must-read."""
244,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104663342-fernando-pestana-da-costa,4,"This is the Portuguese translation of the french original Théorème Vivant, a personal description of what it means to do mathematical research at the highest level: Cédric Villani guides us in a kind of diary (complemented with reproduction of emails and a few more technical notes the detailed understanding of which are not strictly necessary to appreciate the rest of the book) covering the two years of intense work with his co-worker Clément Mouhot on the mathematical analysis of Landau damping that resulted in the one hundred and seventy two pages long breakthrough paper in Acta Mathematica that earned him a Fields Medal in 2010. One must not read this book with the objective of understanding every single line (not if one is not an expert in kinetic equations, that is), but with the goal of getting the feel of what it is like being totally immersed in a difficult mathematical research problem: the importance of getting the right ideas (sometimes coming from unexpected sources), the need to have an extremely strong technical background (without which no idea can ever be of any use, or even occur), and then the painstaking slow and usually intermittent pace of progress, full of dead ends, sometimes with severe setbacks, before the final goal is achieved. A very captivating book. "

This work was done in collaboration with Prof. Clément Mouhot.The book flows very nicely and portraits in a very detailed way how the author is consumed and obsessed by his problem and how he eventually conquers it. It is a story of confidence in the face of failures and uncertainty, making progress in chaos, and collaboration.Apart from the general commentary, this book includes the detailed email exchange between Prof. Villani and Prof. Mouhot regarding the problem they were solving. Another important thing to note is their 100 page paper was not written at once after they had done all the work. Rather, a draft was continually improved right from the beginning until the paper was submitted; one finds references like second theorem in section 5 and so on right from the beginning of the collaboration.To enjoy this book though, I felt the need to skip the parts where technical details were involved. Once you ignore those parts though, this book is a joy to read."

Maybe professional mathematicians, as he describes the process of developing the tools to prove a big theorem. The ups from finding new methods, the downs, from realizing that your new methods don’t quite work. (And eventually, what it’s like to win the Fields Medal.) Of course, professional mathematicians know what that’s like. (Except for the Fields Medal part.) Or maybe it’s for non-mathematicians, who don’t understand what mathematicians actually do. There’s plenty here to appreciate even if you don’t understand the meaning. Heck, I didn’t understand most of it, and I am a professional mathematician. (It just happens that I don’t specialize in statistical physics.) But is it clear to someone even less comfortable with the mathematical material what is OK to ignore? Maybe.

272,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195330-tomq,2,"(Read in the original French)It's a quick read and it tells us much about the day-to-day life of a mathematician. The idea is as follows: Cédric Villani, who was recently given the highest award in mathematics (the Fields Medal), tells the story of a theorem - from the beginning of the investigation to the publication in a prestigious journal. This includes email exchanges (many are reproduced verbatim in the book) with the co-author of the theorem Clément Mouhot, meeting other mathematicians, giving talks about intermediary results, juggling with other professional and familial obligations, etc. We learn a lot about a lot of topics, mostly in terms of how mathematics functions as a community of researchers. Unfortunately we learn very little about the individual mathematical work which each mathematician does on his own, and which still makes up most of their time: this would necessitate more complicated mathematical explanations. Instead we get 3 or 4 pages about Villani's musical preferences. Ugh.It's a pity that so little effort is put into offering accessible explanations of some of the mathematics involved. Explaining the theorem itself is out of the question - the demonstration takes hundreds of extremely dense pages; the average reader would never understand it if they dedicated their life to it. And there are in fact some vague attempts at popularizing certain basic notions of mathematics at certain points in this book. But the author does not look for a middle ground. So we are left almost entirely in the dark as to what this theorem is about, or rather, we're given just enough that we can intuit a probably mistaken, vague impression... which might be worse than nothing.Anyway, this should be an interesting read for people who have an amateur interest in the sociology of sciences and mathematics."
273,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50173583-andrew-litfin,3,"I went into this book thinking it was going to be something along the lines of ""Love and Math,"" by Edward Frenkel. Boy, was I wrong. This book is not at all a pop math book like I am used to.Most pop math books I've read and enjoyed attempt to make the mathematics presented accessible to a lay audience. This book does no such thing. Admittedly, the work documented in this book did win the author a Fields Medal, one of the highest honors in mathematics, and the titular theorem in its proper form is unreadable except to a professional mathematician.Rather, the book is a journal of Villani's life from the time he begins working on his theorem to the time it is published. He describes his ups and downs, his work, his communications with other professional mathematicians, et cetera.I happened to find the book interesting enough, despite it not at all being what I was expecting, because I am an undergraduate mathematics student. Those who are not probably would find portions of the book unreadable, as the author makes no attempt to make some of the technicalities accessible to a lay audience. In particular, if you are scared easily by mathematical jargon, you might want to avoid this book, as it doesn't really hold your hand.Overall, it was interesting enough, but I wouldn't recommend it as a ""must-read."""
274,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104663342-fernando-pestana-da-costa,4,"This is the Portuguese translation of the french original Théorème Vivant, a personal description of what it means to do mathematical research at the highest level: Cédric Villani guides us in a kind of diary (complemented with reproduction of emails and a few more technical notes the detailed understanding of which are not strictly necessary to appreciate the rest of the book) covering the two years of intense work with his co-worker Clément Mouhot on the mathematical analysis of Landau damping that resulted in the one hundred and seventy two pages long breakthrough paper in Acta Mathematica that earned him a Fields Medal in 2010. One must not read this book with the objective of understanding every single line (not if one is not an expert in kinetic equations, that is), but with the goal of getting the feel of what it is like being totally immersed in a difficult mathematical research problem: the importance of getting the right ideas (sometimes coming from unexpected sources), the need to have an extremely strong technical background (without which no idea can ever be of any use, or even occur), and then the painstaking slow and usually intermittent pace of progress, full of dead ends, sometimes with severe setbacks, before the final goal is achieved. A very captivating book. "
275,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52049606-saurabh-jha,5,"I read the hard cover English translation of this book.This book is a very vivid story of the discovery of a theorem for which Prof. Cédric Villani won the fields medal in 2010. This work was done in collaboration with Prof. Clément Mouhot.The book flows very nicely and portraits in a very detailed way how the author is consumed and obsessed by his problem and how he eventually conquers it. It is a story of confidence in the face of failures and uncertainty, making progress in chaos, and collaboration.Apart from the general commentary, this book includes the detailed email exchange between Prof. Villani and Prof. Mouhot regarding the problem they were solving. Another important thing to note is their 100 page paper was not written at once after they had done all the work. Rather, a draft was continually improved right from the beginning until the paper was submitted; one finds references like second theorem in section 5 and so on right from the beginning of the collaboration.To enjoy this book though, I felt the need to skip the parts where technical details were involved. Once you ignore those parts though, this book is a joy to read."
276,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1849937-yofish,3,"Really more like 3.5 stars.I’m not sure who the audience for this book is. Maybe professional mathematicians, as he describes the process of developing the tools to prove a big theorem. The ups from finding new methods, the downs, from realizing that your new methods don’t quite work. (And eventually, what it’s like to win the Fields Medal.) Of course, professional mathematicians know what that’s like. (Except for the Fields Medal part.) Or maybe it’s for non-mathematicians, who don’t understand what mathematicians actually do. There’s plenty here to appreciate even if you don’t understand the meaning. Heck, I didn’t understand most of it, and I am a professional mathematician. (It just happens that I don’t specialize in statistical physics.) But is it clear to someone even less comfortable with the mathematical material what is OK to ignore? Maybe. I could be overthinking it…."
277,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55631754-chris,4,"A great description of the world of a modern mathematician. Cedric Villani shares with us his daily esoteric life without overburdening us with irrelevant details. The mathematical equations can be glanced at easily an offer just enough insight into the language of modern mathematics.One could regret the absence of reflection on his own journey. Why accept a post of administrative responsibility when it probably means abandoning his research? How important are these international collaborations and how does the system help or hinder them? The relationship to teaching with research, its practical implications (nuclear fusion?) if any, the ultimate goals of mathematical research, the rate of progress in mathematics.So many questions that remain unanswered and unaddressed in such a great read.

278,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5625189-alejandro-teruel,2,"A tongue in cheek genre pastiche of mathematics, memoir, email, lists of favourite things, travel diary, poems, microbiographies of mathematicians, impressions and so on.Cédric Villani puts together -writes is far too passive a word- this exhuberent collage about the time he spent working on a mathematical conjecture that provided the basis for his winning the Fields medal.If you are a mathematician with some literary appreciation you will probably love this book. For me the math is waaay over my head and as a result I skipped over at least half of the book and appreciated only how much hard work this flamboyant mathematician and his team mate Clément Mouhot put into proving some important mathematical results."
279,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68372088,3,"This is a fascinating book, written by a fascinating man. I can imagine this book being overwhelming and maybe boring to someone not interested in Mathematics. I had no trouble skimming over the Mathematics, knowing full well that it'ss presentation was merely expository and not meant to be fully understood. I can see people trying to read those sections, and feeling slightly defeated.If you are even remotely interested in Mathematics, or any intellectual pursuit for that matter, you ought to read this book. If not, it will seem confusing and a little long winded. I finished this book with a better appreciation of Monsieur Villani's work, as well as for Pure Mathematics."
280,0374710236,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29371211-daniel,2,"Parts of the book were interesting but on the whole the book lacked direction and flitted between a chronology of creating a theorem, to snippets of biography about famous mathematicians, and then pages upon pages of formulas.Villani has said, many times, his intentions for this book were to describe the process to a non mathematician, to share his world with them. Yet he includes many pages of intimidating formulas which lack context.Even in the epilogue there is reference to the math as ""inessential to Cedric's story""."

On the other hand, it is fascinating and I couldn't stop reading it. It makes me feel like I really felt what it's really to work as a mathematician.You are not going to follow everything in the book, but if you can live with that, you'll get the essence of what is the meaning of being a mathematician."

Detailed description of Villani’s life in their period before and after the awarding of the greatest Mathematical prize, the Fields medal. Nice switch within the text to some of the math (which the reader is not expected to understand) as well as links to great mathematicians related to the topic he is investigating as well as his co-workers. Excellent biography. "

The book was very good at blending what Villani was doing, and the stories that mathematicians tell each other about each other. The sketches of people were very good. The email correspondence was not good and should have been part of ""what Villani was doing"". It was a fast read for me and I enjoyed it."

Cédric does a great job conveying the personal adventure, passion, elusiveness, metaphors and personalities in every mathematician, the mathematical community and the act of doing maths. I'll probably reread this book when I'm in the need for motivation to do more mathematics and find what's next."
