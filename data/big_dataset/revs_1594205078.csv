0,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,5,"Robert Sapolsky is a neuroendocrinologist and has studied primates for decades in Africa, and I love him. If anyone wants to watch it he did a TED talk on what makes human's unique from other animals: https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_sapo.... The book itself covers a wide range of topics, mostly centered around neurology and it's subsequent effect on behavior. The book is a little long and dense and I have finals so I shouldn't even be reading it, but I've been making time to get it done anyways. The book goes through the biology of behavior and describes what happens when we do something and how the body's various hormones and major neurotransmitters work to shape it. The book then goes into the genetic and evolutionary basis of our behavior and the ways we're predisposed to think about others specifically in groups and out groups. This topic is then expanded to talk about culture and hierarchies and our unique behavior as humans of killing over ideas. The book end with a discussion of neurology's place in law and how much culpability people actually have for their actions. There's an appendix at the end of the book for those not as familiar with neuroscience or hormones and proteins of the body. This was a really ambitious undertaking, and the book covers such a vast amount of information. I learned a lot but even with my own familiarity with a lot of the subjects it took me a while to get through this one so I'm not sure how enjoyable this will be for a more general audience. I had so many different thoughts while reading this because it brought up a lot of more pertinent issues but now I can't think of any of them for some reason. I think I'm just a little overtaken with how much I learned from the book. Sapolsky even talked about a lot of popular nonfiction books I havent gotten around to reading plus the criticisms of them and what the evidence against and for them are. It's just a lot to wrap my head around and I mean his whole point is that behavior is extremely complex and context dependent and that we don't yet understand enough to be able to predict it accurately. There are certain ways of thinking that we are predisposed towards but nothing is a hundred percent certain yet. I love neurology and the brain and so this is my type of books so of course I enjoyed it immensely,I'm not sure how much anyone else would like it. He did a very thorough job going through the current literature and covering much of what is being talked about in the present which a lot of nonfiction books tend not to do. I learned a lot and I really think I need to read more of Sapolsky's books."

It's like 10,000 pages long. But it's next to impossible not to adore.It's basically a textbook for his ridiculously, cosmically good Stanford undergraduate course on the biology of behavior (HUMBIO 160 -Stanford)You're not fully sentient until you have watched all 20+ hours of his lectures from the course (at least once) which are freely available on YouTube. Or listened to them in condensed form in his absolutely spellbinding audio programs available by Great Courses. The message is more glorious than any gospel or sage vision. Its biology man. It's a real live magical miracle. We are meat bags of salt water, lipids, proteins and chemicals, that emerged from endoplasmic sewage, and are now capable of having an experience. Dude!That alone is frickin amazing beyond words, but that's only the beginning. Sapolsky is a puckish rascal genius. Sapolsky is an intellectual nonpareil.This is a horrible AF review of the important work of a fuckin' intellectual demigod.FIVE STARS!!!!"
2,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11361859-matt,2,"This book is a masterful distillation of academic research on social behavior. It's creatively organized, clearly written, and always fascinating. I listened on audiobook, but will probably buy a physical copy for reference.But I'm only giving it three stars because it completely fails to grapple with the replication crisis sweeping through these fields. After Sapolsky mentioned a study that I know researchers have failed to replicate, I waited for him to discuss the subsequent controversy. He never did. At that point, I started keeping a tally of ""red flags:"" studies that have subsequently come under fire, but where Sapolsky fails to acknowledge any controversy about their findings.The ones I noticed:- People behave themselves when there is an eye watching them, even if it's just a painted eye. Researchers are having trouble replicating this finding: http://lebs.hbesj.org/index.php/lebs/...- Implicit bias tests. Sapolsky uses this literature extensively without criticism. It's not clear it's as useful as people think: http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2017/01/...- Willpower is like a muscle that gets tired from use. Something as simple as having a snack can help. Another one that it's not so clear this is true: http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/12/...- People take hurricanes more seriously when they are named after men. Another study that has come in for a pile of criticism: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/...- Legalization of abortion led to a drop in crime two decades later. No. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legaliz... and also Steven Pinker's critique in Better Angels of Our Nature.- Air rage is more likely if coach passengers have to pass through first class. Probably not. http://www.pnas.org/content/113/47/E7... and http://andrewgelman.com/?s=air+rage- Judges are way harsher right before lunch. Non. http://nautil.us/blog/impossibly-hung...- Priming studies (cited extensively). Not so easy to replicate. http://andrewgelman.com/2016/02/12/pr...These issues have percolated through the mainstream. Just last week, the NYTimes had a great feature about the replication crisis, told through the story of Amy Cuddy (whose work is also cited uncritically in Behave): https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/ma...I'm not an expert on this stuff, but I still found all these red flags. There are surely many I've missed. At the same time, because I'm not an expert, I can be convinced that the replication crisis isn't that big a deal. But Sapolsky doesn't even try. Unfortunately, that makes me call into question Sapolsky's authority and credibility as a guide to this literature. It's a doubt that poisoned the whole book for me, including his tour of literatures far removed from the ones above. For example, I don't know much about neuro-imaging studies. About them Sapolsky says ""These studies are difficult to pull off, as neuroimaging is as much an art as a science."" When I read that, and when I've spent half the book hearing him talk confidently about lots of problematic studies, part of me wonders ""hmmm, so are neuro-imaging studies garbage? Should I just skim this chapter?"" I don't know!Or at other points, he talks about studies I am unfamiliar with but because he's sacrificed his credibility on studies I do know a bit about, I don't trust his interpretations. I think to myself, ""hmmm, that sounds suspect."" I seriously considered quitting the book because of these issues. I'm glad I stuck with it, because IF THIS STUFF TURNS OUT TO HOLD UP, then it's a wonderfully nuanced portrait of the factors that drive our behavior (neurological, genetic, social). But what a disappointing caveat to have to attach to a book."
3,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,5,"This is an outstanding and monumental synthesis on the causes of behavior by a talented researcher and teacher. He excels in making the science of the brain and behavior accessible to a wide audience without oversimplification. The goal is to provide a handle on how to account for the origins of the most admirable and most despicable of human actions, i.e. the roots of empathy and altruism on the one hand and violence, war, and genocide on the other. Sapolsky’s accomplishment yields an expansion of what we mean by the biological basis of behavior, enough knowledge of brain systems to make you dangerous, and a better appreciation of the interplay between cognitive and emotional contributions to our actions. You will come away with a better appreciation of human evolution, an informed perspective on whether our hunter-gatherer ancestors were more aligned with a Hobbesian dog-eat-dog character or of an Edenic Rousseau types. In the end, he mounts an assault on the need for a concept of free will, arguing that it is equivalent to putting a homunculus in the driver’s seat above the material universe. His mantra is for a multifactorial and hierarchical array of causes behind behavior. In the end it will be easy to conclude that the extreme complexity of the brain limits the gains in explanatory power from any simplistic reductionist plan. I this vein, I liked the quote from Hilary Bok:The claim that a person chose her action does not conflict with the claim that some neural processes or state caused it; it simply redescribes it.Sapolsky’s organizing principle of serving up mountains of research progress according to different timescales that precede particular behaviors is a very helpful approach. Looking at events a second before a behavior taps into automated and unconscious processes in the brain; seconds before brings in higher neural systems associated with conscious actions; hours to days before is the realm of hormonal influences; days to months before the impact of things like chronic stress and adaptations of neuroplasticity; years and decades before includes the shaping of culture and individual development; and centuries to millennia before the processes of evolution. You’ll be busting at the seams by the time you get through this program. He is so skilled at introducing humor and commonsense translations to the concepts presented you will be amazed in your ability to follow his presentation and never fall asleep. If some of the presentation doesn’t quite sink in, he excels in summary take-home messages at the end of each chapter and provision of frequent links among the chapters. A big plus for me was his overall humility and restraint in claiming more than is reasonably warranted from the data. He is scathing for the excessive claims such as of genetic causes of bad behavior (e.g. calling a variant of a monoamine oxidase gene that provides limited predictability for violent behavior a “warrior gene”), use of premenstrual syndrome as a claim of diminished responsibility in a court defense, and the puffing up of the evidence about “mirror neurons”, which are active both when a primate acts and observes the same act in another, as the foundation of empathy and altruism. The stupendous advances from being able to assess activity of significant brain structures in humans through functional magnetic resonance imaging are also subject to overinterpretation, which I think he mostly avoids. I liked his outrage that the problem of PTSD depended on brain scans showing shrinkage of the hippocampus to get Congress to recognize the problem as worthy of expanding treatment resources. For me, I was more impressed by the power of images of changed receptors in the meth addict’s brain to justify more funding of substance abuse treatment as a “brain” disease. The principle is the same: these people need help in the social and psychological realm, and using images as a reification of their state doesn’t really change the situation. That said, I was disappointed with his simplistic summary that schizophrenia is a “biochemical disorder” and dyslexia a result of “microscopic cortical malformations”. The interdisciplinary nature of the topics here raises the issue of reliability of the presenter in interpreting the research. I appreciate how the author has a solid track record both in field studies of dominance and aggression in baboons and in laboratory studies on hormonal and brain system roles in social behaviors. Having been a researcher in the area of brain mechanisms of aggression and motivational systems for several years, I can testify to the veracity and wisdom of his analyses of brain studies. As my former scientific career ended up mostly in the area of brain development and plasticity, I can say he was inaccurate on the status of research on a couple of subjects (e.g. the claim of long distance sprouting of new connections to account for repurposing of the visual cortex in blind people; the conclusion that the extensive neuron cell death during development serves primarily an error-correction function).Can the average reader handle and dig all the brain talk in this book? I think the author does a great job keeping the jargon down in the narrative and slipping a lot of the details into copious footnotes, providing a primer on basic neuroscience in an appendix, and justifying significant points with a huge collection of references stored in the back. A couple of areas of the prefrontal cortex, the amygdala, and the dopamine reinforcement system get the starring role in most of the studies discussed. As an example, here is a bit on the dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortex: The dlPFC is the decider of deciders, the most rational, cognitive, utilitarian, unsentimental part of the PFC. …In contrast to the dlPFC, there’s the ventral part of the PFC, particularly the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC). …This is ..an honorary member of the limbic system because of its interconnections with it. Logically, the vmPFC is all about the impact of emotion on decision making. And many of our best and worst behaviors involve interactions of the vmPFC with the limbic system and the dlPFC.…Consider a classic moral quandary—is it okay to kill one innocent person to save five? When people ponder the question, greater dlPFC activation predicts a greater likelihood of answering yes.…In this bit on dopamine, I give you a taste of his humor:Though the dopamine system is similar across numerous species, humans do something utterly novel: we delay gratification for insanely long times. No warthog restricts calories to look good in a bathing suit next summer. No gerbil works hard at school to get good SAT scores to get into a good college to get into a good grad school to get a good job to get into a good nursing home.Here is a sample on the amygdala, long linked to a major role in fear and anxiety:Amygdalae are prepared to learn to associate something bad with Them.So if whites see a black face shown at a subliminal speed, the amygdala activates. But if the face is shown long enough for conscious processing, and anterior cingulate cortex and the “cognitive” dlPFC then activate and inhibit the amygdala. …This is so depressing—are we hardwired to fear the face of someone from another race, to process their face less as a face, to feel less empathy? No. For starters there’s tremendous individual variation …Moreover, subtle manipulations rapidly change the amygdaloid response to the face of an Other.Here is a good example of his humility in the face of the brains complexity:A “neurobiological” or “genetic” or “developmental” explanation for a behavior is just shorthand, an expository convenience for temporarily approaching the whole multifactorial arc from a particular perspective.Pretty impressive, huh? Actually, maybe not. Maybe I’m just pretentiously saying, “You have to think complexly about complex things.” Wow, what a revelation. And maybe what I’ve been tacitly setting up is this full-of-ourselves straw man of “Oooh, we’re going to think subtly. We won’t get suckered into simplistic answers, not like those chickencrossing-the-road neurochemists and chicken evolutionary biologists and chicken psychoanalysts., all living in their own limited categorical buckets.”Sapolsky shines in his overview on the roles of testosterone on aggression, of oxytocin on empathy and prosocial behavior, and of stress on both realms of behavior. I liked his conclusion that no drug or hormone or gene can be said to cause a behavior. And all we know of a person’s state of brain health, genetic background, and experience does not provide a reliable predictor of bad or good behavior. At a critical point Sapolsky illustrates the importance of a multifactorial outlook by considering whether a particular woman will suffer from depression. Having a certain variant of the serotonin transporter gene has at most a 10% predictive power. But adding development in poverty, experience of child abuse, levels of glucocorticoids in the bloodstream, living in a collectivist culture, and menstrual status might bring you up get you up to a 50% level of prediction. This illustrates both progress in understanding the causes of behavior and the limitations of such knowledge. The author hits a popular vein in his chapter on adolescence. The late maturation of the prefrontal cortex and its function to in reigning in excessive emotionality or impulsive behaviors is held to represent a biological foundation for the folly of youth. I’m not sure what benefits we get in how to treat teenagers wisely with this knowledge over the standard psychological consideration of them as being immature. We are not far from McLean’s model of the Triune Brain, with the neocortex in primates an evolutionary wonder that is seen as riding herd on the unruly mammalian limbic system and lizard-brain of the brainstem like Freud’s Superego over the Id. And emphasizing to parents and teachers the risks of teens’ late development of executive brain functions practically puts them in the category of the brain-damaged. Still, it was fun to experience how eloquent Sapolsky gets on the subject: If by adolescence limbic, autonomic, and endocrine systems are going full blast, while the frontal cortex is still working out the assembly instructions, we’ve just explained why adolescents are so frustrating, great, asinine, impulsive, inspiring, destructive, self-destructive, selfless, selfish, impossible, and world-changing.Where it comes to egregious acts of violence or crime, neuroscience provides little new ground for or against excusing someone’s responsibility for their acts on the basis of biological causes not in the person’s control. Still, an essential role of the criminal justice system is to “protect the endangered from the dangerous”. And despite any solid way to predict dangerousness, juries need to consider diminished capacities for judgment among the accused. Knowledge about the delayed maturation of frontal cortical systems in adolescents helps to justify being more lenient on them in the justice system. The philosopher Stephen Pinker and neuroscientist Michael Gazzanaga both lean with Sapolsky toward the concept that free will is an illusion, but they still argue we must hold people responsible to varying degrees for violent criminal acts. The argument that a man can’t help being a pedophile but is responsible for acts of child abuse is compelling. But Sapolsky holds his ground that the latter acts are biologically determined no less than the ingrained proclivity to fixate on children and to think otherwise reflects an unscientific dualism of an ethereal homunculus pulling the strings. He doesn’t have a practical answer for reforming the criminal justice system, though he did launch an ongoing discussion between a group of jurists and social scientists and a set of neuroscientists starting with a workshop. One can expect further encroachment of neuroscience into the courtroom, which Sapolsky hopes will proceed with great caution:Perhaps we’ll have to settle for making sure our homuncular myths are benign and save the heavy lifting of truly thinking rationally for what matters—when we judge others harshly.Hopefully, the new science of unconscious biases among juries and judges can also be applied to help mitigate some of the excess manipulations of the prosecutors and defense lawyers. For example, research showing that sentences rendered by judges tend to be more severe when they are hungry (i.e. right before lunch). And all members of society (and jury members) must somehow be on guard for subterranean perceptions like the following:From an early age, in both sexes and across cultures, attractive people are judged to be smarter, kinder, and more honest. We’re more likely to vote for attractive people or hire them, less likely to convict them of crimes, more likely to dole out shorter sentences. Remarkably, the medial orbitofrontal cortex assesses both the beauty of a face and the goodness of a behavior, and its level on one of those tasks predicts the level during the other. The brain does similar things when contemplating beautiful minds, hearts, and cheekbones. And assumes that cheekbones tell something about minds and hearts.This is a long book, but I wished the author would have spent more time on the nature of war from a biological perspective. I don’t believe he ever broached the subject of territorial aggression, which represents one of the major classes of intraspecies violence found among many species and some primates and the form that most closely resembles human group conflicts that involve killing people over turf. Maybe the outrageous claims of a territorial instinct behind human war by the likes of Desmond Morris and Robert Ardrey nearly 40 years ago still make this a disreputable topic for current scientists to pursue. The discovery that groups of chimps sometimes coordinate together on patrols and raids into another chimp community and kill members they encounter was a shock to many who imbibed Jane Goodall’s portrait of their communities, and obvious analogies to human war were made in the media. Usually territorial conflicts in animals are resolved through symbolic displays that provoke a withdrawal by the intruders of another groups’ territory. The professor I worked with on a brain region that appeared to organize the freeze-flight-fight system in rats in the early 70’s, David Adams, went on to lead efforts that emphasized that the technology and weapons humans use in group conflicts in the historical period makes war a different kettle of fish from animal territorial aggression because the distances over which the weapons operate preclude use of the usual behavioral signals that moderate lethal outcomes. As part of his work for UNESCO he helped facilitate the drafting of the Seville Statement on Violence in 1986, a proclamation signed by 20 prominent scientists that aimed “to dispel the widespread belief that human beings are inevitably disposed to war as a result of innate, biologically determined aggressive traits” (see http://www.culture-of-peace.info/). A lot of the debate about biological foundations of lethal violence in humans centers around studies of contemporary hunter-gatherer societies and anthropological evidence from ancient human remains. Popular books by people like Jared Diamond and Stephen Pinker interpret such data to indicate that prehistoric humans were always perpetrators of war. Sapolsky spends significant time on the criticisms from various sources on the veracity of the data from hunter-gatherer societies and argues that the advent of agriculture and fixed settlements made warfare more deadly because conflict resolution by moving to a new territory became a less feasible option. The thesis in Pinker’s recent book, “Better Angels of Our Nature”, that the death rate from war has declined substantially over the historical period does not really figure into considerations of the prehistoric hunter-gatherer origins of our species. Nevertheless, Sapolsky criticizes his use of data on death estimates from some historical genocidal events without taking into account their long duration (e.g. centuries for the black slave trade and colonial annihilation of Native Americans). After taking duration as well as population density into account, wars and genocides of the 20th century account for half of the top 10 events of megadeath from violence in known history (surprisingly the Rwandan genocide makes the list under this framework due to its 700K deaths over only 100 days).Much food for thought can be found in this important book. If you want to learn a bit more about Sapolsky the man and his fascinating field work on baboons, I highly recommend his A Primate’s Memoir: A Neuroscientist's Unconventional Life Among the Baboons . This book was provided by the publisher for review through the Netgalley program."
4,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33771-tony,4,"I finished this yesterday, but I had to stop first and catch my breath before writing a review. This was a whirlwind, a high-speed ride, exercising my amygdala mightily. No book I’ve read, at least this year, has challenged me the way this one has. And not just the science, which I will largely forget in its details soon enough. More so, the intellectual challenge was in questioning almost everything I believe. Why do we behave the way we do? You’ll get no biology primer from me. Let’s plunge right in:In the fall of 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait, and in the run-up to the Gulf War, Americans were sickened by a story that emerged. On October 10, 1990, a fifteen-year-old refugee from Kuwait appeared before a congressional Human Rights Caucus.The girl—she would only give her first name, Nayirah—had volunteered in a hospital in Kuwait City. She tearfully testified that Iraqi soldiers had stolen incubators to ship home as plunder, leaving over three-hundred premature infants to die.Our collective breath was taken away. . . . The testimony was seen on the news by approximately 45 million Americans, was cited by seven senators when justifying their support of war (a resolution that passed by five votes), and was cited more than ten times by George H. W. Bush in arguing for U.S. military involvement. And we went to war with a 92 percent approval rating of the president’s decision. In the words of Representative John Porter (R-Illinois), who chaired the committee . . . , “we have never heard, in all this time, in all circumstances, a record of inhumanity, and brutality, and sadism, as the ones that [Nayirah had] given us today.”Much later it emerged that the incubator story was a pseudospeciating lie. The refugee was no refugee. She was Nayirah al-Sabah, the fifteen-year-old daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to the United States. The incubator story was fabricated by the public relations firm Hill + Knowlton, hired by the Kuwaiti government with the help of Porter and cochair Representative Tom Lantos (D-California). Research by the firm indicated that people would be particularly responsive to stories about atrocities against babies (ya think?), so the incubator story was concocted, the witness coached. The story was disavowed by human rights groups . . . and the media, and the testimony was withdrawn from the Congressional Record—long after the war.Be careful when our enemies are made to remind us of maggots and cancer and shit. But also beware when it is our empathic intuitions, rather than hateful ones, that are manipulated by those who use us for their own goals.----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----In the 1990s crime rates plummeted nationwide. Liberals cited the thriving economy. Conservatives credited policing, expanded prisons, and three-strike sentencing laws. Neither, says, our author. Demographics showed that crime rates dropped in areas where abortions became legally, readily available. This was highly controversial, but it makes perfect, depressing sense to me, our author writes. What majorly predicts a life of crime? Being born to a mother who, if she could, would have chosen that you not be.----- ----- ----- ----- -----Drone pilots, who sit somewhere far-removed from battle, but can blow up a group of men sitting around a campfire just by pushing a button, and watch the whole thing (you know, body parts) on their computer screen, have the same rate of Post-Traumatic Stress as soldiers in the field.----- ----- ----- ----- -----. . . in a study of more than 1,100 judicial rulings, prisoners were granted parole at about a 60 percent rate when judges had recently eaten, and at essentially a 0 percent rate just before judges ate. . . . Justice may be blind, but she’s sure sensitive to her stomach gurgling.----- ----- ----- ----- -----Okay, enough examples from the book; I’ll spare you the pages and pages of notes. I read this book because Sapolsky’s book  A Primate’s Memoir is an all-time favorite. And this is his life work, here. He didn’t lose me with the long biology lesson at the beginning of the book. Indeed, he sorta said just read through this, enough will stick to understand what follows. But then he resorted to, essentially, sociological surveys to support his positions. Academic things. I’ve been on the answering end of such surveys and understand just how pre-ordained and un-scientific they can be. And, as smart as he is (very, and much smarter than me) he doesn’t get that sometimes when he was talking about bias, he kind of exposed his own biases. He repeatedly confessed to being a Liberal, then stated as scientific fact that Liberals are more intelligent than Conservatives. Which brings up another point. Before plunging into a discussion of Politics, he notes that there are lot of hands raised in that terrain between Liberal and Conservative. My rough guess is that perhaps a majority of people join me in that middle ground. But Sapolsky says, never mind, let’s just consider Liberals and Conservatives. Well, no you can’t; and even if you could, it sure as hell wouldn’t be science. And, oh, he’s glib, with repeated stay tuned and all that is cool, but. . .; and he even reduces himself to making fun of someone’s name.So, yes, some things he wrote got my amygdala all agitated. But then my frontal cortex took over, which I now know it will do, and let me analyze what he is saying as objectively as I could.We are learning more from science every day. Like, that that frontal cortex (the decider) isn’t fully online until our twenties. So what responsibility does a 14-year-old murderer own? We once burned epileptics as witches, owned slaves, and thought those acts appropriate, justified, biblically-sanctioned. Now we wonder how we could have done that. What will we think of how we behave now in 100 years, 500 years?Notwithstanding some annoyances, which I stated above, this really is a remarkable book and highly recommended by me. It takes a while and is not easy in spots. Maybe first check out some lectures by Sapolsky, readily available on YouTube. You will get a sense of his depth, humor and manic energy, all of which fuel this book. Here’s one about the topic in question: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0Oa4... and here’s one on how religion is a mental illness: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJM5m... .This book changed me, of that I’m sure. Imagine that. Now, excuse me, I have to do some chipmunk experiments."
5,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"What a wonderful book! It is a comprehensive look at all types of behavior, from the magnanimous to the hideous. It is filled with stories that heighten the reader's level of engagement. The book is long, yes. But not overly long. Sapolsky's subtle humor and little bits of light-hearted sarcasm fill the book and make it fun to read.So, what is the ""cause"" of behavior? The answer in this book, stated so clearly, is ""it's complicated."" There is no single cause. The structure of neurons and architecture of the brain is one contributing factor. Our collections of genes is another factor. One's upbringing certainly plays a role, as well as one's peers. One's environment is a major contributor. Hormones, such as testosterone may play a role at times, although its influence seems to be over-rated. Whether or not you are hungry when you make a decision is another factor. And it is clear that an adolescent's yet undeveloped brain has a big influence on lack of impulse control. So, yes, it is complicated.Various genes have been attributed to behavior patterns. But even this is complicated. The so-called ""warrior gene"" is not really a significant factor, except in a very limited set of circumstances. No single gene is responsible for a behavior pattern, but only in large collections do genes play some role in behavior. The book does get technical at times; lots of discussion about the role of certain hormones, and the structure of neurons and the architecture of the brain. You can skip over these sections if you like. But it is 100% fascinating, and the narrative is written for a lay person in mind.I didn't read this book; I listened to the audiobook, skillfully narrated by Michael Goldstrom. The audiobook helped me to relieve boredom during a long solo drive. I looked forward to every session with it."
6,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,5,"In the shortest possible summary, let me start by saying that Behave is a stupendous book, and among the best science books I have read. While it is a book of science, and very detailed in parts at that – it is still highly recommended reading for everybody. After all, who is not curious about why we behave the way we do. This book is certainly a tribute to the remarkable progress science has made in understanding our brain and our behaviours. However, be warned that it is a big book, which has a lot of detail and you might be in for a slower read than many other books.Robert Sapolsky invokes interest and curiosity right from the start - talking about how we are very conflicted in our beliefs – especially we condemn many acts of violence, but do support others. I have to admit I have many conflicts I am unable to resolve myself – such as the fact that I find very impressive the progress that science has made as detailed in this book, and yet I am very pained that much of this has come with cruel experiments on animals. The organisation of the book is very logical – it traces an action from when it happens, to moments before, months/years before and potentially several years earlier in cases. Experiments show that there are several markers in our brain which light up, before we take any action. So the big question (which the book Homo Deus by Yuval Noah Harari explores as well) – do we really have free will? Do we have the ability to stop when the natural instinct kicks in? As it turns out, much of how we act is a result of a multitude of factors – events which have happened at any time previously - sometimes well in the past, our genes, environment, and many others, some of it still to be determined. This has extremely important implications for law enforcement as well.There are excellent examples: eg: when you compliment a child on good work, telling them they are clever vs telling them they are hardworking invokes very different responses. While we appreciate empathy – the ability to step into and feel the others experience, empathy stalls action. Compassion is more effective. The discussion around how the brain responds to meditation are alluded to – though I think it deserved far more coverage. There are also other interesting lessons around how judges and juries decide punishment based on a number of factors which logic says should have no bearing. The issues of “Us” vs “Them” is discussed in detail, and deservedly so. Our brain instantly associates some faces as “Us” and some others as “Them”. We develop this categorisation over time and this association is very strong in adulthood and near impossible to get over. While this is true even in animals, our behaviours are more complex. The “Us” categorisation could be based on country, language, religion, colour, and others. The natural tendency is to think in terms of aggregate labels rather than as individuals, accounting for much of our biases.This is a big book, and one for which I should have taken notes. But I did not. Since there is a wealth of important information, I expect I will have to revisit the book again – when I feel I am forgetting its contents.The Appendix has information on Brain / Genes / Hormones which is worth taking a look at. This is an exceptional book, though certainly not light reading. Since it packs great amount of detail, it is a more difficult read than for instance “Sapiens” by Yuval Noah Harari. However, I very strongly recommend this – for reading at the earliest possible"
7,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/929238-hbalikov,4,"Sapolsky is a gem of a researcher, professor and deep thinker. He has done very well since receiving his MacArthur Foundation “genius grant.” Here he covers neuroscience, cognitive science and philosophy. The basic theme is that humanity (and we who comprise it) are capable of great good and great harm. There is a lot that underlies human thoughts, decision-making and actions that Sapolsky uncovers for us. Some of you may, like me, become a little uneasy reading this if your mind wanders into questions of friendship, race, religion, anger, love, passion, and the arc of civilization.  I felt, while reading this book, that I was less than successfully punching above my weight class. If I had a bit more book learning, I am sure it would have been easier. This isn’t because Sapolsky discusses the issues using fancy terms to impress his audience. In fact, he is very good a bringing in a metaphor or anecdote to illustrate his point. He even includes (toward the back of the book) a very helpful section on terms and functions. No, it’s because using the precise terms is very important and it takes time to become comfortable and conversant with them. I asked for Behave for my birthday. I don’t regret it and I am sure I will be coming back to various sections as time goes by. This book has raised my level of awareness and I am going to find additional ways to explore many of the topics presented."
8,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69589444-jen,5,"I have tremendous respect for Mr. Sapolsky, since I first watched one of his lecture series from The Teaching Company. He has my eternal gratitude for introducing me to the term Glucocorticoids, which I then tried to use a few times a day, every day, for an entire year. An experiment that was cut tragically short after a fateful dinner encounter in which, my father, who had been a mopey navel gazer for some time due to a complicated business decision, confided in me his troubles, to which I replied with as much gravitas as I could summon; “It could be your Glucocorticoids.”Anyway, since Sapolsky has played such a pivotal role in my intellectual development, I’ve made the decision to steer away from my usual review format. I’m going to avoid constructing it as a loose collection of darkly humorous anecdotes with a tiny bit of substance somewhere in the middle which you could glean just from reading the summary.This is a very granular look at all the proximate and distal causes of human behavior. So granular, in fact, that it reminds me of a time when I was racing my bike up and down our gravel driveway with criminal glee. My papaw, upon noticing this, distilled his wisdom into a pithy omen (as was his gift) and offered: “Gonna bust ye ass if ye don’t slow down lil lady.” And (as was my gift) I pretended not to hear him. Some time later, as foretold, I flew over my handle bars, cut an ugly trench through the drive in the rough shape of gangly idiot, and embedded quite a few gravels in my forearm. According to eyewitness accounts, after the dust had settled, I rolled onto my back, took a deep breath and said: “I think I need to go to the hospital.”This book is a bit like that, except without the stitches. And a lot of high quality information on the individual components that go into creating the complex biochemical package which is capable of instantiating behavioral algorithms foolish enough to ignore the advice of their elders. Yes it’s a dense book, and if you’re not paying attention, you might need to beat yourself with a belt in order to properly marshal your attentional resources. Luckily, Sapolsky is one of the smartest, most interesting people on the planet, so his witty anecdotes manage to guard the gutters pretty well —even if you’re like me, who, while under the intense scrutiny of your family during your first attempt at bowling, uttered a silent prayer, stormed ahead with that damnable cannonball and managed to granny toss that sumbitch into a completely different lane and skin your knees at the same time. (Not an easy feat, I still maintain.) — rather than deflect from his inability to cogently explain why this book is so damn good.It’s a fissile warhead containing enriched insights, strapped to a precision ballistic missile that’s waiting to explode your facile understanding of human decision making and leave you screaming amid the burning wreckage of your considerable ignorance. “WHY CAN’T ANYTHING BE SIMPLE!”Immolate your overly simplistic notions of human behavior with this book!"
9,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5,"Sapolsky might become one of my new favorite authors. In this work, he surveys the literature on Brains, Genetics, Culture, and puts together a detailed picture of what makes us tick. He takes in a large chunk of the human condition and lays out much of the known science around it. Be it gender, race, politics, development, violence of all sorts, personality, deviance and conformity, Social Dominance and Authoritarianism, Hierarchy, Ethnicity, differences between liberals and conservatives, Sexuality. Sapolsky is encyclopedic in his study of humans and their behaviors and thoughts and down to earth in his presentation. Reminds of Pinker in the presentation. A good scientist and a good writer.5/12/2018 On the second reading of Sapolsky's book I come away with a better idea of how his picture hangs together. The format, in general, is to look at proximal causes of our behavior starting with immediate causes like the firing of neurons and progressively going farther back in time to cover causes more distant from the present. Sapolsky goes from stuff in our neurons and brains that happened a few seconds or minutes ago, to things like hormones and endocrine stuff that could have bubbled up in the last few hours or days, to frontal cortex development in adolescence and the environment, back to the early childhood and the womb, to the genes and zygote, to culture of the past few decades, centuries and millennia, to our deep evolutionary past. At each of these levels, a part of our ordinary and extraordinary behavior is sculpted. This complex and layered picture starts to do justice to our extraordinary species and its multifaceted behavior. Much more than most pop explanations which focus on one aspect only of this long time sequence. Sapolsky covers much material and ranges widely but ultimately comes back to practical issues, like human development, war and peace, violence, stress and solving problems very serious problems we as people face. recommended."
10,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Sapolsky explores the causes of human behavior at every level. Although he throws in some zingers and catchy vernacular, this is a serious work that can read like a textbook. He divides the book in two parts. The first deals with everything that affects behavior: The brain, neurons, neurotransmitters, hormones; environmental factors particularly in adolescence, childhood, and the womb; culture, genes and epigenetics. The second half shows how all these factors combine to affect us as individuals and as a society. We are presented with an intricate array of influences and as often is the case, the more you know, the less clarity you have about what it all means.In a particularly dense beginning (with appendices for the underlying science) we get primers on the brain and neurons, their structure and how they work. We see how the interplay of their many component parts modulates behavior leading to impulsiveness or restraint. In addition we learn how we are influenced by the way we produce and process neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin) and of course hormones (testosterone, oxytocin). Sapolsky shows that the effects of these chemicals are not as straightforward as commonly presented. For example, oxytocin, the widely heralded pair-bonding hormone, causes us to draw closer to family but also to be more distant to strangers, in effect, amplifying the “Us Versus Them” syndrome.Sapolsky discusses a variety of factors that affect brain, emotional and cognitive development. He points out that the child facing poverty or abuse, lack of maternal interest or care, or lack of stimulation in the environment will be severely compromised. He focuses on adolescence. This awkward age is characterized by a fully developed limbic system which fosters emotions and a far from developed frontal cortex which supports reason. We all have witnessed the result. And of course there are genes which greatly affect behavior, but in context. Environmental effects shaping genes begin in the womb and continue through childhood. Epigenetic factors turn genes on or off. When genes are expressed their impact varies based on the other genes in play and the specific circumstances. For example the extensively studied 7R variant of the DRD4 gene makes you more generous than average if you grew up in a secure environment and less generous than average if you grew up in an insecure one. Sapolsky highlights other genes that cut both ways depending on environment.But much more than brain structure, neurons, neurotransmitters, hormones and genes determine behavior. Our decisions and actions, often unconsciously, are affected by unrelated events occurring at the same time. People holding a cold glass of water in one hand will view others as colder than they otherwise would. If a reviewer reads your resume attached to a heavy clipboard, you are more likely to be judged more serious than others whose resumes are read on light clipboards. Subliminal images also impact our conscious perceptions. Sapolsky offers many examples of how our behavior is primed by sensorial input that does not enter our consciousness. Cultural context is also important. What we expect to see affects what we will. This underlies much of the racism that is so divisive. Culture affects how we process what we see. Sapolsky points to the different ways people in collectivist cultures (East Asian) and individualist cultures (Western) focus their vision. Take a landscape photo with a person in the center. Someone from China will likely focus on the background as much or more than the person, an American just the reverse. Chinese immigrants to the US will take a generation to adopt the US priority in focusing on images. How much of our behavior with respect to violence is due to human nature? Were prehistoric hunter gatherer societies more or less violent or warlike than we are today? Sapolsky reviews expert opinions on both sides of the argument. What a contrast between his excellent presentation of this issue and Harari’s one-sided presentation in Sapiens. We learn that experts disagree. However Sapolsky still echoes Harari, calling the agricultural revolution “one of the all-time human blunders”. I don’t understand this. Without the agricultural revolution Sapolsky would be digging roots or chasing antelopes if he was lucky enough to have ever been born. Instead he is exploring the depths of the human mind, increasing our understanding of who we are. No matter how idyllic you paint primitive existence, I could not value it over one where we can develop our minds and build a better future for our children, as hard as that may be.In the second half of the book Sapolsky explores how all the forces that impact human behavior come together to influence the way we see each other and the world. He starts with a quote attributed to Robert Benchley, “There are two kinds of people in the world: those who divide the world into two kinds of people and those who don’t.” Sapolsky’s ensuing discussion of “Us Versus Them” is amazingly relevant to the current political dialogue in the U.S. Our political proclivity to be liberal or conservative is 50% heritable. Each position embodies a larger set of beliefs. Conservatives most highly value loyalty, authority and sanctity while liberals most highly value care, fairness and liberty. One study gave another reason why our political choices are less than rational. Groups of five-year-olds were asked to choose a captain for a boat ride to Candyland. Each group was asked to decide between pictures of two candidates. The pictures were from political contests across the US. The kids’ pick was the winner of the political contest 71% of the time.How are moral choices made? Of course Sapolsky cites myriad influences. Particularly interesting is empathy. We tend to conflate this with compassion, but empathy often is an end in itself and precludes a compassionate act. Sapolsky points out that empathy may have evolved to help us learn. It’s one thing to learn first-hand that a hot iron burns, seeing what happens to someone else touching the iron is a better way to learn and the lessen is strongly reinforced if we actually feel the other person’s pain. This is probably why that part of the brain (anterior cingulate cortex) that processes empathy developed. Interestingly most people who perform heroic selfless acts don’t think or feel anything first, they act instantaneously. Is there free will? Endlessly arguable, but if there is it certainly seems relegated to the back seat. Sapolsky explores what this implies for the American legal justice system. He believes we should abolish it in its present form. This doesn’t mean he thinks criminals should run free, but justice as punishment for an evil act makes no more sense than punishing an unreliable car. For everyone’s protection unsafe cars and dangerous criminals shouldn’t be allowed on the streets. Deterrence and public safety are legitimate reasons to lock people up, but not retribution. Capital punishment is clearly wrong.Are times more peaceful than in the past? Sapolsky references Steven Pinker’s Better Angels of Our Nature, which now I will have to read. Perhaps violence is down as a percentage of population. In that respect one could say modern wars kill fewer people than ancient ones. However modern wars kill people faster. WWII killed 55 million people and at a faster rate than past major wars. Modern 21st century weapons are poised to kill us all in a flash. Are we at a lesser chance of war? Harari in Sapiens thinks so given the lack of a world war since the 1940’s. I’m reminded of Max Hastings in Catastrophe 1914 quoting an 80 year old Brit just before WWI. He assured his interviewer that there wouldn’t be a major war since in his experience these things always worked themselves out. Unfortunately his experience wasn’t quite long enough. Religion has been responsible for countless wars and still underlies much of the conflict today. Sapolsky brings up a quote I loved regarding religious wars. “People are fighting over who has the better imaginary friend.” attributed to Napoleon. Sadly, nationalistic populism is on the rise often citing religious values and demonizing “Them.” All in all this is a great book if somewhat depressing. How much do we really control our own actions? The influences on human behavior are so many, so intertwined, and so complex that making sense of it seems almost hopeless. Still there are important lessons we can learn just understanding that fact. We can forego the presumptiveness of intuitively knowing why people behave the way they do. We can see that just casting blame and calling others evil will get us nowhere. Sapolsky gives us a detailed and thoughtful mix of facts and his opinions, of which I have covered small slices. It is not a light read, but if you want to understand why we do the things we do, it is very worthwhile."
11,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish,5,"Whatever your discipline of study, this book has some degree of relevance, considering as it does human biology. I wish to convey that this book is aspirational for everyone, even the author himself. He readily admits to gaps in his/our knowledge about human biology, but he tries, in this mighty interdisciplinary work synthesizing a lifetime of observation and thought, the current state of knowledge and points to areas for further study.Don’t be intimidated by its size or erudition. The author is amazing but he has always been approachable. Just flip through, stopping where something catches your eye. You will find yourself absorbed, amazed, provoked. Notice the chapter headings: the last several chapters are about humans doing the right thing…or not. The first several chapters reference those later chapters, showing how what he is telling us is related. What we do and how we act is related to our biology..all of it…like neurobiology, endocrinology, genetics, the relevance of which he attempts to be very careful and specific about explaining. He goes back in time, bringing in examples from our ancient history to show how things have changed and how culturally conditioned our reactions and responses are to stimuli. Each chapter ends with a summary, and the book ends with insights he has developed over years of study. Skim these to see if there is something more you wish to pursue. The studies he discusses in each section are referenced by authors focusing on different aspects of human knowledge and you may already be familiar with them. The concepts explored underpin much of what we understand about human behavior and morality. The work of Steven Pinker, cognitive scientist and currently professor of psychology at Harvard, is described by Sapolsky as “monumental” and is given its own critique late in this book.Sapolsky is not arrogant. He writes this book not to show off his knowledge, but to share his knowledge, which is why he tries to make it as readable as possible without dumbing it down. It is a work to be grateful for. One of the more moving moments in the work comes near the end, after over 600 pages of science and Sapolsky is talking about doing the right thing. He introduces us to Anglican cleric John Newton, born in 1725.Newton composed the hymn “Amazing Grace” but that is not what Sapolsky wants to tell us. Newton is remembered as an abolitionist, mentor to William Wilberforce who worked through parliament to outlaw slavery in the British Isles. But he didn’t start out that way. Read the story for yourself--plan to read the whole back-end of the book because you won’t be able to stop with Newton—about individuals, ordinary individuals making a difference and doing the right thing.Sapolsky may be a great scientist, but he is great writer and a great teacher. He makes us think and challenge our own assumptions. He tries to answer questions as they arise and he does not intentionally obfuscate. He does not dodge and only occasionally dismisses, and only then when an argument falls of its own weight. If you wish you had the background to soak up everything he says but do not, go for one of his earlier books which he wrote as a younger man, less burdened by all he has studied. They display his trademark intelligence and humor and are as much fun as a barrel of monkeys book on bonobos."
12,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13162061-amirography,5,"This is an important book, which I suspect, will be a classic. the whole book was dedicated to explaining how our biology and environment interact to give rise to our behavior and what does that implicate for our ethical and social views. That being said, Behave could have as easily been a comprehensive textbook. Yet the author vitally made the decision to write in classical style, as the intended reader were lay people. however, even I, as a person studying this exact field, have had struggled with some challenging parts, as the book is essentially about one of the most complex systems that we know.Fluency: 4/5Style: 5/5Content: 5/5"
13,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,4,"Why do we do what we do and is there something like a free will?In “Behave” you will learn basically everything there is to know on human behavior. Robert Sapolsky is professor for biology and neurology at Stanford university and takes us through the depth of our mind that determine our behavior.We are capable of acts of violence but also of kindness, but is one side of our nature destined to win out over the other? Every act of our behaviour has multiple layers of causation, so how does our biology affect the arc of war and peace, justice and persecution? How have our brains evolved alongside our cultures? One of the first topics that won me over was about race. We can tell the skin color of a person by seeing a picture for only one hundred milliseconds and experience a neutral face expression of a colored person as more angry, as one of a white person. That has devastating consequences on jurisdiction. For example are black people more likely to be shot by police officers, more likely to be convicted of juries and more likely to receive higher sentences. None of that has to do with conscious discrimination but unconscious impressions that we later correct. The more racist people are, the less of this correction happens. I knew about these injustices before and it devastated me, but I didn’t know which exact processes in amygdala and cortex lead to it. I thought about it as conscious race discrimination and not something that happens in all our brains. It can only be channeled through conscious correction of our cortex later and that really opened my eyes but also frightened me. I also learned that Ulrike Meinhof had a brain tumor- which I somehow missed before.On the other hand I slightly criticize the accessibility of his writing. I think that wide passages are loaded with technical terms and neurological details which make it hard to take in at times. For me this applied to some chapters more than others. Some things went over my head and I won‘t be able to remember unnecessary details. Because I already knew a lot of the studies from other books I have comparisons for how the exact same thing can be told more entertainingly and memorable, for example the research of Roy Baumeister, whom he constantly recites, and whose books I read and absolutely loved. But I’m not a native speaker and while I read in English 90% of the time, a ton of new technical terms make it unnecessarily difficult for me to understand, when it already acquires a lot of attention from native speakers to begin with. So maybe it‘s just my very subjective experience with a little bit of language barrier that prevented me from getting into the reading flow I would have wished for. In any case I didn‘t have any comprehension issues and the content remains amazing.If you are someone who criticizes so called “pop science” for not being detailed and accurate enough and want to have all possible proof, even if you can’t remember it later, than this book is just perfect for you. In any case you should be willing to invest a lot of time and attention into this. It’s absolutely interesting and rewarding but only if you can be enthusiastic about it, or it will be difficult to get through."
14,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,5,"Wow. This book literally covers everything there is to know about evolution, the human brain, behavioral theories, culture, etc. And Sapolsky does it in a fair and humble way. In other words, on the one hand, this and on the other this, but at this point there's more evidence for the latter. He's not selling a pet theory. It's so comprehensive and insightful that I'm mad I've read so many other books in this basic arena. "

This book explores the biology of violence, aggression, and competition – the behaviors and the impulses behind them, the acts of individuals, groups, and states, and when these are bad or good things. It is a book about the ways in which humans harm one another. But it is also a book about the ways in which people do the opposite. What does biology teach us about cooperation, affiliation, reconciliation, empathy, and altruism?
Behave took me longer than average to read – at a rate of about 30 pages/hour, this was approximately a twenty-five hour commitment for me – and while some of that reflects the care I took to understand the well-explained but still complex neurobiology behind human behaviour, nothing about this book encourages the reader to skim or gloss over: everything is just so interesting and I went slowly in an effort to absorb as much as possible. I can't ask for more from a book. Author Robert M. Sapolsky must be an inspirational professor to study under at Stanford, and in addition to his clear explanations of the sciencey bits, this book is full of (mostly bad) jokes, personal anecdotes, and illustrative examples that keeps everything relatable and focussed; Behave feels like a magnum opus, the synthesis of all that Sapolsky has learned over his professional and personal life, and to that end, I think it's valuable to let Sapolsky explain himself and his intent here:I make my living as a combination neurobiologist – someone who studies the brain – and primatologist – someone who studies monkeys and apes. Therefore, this is a book that is rooted in science, specifically biology. And out of that come three key points: First, you can't begin to understand things like aggression, competition, cooperation, and empathy without biology; I say this for the benefit of a certain breed of social scientist who finds biology to be irrelevant and a bit ideologically suspect when thinking about human social behavior. But just as important, second, you're just as much up the creek if you rely only on biology; this is said for the benefit of a certain style of molecular fundamentalist who believes that the social sciences are destined to be consumed by “real” science. And a third point, by the time you finish this book, you'll see that it actually makes no sense to distinguish between aspects of a behavior that are “biological” and those that would be describes as, say, “psychological” or “cultural”. Utterly intertwined.I wish I could find the quote now, but I once read something like, “American high school students learn that their Civil War was about slavery, but if they go to college, they'll soon learn that it was fought over taxation, State Rights, etc. However, anyone who studies further and learns the intricacies and nuances of history will discover that the Civil War was fought over...slavery (just not in the simplistic way that a high school student might believe).” Sapolsky follows the same kind of dialectic arc in his explanation of human behaviour. In the first sections, he describes the neural processes (the gooey brain stuff) that immediately precede any action: Fear triggers the amygdala, and in a split second choice between fight or flight, you punch an approaching stranger in the face; you are a slave to your biology. In the next sections, Sapolsky expands the neural picture to include all of the environmental factors that set individuals up to choose, for example, between fight and flight (ie., the so-called “warrior gene” in aggressive adults needs to be activated by a lousy childhood); proving that we are not slaves to our biology; there are a multitude of factors that influence behaviour; we have the free will (or the “free won't”) to choose amongst options, and that punch is an individual choice. Sapolsky then goes on to expand the picture further – to include the historical, cultural, and familial factors that inform behaviour – and as we can't control how we have been conditioned to behave, we are each enslaved by our conditioned biology. (Sapolsky rejects the notion that “no one can choose not to be a pedophile but pedophiles can choose not to be child molesters”: just as we are justifiably horrified by a society that once condemned epileptics as witches when they had seizures, Sapolsky imagines a more knowledgeable future in which we have mapped the brain to the extent that a child molester's desires can be cured; until that day, we are the equivalent of the Spanish Inquisition in our bloodlust for punishing these sex offenders for an uncontrollable brain disease. As a final aside on this, Sapolsky does agree that child molesters need to be separated from society, but doesn't see the efficacy of “punishment” and is looking forward to a more enlightened future.) The final sections explain how, in general, our society has been evolving towards less aggression, and as the state of the world literally moulds the state of our brains, we should all be working towards a more peaceful society that will, in turn, evolve more peace-seeking brains.The biology of the behaviors that interest us is, in all cases, multifactorial – that is the thesis of this book.As I started with, Behave reads like the synthesis of what Sapolsky has learned in both his professional and personal life, and his personal beliefs were never far from the surface here (which will cost him a star in my estimation; this book is not purely about the science). He refers to himself as a “progressive”, a “clichéd card-carrying liberal”, and cites studies that apparently show liberals to be more morally evolved than conservatives (conservatives are apparently more enslaved to fear-based triggers to their amygdalas; liberals take the time to sift kneejerk reactions through their more prudent prefrontal cortexes), but I don't know how, if we are all slaves to our biology, one belief system can be more “moral” than another (and I say this as a Canadian; I am not talking specifics about any country's political landscape). I was routinely turned off by value-laden phrases such as “the 'Islam=terrorism' idiocy”, and “the standard, wearisome critique of atheism”, and in particular, Sapolsky's professed atheism seems instructive: It is because he rejects the notion of humans having anything separate from their brains that make higher level decisions – whether you want to call that the mind, or the soul, or what he neutrally refers to as the homunculus before rejecting it as ridiculous – because he doesn't believe there's anything separate from the brain, he believes the gooey stuff of the brain itself contains all there is to know about human behaviour. I'm too agnostic to follow him to an absolute conclusion like that, but can't argue with his ultimate epilogue:
• If you had to boil this book down to a single phrase it would be, “It's complicated”. Nothing seems to cause anything; instead everything just modulates something else. Scientists keep saying, “We used to think X, but now we realize that...” Fixing one thing often messes up ten more, as the law of unintended consequences reigns. On any big, important issue it seems like 51 percent of the scientific studies conclude one thing, and 49 percent conclude the opposite. And so on. Eventually it can seem hopeless that you can actually fix something, can make things better. But we have no choice but to try. And if you are reading this, you are probably ideally suited to do so. You've amply proven you have intellectual tenacity. You probably also have running water, a home, adequate calories, and low odds of festering with a bad parasitic disease. You probably don't have to worry about Ebola virus, warlords, or being invisible in your world. And you've been educated. In other words, you're one of the lucky humans, so try.• Finally, you don't have to choose between being scientific and being compassionate.
Twenty-five hours of never boring reading to get to this point was a very good use of my time. The neuroscience did get complex, but Sapolsky ends each chapter with a clarifying summing-up. I also really appreciated Sapolsky's frequent shoutouts to other scientists and what appears to have been an army of undergrads who helped with his research for this book; makes him seem like a good guy and that upped my enjoyment as well."
16,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68316850-gavin,2,"Has an ingenious structure: starting with a piece of behaviour, work backwards through the many scales that caused it: from the nerve bundles that enable the muscle motion, through the brain processing that ordered those, through that morning's hormonal predisposing, foetal genetic construction, all the way to the ancestral environment.Sapolsky is engagingly cranky about various things: traditional misogynies, war. He uses the neologism ""pseudospeciation"" (i.e. the dehumanising kind of racism) about 50 times.He is often thrillingly unimpressed:
 Jane Goodall blew everyone's socks off by reporting the now-iconic fact that chimps make tools... Most cultural anthropologists weren't thrilled by Goodall's revolution, and now emphasise definitions that cut chimps and other hoi polloi out of the party. There's a fondness for the thinking of Alfred Kroeber, Clyde Kluckhohn, and Clifford Geertz, three heavyweights who focused on how culture is about ideas and symbols, rather than the mere behaviours in which they instantiate, or material products like flint blades or iPhones... Basically, I don't want to go anywhere near these debates. For our purposes we'll rely on an intuitive definition of culture emphasised by Frans de Waal: culture is how we do and think about things.
But he's way too credulous about social science. For instance, I recommend skipping the last half of chapter 3, on social psychology, entirely. In the space of two pages (p90-1) he cites power pose, facial feedback, ego depletion, and himmicanes; all as exciting, uncontroversial fact. This is a clean sweep of recent studies well-known to be p-hacked, low-power and spurious. He also endorses the results of Implicit Association and stereotype threat tests far too strongly. I don't know enough about neuroscience or endocrinology or ethology to make a similar recommendation for the other chapters. But the ""Gell-Mann amnesia"" effect sadly suggests that we should (partially) discount everything else in here, primates aside; evidence of credulity in one domain is evidence for others.(Best case, he just didn't keep up with the latest research dramas. Though some results, like the litter -> theft link or the Macbeth effect, have been comprehensively criticised for 8+ years now, so.)He also takes anthropologists at their qualitative, cherry-picking word when they try to maintain their academic boundary against Pinker's work on violence.Still worth it for his first-hand stories - him watching Somali oil workers conduct ritual argument, him watching a troop of baboons spread a culture - a pocket of pacifism and gender sanity in the psychotic roundabout of nature.Minus 1 point because his empirical judgments are unreliable. : ("

Not only does he present the latest data in fields of neuroscience and psychology, but his presentation of several issues of human behavior from the levels of neurobiology, sensory and stimulus perception, changes in hormone levels, developmental changes in physiology, evolutionary changes over the course of millions of years, as well as cultural and psychological changes from the environment as well as parental/societal upbringing makes for the most thorough, multidisciplinary work I've ever read. All the while, over the course of around 700 pages that is, Sapolsky does so in very readable and at times quite bizarrely funny fashion:""It floats above the limbic system, supporting philosophers since at least Descartes who have emphasized the dichotomy between thought and emotion. Of course, that's all wrong, as shown by the temperature of a cup - something processed in the hypothalamus - altering assessment of of the coldness of someone's personality.""""...after all, LTP (long-term potentiation) is what occurred in Schopenhauer's hippocampus when he read Hegel, not what the spinal cord does to make you more coordinated at twerking.""""Agriculture's invention is one of the all-time human blunders, up thee with, say, the New Coke debacle and the Edsel...and from there it's just a hop, skip, and a jump until we've got Mr. McGregor persecuting Peter Rabbit and people incessantly singing Oklahoma.""Quoting Steve Jones: ""Evolution is to analogy as statues are to birdshit.""He ends each chapter with important bullet points and makes this very complicated work flow seamlessly. As he approaches the great moral topics of the day the writing becomes quite poignant as demonstrated in two powerful back-to-back chapters, ""Metaphors We Kill By,"" and ""Biology, the Criminal Justice System, and Free Will.""I can't recommend this enough, rarely is this much education so much fun to read!"

I think it is important to do this in order to have a better grasp on the accuracy of his claims. ""Robert Morris Sapolsky is an American neuroendocrinologist and author. He is currently a professor of biology, and professor of neurology and neurological sciences and, by courtesy, neurosurgery, at Stanford University.""The bookThis is the best book on behavior, so on humans in general, and the overall best book I have *read so far.Make no mistake - this is a tough read but by no means because of the author's fault or its length.The endeavor he embarked on - explaining human behavior from every conceivable facet - is one of such magnitude that its sheer complexity demands you understand the underlying workings of neuroscience and endocrinology. Fear not however, as he takes you step by step with detailed explanations through all of these and more, laying the building blocks towards a better understanding of yourself and others.I am a long time admirer of science because it is the only tool that helps us better understand ourselves and the environment, facilitating a better comprehension of reality and the Universe we live in.Sapolsky uses the latest research interwoven with great examples, so that you can better grasp the complexity, all told through his strikingly objective thinking sprinkled with great humor.He tackles mind-numbingly complex subjects such as social hierarchies, morality, killing, war, peace, religion and free will, all while taking into account the environment, early stage fetal development, human evolution and so many other factors that your head might start to hurt, looking at behavior through each of these lenses.It is difficult for me to express in this measly review just how amazing his effort is.More amazing however is that he pulls it off, making this the most awesome endeavor about understanding humans that I am aware of.Sapolsky is a FUCKING LEGEND!Just as Morgan Blackledge, a GoodReads reviewer (sorry I can't seem to tag you here) says:""You're not fully sentient until you have watched all 20+ hours of his lectures from the course (at least once) which are freely available on YouTube.""If you don't like to read - although I highly doubt you're here if that's the case -  go watch his YouTube videos.Better yet, read the damned book AND watch his videos - you can thank me later!All these taken into consideration, I am convinced that 
EVERYONE
should read this book.Notes*I listened to the book - so used an audiobook format - and I absolutely do not recommend you do this unless you are familiar with the intricacies of neuroscience or, as I will do, you will purchase a written copy to go again through the content.**There are people who celebrate the lack of science behind their actions and you should be weary of them.One such example I've recently seen is a man who claims he is a certified psychotherapist, which I don't necessarily doubt, but openly acknowledged, when I asked, that there is no science behind his therapy. I expected the workshop participants to raise and leave the room, however they only applauded onward as he charismatically spinned the story to his liking.Please educate yourself, use critical thinking and always be skeptical in order not to be fooled and robbed by the likes of them - science is not perfect, however it is undoubtedly better than falling into the traps of cheap generalizations, confirmation biases and short term placebo effects.Reality is very complex so we should acknowledge this and act accordingly.***If you'd like recommendations on books I consider to be good in this area, feel free to ask or just take a look at my 'read' list.****I'm starting to seriously think there should be modern means to teach people how to think and the emergence of Mixed Reality might be a good medium for that. If you're interested in a chat about this or have a concrete proposition just drop me a message.Thanks for surviving my ramblings.Now go and read the book!"
19,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"Without question, this is Sapolsky's best work yet. I have too many pages of notes to synthesize a review that could possibly do this book justice. Review to come when I have more time to write. Meanwhile, put this book at the top of your list! A+"
20,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21675244-stian,3,"Whew! Aaaand breathe...! I managed to get through this slog of a book. A very thick, long, messy, and complicated work (stay tuned) Sapolsky is so fond of digressions that it becomes slightly jarring at times, not to mention his obsessive usage of footnotes (even David Foster Wallace would be envious of his propensity for footnotes!). These two annoyances do detract some enjoyment from the book. On top of that, the book tries to do a lot more than it initially purports to do. On the face of it, at least you are lead to believe initially that this is an excursion into the biology of human behaviour and the mechanisms that «govern» this behaviour, that is, outside factors like culture and ecology, and internal forces, like neurons, genes, hormones, and so on -- to give some answer to the question, Why do we behave the way we do? Now, he definitely does do this, it is true, but oh boy does he do a lot more than this too. After a while the book gets a clearly and overtly political inclination (stay tuned). I don’t really have a problem with that – it’s just not quite what I expected. Sapolsky pulls no punches here: he is a liberal leftist. Hey, I am too – I should dig it! And in some ways it’s hard for me to give this only 3 stars, as in the end I find myself agreeing with him on most accounts, and also share his rather pessimistic and depressing worldview that is felt throughout the book (except for in the final part, but even this optimism feels kind of half-hearted to me). But this aspect of the book makes it more jumbled, it becomes unclear where he’s taking you, and what I initially thought would be a fairly straight-forward book about human behaviour became something of a political statement, with, among other things, Sapolsky’s opinions on the current state of prisons in the US (and elsewhere) and the desperate need for reform. On top of all that, the book is stuffed with (littered with, perhaps?) fascinating case studies, including obligatory discussions of the Asch conformity experiments, the Milgram Experiment, and the Stanford Prison Experiment. Throughout the book Sapolsky is critical of the science behind the studies, and sometimes admits that studies he cites have not yet been replicated – so this is good, it’s clear that as a scientist Sapolsky is great, and I expected no less from one of my favourite authors. The problem is just that there are so many of these case studies, not all of them are even relevant (see above about digressions and footnotes!). Apart from the many chapters with biological priming, you’ll find discussions of free will, the difference between conservatives and liberals (a section of the book that may infuriate conservatives and make liberals gloat), and Sapolsky also throws in his opinions in the quite recent debate sparked by Steven Pinker’s book, The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined, about whether or not humans have gotten «better» (i.e. more peaceful) during the course of history. This section of the book I found particularly insightful, as I was aware of the debate but had honestly not really dived into it due to laziness. (Stay tuned.)I’m also quite convinced many readers will be put off by Sapolsky’s humour (he is not afraid of using abbreviations like OMG either), and some who don’t get the humour might even think he’s insulting to other scientists – similarly to how many people get confused by Bertrand Russell’s use of irony and have a hard time telling when he’s serious and not. But with Sapolsky it’s a lot more obvious. He’s a good-humoured guy with a very self-deprecating sense of humour, and there is a lot of it in the book (stay tuned). He is well aware he’s a slightly aloof professor whose body is only a means to transport his brain; a man who has spent some 30 years alone in the savannahs of Africa studying baboons. I think he’s great for it. The tone in general is quite conversational – which again I was expecting; Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers was written in the same vein. All that negativity aside, the book is good, in the end, partly because its message does in fact resonate so well with me. It makes me reflect on myself as a human being, my actions, thoughts, feelings, my biases and prejudices, and why I think as I do. The book has made me aware of areas in my life where I am particularly sensitive to irrational or prejudicial thinking, and how I can circumvent those flaws (basically tell my amygdala to STFU and make space for my prefrontal cortex). It’s made me aware of how humans tend to think, how we are so prone to Us/Them thinking, and just prone to thinking in buckets in general (as Sapolsky calls it). One of the conclusions of the book is simply: it’s complicated. And the book suffers from that: Sapolsky picks a fight with a topic that is just a bit too massive perhaps, especially considering all he wants to say, which is even more. But is it worth reading? A resounding yes. Would I recommend Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers ahead of this? Another, even more resounding, yes.*For those that have not read the book: I added the odd ""stay tuned"" here and there because if you read this book you will be having to ""stay tuned"" pretty much constantly. Just priming you. Now when you know this fact, too, your dopamine will soar as you will find the first ""stay tuned"" in the book and be pleased to get the (admittedly poor) joke in my (admittedly poor) review. STAY TUNED. It is of vital importance."
21,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,4,"Robert Sapolsky's modest goal with this book, is to give a full survey of why we humans behave the way we do. Unlike most others who attempt the task, he is not focused primarily on one timescale. Chapter Two focuses on ""One Second Before"" (whatever the action was). By Chapter Five we are up to ""Days to Months Before"". By Chapter Nine, we are up to ""Centuries to Millennia Before"". Trying to look at the same cause from the perspective of either the previous second, or the previous millennium, is in itself an intriguing premise.Sapolsky is a professor of biology and neurology at Stanford University, so we can guess that he is no dummy. Also, unlike the science textbooks I suffered through when I was in school, he is willing to let you see that there is a human writing the book, both by using personal anecdotes to illustrate a point, and by interjecting humor from time to time. Both of these are useful, when you are reading the sort of book where ""pre-frontal cortex"" and ""anterior cingulate cortex"" are used so often that he uses the acronyms PFC and ACC for them. He must have done a good job of it, though, because after a while I sort of knew what he was referring to when he used those acronyms, forgetting for the moment that they were specialized terms I don't normally encounter, and I even remembered one of them just now without having to look it up. Would that we had people writing grade school and high school textbooks in such a manner.Sapolsky is, of course, just about as far to the pacifist left as one can get. He is an American professor living in San Francisco, after all. However, he is able to at least recognize his own biases, call them out for you, and even occasionally tell you about a finding that might make him a bit uncomfortable. I don't mind authors having a bias; they are human. I do much prefer it when they know it, recognize it, and don't try to pretend it doesn't exist. Sapolsky's book is both eminently readable and packed with about a thousand different scientific studies (some he did himself, many more done by other all over the world) that allow you to judge for yourself if his conclusions hold up.I also appreciate that very little of the book is attempting to program his readers to any given policy or ideology. There is a section towards the end, when he turns to the question of crime and punishment. If you are writing a book about why humans behave the way they do, it is perhaps inevitable that at some point you need to turn to the question of what society should do about it when people behave badly. I don't necessarily even disagree with his conclusions all that much, but for me that part of the book (and it was a relatively small part) was by far less interesting.The greatest part of it was like a conversation with someone who knows a lot of great stories, a lot of interesting facts, and a lot of funny jokes, and he mixes them together in a masterful way. It was about 700 pages long, and I was sorry to see it end."
22,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"This book delves into what makes us do what we do: hormones, genes, environment. Unsurprisingly the conclusion is that you can't point a single factor - be it gene or hormone, without taking into account what is happening in the environment. How you react to the influence of oxytocin or testosterone is entirely dependent on the setting. Likewise with genes. There isn't any one gene for aggression that strongly points to individuals being more aggressive - although being a man definitely means there is a higher likelihood for such behavior.In some ways this book is reminiscent of ""The Ten Types of Human: Who We Are and Who We Can Be"" by Dexter Dias. However, he concentrates more on evolution and on telling stories, making his book more compelling. Although ""Behave"" is rife with examples and the author's humor, it simply isn't quite as engaging. On the other hand, it is far more interesting than ""	Aroused: The History of Hormones and How They Control Just About Everything"" and its spectacularly misleading title. What ""Behave"" has is a lot of detailed examples, both proof and reproof. I like that. It shows that it's not 100-0, like the author points out, it's usually 51 for and 49 against.The author is funny and I did learn quite a few new things. One of my favorite paragraphs was this one: ""How's this for irrationality? Back to people deciding whether to save the person or the dog. The decision depended not only on who the person was (sibling, cousin, stranger) but also on who the dog was - a strange dog or your own. Remarkably, 46 percent of women would save their dog over a foreign tourist. What would any rational baboon, pika, or lion conclude? That those women believe that they are more related to a neotenized wolf than to another human. Why else act that way? 'I'll gladly lay down my life for eight cousins or my awesome labradoodle, Sadie.'""Yes, I am one of those women. I'd definitely save my dog over a stranger. When it comes to ""us"" and ""them"", my dogs are part of my ""us""."
23,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502690-graeme-roberts,5,"Already called ""a masterpiece,"" ""a miraculous book,"" and ""the best book I have ever read,"" by eminent experts, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst defies further superlatives. I would happily give it ten stars on Goodreads. What I loved most about this massive tome, at 717 pages with the important appendices but not including the glossary, abbreviations, notes, and index, is the extraordinary man who wrote it. Robert Sapolsky speaks to us, you and me, with elegance and clarity, personality, and a rich, self-deprecating humor. This great teacher imparts ideas of enormous complexity without losing us. He heads the second paragraph on page 253 with, ""Yikes, this is complicated."" And he lets us know what he really thinks, completing the third paragraph on page 254 with, '""Warrior gene"" my ass.' Countless pages ago, those words made me laugh."
24,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4100763-hadrian,4,"Sapolsky, in this volume, hopes to address the causes of violence, competition, and aggression in human beings. He bases his study on neuroendocrinology - the chemical and biological interaction between hormones and the brain, but also primatology, the study of primates - not just human beings. In looking at 'causes' of behavior, he looks at immediate causes, causes from the development of the brain and hormone systems, and different adaptations across evolutionary history. He also does this in a way that a layperson like myself can understand what exactly he is trying to say. The first ten chapters cover what behaviors he hopes to discuss - Chapter 1 is a definition of what exactly aggression and competition are. Chapters 2-10 cover the causes of these behaviors - from seconds before to adolescence, childhood, prenatal development, millennial, and the evolution of behavior itself. This framing lets Sapolsky cover so many different causal approaches of behavior. Chapter 3, which covers the seconds and minutes before a behavior, talks about neurobiology and neuroanatomy. Chapter 4, about hours or days before, takes into account the effect of hormones. The simplest takeaway is that there is no single proximate causes for behavior, but a collection of tendencies, factors, and propensities, which go into effect in different environments. The last seven chapters, again to grossly oversimplify is about what can we do with all this - how to manage human aggression in maintaining complex societies. Sapolsky is an optimist here. He argues - and makes a serious case for - understanding the plasticity of human nature and the benefits of creating just and fair societies and environments that aid the development of the human brain, and so to avoids thinking about biology alone as destiny. The book is written in a convincing, knowledgeable, and humorous style. If he talks like how he writes, he would be an engaging professor to have. The book also contains useful appendices on the endocrinal system and the brain. While I have little reason to doubt the author's own expertise, especially in his affectionate descriptions of his own work and his explanation of the fields - I admit some skepticism over the older studies and examples he references. This is not his own fault, of course, but the results of the ""replication crisis"" which is roiling through human psychology. In short, so many studies that were once held as iconic representations of human behavior were now cast in doubt, as their findings cannot always be reproduced. The ""broken windows"" study, the ""marshmallow test"", and even the ""implicit-association test"" have had their findings called into doubt. That said, this is a book that presents complicated issues in a way that an attentive reader can at least approach them and understand their premises and where they came from. I would think, but I cannot say for sure, that specialists might also benefit from a closer study of the book's sources and conclusions. Few science books can straddle the line between both these audiences, but Sapolsky has done it."

""You don’t have to choose between being scientific and being compassionate.""
I've got a degree and psychology and in many ways I wish I had just read this book instead.  Behave is a chunky read – but it's worth it. The book follows the question of why we do the things we do and thereby covers everything from the brain to the evolutionary background, cultural influences and discusses tricky subjects such as altruism and violence. It's an incredibly ambitious book. There's no way I'd be able to summarise its content – it's ridiculously dense on information and as I was reading it I could already feel myself feeling genuinely sad that I probably won't be able to remember each ounce of information delivered. But in a way, I'm okay with it, because now that I am a genuine fan of the guy, I'm absolutely ready to dive into all the videos on YouTube of lectures he has been giving at Stanford.The book will be interesting to people of the subject as well as non-specialists. While I was already familiar with a lot of things covered here, Sapolsky has a way of delivering information that is just so pleasant and fun that it mostly feels like your favourite teacher sitting down with you to tell you some anecdotes about his passion. There are loads of footnotes with little tidbits of bonus information and context and also appendixes covering the basics of neuroscience, endocrinology and proteins. Sapolsky is special, because he's not only a great researcher, but also a great teacher. The two don't necessarily go hand-in-hand, as many scientists I am familiar with lack to have a knack for story telling and actually delivering information. Sapolsky can do both – without oversimplifying, he's able to entertain and educate you simultaneously. Honestly, the only regret I feel in regards to this book is that I borrowed it from a library (and also got that copy wet because the weather decided to turn on me at some point – apologies to all the Book Gods here), because I just want it back now. I can't wait to learn more about and from this man. "

I sped read through and skimmed for any interesting morsels!The title was misleading to say the least. Humans at our best and worst?!!!! No, it was the history of neuroscience at its worst!It was a bogged down, overly expansive historical account of neurobiology! I have read similar books to this before and wouldn't have started this if I'd known it would be more of the same!Reviewers (Matt, Oct 24, 2017 and Jen, Jun 16, 2019) have handily listed all the citations of ""red flag"" experiments mentioned by Sapolsky that seem to be replicated in EVERY other book about neuroscience and have dubious scientific grounding!!Also, I'm sick of hearing about the Milgram Experiment and the Prisoner's Dilemma!For a study on the biology of humans, Sapolsky also overly concentrated on chimps, bonobos (I know I know we share high percentages of DNA), rats and small furry animals! The mentioned human studies were surprise surprise twin studies!!!!!!I think I've had my fill of books like these as they are far too similar in nature to be interesting any more.Bloody neuroscience!"
27,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3998101-literary-chic,3,"Definitely for a smarter reader than me. The writing was very good, but what sounded like a fascinating topic was immensely dry. Eventually, all the scientific speak led to hypotheses by the author. Personally, my favorite line of thought was prison time for young offenders. Science has discovered brains aren't fully developed until in our 20's. So, how can we charge 14 year olds as adults?The author kept everything light. He had lighthearted analogies to maintain the readers attention. All in all, excellent writing work in my opinion. However, I found it too mental after a long day at work. Truly 3 stars is more reflective of me as a reader than Dr. Sapolsky as a writer."
28,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25904223-abderrahmane-nadir,5,"Well I usually don’t write reviews on books, because for the most time a lot of people have done it before(in better and more extensive way), but I had to write this one, BEHAVE was a life changing book after you finish this book you won’t have the same ideas about many concepts and it makes you puzzled about many subjects (free will, judicial system.. etc.), this book tackles the human behavior and analyses it through different disciplines (endocrinology, evolutionary biology, ethology, behaviorism and neurology ) and it studies what happens in the body second, minutes ,hours and days before a behavior happens, the most important theme was context and environment, those are the ones with the greatest impact on behavior.The second part is about Sapolsky, man if I have to talk about this man in pages it won’t be enough, I was taking his course of behavioral biology of Stanford university (which you can find it for free in YOUTUBE, and the content is similar to the book but with more examples and interaction ), the guy is gifted for simplifying information with a unique sense of humor, and how he masters the different subjects is mind-blowing, BEHAVE is by far the best book I’ve read in 2020, it lit a flame inside you to continue searching about this subject passionately."
29,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20989544-laura,5,"Eminently good, as expected.It's impossible not to love and enjoy a book written by Sapolsky, I've said it already, I will continue saying it. What surprises me the most, it's how many topics this book covered, by the amount of pages if may seem obvious there were many, but when reading it, those pages don't seem to be much for the great work he did. I think the title is the perfect summary of what this book is about ''the biology of humans at our best and worst'' but of course, to cover that you have to go from cells, genes, evolution to race, politics and wars. Therefore, it's a book about biology, but also a book about sociology, psychology, about us.Also, everyone can read it. This book has a lot of appendices with information that complements or explains in more detail things that might be hard if you don't have a science background, so there isn't an excuse to not read it"

What is it with biologists and well written non-fiction that does not completely gloss over the details? The book is fairly long and appears to lack a central thesis except that ""it's complicated"". But ""Nothing seems to cause anything, instead everything just modulates everything else"" is probably closer to the truth than the endless internet debates over nature vs nurture.However even though the book is expansive, remembering to critique both sides of the debate (not even Pinker or Ramachandran are spared) while being filled with citation and humorous footnotes, I still had a few minor issues that force me to discount other things as well. Things like Wellesley effect and Freakonomics explanation of drop in crime rate in US are presented without any remarks about the contentious nature of the findings (largely believed to be false I think, but I could be wrong)."

It's probably a little too textbook-like for some readers, but for those who really want to get a good general grounding in what science in 2017 tells us about behavior, there is probably no better place to go.I particularly liked the discussions on the law and neuroscience, and a really nuanced take on role (or lack thereof) of genetics in behavioral determinism, and final chapter relating to war (and peace)."
32,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,4,"It is common these days to come across people who have developed a strong dislike for all reductionist approaches. They prefer holistic views, and are suspicious of any knowledge that has been derived through breaking up a big problem into smaller chunks. I can understand why they feel that way, but I have always felt that such feelings can only be harbored when one is unfamiliar with the depth of the subject in question, and therefore assumes a simplistic view of things. For example, I know of many people who are suspicious of normal medical science because it treats each organ as a separate functional entity, and expertise within the medical profession is divided by such narrow specializations. They prefer a medical science that looks at the big picture, which includes not just the various sub-systems, but combines the body with the mind. This is a wise and noble thought until we realize the complexity of the whole system. Once we do, the justification of breaking it up into smaller systems become obvious. All the knowledge we have about our body could not have been attained without first breaking it up into the various organs and trying to understand how they work in isolation. Once that has reached a certain level of details can we afford to put them back together and investigate the far more complex interactions between these systems. If we tried to bypass the reductionist step in the first place, we would have been stuck with vague and faulty theories of how the body works, as can be found in all ancient texts. A responsible form of holistic science cannot be rushed. In many cases we may not even be ready to take that step, and must wait till we have better understanding of the parts.Of all the systems we have investigated so far, the physical systems of materials and forces, chemical systems, astronomical systems, and biological systems – they all yielded fairly well to the scientific reductionist methodologies. However, the biggest challenge lies ahead in understanding the most complex system we have encountered so far – our mind. Huge progress has been made in this direction in the last few decades. The progress happened through advances in neuroscience, biology, computational science, evolutionary sciences, psychology etc. Problems that were beyond any convincing and demonstrable theory are regularly being converted into understandable bits of knowledge. In this environment of tremendous progress, where all the different branches seems to be converging, it is not unexpected that many specialists start to believe that they have finally figured it out. I have read many books where brilliant minds would try to prove how their specialty, be it neuroscience or evolutionary biology, can finally explain our behavior, our morality, our aesthetic sense, etc. in terms of their science alone.This book is the only one I have read that not only celebrates the great accomplishments of our reductionist approach towards understanding of how the mind works, but also exposes the severe limitations of not appreciating the complexity of all these subsystems when they work together. He systematically shows how each of the systems involved, our neuronal bran, the environment we live in, both in our mother’s womb and the environment outside, our endocrinal systems, our genes, how they all interact and influence each other is incredibly complex ways. The only way we can understand the whole thing is when we allow for these interactions. In other words, why we need to look at the whole thing holistically, while admitting that it can only be done when we understand the parts really well. It is a sobering document because it shows the challenge that lies ahead. Modelling the complexity of the whole system is so complex then we may never be able to crack it open. That is, understanding of an individual mind may remain impossible, while we get better at understanding them in aggregate.The real value of this book is not just in convincing us that full understanding of our mind cannot happen until we integrate all the pieces together, but in nudging us towards a slightly different mindset that can be applied to all complex problems. As in everything else, when we solve one problem, it only presents us with an even more complex problem. And to me, that’s what makes life worth living – that there will never be a shortage of things to ponder."

The second part of the book has a slightly different format - as the author delves into specific human behavioral traits (like Us vs Them-ing, hierarchies and obedience, morals, usage of metaphors, violence, etc.), and discusses them in detail, often drawing the fundamental expounded upon in the previous chapters. The book has a entertaining myth-busting style. It will present a hypothesis (say testosterone is responsible for aggression), present experiments in favor of it (castration reduces aggression, injecting testosterone back in brings it back), and then present more experiments that poke holes in the earlier somewhat simplistic explanation (raising testosterone to 10% or 200% of original levels makes no difference as compared to raising to 100%). He also talks about the wars within academia on numerous theories/ideas - neurogenesis, mirror neurons, sociobiology, Stanford Prison Experiment findings etc., which, apart from being entertaining, also reinforce my belief that the author does not only present the theories that he “likes”. Though it’s definitely possible that he did that at certain points in the book, I think he presented the nuanced view more often than not. Sometimes, there’s an information overload, as the author presents results from 5-10 studies in a single paragraph. Also, since a lot of these tend to be psychology studies, their results have to be taken with an appropriate amount of salt. Some of the later chapters are a bit preachy (using intuition vs reason in in-group and out-group interactions, why the current justice system is stupid, how to reduce violence)- but since they are backed by fairly solid science, and logical (to me) explanations, I still enjoyed reading them. In the end, I think it’s a great book, and is peppered with humorous anecdotes, both personal and historical, which makes it easier to go through its ~800 pages. The only “limitation” of the book is its scope - I don’t really think any single book can cover all the issues that this book tackles - but a list compiled from the books referenced here would probably make a great reading list. I might do that at some point. "

However if you are interested in brain chemistry or feel like a challenge this was quite well done.

For anyone else, that would be enough. For Sapolsky, it's just the start. Behave is entrancing, accessible, and infused with a spirited likability that you just can't help but enjoy. Behave will turn heads and raise controversy in the field of neurobiology, something the field has come to expect from Sapolsky, but Behave will also change science writing. Gone is the jargon and hundred-watt rhetoric that repels the plebians and ill-informed. No more tented-fingered, cross-legged analysis. This may be the definitive book on behavior, but it's a book for everyone"

It was first published in May, 2017. This is one miracle of a book. I don’t know where to start…“Someone does something lousy and selfish to you in a game, and the extent of insular and amygdaloid activation predicts how much outrage you feel and how much revenge you take.” ― Robert M. Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst Book focuses on Robert Sapolsky’s attempt to tackle seemingly impossible question. That is to look at our behavior from every possible angle: biological, psychological, physiological…and there are some historical and cultural angles thrown in to it too. We start with neurobiological angle: what happens in our brains when some specific behavior occurs, what effect do our hormones have on us, what is our genetic makeup, how are we different or even not that different from rest of the animal kingdom… This is not enough. Sapolsky continues by how environment affects us and also focuses on age-old question: are we formed more by nature or nurture? And indeed as mentioned, then we continue with psychology, history, culture…Behave is among the best nonfiction reads ever. It’s stunning, it’s big and it’s absolutely beautiful. I learned so much and it also changed the way I see some things. Here are some of my picks throughout the chapters of the book:Chapter 4: Hours to Days Before: How testosterone increases confidence and optimism and decreases fear and anxiety. Chapter 5: Days to Months Before: Enough time for Arab spring, for a discontented winter or for STDs to spread a lot during a summer of love…and also plenty of time for our brains to change…How there’s long-term LTP and LTD. And veryy long term LTP and LTD and how they work differently in different regions of our brains.“Testosterone makes people cocky, egocentric, and narcissistic.”― Robert M. Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and WorstChapter 15: Metaphors We Kill By: How Rwandan genocide came to be and how metaphors were used as a weapon. Oh the power of metaphors. I have never before realized this. During Rwandan genocide, Tutsis were described as cockroaches. And those cockroaches would steal your husband. They became something that had to be exterminated, swept away from the country. Almost 1 million people dead within 100 days.“Some translation is needed. The Rwandan genocide did not involve tanks, airplanes, dropping bombs or shelling at civilians. There were no concentration camps. No transport trains. No Zyklon-B. There was no bureaucratic banality of evil. There were hardly even many guns.” ― Robert M. Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and WorstChapters 6 & 16: Author explained PMS syndrome. He also explained how PMS syndrome has been used as a criminal defense. And this is not the only sort of crazy sounding criminal defense in the book. There’s also a lot of talk about the development of the brain in earlier chapters and whether a person is or isn’t fully aware of his actions and consequences of those actions due to it… Adolescence. Or. Dude, where is my frontal cortex as the chapter is called.What else… Sapolsky uses the analogy of a car with faulty brakes to describe antisocial human behaviour. How judges give less harsh sentences after they have had lunch! Yes you read that right, judges’ rulings’ are harsher when they are hungrier. And this also works with smells. If you’re in a place that smells bad, you more likely to judge a person or a thing in a negative manner, how there was a Christmas truce in 1914 and how in many wars since soldiers had to be threatened to go kill soldiers from the opposite side. And how opposite of love is not hate …it’s indifference. And to conclude. There is no such thing as free will.I loved this book. As you can probably tell from my review, it’s packed with loads and loads of information in a very simplified, easily understood form. Moreover, there’s a sense of humor or sarcasm in the writing and that always gets one more star from me because it’s like authors are laughing at how idiotic some of the things we do are and I really appreciate that (…we do a lot of dumb shit). Maybe the only downside to the book as I was listening to audio version were all the: “footnotes” and “i see her see i see her see i see?”. They were a bit much in spoken. All in all, a fantastic piece of literature.5/5 stars"
38,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6179509-derek-ouyang,4,"At over 700 pages, this took almost all year to finish. I can't say the journey is necessarily enjoyable -- it's incredibly dense, and Sapolsky admits in his epilogue that the two word TL;DR of his book is ""It's complicated"". But this staggering work is also incredibly rich, like a mental block of cheese that you can only sample in nibbles, and incredibly plastic, meant in the best neurological sense, like a mind actively at work laid bare. And this mind is an incredibly inspiring one. I never took one of his classes, but I think this book is a great representation of what brilliance looks like in a teacher."

I must be his perfect reader-- someone with a working knowledge of popular science, biology, neurology, and psychology-- I get his jokes. He is informative, vastly knowledgable (to put it mildly), speaks to the general reader, and light-handed with his material.I can not think of a better read for the approaching times of neurological understanding of the cause of why people do what they do, and the larger questions of blame in a criminal context. "
40,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81718362-ann,4,"After taking over two months to complete this, I am not sure what to say except 'whew'. This is the most comprehensive book I have read on human behavior. Sapolsky goes beyond the (neuro)biological factors and incorporates cultural, psychological and environmental considerations into the discussion. I wouldn't say this is a difficult read but it is a richly complex and detailed book. Sapolsky's sense of humor helps take the edge off things. By the end, the reader is fully aware of the meaning of, 'it's complicated' when attempting to explain human behavior. In essence, it is very complicated and scientists probably have just scratched the surface in their understanding.What struck me is how 'me' vs 'us' vs 'them' factors into things, even in our split second decision making. The chapters discussing the roles of hormones and neurotransmitters were quite interesting and sometimes the information surprised me. Finally, the chapter titled 'Metaphors We Kill By,' discussing symbolism and symbolic values was actually frightening. The different parts of our brain aren't adept at handling that information in a logical way and symbolic meanings can be interpreted as physical pain or rejection. Ouch and Yikes! Scary stuff. After reading all this, I do believe there is some meaning to the saying 'reality is the stories we tell ourselves' (greatly influenced by our brain's interpretation of things, along with hormonal regulation, genetics, environmental factors, childhood experiences, etc.) For anyone who isn't ready to undertake reading this, I'd recommend checking out some of Sapolsky's lectures from Stanford University on YouTube. There is some overlap between the lectures and the contents of the book. His lecturing style offers a comparable representation to his writing style. "
41,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2976142-thomas-edmund,5,"I'm going to be upfront and explain that I have a huge bias towards this book, in that I purchased it first thing after Lockdown ended (2020 hope that clarification isn't needed in the future) after 2 months of missing having a massive tome of non-fiction to read!That aside I still think this book is amazing, although extremely heavy. Sapolsky covers genetics, neurology, development, just to get STARTED on the important half of the book. I have a Master's in Psychology but my undergrad was in genetics and I struggled to keep up with the technical stuff in this book (luckily Sapolsky provides appendices with 101s for folk)So I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book to someone first diving into a piece on human nature, perhaps starting with something like Sapiens, or Ten Types of Humans. However if feeling confident or having plenty of time and cognitive energy to devote to this it should be fine.Overall the book is huge and covers so much its hard to really summarize, I loved that between the technical stuff there was the odd joke, or personal touch that always seemed brilliant. Some of the insights from this book will stick with me for life and while much of the content was heavy it was worthwhile."

The way neuroscience, endocrinology were explained. Its a more important book than most of the books you have read or will read. The scope is wide - covers almost all aspects of human behavior. It lets you learn something new in every chapter. My favorite part is when Sapolsky explains what goes in our brain when any behavior occurs.

I read this together with Steven Pinker's ""Enlightenment Now,"" and I felt that the two books complemented one another well, even though the two authors don't necessarily see eye to eye on every point. Both discuss (in somewhat different contexts) the social, cultural, and psychological evolution of the human animal. Both give reasons for cautious optimism, though both also seem to realize the potential for disaster that looms as we move forward as a species. "
45,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66276739-adam-marischuk,2,"Two books and two different ratings, but you could save a lot of time by watching the youtube videos of kids trying to not eat marshmellows and coming to your own conclusions about human nature.The first half (including the three appendices) of Behave are the more scientific chapters of the book. The appendices are worth reading if, like me, you haven't formally studied biology in a couple of decades. They are a well written and easily digested summary of neuroscience, endocrinology and proteins.The first nine chapter have an interesting organisation, even if I feel it was not well executed. The idea of tracing an action backwards in time to evaluate the causes of the action has some merit, but Professor Sapolsky fails to remain on task and hence the excessive length of the sections. In the introduction he rails against ""buckets"" or categories of answers (the distinction between biology, psychology and culture) and then follows his own holistic advice. But the resulting chapters are disjointed at best. An editor could have cut the book in half without sacrificing any of the science or the audiences' ability to understand and a little of Aristotle's four causes would have benefited both author and audience. The digressions are sometimes interesting but usually merely political marginalia from an aging ""vertebarte, mammal, ape, human, male, scientist, lefty"" (p. 405)What was particularly interesting in the first few chapters is Professor Sapolsky's ability to find middle ground in the nature/nuture debate by bridging the gap between the two and noting the maliabiliy of nature.I suppose if the book had ended after chapter nine it would have received 3-4 stars.But then Professor Sapolsky continues into what I could only call socio-psychology with a dabbing of neuroscience to back up some rather radical leftist views. His discussions on hierarchy, free will, ethics, religion and war all take the same politically inspired position and do not flow seemlessly from the science. Sometimes it is bias mascarading as science, and othertimes it simply leaves the science aside. His discussion of ethics and utilitarianism is particularly egregious, and this is coming from someone who has little sympathy for utilitarianism. The construction of straw-man arguments does little to help the cause.Professor Sapolsky attempts to reconstruct the Naked Ape (Desmond Morris) but ends up with some monster who only vaguely resembles a man. I am reminded of the G.K. Chesterton quote, ""Take away the supernatural and all that is left is the unnatural"" (Orthodoxy, p 49) His reductionist materialist approach leads him into some strange territory, where rights exist but free will doesn't. Where a complete (and admittedly impossible) revolution of the criminal justice system is necessary. The very subtitle explicitly mentions our best and worst behaviour but he develops no criteria for evaluating one or the other, prefering to rely on ""context, context, context"" (p. 672). I am inclined to buy Jonathan Haidt and Steven Pinker and never pick up another book by Sapolsky. His politics, philosophy, ethics, criminology, even theology and psychology are all so different from any human's lived experience (and the language that goes along with it) that I can only concluded with E.O. Wilson, ""Wonderful theory, wrong species.""A lot more was said a lot better about materialism by David Hume, or about free will by Nietzsche, or mind-body dualism by Descartes, consciousness by Leibniz etc.And to close, he never justified:""I won't pull any punches- I think that its [agriculture's] invention was one of the all-time human blunders"" (p. 326)"
46,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49565692-ben-torgerson,1,"A shining example of what is wrong in the world of science today - scientists who can't separate their personal prejudices and belief from research-based fact. Sapolsky cherry-picks his research to make political points. He is yet another typical liberal intellectual type (so prevalent in education today) that is unable to set aside his own political and social prejudices and present the research in an unbiased way. That is not to say he does not present some interesting research in this book, but he so damages his own credibility with his misapplications of the scientific results and cherry-picking of the science that supports his own skewed views that no reasonable person can accept any of his characterizations or conclusions at face value. What is even more amusing is his repeated condemnations of people who misapply scientific results and cherry-pick the data, all while doing this himself throughout the length of the book. A good percentage of the book is devoted to using scientific research to prove that people who disagree with his political beliefs are unintelligent, unfeeling, etc., and yet he condemns the Nazis for citing science in a similar way to turn the Germans against the Jews. This book should be regarded as nothing but pure drivel and the author should be completely discredited in the world of science."

50,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7208369-miles,5,"Books that examine the relationship between science and morality have become ubiquitous, so readers interested in these important subjects need to choose carefully. It is not an overstatement to say that one could do no better than to alight on Robert M. Sapolsky’s Behave. This engrossing, encyclopedic examination of the causal mechanisms that determine human behavior is a monumental achievement of syncretic thought.This was my first journey into Sapolsky’s singular mind, both joyful and challenging. Covering an almost inconceivably vast landscape of scientific information, this neurobiologist/primatologist takes a playful but responsible approach to some heady topics, delving deep into humanity’s best and worst behaviors while never missing an opportunity to charm the reader with his perspicacious wit. I usually don’t care for comedy in nonfiction, but Sapolsky’s wry humor rarely misses the mark, and is complemented by an impressive ability to synthesize multiple perspectives and extricate sensible conclusions from dense and sometimes-conflicting data. Sapolsky is also transparent about his own biases as a “bleeding heart liberal,” making him a truly lovable genius (and not just in the casual sense).Since it would be folly to try to cover everything this book has to offer in a review, I’ll focus on explaining Sapolsky’s methodology, and then comment on just a few of his most important findings. Sapolsky begins with a necessary critique of how scientists typically explain human behavior, which is to break it down into different “buckets of explanation,” each of which comprises a distinct realm of inquiry:""We tend to use a certain cognitive strategy when dealing with complex, multifaceted phenomena, in that we break down those separate facets into categories, into buckets of explanation…The goal of this book is to avoid such categorial thinking. Putting facts into nice cleanly demarcated buckets of explanation has its advantages––for example, it can help you remember facts better. But it can wreak havoc on your ability to think about those facts. This is because the boundaries between different categories are often arbitrary, but once some arbitrary boundary exists, we forget that it is arbitrary and get way too impressed with its importance…There are not different disciplinary buckets. Instead, each one is the end product of all the biological influences that came before it and will influence all the factors that follow it. Thus, it is impossible to conclude that a behavior is caused by a gene, a hormone, a childhood trauma, because the second you invoke one type of explanation, you are de facto invoking them all. No buckets. A 'neurobiological' or 'genetic' or 'developmental' explanation for a behavior is just shorthand, an expository convenience for temporarily approaching the whole multifactorial arc from a particular perspective."" (5-8, emphasis his)This boundary-busting approach puts Sapolsky squarely in the company of intellectual titans such as Edward O. Wilson and Steven Pinker––interdisciplinary thinkers who have, however imperfectly, combined findings from numerous academics fields to launch humanity into new realms of inquiry and debate. Sapolsky is less poetic than Wilson and less contentious than Pinker, bringing a cautious, even-handed compassion to the science of understanding human nature. As any science reader knows, it is one thing to claim that disciplinary boundaries are arbitrary and ought to be ignored, and quite a different thing to actually demonstrate how this can be done. And while I don’t think Sapolsky fully achieves his stated goal, his efforts to do so are heroic and effectual.The first half of Behave plays out like a tennis match that travels back in time, with the ball representing the focus of Sapolsky’s chapters and the net representing a (somewhat arbitrary) boundary between behavioral mechanisms that operate primarily inside or outside the human body. He begins with “One Second Before,” an explanation of the neurobiology that takes place just before behavior is enacted, then transitions to “Seconds to Minutes Before,” where he discusses immediate environmental stimuli that contribute to behavior. Next comes “Hours to Days Before,” a discussion of how hormones influence behavior, which is followed by “Days to Months Before,” where he takes up long-term neural plasticity (learning and memory).This pattern continues, with subsequent chapters addressing adolescence, early childhood development, genetics, culture, and humanity’s shared evolutionary heritage. So Sapolsky makes use of the buckets of explanation by taking up these topics one at a time (what else could he do?), but also goes to great lengths to show as many interactive areas of overlap between the different causal mechanisms as possible. This truly is a “both/and” story he is telling, with all the moving parts affecting all the other moving parts in profound and intriguing ways.The second half of Behave is more traditionally structured, and wades into dicier territory. Sapolsky tackles tricky subjects such as tribalism, moral intuition and bias, power dynamics, ethical motivation, empathy, the power of symbols to move us to action (or not), free will, criminal justice, and war. These areas of study are all rapidly evolving along with society and technology, so it’s impossible to tell how relevant Sapolsky’s assessments will be in decades to come. But all in all, this is the best and most up-to-date summary of recent findings in these fields one could hope to engage with. I probably had to read between ten and twenty other books to discover most of the insights Sapolsky distills into just a few hundred pages.All of this should be more than enough to convince science and ethics enthusiasts that Behave is essential reading. If you’re eager to run out and pick it up, just stop reading here and go for it. But if you want to stick around, I’ll give some thoughts about what I see as Sapolsky’s most important findings.Sapolsky’s most critical point by far is the importance of context in understanding human behavior. This is hardly a novel position, but Sapolsky lays out the argument for contextualization with sui generis assiduousness and clarity. Over and over he pounds the table about context, tirelessly illuminating the ways in which human behavior is sensitive to myriad influences both inside and outside the body. Most of these influences are partially or completely hidden from our conscious experience of the world, and it is only through scientific inquiry and abstraction that we come to understand their significance. Perhaps the wildest demonstration of this is the role of transcription factors in determining how a person’s genome expresses itself:""95 percent of DNA is noncoding…What is that 95 percent? Some is junk––remnants of pseudogenes inactivated by evolution. But buried in that are the keys to the kingdom, the instructional manual for when to transcribe particular genes, the on/off switches for gene transcription. A gene doesn’t 'decide' when to be photocopied into RNA, to generate its protein. Instead before the start of the stretch of DNA coding for that gene is a short stretch called a promoter––the 'on' switch. What turns the promoter switch on? Something called a transcription factor (TF) binds to the promoter…Thus transcription factors regulate genes. What regulates transcription factors? The answer devastates the concept of genetic determinism: the environment."" (226, emphasis his)Sapolsky goes on to explain that numerous factors––ones present inside cells, inside bodies, and even outside bodies––can all nudge transcription factors one way or another. This means that, while a person’s genome stays constant throughout life, gene expression (the manner in which genes code for the particular proteins that make you you) is keenly sensitive to environmental conditions and constantly in flux. Furthermore, it turns out that transcription factors are usually proteins themselves, and therefore require other transcription factors to instruct genes to code for them:""Genomes aren’t infinite; instead TFs regulate one another’s transcription, solving that pesky infinity problem. Importantly, across the species whose genomes have been sequenced, the longer the genome (i.e., roughly the more genes there are), the greater the percentage of genes coding for TFs. In other words, the more genomically complex the organism, the larger the percentage of the genome devoted to gene regulation by the environment...The human genome codes for about 1,500 different TFs, contains 4,000,000 TF-binding sites, and the average cell uses about 200,000 such sites to generate its distinctive gene-expression profile. This is boggling."" (228-9, emphasis his)Boggling indeed, but also fucking fabulous. O brave new world, that has such people in ‘t! The level of detail and complexity in the example above is indicative of every section and chapter Behave has to offer. Sapolsky doesn’t cut corners or succumb to simplistic reductionism, seeking instead to repeatedly blow the reader’s mind by showing the grand scope of what goes into decisions as simple as deciding whether to reach out to touch someone’s arm. Every step of the way, we are bombarded with caveats, clarifications, contradictions, and pitfalls of empirical limitation. It would be infuriating if it weren’t so damned fascinating! Sapolsky’s main thrust––that context is always crucial and never simple when trying to understand behavior––could not be better delivered. It also carries a hopeful undertone because many of the environmental contexts in which humans must operate are created and controlled by humans, implying that we can genuinely help people lead better lives if we learn how to fiddle the environmental dials the right way. Our power in this regard is far from limitless, but hardly insignificant (I’ll return to this at the end of the review).Behave also contains strong arguments for the elimination of poverty and abuse, especially in the lives of children. Sapolsky grinds out a glut of ghastly facts about how “childhood adversity” can compromise people later in life:""Childhood adversity increases the odds of an adult having (a) depression, anxiety, and/or substance abuse; (b) impaired cognitive capacity, particularly related to frontocortical function; (c) impaired impulse control and emotion regulation; (d) antisocial behavior, including violence; and (e) relationships that replicate the adversities of childhood (e.g., staying with an abusive partner)."" (194)He immediately follows up by pointing out that “some individuals endure miserable childhoods just fine,” and makes it clear that anything goes when looking at a particular case (194). But the trending effects of childhood adversity are undeniable and terrible. Like many other insights in Behave, this is not anything we didn’t already know; it’s the sheer volume and artful presentation of Sapolsky’s converging evidence that gives his work inimitable force. He is also not afraid to bind these findings to strong, empirically-based arguments that reject egregious income inequality and promote investment in public goods:""It’s not so much that poverty predicts poor heath; it’s poverty amid plenty––income inequality. The surest way to make someone feel poor is to rub their nose in what they don’t have…When social capital decreases (thanks to inequality), up goes psychological stress…If you want to improve health and quality of life for the average person in a society, you spend money on public goods––better public transit, safer streets, cleaner water, better public schools, universal health care…Inequality means more secession of the wealthy from contributing to the public good."" (294-5)There’s no denying that this is a kind of liberal do-gooder wishlist, tinged with Sapolsky’s political leanings. Although it leaves him open to criticism, I admire Sapolsky for linking research with certain normative outcomes when he deems it appropriate. It is a fitting strategy for this moment in time, when the notion of any truly “objective” source of information has become obsolete. The best we’ve got are people like Sapolsky, who humbly bend the knee to reason and reality even when they’d rather the universe were otherwise, and who also fight tooth and nail to be heard when reason and reality actually support their political points of view.The final aspects of Behave I want to take up are Sapolsky’s direct claims that we can and should use science to improve the chances of people acting well instead of badly, along with his implicit argument that narrative and storytelling have a huge role to play in this grand project. While science is perhaps humanity’s most powerful method for analyzing and improving environmental conditions, narrative is a timeless tool for teaching people to assume the perspectives of others and to individuate potential enemies instead of reducing them to faceless members of a reviled out-group. This comes through in Sapolsky’s recommendations for dealing with humanity’s inescapably tribal nature:""From massive, breathtaking barbarity to countless pinpricks of microaggression, Us versus Them has produced oceans of pain. Yet our generic goal is not to 'cure' us of Us/Them dichotomizing. It can’t be done…If we accept that there will always be sides, it’s a nontrivial to-do list item to always be on the side of angels. Distrust essentialism. Keep in mind that what seems like rationality is often just rationalization, playing catch-up with subterranean forces that we never suspect. Focus on the larger, shared goals. Practice perspective taking,. Individuate, individuate, individuate. Recall the historical lessons of how often the truly malignant Thems keep themselves hidden and make third parties the fall guy."" (423-4)Sapolsky doesn’t take what I see as the next logical step here, which is to assert that the easiest way people can begin checking off his anti-tribal “to-do list” is to engage with stories that open the way to novel perspectives and unfamiliar modes of moral calculus. We should draw heavily on the power of narrative to simulate social complexity and teach the lessons Sapolsky rightly identifies as essential for ethical education. He points out in a later chapter that, despite its considerable downsides, “our confusion of the literal and the metaphorical, our granting of life-threatening sanctity to the symbolic, can be used to bring about the best of our behaviors” (579). There is a momentous marriage between the arts and sciences embedded in this outlook––a marriage more sacred than any of the supposedly sacrosanct folderol that has hitherto spawned from the imaginative shit-heap of human history.Stories can teach us to think and act better, but only science can deliver the building blocks and blueprints for our better world. When wrapping up a discussion of how former enemies reach reconciliation, Sapolsky implores readers to “recognize that science can teach us how to make events like these more likely” (670). He knows it’s a game of probability; we can’t force people to be good, but we can make it systemically easier for them to make the right choice, even if we know the “rightness” of that choice will always be at least partially if not wholly circumstantial. The more we learn about the light and dark tendencies inherent in human nature and particular arenas of action, the more capable we become of incentivizing instances of good behavior and minimizing instances of bad behavior. Scrupulousness of the highest order is called for, but the project is both worthy and necessary.I’d be delighted to spin out some final words that would drive home everything that is special about this book, but I couldn’t hope to top Sapolsky himself:""If you had to boil this book down to a single phrase, it would be 'It’s complicated.' Nothing seems to cause anything; instead everything just modulates something else. Scientists keep saying, “We used to think X, but now we realize that…” Fixing one thing often messes up ten more, as the law of unintended consequences reigns. On any big, important issue it seems like 51 percent of the scientific studies conclude one thing, and 49 percent conclude the opposite. And so on. Eventually it can seem hopeless that you can actually fix something, can make things better. But we have no choice but to try. And if you are reading this, you are probably ideally suited to do so. You’ve amply proven you have intellectual tenacity. You probably also have running water, a home, adequate calories, and lows odds of festering with a bad parasitic disease. You probably don’t have to worry about Ebola virus, warlords, or being invisible in your world. And you’ve been educated. In other words, you’re one of the lucky humans. So try.""

51,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77785790-david,4,"I think of this book as an introduction to pre-crime. I believe the term that the author uses is ""neurocriminology"", but the essential unifying premise of the book is that human choices are predetermined by complex biological factors which neuroscientists are just beginning to understand in ways that will eventually allow these specialists to predict very specific criminal and antisocial behaviors before, sometimes long before, the actors consciously choose them. We inherently function as if our choices are independent, spontaneous and free. Westerners particularly tend to view ourselves as autonomous individuals. This book will shatter these notions. Most or all of our choices are made before we are consciously aware of them, and most of our choices are not really originate in the individual. Our thoughts and decisions arise from our primordial past, our education, and the biological / environmental conditions immediately preceding ""our"" decisions.The most difficult aspect of the book for me was the insufferable liberalism of the author. The book opens with a gratuitous fantasy about all the horrible things the author would do to Hitler, if given the chance. The author also avails himself of every opportunity to illustrate how racist and bigoted white people are compared to nonwhites. It's never made clear why the author harbors such biases, but it's clear that he feels both justified and righteous for doing so.The concessions which the author makes concerning human biology and behavior are all the more enlightening given his openly hard left bias. For example, Sapolsky conclusively denies that ""nurture"" is the pre-eminent factor in determining human behavior. At the same time, he also gives evidence to show that inherited, genetic traits are strongly modified by the environment, whether that be biochemical or social.Sapolsky affirms the biological reality of kin selection by citing mouse studies showing that mammals produce biochemicals enabling individuals to ""smell"" how closely related other individuals are. Mice, among others, preferentially socialize with individuals whom they sense are more closely related, all else being equal. On the other hand, mice and other animals can be trained artificially to ignore this natural bias for their kin and affiliate with non-related individuals.Similarly, the author points out that human social structures tend to be ethnocentric. Human studies show that whites have an innate, preconscious bias towards their own kind and against blacks. Nevertheless, it's possible to ""overcome"" this ""xenophobia"" with appropriate conditioning, according to the author. Sapolsky consistently recognizes the fact that humans and animals naturally desire to bond with relatives and kin, yet he regularly affirms this natural tendency is ""bad"" or ""xenophobic"".The ""fallacy of naturalism"" struck me as a profound insight into the character not only of Sapolsky, but of the leftist cultural phenomenon as a whole. Such liberals are characterized by the belief that what is natural and instinctive is often wrong and must be artificially re-engineered in order to achieve harmony. By contrast, the opposing view of many conservatives is that nature is correct, even sacrosanct. This view of nature's correctness is easily seen in Austrian Economics, for instance.Another key aspect of the liberal left versus the conservative right that I noticed in this book was the fact that liberal tendencies typically arise from people who are insulated from the exigencies of life relative to those people who are regularly exposed to hardship. Sapolsky cites studies showing, for instance, that conservative people experience nightmares more frequently and suffer from more adversity in general than their liberal counterparts.This adversity-conservatism correlation was also illustrated by a narrative describing the social transformation of a troop of baboons from an endogamous, tribal, aggressive, and patriarchal community to a relatively exogamous, passive, and female-dominant one. How did this transformation occur? It occurred in response to an unlimited supply of low-cost food: the troop settled near a garbage dump where they ate leftovers from human tourists and became ""liberalized"".The same appears to be true for primitive human society. Sapolsky devotes considerable space to the question of whether archaic hunter-gatherer and pastoral human societies were violent and aggressive or peaceful and harmonious. What he shows is that scarcity of resources provokes the former, while abundance promotes the latter. Thus, the ""noble savage"" resolves to the ""well-fed savage"" who becomes more savage and less noble he becomes more hungry.Conservatism and hunger are not only linked in the case of monkeys and tribal humans. Sapolsky notes that criminal justices statistically deliver harsher sentences when they have skipped breakfast. Combined with the observation that conservative people often have more nightmares and other adverse experiences, a theme emerges: liberalism of all kinds is the natural product of affluence and excess, while conservatism is the natural response to adversity and hardship.However, culture is not merely the expression of environmental resources over time. Behavior is embedded in the biology and genetics of the individuals forming a community. Sapolsky cites the famous Dmitry Belyayev Russian Fox study which showed that selective breeding could produce docile foxes. Sapolsky also cited a similar study showing that feral behavioral traits could be bred out of rats. These studies showed, according to Sapolsky, that behaviors which we think of a volitional and ""free"" may, in fact, be the inevitable result of genetic selection.This is a fascinating admission from a leftist author since it forms the key premise of ""A Troublesome Inheritance"" by Nicholas Wade. Wade's book is described as ""controversial"" largely because it applies the Russian Fox study (among others) to human society. Sapolsky shies away from such conclusions, yet both he and Wade agree that human behavior is heritable, just like animal behavior is. Further, both explicitly reject the absurd ""blank slate"" hypothesis of the social constructivists. Sapolsky's book can, in many ways, be seen a single, massive refutation of ""blank slate"" theory, yet in practice, Sapolsky advocates against the idea that our heritable traits are generally good. Our natural proclivity to identify and associate with kin leads, in his view, to violence, ""xenophobia"", and antisocial behavior. Thus, Sapolsky sees it as necessary for social harmony to scientifically overcome our natural tendency towards ""pseudospeciation"" based on biological factors like genes and race.Sapolsky regularly returns to the theme of ""green-beard effects"" wherein individuals in society identify and associate with individuals who share specific phenotypical traits, such as dark skin or blue eyes. Sapolsky automatically asserts that such effects are irrational, even dangerous. With this in mind, he documents various scientifically-validated techniques for replacing natural, racially-based green-beard effects with artificial ones, such as affiliation on the basis of organized sports.Conservative, ethnocentric thinkers like Wade, Pat Buchanan, and Ann Coulter observe the same green-beard and kin-selection effects but that such effects are both good and natural. In the conservative paradigm, separation of the tribe is the solution, not the problem. Both sides admit the existence of the natural tendency to form kin-based tribes, yet authors like Sapolsky generally affirm that advocacy of such nativism constitutes the dangerous logical fallacy of ""moral naturalism"".Sapolsky regularly makes jabs at moral naturalism. His main criticism is that what is perceived to be natural at one time often changes later. Thus, culture mediates our perception of what is ""natural"" and ""good"" versus what is ""unnatural"" and ""bad"". Sapolsky sees this as a an opportunity for reshaping social perceptions to accept new ""unnatural"" things as ""good"" and ""natural"", while the conservative instinct is to pass on what is perceived as natural from one generation to the next.If we accept the essential premise of Behave, then the choice to be liberal (in the sense of adoption what is unnatural and foreign) versus conservative (the preservation of the natural) is biological and subconscious rather than objective and rational. Furthermore, if we accept that the instinct to conserve kin-based groups and ostracize foreign races is dangerous and subversive, then it is easy to cast racial conservatism as a mental disorder rather than a rational decision. The same is true in reverse: if liberal tendencies are heritable, biological, and subversive rather than rational and ""free"", then liberalism is a ultimately disease. This isn't a new idea: Michael Savage, for instance, is notable for his regular insistence that liberalism is a mental disorder. In the opposite camp, it's not uncommon for liberals to insist that conservatism is the result of inbreeding, mental retardation, or childhood trauma.The ultimate end of rational dialog comes when we finally accept that people with views opposite to our own are not going to change their minds or become ""converted"" on the basis of rational argumentation and evidence. Various biological markers predispose people to adopt the views which they hold such that the conscious, rational portion of our brain constitutes a thin veneer over the primal realities of our nature.Viewing liberalism and conservatism as biological traits leads us to the ultimate question: will liberalism or conservatism ultimately wipe out the opposing trait and achieve hegemony in the human population, or at least in specific human population groups? Drawing on the above-mentioned studies, I conclude that while resources are abundant, docile, passive, and liberal traits will be dominant while virile, defensive, and conservative traits will become recessive relics of a dark, irrelevant past."
52,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7422525-scriptor-ignotus,5,"IT’S COMPLICATED “I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.”  — Sir Isaac NewtonWhy do people do what they do? Of all the sciences, that of our own behavior is often the most unsettling in its mysteriousness. Delivering a precise and comprehensive causal explanation for any form of human behavior is almost always impossible, and to attempt even a general account requires one to interface with a bewildering array of methodologies, disciplinary perspectives, spatial and temporal scales of analysis, and the necessary but overwhelmingly nuanced and complex interrelationship between all these factors. If any piece of the causal puzzle is missing—which is always the case, as biologists have not (yet) fully mapped the causal chains that produce our most unique and sophisticated behaviors—then none of the other pieces quite fit together either, leaving unanswered some of the most fundamental questions regarding who and what we are. We are enigmatic even (perhaps especially) to ourselves—as psychology and the humanities have long attested—even though self-knowledge may be the most critical necessity for the survival and flourishing of our species and its planetary habitat. Behave is an incredibly ambitious cross-disciplinary gesture towards a complete picture of the biological substrata of human behavior. As a study which attempts to account for both the profoundest depths of cruelty and sadism and the most exalted heights of compassion and benevolence characteristic of our kind, and which attempts not to override and dismiss but to affirm and buttress the full spectrum of approaches for thinking about human nature, it is the most genuinely humanistic science book I have read. Behave is organized in two main parts. The first part, composed of the first nine chapters, is likely the most thorough exposition of the multilayered biological underpinnings of human behavior ever put in print. Each chapter is framed as part of a skeletal narrative: a behavior has just occurred: what happened in the seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, years, centuries, and millennia beforehand that could help explain why it happened? Each consecutive chapter widens Sapolsky’s analytical lens. When we think about what happened one second before the behavior occurred, we’re in the realm of cellular neurobiology. Neurons in the brain are generating action potentials in response to a stimulus; these disturbances of the negative charge inside of a neuron, caused by openings in the dendritic spines which allow positively-charged ions to flow through, travel from the dendritic spines through the cell body and, if the electrical disturbance passes a certain threshold, through the axon to the axon terminals, which send neurotransmitters across synapses that connect with specialized receptors on the dendritic spines of subsequent neurons, which causes the opening of channels in the membrane for positive ions, which generates action potentials in those neurons, and so on. The collection of 100 billion neurons in each human body and their integrated axonal projections are, at the cellular level, what constitute the vast and intricate circuitry of the nervous system. The generation of collective action potentials in billions of neurons in a particular brain region is what neuroscientists refer to when they speak about the “activation” of brain regions in response to stimuli. Move the timescale back to seconds or minutes before the behavior, and we’re looking at the macro organization of the brain. At this level our behaviors are mediated through the interaction of brain regions. The ancient amygdala, the almond-shaped core of the limbic system, mediates fear, anxiety, and aggression, and is often the first brain region to activate in response to unfamiliar stimuli. People who demonstrate more implicit bias against racial out-groups show more amygdaloid activation when presented with faces of people of another race, and the amygdala shows growth and overactivity in the brains of people suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Overlaying the amygdala are the higher limbic structures, which regulate base emotions, and the cortex, which mediates most of our higher cognitive functions, such as memory, language, motor skills, facial recognition, and contextual judgment. The newest brain region, in evolutionary terms, is the prefrontal cortex (PFC): the crown jewel of executive function, the seat of strategic knowledge organization, delayed gratification, social and cultural acclimation, contextualization, and the regulation of emotionality and impulsivity. It is also the last brain region to mature in an individual lifetime, not coming fully online until around age 25—a critical fact when thinking about the brilliance and deviancy so uniquely characteristic of adolescence.The late maturation of the PFC indicates something astonishing about the evolution of the human brain. The wiring of the PFC is not significantly more complex than that of other cortical regions, nor does it consist of a different type of neuron—with a few limited exceptions. Biologically speaking, it isn’t any “harder” to develop a prefrontal cortex than it is to develop any other part of the brain, which likely means that the delayed development of the PFC was selected for by our hominid ancestors. We evolved in such a way that the makeup of the frontal cortex, because its development is delayed, is shaped by the makeup of our other brain regions, which in turn are shaped by personal experiences. By developing later, the PFC is designed to accommodate the neurological “lessons” of our own, individual lives. The genetic program of our brain development has evolved to liberate the frontal cortex from genetics. Of course, none of these brain regions are discrete entities, and none are free from the influences of hormones and environmental factors. Expanding our timescale to account for the hours to months before a behavior occurs involves reference to endocrinology, the effect of hormones on behavior via their influencing of the nervous system, and the plasticity of the brain. Here Sapolsky debunks some common misunderstandings about the role of certain hormones in behavior; namely testosterone and oxytocin. Hormones are not “instigators” of behavior; in fact, one of the overarching themes of the entire book is that there is never a single biological cause of any behavior, but rather a vast field of facilitating and inhibiting factors that influence the probability of certain behaviors to degrees that are not always quantifiable. Androgens like testosterone are facilitators of behavior. They make the amygdala more sensitive to triggers of aggression, but only among people who are already predisposed to acts of aggression. Nor is aggression the single, inevitable result of testosterone production. Testosterone levels increase not only in response to situations demanding aggression, but also in situations in which one’s social status is uncertain, changing, or perceived to be under threat. In those situations testosterone does not facilitate violence per se; it facilitates whatever behavior is necessary for one to secure status. If a society bases its status relations on, say, charitability, then testosterone won’t cause you to strangle a cheetah; it will cause you to insist on paying the tab at a restaurant. If testosterone has an unfairly negative reputation, oxytocin has an unfairly positive one. This “luv hormone” facilitates bonds between mothers and infants, bonds between humans and their canine pets, and the pair-bonding of monogamous romantic couples; but these salutary effects are relegated to in-group relations. Oxytocin increases our prosociality towards an “Us”, but it also makes us more suspicious of “Thems”. It does not facilitate free love, but rather parochialism. In the second part of the book, Sapolsky attempts to synthesize the complicated layers of knowledge laid out in the first half, and to offer some insight as to how these biological factors influence our best and worst behaviors. I can hardly do justice to the nuances of the discussions in each chapter, but they address such topics as our instinctual categorization of people into In-Groups and Out-Groups and how and why we prioritize some dimensions of “Us-ness” over others; the unique human capacity for establishing and navigating hierarchies and the physically corrosive effects of having the “wrong” status in a particular social context (Sapolsky is a Rousseauian primitivist, and considers the agricultural revolution to be the greatest blunder in human history for the role it played in establishing rigid and dramatic status hierarchies); the neurological correlates of empathy (and how it’s better if our altruism is instinctive rather than an act of willpower); how metaphorical thinking is innate to our biology (and why a society is in extremely dangerous territory if certain members of it are persuasively associated with insects or fecal matter; hyperactivity of the insular cortex, which regulates disgust responses, can make one an ethnic cleanser—or worse, a germaphobe); the question of free will and how our conception of justice should be framed accordingly (Sapolsky is a strong determinist and thinks a criminal justice system based on punishment is totally irrational); and, of course, war and peace. Why do people do what they do? Sapolsky’s short answer is: it’s really complicated. No, really, that’s his answer; that’s the conclusion he comes to at the end of this big, beautiful disaster of a book. But understanding, though difficult, is possible; and with understanding comes a spirit of mercy which could perhaps change the world."
53,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22844682-pat-rolston,5,"If Professor Sapolsky teaches as well as he writes then his students are among the most fortunate in any classroom on the planet. This is one of those rare authors who can educate the reader while entertaining regarding a topic of staggering complexity. I hope this gift does indeed carry over to his classroom at Stanford in which case there will undoubtedly be a lot of inspired youth pursuing answers to the mysteries of the brain. I took considerable time to read this book as there were many opportunities to reread the passage or concept at hand and contemplate the subject in depth. There is also great reference information and appendices to help those of us needing liberal doses of assistance. As one of the greatest benefits of such books are the attributions and opportunity to read the books referenced I will add one for consideration that won't disappoint: ""The Archaeology of Mind: Neuroevolutionary Origins of Human Emotion."" by Jaak Panksepp and Lucy Biven. This is worthy of mentioning in the same review as Professor Sapolsky's masterpiece.  As with so many things in life the satisfaction is directly proportional to the effort expended and Robert Sapolsky's book, ""Behave,"" will help you better understand what chemistry and brain structures combined with environmental factors are potentially at the root of this feeling. This is not an author espousing an absolute deterministic view, but leaves room for something more that makes us human that our science has yet to discover the metrology to measure. The intellectual humility is rare and a reflection of the author's wisdom."

57,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31302406-lori,5,"I have a very quick rule of thumb to measure up books meant popularise science: if it leaves one thinking ""ow it's much more complicated than that"", then it's a good book. And I was very pleased to see the author echo—explicitly, obviously this was implicit throughout the book— much of the same sentiment in the Epilogue: If you had to boil down this book to a single phrase it would be ""it's complicated"" (p. 674)   Highly recommended to anyone trying to understand what it is to inhabit this meat suit we call a human body. Although, fair warning, you will be left with a great feeling of uncertainty afterwards; i.e. you will be made aware of your own ignorance, and most important—hopefully—you will shut up about ""human nature"" at every turn. You can also expect to have your (yes, your) simplistic notions of biological determinism shattered.  Now, a slightly more elaborate exposition than ""it's complicated"": Any meaningful analysis of the behaviour of human species deals with biology-environment interactions. One can expect to learn that: testosterone, oxytocin, mirror neurons, and pretty much any new fad protein, neurotransmitter, or brain region does not work the way you thought it did.  The negative effects of poverty, inequality, and social hierarchy in general are laid bare—or shorter SES (socio-economic status). The science is in: these societal dynamics wreak havoc on everything from IQ (p. 249) to health, to exacerbating anti-social behavior. Most fascinating is the fact that the lower you are on the wealth inequality ladder, the poorer your health. And get this, only a third of this degradation is due to actual, poorer material conditions. It is the subjective experience that matters, and the definitive knowledge and reality of having someone who's infinitely richer than you, and capable of shitting down the ladder—so to speak—on you. (p. 441 contains a nice bullet-point list of the known effects). Now, I am going to go on a tangent, to something the author did not mention, but as a filthy red I am almost obliged to do so. If we look into the work of Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century, and more importantly in Karl Marx's Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, Vol 1, we see capitalism's inevitable, structural tendency to create utterly obscene inequalities. Now, given that we know the negative effects of inequality on human beings and the causes of these inequalities, it should be trivial to synthesise a necessary political project: anti-capitalism.Ok, now, back to the content of the book. Robert Sapolsky—rightly so—criticizes Steven Pinker's The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined for cherry picking some of the data referring to primitive societies (p. 311-315). Mislabelling of hunter-horticulturalists (p. 321) as hunter gatherers, thus shadowing the plethora of research showing distinct ""pro-social"" behaviour of the former group. Failure to adjust for length of conflict (p. 614-620) in determining how violent historical periods were, doubly baffling given that Pinker all the while (correctly) adjusted the total victim count for overall world population size at that time—glaring oversight. Overall, a fairly positive critique, but one that leaves the reader with the impression ""it's more complicated than that"" (unlike Pinker's own conclusions). Note: the page references in this paragraph are to ""Behave"".  My own point of contention with the book, is that it omits a plethora of anthropological, and historical studies into human civilization (Lewis Mumford, E.A Gutkind, David Graeber)—while tapping into what seems to be a clichee body of work that is being passed around in the same Ivy League circles (essentially the same body of work as used by Pinker). This also leads to the author using some historically impoverished definitions of ""individualist"" and ""collectivist"" cultures—the latter being extremely poorly represented, and mostly by modern ""samples"". Mentions of ancient, medieval, and revolutionary period cities, which would be much better examples than modern ones, are woefully absent.  In short, this books is broad in its analysis of biology, but rather narrow in its analysis of society. But nonetheless, it is still an endless mine of fresh knowledge that would take forever for me to go through in this review. Luckily, the Epilogue has a nice bullet-point list (albeit it is not exhaustive of the content). Overall, Behave it deeply fascinating, and definitely worth a read! I highly recommend this book to everyone!"
58,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30276417-nancy-mills,5,"Fascinating book that begins with some rather difficult lessons in endocrinology and neuroloscience, but after the author lays that foundation, the books blooms into a dense but highly entertaining tomb about how behavior is affected by genes, hormones, environmental factors (that of course affect hormones), and then the guy actually has the nerve to go into the topic of Free Will ... and does a great job all the way. Here I am compelled to add a lengthy quote from the author, in a footnote, of course:""And the one thing I'm not going anywhere near is this New Age-y notion, ""Of course we have free will. You can't say that our behavior is determined by a mechanistic universe, because the universe is indeterminate, because of quantum mechanics."" Argh. What anyone sensible who has thought about this will point out is that (a)the consequences of subatomic indeterminacy of quantum mechanics (about which I understand zero) don't ripple upward enough to influence behavior, and (b) if they did, the result wouldn't be the freedom to will your behavior. It would be the utter randomization of behavior. In the words of philosopher/neuroscientist Sam Harris, a free will trasher, if quantum mechanics actually played a role in any of this, 'Every thought and action would seem to merit the statement ""I don't know what just came over me."""" Except you wouldn't actually be able to make that statement, since you'd just makinggarly sounds because the muscles in your tongue would be doing all sorts of random things.""Well I guess he told THEM!There is a chapter toward the back of the book entitled ""Biology, the Criminal Justice System, and Free Will,"" which will get your frontal cortex neurons twitching if anything will.Conclusions aren't cut and dry, if that's what you were hoping, but certainly will give the reader a tremendous background, if one can manage to absorb even half of the book's contents. If you're not all that into biology and long scientific words, you can get away with skimming the tough parts. I plowed through it and found it very rewarding. There are 3 Appendices, all good that you can skip if you don't want to learn about Neuroscience, Endocrinology or Protein Basics.Dr. Sapolsky is sympathetic, maybe even empathetic (the books discusses these phenomena) toward the the reader who may find the material dense, and his humor more than redeems his asking us to familiarize ourselves with all this stuff. Anterior Something Cingulate. dmELvE. vm LLpe. I don't know. A whole bunch of acronyms. Half way through the book I accidentally found out that there is a glossary in the back that defines each acronym which certainly makes things tons easier. Anyway, the author is understanding. One passage, for example, reads ""This is a bold assertion that the heuristic of dialectical materialism not only extends beyond the economic world into the naturalistic one, but is ontologically rooted in the essential sameness of both worlds' dynamic resolution of irresolvable contradictions."" Before the you throw the book across the room, the author adds this footnote: ""I have no idea what it is that I just wrote..."" He bravely plows ahead with ""It is Marx and Engels as trilobite and snail,"" and immediately footnotes again: ""Ditto."" Truthfully my main complaint is that the footnotes, which are numerous and are at times the best parts of the text, and printed in such teeny print that even with my glasses I had trouble reading them after the sun went down with my 60 watt bulb. There are, of course, about a million end notes to, which I seldom bothered with.Sapolsky, in his final chapter, delves into War and Peace (the subject, not the novel) and reveals some very interesting behaviors on the battlefield versus way back behind the lines where men in fancy uniforms make strategics decisions. And the part about drone pilots, who shoot targets thousands of miles away, nevertheless get bad cases of PTSD in spite of the fact that they are never physically putting their own lives in danger. Remarkable findings.One of the most worthwhile books I've read this year, highly recommended for people who like to read and don't mind a little mental exercise."
59,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,4,"This brick of a book purports to be an interdisciplinary explanation of human behavior, drawing from biology, psychology, and sociology, and everything from primate studies to well-known works in various fields. It’s big, at 717 pages of actual text followed by references; it’s broad; and as such it’s a little bit simplistic. Even at this size, there’s not quite room to develop all of the material. The first half or so of the book is more focused on the “hard” science, beginning with how neurons communicate with each other, and working its way up through hormones, genes, brain development through childhood and adulthood and how this is affected by trauma, and the evolution of species. The second half is more focused on psychology: us vs. them dichotomies, moral decisionmaking, the causes of violence, and whether the criminal justice system really makes sense when all human behavior is ultimately driven by biology. (Sapolsky argues no, but I’m not so sure. Where would we be as a species, or as individuals, if we all just shrugged our shoulders and gave in to ideas of biological determinism?)I certainly learned a lot from this book, which contains a ton of information presented in a way that is understandable to a non-scientist – though I struggled a bit with some of the early chapters. It provides a strong synthesis and framework for understanding information from biology and social sciences. That said, on the subjects that I did know something about, it seemed a little simplified. Fair enough; entire books have been written on subjects that comprise a single chapter here. As other reviewers have suggested, Sapolsky perhaps accepts too many psychological studies uncritically, without discussing psychology’s replication crisis, in which dozens of famous studies, when run again using the exact same methods and parameters, failed to produce the same headline-worthy results. That said, in general Sapolsky seems to take a fair approach to his material, presenting and evaluating multiple viewpoints in areas that have generated controversy. His writing is readable given the subject matter, and there’s a goofy-professor personality behind it that occasionally shines through. I wouldn’t take everything here as gospel – and I suppose we never should, since new scientific discoveries regularly require us to reevaluate what we thought was true – but the book did leave me a little more educated than I was before."

What is it with biologists and well written non-fiction that does not completely gloss over the details? The book is fairly long and appears to lack a central thesis except that ""it's complicated"". But ""Nothing seems to cause anything, instead everything just modulates everything else"" is probably closer to the truth than the endless internet debates over nature vs nurture.However even though the book is expansive, remembering to critique both sides of the debate (not even Pinker or Ramachandran are spared) while being filled with citation and humorous footnotes, I still had a few minor issues that force me to discount other things as well. Things like Wellesley effect and Freakonomics explanation of drop in crime rate in US are presented without any remarks about the contentious nature of the findings (largely believed to be false I think, but I could be wrong)."

It's probably a little too textbook-like for some readers, but for those who really want to get a good general grounding in what science in 2017 tells us about behavior, there is probably no better place to go.I particularly liked the discussions on the law and neuroscience, and a really nuanced take on role (or lack thereof) of genetics in behavioral determinism, and final chapter relating to war (and peace)."
62,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,4,"It is common these days to come across people who have developed a strong dislike for all reductionist approaches. They prefer holistic views, and are suspicious of any knowledge that has been derived through breaking up a big problem into smaller chunks. I can understand why they feel that way, but I have always felt that such feelings can only be harbored when one is unfamiliar with the depth of the subject in question, and therefore assumes a simplistic view of things. For example, I know of many people who are suspicious of normal medical science because it treats each organ as a separate functional entity, and expertise within the medical profession is divided by such narrow specializations. They prefer a medical science that looks at the big picture, which includes not just the various sub-systems, but combines the body with the mind. This is a wise and noble thought until we realize the complexity of the whole system. Once we do, the justification of breaking it up into smaller systems become obvious. All the knowledge we have about our body could not have been attained without first breaking it up into the various organs and trying to understand how they work in isolation. Once that has reached a certain level of details can we afford to put them back together and investigate the far more complex interactions between these systems. If we tried to bypass the reductionist step in the first place, we would have been stuck with vague and faulty theories of how the body works, as can be found in all ancient texts. A responsible form of holistic science cannot be rushed. In many cases we may not even be ready to take that step, and must wait till we have better understanding of the parts.Of all the systems we have investigated so far, the physical systems of materials and forces, chemical systems, astronomical systems, and biological systems – they all yielded fairly well to the scientific reductionist methodologies. However, the biggest challenge lies ahead in understanding the most complex system we have encountered so far – our mind. Huge progress has been made in this direction in the last few decades. The progress happened through advances in neuroscience, biology, computational science, evolutionary sciences, psychology etc. Problems that were beyond any convincing and demonstrable theory are regularly being converted into understandable bits of knowledge. In this environment of tremendous progress, where all the different branches seems to be converging, it is not unexpected that many specialists start to believe that they have finally figured it out. I have read many books where brilliant minds would try to prove how their specialty, be it neuroscience or evolutionary biology, can finally explain our behavior, our morality, our aesthetic sense, etc. in terms of their science alone.This book is the only one I have read that not only celebrates the great accomplishments of our reductionist approach towards understanding of how the mind works, but also exposes the severe limitations of not appreciating the complexity of all these subsystems when they work together. He systematically shows how each of the systems involved, our neuronal bran, the environment we live in, both in our mother’s womb and the environment outside, our endocrinal systems, our genes, how they all interact and influence each other is incredibly complex ways. The only way we can understand the whole thing is when we allow for these interactions. In other words, why we need to look at the whole thing holistically, while admitting that it can only be done when we understand the parts really well. It is a sobering document because it shows the challenge that lies ahead. Modelling the complexity of the whole system is so complex then we may never be able to crack it open. That is, understanding of an individual mind may remain impossible, while we get better at understanding them in aggregate.The real value of this book is not just in convincing us that full understanding of our mind cannot happen until we integrate all the pieces together, but in nudging us towards a slightly different mindset that can be applied to all complex problems. As in everything else, when we solve one problem, it only presents us with an even more complex problem. And to me, that’s what makes life worth living – that there will never be a shortage of things to ponder."
63,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17937883-avi-singh,5,"Behave is an ambitious book that seeks to explain human behavior at almost every level of abstraction - what parts of the brain lit up in the second before an action (the lizard-ish amygdala, or the primate-y frontal cortex), what sensory information obtained in the past few seconds to minutes “primed” you for it (if people are shown a random string of positive words, they tend to behave nicely in a cooperative game), what hormones were secreted in the past few hours to days (effects of testosterone, oxytocin etc.), what happened in the years before (say during adolescence or childhood), or in the prenatal period (kids show preference to flavors the mother consumed when pregnant, can hear things and show preference to stories they heard while in the womb etc., the “boy/girl” brain development, connections with sexual orientation / identity), what cultural forces in the last few hundred years shaped the behavior (for example, difference between individualistic and collectivistic cultures), and last, but not the least, how evolution in the last thousands of years influence behavior (ideas from sociobiology or evolutionary psychology - kin selection, reciprocative altruism, etc. ). The second part of the book has a slightly different format - as the author delves into specific human behavioral traits (like Us vs Them-ing, hierarchies and obedience, morals, usage of metaphors, violence, etc.), and discusses them in detail, often drawing the fundamental expounded upon in the previous chapters. The book has a entertaining myth-busting style. It will present a hypothesis (say testosterone is responsible for aggression), present experiments in favor of it (castration reduces aggression, injecting testosterone back in brings it back), and then present more experiments that poke holes in the earlier somewhat simplistic explanation (raising testosterone to 10% or 200% of original levels makes no difference as compared to raising to 100%). He also talks about the wars within academia on numerous theories/ideas - neurogenesis, mirror neurons, sociobiology, Stanford Prison Experiment findings etc., which, apart from being entertaining, also reinforce my belief that the author does not only present the theories that he “likes”. Though it’s definitely possible that he did that at certain points in the book, I think he presented the nuanced view more often than not. Sometimes, there’s an information overload, as the author presents results from 5-10 studies in a single paragraph. Also, since a lot of these tend to be psychology studies, their results have to be taken with an appropriate amount of salt. Some of the later chapters are a bit preachy (using intuition vs reason in in-group and out-group interactions, why the current justice system is stupid, how to reduce violence)- but since they are backed by fairly solid science, and logical (to me) explanations, I still enjoyed reading them. In the end, I think it’s a great book, and is peppered with humorous anecdotes, both personal and historical, which makes it easier to go through its ~800 pages. The only “limitation” of the book is its scope - I don’t really think any single book can cover all the issues that this book tackles - but a list compiled from the books referenced here would probably make a great reading list. I might do that at some point. "

Behave will turn heads and raise controversy in the field of neurobiology, something the field has come to expect from Sapolsky, but Behave will also change science writing. Gone is the jargon and hundred-watt rhetoric that repels the plebians and ill-informed. No more tented-fingered, cross-legged analysis.

It was first published in May, 2017. This is one miracle of a book. I don’t know where to start…“Someone does something lousy and selfish to you in a game, and the extent of insular and amygdaloid activation predicts how much outrage you feel and how much revenge you take.” ― Robert M. Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst Book focuses on Robert Sapolsky’s attempt to tackle seemingly impossible question. That is to look at our behavior from every possible angle: biological, psychological, physiological…and there are some historical and cultural angles thrown in to it too. We start with neurobiological angle: what happens in our brains when some specific behavior occurs, what effect do our hormones have on us, what is our genetic makeup, how are we different or even not that different from rest of the animal kingdom… This is not enough. Sapolsky continues by how environment affects us and also focuses on age-old question: are we formed more by nature or nurture? And indeed as mentioned, then we continue with psychology, history, culture…Behave is among the best nonfiction reads ever. It’s stunning, it’s big and it’s absolutely beautiful. I learned so much and it also changed the way I see some things. Here are some of my picks throughout the chapters of the book:Chapter 4: Hours to Days Before: How testosterone increases confidence and optimism and decreases fear and anxiety. Chapter 5: Days to Months Before: Enough time for Arab spring, for a discontented winter or for STDs to spread a lot during a summer of love…and also plenty of time for our brains to change…How there’s long-term LTP and LTD. And veryy long term LTP and LTD and how they work differently in different regions of our brains.“Testosterone makes people cocky, egocentric, and narcissistic.”― Robert M. Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and WorstChapter 15: Metaphors We Kill By: How Rwandan genocide came to be and how metaphors were used as a weapon. Oh the power of metaphors. I have never before realized this. During Rwandan genocide, Tutsis were described as cockroaches. And those cockroaches would steal your husband. They became something that had to be exterminated, swept away from the country. Almost 1 million people dead within 100 days.“Some translation is needed. The Rwandan genocide did not involve tanks, airplanes, dropping bombs or shelling at civilians. There were no concentration camps. No transport trains. No Zyklon-B. There was no bureaucratic banality of evil. There were hardly even many guns.” ― Robert M. Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and WorstChapters 6 & 16: Author explained PMS syndrome. He also explained how PMS syndrome has been used as a criminal defense. And this is not the only sort of crazy sounding criminal defense in the book. There’s also a lot of talk about the development of the brain in earlier chapters and whether a person is or isn’t fully aware of his actions and consequences of those actions due to it… Adolescence. Or. Dude, where is my frontal cortex as the chapter is called.What else… Sapolsky uses the analogy of a car with faulty brakes to describe antisocial human behaviour. How judges give less harsh sentences after they have had lunch! Yes you read that right, judges’ rulings’ are harsher when they are hungrier. And this also works with smells. If you’re in a place that smells bad, you more likely to judge a person or a thing in a negative manner, how there was a Christmas truce in 1914 and how in many wars since soldiers had to be threatened to go kill soldiers from the opposite side. And how opposite of love is not hate …it’s indifference. And to conclude. There is no such thing as free will.I loved this book. As you can probably tell from my review, it’s packed with loads and loads of information in a very simplified, easily understood form. Moreover, there’s a sense of humor or sarcasm in the writing and that always gets one more star from me because it’s like authors are laughing at how idiotic some of the things we do are and I really appreciate that (…we do a lot of dumb shit). Maybe the only downside to the book as I was listening to audio version were all the: “footnotes” and “i see her see i see her see i see?”. They were a bit much in spoken. All in all, a fantastic piece of literature.5/5 stars"
68,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6179509-derek-ouyang,4,"At over 700 pages, this took almost all year to finish. I can't say the journey is necessarily enjoyable -- it's incredibly dense, and Sapolsky admits in his epilogue that the two word TL;DR of his book is ""It's complicated"". But this staggering work is also incredibly rich, like a mental block of cheese that you can only sample in nibbles, and incredibly plastic, meant in the best neurological sense, like a mind actively at work laid bare. And this mind is an incredibly inspiring one. I never took one of his classes, but I think this book is a great representation of what brilliance looks like in a teacher."

I must be his perfect reader-- someone with a working knowledge of popular science, biology, neurology, and psychology-- I get his jokes. He is informative, vastly knowledgable (to put it mildly), speaks to the general reader, and light-handed with his material.I can not think of a better read for the approaching times of neurological understanding of the cause of why people do what they do, and the larger questions of blame in a criminal context. "
70,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81718362-ann,4,"After taking over two months to complete this, I am not sure what to say except 'whew'. This is the most comprehensive book I have read on human behavior. Sapolsky goes beyond the (neuro)biological factors and incorporates cultural, psychological and environmental considerations into the discussion. I wouldn't say this is a difficult read but it is a richly complex and detailed book. Sapolsky's sense of humor helps take the edge off things. By the end, the reader is fully aware of the meaning of, 'it's complicated' when attempting to explain human behavior. In essence, it is very complicated and scientists probably have just scratched the surface in their understanding.What struck me is how 'me' vs 'us' vs 'them' factors into things, even in our split second decision making. The chapters discussing the roles of hormones and neurotransmitters were quite interesting and sometimes the information surprised me. Finally, the chapter titled 'Metaphors We Kill By,' discussing symbolism and symbolic values was actually frightening. The different parts of our brain aren't adept at handling that information in a logical way and symbolic meanings can be interpreted as physical pain or rejection. Ouch and Yikes! Scary stuff. After reading all this, I do believe there is some meaning to the saying 'reality is the stories we tell ourselves' (greatly influenced by our brain's interpretation of things, along with hormonal regulation, genetics, environmental factors, childhood experiences, etc.) For anyone who isn't ready to undertake reading this, I'd recommend checking out some of Sapolsky's lectures from Stanford University on YouTube. There is some overlap between the lectures and the contents of the book. His lecturing style offers a comparable representation to his writing style. "
71,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2976142-thomas-edmund,5,"I'm going to be upfront and explain that I have a huge bias towards this book, in that I purchased it first thing after Lockdown ended (2020 hope that clarification isn't needed in the future) after 2 months of missing having a massive tome of non-fiction to read!That aside I still think this book is amazing, although extremely heavy. Sapolsky covers genetics, neurology, development, just to get STARTED on the important half of the book. I have a Master's in Psychology but my undergrad was in genetics and I struggled to keep up with the technical stuff in this book (luckily Sapolsky provides appendices with 101s for folk)So I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book to someone first diving into a piece on human nature, perhaps starting with something like Sapiens, or Ten Types of Humans. However if feeling confident or having plenty of time and cognitive energy to devote to this it should be fine.Overall the book is huge and covers so much its hard to really summarize, I loved that between the technical stuff there was the odd joke, or personal touch that always seemed brilliant. Some of the insights from this book will stick with me for life and while much of the content was heavy it was worthwhile."

The way neuroscience, endocrinology were explained. Its a more important book than most of the books you have read or will read. The scope is wide - covers almost all aspects of human behavior. It lets you learn something new in every chapter. My favorite part is when Sapolsky explains what goes in our brain when any behavior occurs.

I read this together with Steven Pinker's ""Enlightenment Now,"" and I felt that the two books complemented one another well, even though the two authors don't necessarily see eye to eye on every point. Both discuss (in somewhat different contexts) the social, cultural, and psychological evolution of the human animal. Both give reasons for cautious optimism, though both also seem to realize the potential for disaster that looms as we move forward as a species. "
75,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66276739-adam-marischuk,2,"Two books and two different ratings, but you could save a lot of time by watching the youtube videos of kids trying to not eat marshmellows and coming to your own conclusions about human nature.The first half (including the three appendices) of Behave are the more scientific chapters of the book. The appendices are worth reading if, like me, you haven't formally studied biology in a couple of decades. They are a well written and easily digested summary of neuroscience, endocrinology and proteins.The first nine chapter have an interesting organisation, even if I feel it was not well executed. The idea of tracing an action backwards in time to evaluate the causes of the action has some merit, but Professor Sapolsky fails to remain on task and hence the excessive length of the sections. In the introduction he rails against ""buckets"" or categories of answers (the distinction between biology, psychology and culture) and then follows his own holistic advice. But the resulting chapters are disjointed at best. An editor could have cut the book in half without sacrificing any of the science or the audiences' ability to understand and a little of Aristotle's four causes would have benefited both author and audience. The digressions are sometimes interesting but usually merely political marginalia from an aging ""vertebarte, mammal, ape, human, male, scientist, lefty"" (p. 405)What was particularly interesting in the first few chapters is Professor Sapolsky's ability to find middle ground in the nature/nuture debate by bridging the gap between the two and noting the maliabiliy of nature.I suppose if the book had ended after chapter nine it would have received 3-4 stars.But then Professor Sapolsky continues into what I could only call socio-psychology with a dabbing of neuroscience to back up some rather radical leftist views. His discussions on hierarchy, free will, ethics, religion and war all take the same politically inspired position and do not flow seemlessly from the science. Sometimes it is bias mascarading as science, and othertimes it simply leaves the science aside. His discussion of ethics and utilitarianism is particularly egregious, and this is coming from someone who has little sympathy for utilitarianism. The construction of straw-man arguments does little to help the cause.Professor Sapolsky attempts to reconstruct the Naked Ape (Desmond Morris) but ends up with some monster who only vaguely resembles a man. I am reminded of the G.K. Chesterton quote, ""Take away the supernatural and all that is left is the unnatural"" (Orthodoxy, p 49) His reductionist materialist approach leads him into some strange territory, where rights exist but free will doesn't. Where a complete (and admittedly impossible) revolution of the criminal justice system is necessary. The very subtitle explicitly mentions our best and worst behaviour but he develops no criteria for evaluating one or the other, prefering to rely on ""context, context, context"" (p. 672). I am inclined to buy Jonathan Haidt and Steven Pinker and never pick up another book by Sapolsky. His politics, philosophy, ethics, criminology, even theology and psychology are all so different from any human's lived experience (and the language that goes along with it) that I can only concluded with E.O. Wilson, ""Wonderful theory, wrong species.""A lot more was said a lot better about materialism by David Hume, or about free will by Nietzsche, or mind-body dualism by Descartes, consciousness by Leibniz etc.And to close, he never justified:""I won't pull any punches- I think that its [agriculture's] invention was one of the all-time human blunders"" (p. 326)"
76,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49565692-ben-torgerson,1,"A shining example of what is wrong in the world of science today - scientists who can't separate their personal prejudices and belief from research-based fact. Sapolsky cherry-picks his research to make political points. He is yet another typical liberal intellectual type (so prevalent in education today) that is unable to set aside his own political and social prejudices and present the research in an unbiased way. That is not to say he does not present some interesting research in this book, but he so damages his own credibility with his misapplications of the scientific results and cherry-picking of the science that supports his own skewed views that no reasonable person can accept any of his characterizations or conclusions at face value. What is even more amusing is his repeated condemnations of people who misapply scientific results and cherry-pick the data, all while doing this himself throughout the length of the book. A good percentage of the book is devoted to using scientific research to prove that people who disagree with his political beliefs are unintelligent, unfeeling, etc., and yet he condemns the Nazis for citing science in a similar way to turn the Germans against the Jews. This book should be regarded as nothing but pure drivel and the author should be completely discredited in the world of science."

80,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7208369-miles,5,"Books that examine the relationship between science and morality have become ubiquitous, so readers interested in these important subjects need to choose carefully. It is not an overstatement to say that one could do no better than to alight on Robert M. Sapolsky’s Behave. This engrossing, encyclopedic examination of the causal mechanisms that determine human behavior is a monumental achievement of syncretic thought.This was my first journey into Sapolsky’s singular mind, both joyful and challenging. Covering an almost inconceivably vast landscape of scientific information, this neurobiologist/primatologist takes a playful but responsible approach to some heady topics, delving deep into humanity’s best and worst behaviors while never missing an opportunity to charm the reader with his perspicacious wit. I usually don’t care for comedy in nonfiction, but Sapolsky’s wry humor rarely misses the mark, and is complemented by an impressive ability to synthesize multiple perspectives and extricate sensible conclusions from dense and sometimes-conflicting data. Sapolsky is also transparent about his own biases as a “bleeding heart liberal,” making him a truly lovable genius (and not just in the casual sense).Since it would be folly to try to cover everything this book has to offer in a review, I’ll focus on explaining Sapolsky’s methodology, and then comment on just a few of his most important findings. Sapolsky begins with a necessary critique of how scientists typically explain human behavior, which is to break it down into different “buckets of explanation,” each of which comprises a distinct realm of inquiry:""We tend to use a certain cognitive strategy when dealing with complex, multifaceted phenomena, in that we break down those separate facets into categories, into buckets of explanation…The goal of this book is to avoid such categorial thinking. Putting facts into nice cleanly demarcated buckets of explanation has its advantages––for example, it can help you remember facts better. But it can wreak havoc on your ability to think about those facts. This is because the boundaries between different categories are often arbitrary, but once some arbitrary boundary exists, we forget that it is arbitrary and get way too impressed with its importance…There are not different disciplinary buckets. Instead, each one is the end product of all the biological influences that came before it and will influence all the factors that follow it. Thus, it is impossible to conclude that a behavior is caused by a gene, a hormone, a childhood trauma, because the second you invoke one type of explanation, you are de facto invoking them all. No buckets. A 'neurobiological' or 'genetic' or 'developmental' explanation for a behavior is just shorthand, an expository convenience for temporarily approaching the whole multifactorial arc from a particular perspective."" (5-8, emphasis his)This boundary-busting approach puts Sapolsky squarely in the company of intellectual titans such as Edward O. Wilson and Steven Pinker––interdisciplinary thinkers who have, however imperfectly, combined findings from numerous academics fields to launch humanity into new realms of inquiry and debate. Sapolsky is less poetic than Wilson and less contentious than Pinker, bringing a cautious, even-handed compassion to the science of understanding human nature. As any science reader knows, it is one thing to claim that disciplinary boundaries are arbitrary and ought to be ignored, and quite a different thing to actually demonstrate how this can be done. And while I don’t think Sapolsky fully achieves his stated goal, his efforts to do so are heroic and effectual.The first half of Behave plays out like a tennis match that travels back in time, with the ball representing the focus of Sapolsky’s chapters and the net representing a (somewhat arbitrary) boundary between behavioral mechanisms that operate primarily inside or outside the human body. He begins with “One Second Before,” an explanation of the neurobiology that takes place just before behavior is enacted, then transitions to “Seconds to Minutes Before,” where he discusses immediate environmental stimuli that contribute to behavior. Next comes “Hours to Days Before,” a discussion of how hormones influence behavior, which is followed by “Days to Months Before,” where he takes up long-term neural plasticity (learning and memory).This pattern continues, with subsequent chapters addressing adolescence, early childhood development, genetics, culture, and humanity’s shared evolutionary heritage. So Sapolsky makes use of the buckets of explanation by taking up these topics one at a time (what else could he do?), but also goes to great lengths to show as many interactive areas of overlap between the different causal mechanisms as possible. This truly is a “both/and” story he is telling, with all the moving parts affecting all the other moving parts in profound and intriguing ways.The second half of Behave is more traditionally structured, and wades into dicier territory. Sapolsky tackles tricky subjects such as tribalism, moral intuition and bias, power dynamics, ethical motivation, empathy, the power of symbols to move us to action (or not), free will, criminal justice, and war. These areas of study are all rapidly evolving along with society and technology, so it’s impossible to tell how relevant Sapolsky’s assessments will be in decades to come. But all in all, this is the best and most up-to-date summary of recent findings in these fields one could hope to engage with. I probably had to read between ten and twenty other books to discover most of the insights Sapolsky distills into just a few hundred pages.All of this should be more than enough to convince science and ethics enthusiasts that Behave is essential reading. If you’re eager to run out and pick it up, just stop reading here and go for it. But if you want to stick around, I’ll give some thoughts about what I see as Sapolsky’s most important findings.Sapolsky’s most critical point by far is the importance of context in understanding human behavior. This is hardly a novel position, but Sapolsky lays out the argument for contextualization with sui generis assiduousness and clarity. Over and over he pounds the table about context, tirelessly illuminating the ways in which human behavior is sensitive to myriad influences both inside and outside the body. Most of these influences are partially or completely hidden from our conscious experience of the world, and it is only through scientific inquiry and abstraction that we come to understand their significance. Perhaps the wildest demonstration of this is the role of transcription factors in determining how a person’s genome expresses itself:""95 percent of DNA is noncoding…What is that 95 percent? Some is junk––remnants of pseudogenes inactivated by evolution. But buried in that are the keys to the kingdom, the instructional manual for when to transcribe particular genes, the on/off switches for gene transcription. A gene doesn’t 'decide' when to be photocopied into RNA, to generate its protein. Instead before the start of the stretch of DNA coding for that gene is a short stretch called a promoter––the 'on' switch. What turns the promoter switch on? Something called a transcription factor (TF) binds to the promoter…Thus transcription factors regulate genes. What regulates transcription factors? The answer devastates the concept of genetic determinism: the environment."" (226, emphasis his)Sapolsky goes on to explain that numerous factors––ones present inside cells, inside bodies, and even outside bodies––can all nudge transcription factors one way or another. This means that, while a person’s genome stays constant throughout life, gene expression (the manner in which genes code for the particular proteins that make you you) is keenly sensitive to environmental conditions and constantly in flux. Furthermore, it turns out that transcription factors are usually proteins themselves, and therefore require other transcription factors to instruct genes to code for them:""Genomes aren’t infinite; instead TFs regulate one another’s transcription, solving that pesky infinity problem. Importantly, across the species whose genomes have been sequenced, the longer the genome (i.e., roughly the more genes there are), the greater the percentage of genes coding for TFs. In other words, the more genomically complex the organism, the larger the percentage of the genome devoted to gene regulation by the environment...The human genome codes for about 1,500 different TFs, contains 4,000,000 TF-binding sites, and the average cell uses about 200,000 such sites to generate its distinctive gene-expression profile. This is boggling."" (228-9, emphasis his)Boggling indeed, but also fucking fabulous. O brave new world, that has such people in ‘t! The level of detail and complexity in the example above is indicative of every section and chapter Behave has to offer. Sapolsky doesn’t cut corners or succumb to simplistic reductionism, seeking instead to repeatedly blow the reader’s mind by showing the grand scope of what goes into decisions as simple as deciding whether to reach out to touch someone’s arm. Every step of the way, we are bombarded with caveats, clarifications, contradictions, and pitfalls of empirical limitation. It would be infuriating if it weren’t so damned fascinating! Sapolsky’s main thrust––that context is always crucial and never simple when trying to understand behavior––could not be better delivered. It also carries a hopeful undertone because many of the environmental contexts in which humans must operate are created and controlled by humans, implying that we can genuinely help people lead better lives if we learn how to fiddle the environmental dials the right way. Our power in this regard is far from limitless, but hardly insignificant (I’ll return to this at the end of the review).Behave also contains strong arguments for the elimination of poverty and abuse, especially in the lives of children. Sapolsky grinds out a glut of ghastly facts about how “childhood adversity” can compromise people later in life:""Childhood adversity increases the odds of an adult having (a) depression, anxiety, and/or substance abuse; (b) impaired cognitive capacity, particularly related to frontocortical function; (c) impaired impulse control and emotion regulation; (d) antisocial behavior, including violence; and (e) relationships that replicate the adversities of childhood (e.g., staying with an abusive partner)."" (194)He immediately follows up by pointing out that “some individuals endure miserable childhoods just fine,” and makes it clear that anything goes when looking at a particular case (194). But the trending effects of childhood adversity are undeniable and terrible. Like many other insights in Behave, this is not anything we didn’t already know; it’s the sheer volume and artful presentation of Sapolsky’s converging evidence that gives his work inimitable force. He is also not afraid to bind these findings to strong, empirically-based arguments that reject egregious income inequality and promote investment in public goods:""It’s not so much that poverty predicts poor heath; it’s poverty amid plenty––income inequality. The surest way to make someone feel poor is to rub their nose in what they don’t have…When social capital decreases (thanks to inequality), up goes psychological stress…If you want to improve health and quality of life for the average person in a society, you spend money on public goods––better public transit, safer streets, cleaner water, better public schools, universal health care…Inequality means more secession of the wealthy from contributing to the public good."" (294-5)There’s no denying that this is a kind of liberal do-gooder wishlist, tinged with Sapolsky’s political leanings. Although it leaves him open to criticism, I admire Sapolsky for linking research with certain normative outcomes when he deems it appropriate. It is a fitting strategy for this moment in time, when the notion of any truly “objective” source of information has become obsolete. The best we’ve got are people like Sapolsky, who humbly bend the knee to reason and reality even when they’d rather the universe were otherwise, and who also fight tooth and nail to be heard when reason and reality actually support their political points of view.The final aspects of Behave I want to take up are Sapolsky’s direct claims that we can and should use science to improve the chances of people acting well instead of badly, along with his implicit argument that narrative and storytelling have a huge role to play in this grand project. While science is perhaps humanity’s most powerful method for analyzing and improving environmental conditions, narrative is a timeless tool for teaching people to assume the perspectives of others and to individuate potential enemies instead of reducing them to faceless members of a reviled out-group. This comes through in Sapolsky’s recommendations for dealing with humanity’s inescapably tribal nature:""From massive, breathtaking barbarity to countless pinpricks of microaggression, Us versus Them has produced oceans of pain. Yet our generic goal is not to 'cure' us of Us/Them dichotomizing. It can’t be done…If we accept that there will always be sides, it’s a nontrivial to-do list item to always be on the side of angels. Distrust essentialism. Keep in mind that what seems like rationality is often just rationalization, playing catch-up with subterranean forces that we never suspect. Focus on the larger, shared goals. Practice perspective taking,. Individuate, individuate, individuate. Recall the historical lessons of how often the truly malignant Thems keep themselves hidden and make third parties the fall guy."" (423-4)Sapolsky doesn’t take what I see as the next logical step here, which is to assert that the easiest way people can begin checking off his anti-tribal “to-do list” is to engage with stories that open the way to novel perspectives and unfamiliar modes of moral calculus. We should draw heavily on the power of narrative to simulate social complexity and teach the lessons Sapolsky rightly identifies as essential for ethical education. He points out in a later chapter that, despite its considerable downsides, “our confusion of the literal and the metaphorical, our granting of life-threatening sanctity to the symbolic, can be used to bring about the best of our behaviors” (579). There is a momentous marriage between the arts and sciences embedded in this outlook––a marriage more sacred than any of the supposedly sacrosanct folderol that has hitherto spawned from the imaginative shit-heap of human history.Stories can teach us to think and act better, but only science can deliver the building blocks and blueprints for our better world. When wrapping up a discussion of how former enemies reach reconciliation, Sapolsky implores readers to “recognize that science can teach us how to make events like these more likely” (670). He knows it’s a game of probability; we can’t force people to be good, but we can make it systemically easier for them to make the right choice, even if we know the “rightness” of that choice will always be at least partially if not wholly circumstantial. The more we learn about the light and dark tendencies inherent in human nature and particular arenas of action, the more capable we become of incentivizing instances of good behavior and minimizing instances of bad behavior. Scrupulousness of the highest order is called for, but the project is both worthy and necessary.I’d be delighted to spin out some final words that would drive home everything that is special about this book, but I couldn’t hope to top Sapolsky himself:""If you had to boil this book down to a single phrase, it would be 'It’s complicated.' Nothing seems to cause anything; instead everything just modulates something else. Scientists keep saying, “We used to think X, but now we realize that…” Fixing one thing often messes up ten more, as the law of unintended consequences reigns. On any big, important issue it seems like 51 percent of the scientific studies conclude one thing, and 49 percent conclude the opposite. And so on. Eventually it can seem hopeless that you can actually fix something, can make things better. But we have no choice but to try. And if you are reading this, you are probably ideally suited to do so. You’ve amply proven you have intellectual tenacity. You probably also have running water, a home, adequate calories, and lows odds of festering with a bad parasitic disease. You probably don’t have to worry about Ebola virus, warlords, or being invisible in your world. And you’ve been educated. In other words, you’re one of the lucky humans. So try.""

81,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77785790-david,4,"I think of this book as an introduction to pre-crime. I believe the term that the author uses is ""neurocriminology"", but the essential unifying premise of the book is that human choices are predetermined by complex biological factors which neuroscientists are just beginning to understand in ways that will eventually allow these specialists to predict very specific criminal and antisocial behaviors before, sometimes long before, the actors consciously choose them. We inherently function as if our choices are independent, spontaneous and free. Westerners particularly tend to view ourselves as autonomous individuals. This book will shatter these notions. Most or all of our choices are made before we are consciously aware of them, and most of our choices are not really originate in the individual. Our thoughts and decisions arise from our primordial past, our education, and the biological / environmental conditions immediately preceding ""our"" decisions.The most difficult aspect of the book for me was the insufferable liberalism of the author. The book opens with a gratuitous fantasy about all the horrible things the author would do to Hitler, if given the chance. The author also avails himself of every opportunity to illustrate how racist and bigoted white people are compared to nonwhites. It's never made clear why the author harbors such biases, but it's clear that he feels both justified and righteous for doing so.The concessions which the author makes concerning human biology and behavior are all the more enlightening given his openly hard left bias. For example, Sapolsky conclusively denies that ""nurture"" is the pre-eminent factor in determining human behavior. At the same time, he also gives evidence to show that inherited, genetic traits are strongly modified by the environment, whether that be biochemical or social.Sapolsky affirms the biological reality of kin selection by citing mouse studies showing that mammals produce biochemicals enabling individuals to ""smell"" how closely related other individuals are. Mice, among others, preferentially socialize with individuals whom they sense are more closely related, all else being equal. On the other hand, mice and other animals can be trained artificially to ignore this natural bias for their kin and affiliate with non-related individuals.Similarly, the author points out that human social structures tend to be ethnocentric. Human studies show that whites have an innate, preconscious bias towards their own kind and against blacks. Nevertheless, it's possible to ""overcome"" this ""xenophobia"" with appropriate conditioning, according to the author. Sapolsky consistently recognizes the fact that humans and animals naturally desire to bond with relatives and kin, yet he regularly affirms this natural tendency is ""bad"" or ""xenophobic"".The ""fallacy of naturalism"" struck me as a profound insight into the character not only of Sapolsky, but of the leftist cultural phenomenon as a whole. Such liberals are characterized by the belief that what is natural and instinctive is often wrong and must be artificially re-engineered in order to achieve harmony. By contrast, the opposing view of many conservatives is that nature is correct, even sacrosanct. This view of nature's correctness is easily seen in Austrian Economics, for instance.Another key aspect of the liberal left versus the conservative right that I noticed in this book was the fact that liberal tendencies typically arise from people who are insulated from the exigencies of life relative to those people who are regularly exposed to hardship. Sapolsky cites studies showing, for instance, that conservative people experience nightmares more frequently and suffer from more adversity in general than their liberal counterparts.This adversity-conservatism correlation was also illustrated by a narrative describing the social transformation of a troop of baboons from an endogamous, tribal, aggressive, and patriarchal community to a relatively exogamous, passive, and female-dominant one. How did this transformation occur? It occurred in response to an unlimited supply of low-cost food: the troop settled near a garbage dump where they ate leftovers from human tourists and became ""liberalized"".The same appears to be true for primitive human society. Sapolsky devotes considerable space to the question of whether archaic hunter-gatherer and pastoral human societies were violent and aggressive or peaceful and harmonious. What he shows is that scarcity of resources provokes the former, while abundance promotes the latter. Thus, the ""noble savage"" resolves to the ""well-fed savage"" who becomes more savage and less noble he becomes more hungry.Conservatism and hunger are not only linked in the case of monkeys and tribal humans. Sapolsky notes that criminal justices statistically deliver harsher sentences when they have skipped breakfast. Combined with the observation that conservative people often have more nightmares and other adverse experiences, a theme emerges: liberalism of all kinds is the natural product of affluence and excess, while conservatism is the natural response to adversity and hardship.However, culture is not merely the expression of environmental resources over time. Behavior is embedded in the biology and genetics of the individuals forming a community. Sapolsky cites the famous Dmitry Belyayev Russian Fox study which showed that selective breeding could produce docile foxes. Sapolsky also cited a similar study showing that feral behavioral traits could be bred out of rats. These studies showed, according to Sapolsky, that behaviors which we think of a volitional and ""free"" may, in fact, be the inevitable result of genetic selection.This is a fascinating admission from a leftist author since it forms the key premise of ""A Troublesome Inheritance"" by Nicholas Wade. Wade's book is described as ""controversial"" largely because it applies the Russian Fox study (among others) to human society. Sapolsky shies away from such conclusions, yet both he and Wade agree that human behavior is heritable, just like animal behavior is. Further, both explicitly reject the absurd ""blank slate"" hypothesis of the social constructivists. Sapolsky's book can, in many ways, be seen a single, massive refutation of ""blank slate"" theory, yet in practice, Sapolsky advocates against the idea that our heritable traits are generally good. Our natural proclivity to identify and associate with kin leads, in his view, to violence, ""xenophobia"", and antisocial behavior. Thus, Sapolsky sees it as necessary for social harmony to scientifically overcome our natural tendency towards ""pseudospeciation"" based on biological factors like genes and race.Sapolsky regularly returns to the theme of ""green-beard effects"" wherein individuals in society identify and associate with individuals who share specific phenotypical traits, such as dark skin or blue eyes. Sapolsky automatically asserts that such effects are irrational, even dangerous. With this in mind, he documents various scientifically-validated techniques for replacing natural, racially-based green-beard effects with artificial ones, such as affiliation on the basis of organized sports.Conservative, ethnocentric thinkers like Wade, Pat Buchanan, and Ann Coulter observe the same green-beard and kin-selection effects but that such effects are both good and natural. In the conservative paradigm, separation of the tribe is the solution, not the problem. Both sides admit the existence of the natural tendency to form kin-based tribes, yet authors like Sapolsky generally affirm that advocacy of such nativism constitutes the dangerous logical fallacy of ""moral naturalism"".Sapolsky regularly makes jabs at moral naturalism. His main criticism is that what is perceived to be natural at one time often changes later. Thus, culture mediates our perception of what is ""natural"" and ""good"" versus what is ""unnatural"" and ""bad"". Sapolsky sees this as a an opportunity for reshaping social perceptions to accept new ""unnatural"" things as ""good"" and ""natural"", while the conservative instinct is to pass on what is perceived as natural from one generation to the next.If we accept the essential premise of Behave, then the choice to be liberal (in the sense of adoption what is unnatural and foreign) versus conservative (the preservation of the natural) is biological and subconscious rather than objective and rational. Furthermore, if we accept that the instinct to conserve kin-based groups and ostracize foreign races is dangerous and subversive, then it is easy to cast racial conservatism as a mental disorder rather than a rational decision. The same is true in reverse: if liberal tendencies are heritable, biological, and subversive rather than rational and ""free"", then liberalism is a ultimately disease. This isn't a new idea: Michael Savage, for instance, is notable for his regular insistence that liberalism is a mental disorder. In the opposite camp, it's not uncommon for liberals to insist that conservatism is the result of inbreeding, mental retardation, or childhood trauma.The ultimate end of rational dialog comes when we finally accept that people with views opposite to our own are not going to change their minds or become ""converted"" on the basis of rational argumentation and evidence. Various biological markers predispose people to adopt the views which they hold such that the conscious, rational portion of our brain constitutes a thin veneer over the primal realities of our nature.Viewing liberalism and conservatism as biological traits leads us to the ultimate question: will liberalism or conservatism ultimately wipe out the opposing trait and achieve hegemony in the human population, or at least in specific human population groups? Drawing on the above-mentioned studies, I conclude that while resources are abundant, docile, passive, and liberal traits will be dominant while virile, defensive, and conservative traits will become recessive relics of a dark, irrelevant past."
82,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7422525-scriptor-ignotus,5,"IT’S COMPLICATED “I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.”  — Sir Isaac NewtonWhy do people do what they do? Of all the sciences, that of our own behavior is often the most unsettling in its mysteriousness. Delivering a precise and comprehensive causal explanation for any form of human behavior is almost always impossible, and to attempt even a general account requires one to interface with a bewildering array of methodologies, disciplinary perspectives, spatial and temporal scales of analysis, and the necessary but overwhelmingly nuanced and complex interrelationship between all these factors. If any piece of the causal puzzle is missing—which is always the case, as biologists have not (yet) fully mapped the causal chains that produce our most unique and sophisticated behaviors—then none of the other pieces quite fit together either, leaving unanswered some of the most fundamental questions regarding who and what we are. We are enigmatic even (perhaps especially) to ourselves—as psychology and the humanities have long attested—even though self-knowledge may be the most critical necessity for the survival and flourishing of our species and its planetary habitat. Behave is an incredibly ambitious cross-disciplinary gesture towards a complete picture of the biological substrata of human behavior. As a study which attempts to account for both the profoundest depths of cruelty and sadism and the most exalted heights of compassion and benevolence characteristic of our kind, and which attempts not to override and dismiss but to affirm and buttress the full spectrum of approaches for thinking about human nature, it is the most genuinely humanistic science book I have read. Behave is organized in two main parts. The first part, composed of the first nine chapters, is likely the most thorough exposition of the multilayered biological underpinnings of human behavior ever put in print. Each chapter is framed as part of a skeletal narrative: a behavior has just occurred: what happened in the seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, years, centuries, and millennia beforehand that could help explain why it happened? Each consecutive chapter widens Sapolsky’s analytical lens. When we think about what happened one second before the behavior occurred, we’re in the realm of cellular neurobiology. Neurons in the brain are generating action potentials in response to a stimulus; these disturbances of the negative charge inside of a neuron, caused by openings in the dendritic spines which allow positively-charged ions to flow through, travel from the dendritic spines through the cell body and, if the electrical disturbance passes a certain threshold, through the axon to the axon terminals, which send neurotransmitters across synapses that connect with specialized receptors on the dendritic spines of subsequent neurons, which causes the opening of channels in the membrane for positive ions, which generates action potentials in those neurons, and so on. The collection of 100 billion neurons in each human body and their integrated axonal projections are, at the cellular level, what constitute the vast and intricate circuitry of the nervous system. The generation of collective action potentials in billions of neurons in a particular brain region is what neuroscientists refer to when they speak about the “activation” of brain regions in response to stimuli. Move the timescale back to seconds or minutes before the behavior, and we’re looking at the macro organization of the brain. At this level our behaviors are mediated through the interaction of brain regions. The ancient amygdala, the almond-shaped core of the limbic system, mediates fear, anxiety, and aggression, and is often the first brain region to activate in response to unfamiliar stimuli. People who demonstrate more implicit bias against racial out-groups show more amygdaloid activation when presented with faces of people of another race, and the amygdala shows growth and overactivity in the brains of people suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Overlaying the amygdala are the higher limbic structures, which regulate base emotions, and the cortex, which mediates most of our higher cognitive functions, such as memory, language, motor skills, facial recognition, and contextual judgment. The newest brain region, in evolutionary terms, is the prefrontal cortex (PFC): the crown jewel of executive function, the seat of strategic knowledge organization, delayed gratification, social and cultural acclimation, contextualization, and the regulation of emotionality and impulsivity. It is also the last brain region to mature in an individual lifetime, not coming fully online until around age 25—a critical fact when thinking about the brilliance and deviancy so uniquely characteristic of adolescence.The late maturation of the PFC indicates something astonishing about the evolution of the human brain. The wiring of the PFC is not significantly more complex than that of other cortical regions, nor does it consist of a different type of neuron—with a few limited exceptions. Biologically speaking, it isn’t any “harder” to develop a prefrontal cortex than it is to develop any other part of the brain, which likely means that the delayed development of the PFC was selected for by our hominid ancestors. We evolved in such a way that the makeup of the frontal cortex, because its development is delayed, is shaped by the makeup of our other brain regions, which in turn are shaped by personal experiences. By developing later, the PFC is designed to accommodate the neurological “lessons” of our own, individual lives. The genetic program of our brain development has evolved to liberate the frontal cortex from genetics. Of course, none of these brain regions are discrete entities, and none are free from the influences of hormones and environmental factors. Expanding our timescale to account for the hours to months before a behavior occurs involves reference to endocrinology, the effect of hormones on behavior via their influencing of the nervous system, and the plasticity of the brain. Here Sapolsky debunks some common misunderstandings about the role of certain hormones in behavior; namely testosterone and oxytocin. Hormones are not “instigators” of behavior; in fact, one of the overarching themes of the entire book is that there is never a single biological cause of any behavior, but rather a vast field of facilitating and inhibiting factors that influence the probability of certain behaviors to degrees that are not always quantifiable. Androgens like testosterone are facilitators of behavior. They make the amygdala more sensitive to triggers of aggression, but only among people who are already predisposed to acts of aggression. Nor is aggression the single, inevitable result of testosterone production. Testosterone levels increase not only in response to situations demanding aggression, but also in situations in which one’s social status is uncertain, changing, or perceived to be under threat. In those situations testosterone does not facilitate violence per se; it facilitates whatever behavior is necessary for one to secure status. If a society bases its status relations on, say, charitability, then testosterone won’t cause you to strangle a cheetah; it will cause you to insist on paying the tab at a restaurant. If testosterone has an unfairly negative reputation, oxytocin has an unfairly positive one. This “luv hormone” facilitates bonds between mothers and infants, bonds between humans and their canine pets, and the pair-bonding of monogamous romantic couples; but these salutary effects are relegated to in-group relations. Oxytocin increases our prosociality towards an “Us”, but it also makes us more suspicious of “Thems”. It does not facilitate free love, but rather parochialism. In the second part of the book, Sapolsky attempts to synthesize the complicated layers of knowledge laid out in the first half, and to offer some insight as to how these biological factors influence our best and worst behaviors. I can hardly do justice to the nuances of the discussions in each chapter, but they address such topics as our instinctual categorization of people into In-Groups and Out-Groups and how and why we prioritize some dimensions of “Us-ness” over others; the unique human capacity for establishing and navigating hierarchies and the physically corrosive effects of having the “wrong” status in a particular social context (Sapolsky is a Rousseauian primitivist, and considers the agricultural revolution to be the greatest blunder in human history for the role it played in establishing rigid and dramatic status hierarchies); the neurological correlates of empathy (and how it’s better if our altruism is instinctive rather than an act of willpower); how metaphorical thinking is innate to our biology (and why a society is in extremely dangerous territory if certain members of it are persuasively associated with insects or fecal matter; hyperactivity of the insular cortex, which regulates disgust responses, can make one an ethnic cleanser—or worse, a germaphobe); the question of free will and how our conception of justice should be framed accordingly (Sapolsky is a strong determinist and thinks a criminal justice system based on punishment is totally irrational); and, of course, war and peace. Why do people do what they do? Sapolsky’s short answer is: it’s really complicated. No, really, that’s his answer; that’s the conclusion he comes to at the end of this big, beautiful disaster of a book. But understanding, though difficult, is possible; and with understanding comes a spirit of mercy which could perhaps change the world."

This is one of those rare authors who can educate the reader while entertaining regarding a topic of staggering complexity. I hope this gift does indeed carry over to his classroom at Stanford in which case there will undoubtedly be a lot of inspired youth pursuing answers to the mysteries of the brain. I took considerable time to read this book as there were many opportunities to reread the passage or concept at hand and contemplate the subject in depth. There is also great reference information and appendices to help those of us needing liberal doses of assistance. As one of the greatest benefits of such books are the attributions and opportunity to read the books referenced I will add one for consideration that won't disappoint: ""The Archaeology of Mind: Neuroevolutionary Origins of Human Emotion."" by Jaak Panksepp and Lucy Biven. This is worthy of mentioning in the same review as Professor Sapolsky's masterpiece.  As with so many things in life the satisfaction is directly proportional to the effort expended and Robert Sapolsky's book, ""Behave,"" will help you better understand what chemistry and brain structures combined with environmental factors are potentially at the root of this feeling. This is not an author espousing an absolute deterministic view, but leaves room for something more that makes us human that our science has yet to discover the metrology to measure.

87,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31302406-lori,5,"I have a very quick rule of thumb to measure up books meant popularise science: if it leaves one thinking ""ow it's much more complicated than that"", then it's a good book. And I was very pleased to see the author echo—explicitly, obviously this was implicit throughout the book— much of the same sentiment in the Epilogue: If you had to boil down this book to a single phrase it would be ""it's complicated"" (p. 674)   Highly recommended to anyone trying to understand what it is to inhabit this meat suit we call a human body. Although, fair warning, you will be left with a great feeling of uncertainty afterwards; i.e. you will be made aware of your own ignorance, and most important—hopefully—you will shut up about ""human nature"" at every turn. You can also expect to have your (yes, your) simplistic notions of biological determinism shattered.  Now, a slightly more elaborate exposition than ""it's complicated"": Any meaningful analysis of the behaviour of human species deals with biology-environment interactions. One can expect to learn that: testosterone, oxytocin, mirror neurons, and pretty much any new fad protein, neurotransmitter, or brain region does not work the way you thought it did.  The negative effects of poverty, inequality, and social hierarchy in general are laid bare—or shorter SES (socio-economic status). The science is in: these societal dynamics wreak havoc on everything from IQ (p. 249) to health, to exacerbating anti-social behavior. Most fascinating is the fact that the lower you are on the wealth inequality ladder, the poorer your health. And get this, only a third of this degradation is due to actual, poorer material conditions. It is the subjective experience that matters, and the definitive knowledge and reality of having someone who's infinitely richer than you, and capable of shitting down the ladder—so to speak—on you. (p. 441 contains a nice bullet-point list of the known effects). Now, I am going to go on a tangent, to something the author did not mention, but as a filthy red I am almost obliged to do so. If we look into the work of Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century, and more importantly in Karl Marx's Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, Vol 1, we see capitalism's inevitable, structural tendency to create utterly obscene inequalities. Now, given that we know the negative effects of inequality on human beings and the causes of these inequalities, it should be trivial to synthesise a necessary political project: anti-capitalism.Ok, now, back to the content of the book. Robert Sapolsky—rightly so—criticizes Steven Pinker's The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined for cherry picking some of the data referring to primitive societies (p. 311-315). Mislabelling of hunter-horticulturalists (p. 321) as hunter gatherers, thus shadowing the plethora of research showing distinct ""pro-social"" behaviour of the former group. Failure to adjust for length of conflict (p. 614-620) in determining how violent historical periods were, doubly baffling given that Pinker all the while (correctly) adjusted the total victim count for overall world population size at that time—glaring oversight. Overall, a fairly positive critique, but one that leaves the reader with the impression ""it's more complicated than that"" (unlike Pinker's own conclusions). Note: the page references in this paragraph are to ""Behave"".  My own point of contention with the book, is that it omits a plethora of anthropological, and historical studies into human civilization (Lewis Mumford, E.A Gutkind, David Graeber)—while tapping into what seems to be a clichee body of work that is being passed around in the same Ivy League circles (essentially the same body of work as used by Pinker). This also leads to the author using some historically impoverished definitions of ""individualist"" and ""collectivist"" cultures—the latter being extremely poorly represented, and mostly by modern ""samples"". Mentions of ancient, medieval, and revolutionary period cities, which would be much better examples than modern ones, are woefully absent.  In short, this books is broad in its analysis of biology, but rather narrow in its analysis of society. But nonetheless, it is still an endless mine of fresh knowledge that would take forever for me to go through in this review. Luckily, the Epilogue has a nice bullet-point list (albeit it is not exhaustive of the content). Overall, Behave it deeply fascinating, and definitely worth a read! I highly recommend this book to everyone!"
88,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30276417-nancy-mills,5,"Fascinating book that begins with some rather difficult lessons in endocrinology and neuroloscience, but after the author lays that foundation, the books blooms into a dense but highly entertaining tomb about how behavior is affected by genes, hormones, environmental factors (that of course affect hormones), and then the guy actually has the nerve to go into the topic of Free Will ... and does a great job all the way. Here I am compelled to add a lengthy quote from the author, in a footnote, of course:""And the one thing I'm not going anywhere near is this New Age-y notion, ""Of course we have free will. You can't say that our behavior is determined by a mechanistic universe, because the universe is indeterminate, because of quantum mechanics."" Argh. What anyone sensible who has thought about this will point out is that (a)the consequences of subatomic indeterminacy of quantum mechanics (about which I understand zero) don't ripple upward enough to influence behavior, and (b) if they did, the result wouldn't be the freedom to will your behavior. It would be the utter randomization of behavior. In the words of philosopher/neuroscientist Sam Harris, a free will trasher, if quantum mechanics actually played a role in any of this, 'Every thought and action would seem to merit the statement ""I don't know what just came over me."""" Except you wouldn't actually be able to make that statement, since you'd just makinggarly sounds because the muscles in your tongue would be doing all sorts of random things.""Well I guess he told THEM!There is a chapter toward the back of the book entitled ""Biology, the Criminal Justice System, and Free Will,"" which will get your frontal cortex neurons twitching if anything will.Conclusions aren't cut and dry, if that's what you were hoping, but certainly will give the reader a tremendous background, if one can manage to absorb even half of the book's contents. If you're not all that into biology and long scientific words, you can get away with skimming the tough parts. I plowed through it and found it very rewarding. There are 3 Appendices, all good that you can skip if you don't want to learn about Neuroscience, Endocrinology or Protein Basics.Dr. Sapolsky is sympathetic, maybe even empathetic (the books discusses these phenomena) toward the the reader who may find the material dense, and his humor more than redeems his asking us to familiarize ourselves with all this stuff. Anterior Something Cingulate. dmELvE. vm LLpe. I don't know. A whole bunch of acronyms. Half way through the book I accidentally found out that there is a glossary in the back that defines each acronym which certainly makes things tons easier. Anyway, the author is understanding. One passage, for example, reads ""This is a bold assertion that the heuristic of dialectical materialism not only extends beyond the economic world into the naturalistic one, but is ontologically rooted in the essential sameness of both worlds' dynamic resolution of irresolvable contradictions."" Before the you throw the book across the room, the author adds this footnote: ""I have no idea what it is that I just wrote..."" He bravely plows ahead with ""It is Marx and Engels as trilobite and snail,"" and immediately footnotes again: ""Ditto."" Truthfully my main complaint is that the footnotes, which are numerous and are at times the best parts of the text, and printed in such teeny print that even with my glasses I had trouble reading them after the sun went down with my 60 watt bulb. There are, of course, about a million end notes to, which I seldom bothered with.Sapolsky, in his final chapter, delves into War and Peace (the subject, not the novel) and reveals some very interesting behaviors on the battlefield versus way back behind the lines where men in fancy uniforms make strategics decisions. And the part about drone pilots, who shoot targets thousands of miles away, nevertheless get bad cases of PTSD in spite of the fact that they are never physically putting their own lives in danger. Remarkable findings.One of the most worthwhile books I've read this year, highly recommended for people who like to read and don't mind a little mental exercise."
89,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,4,"This brick of a book purports to be an interdisciplinary explanation of human behavior, drawing from biology, psychology, and sociology, and everything from primate studies to well-known works in various fields. It’s big, at 717 pages of actual text followed by references; it’s broad; and as such it’s a little bit simplistic. Even at this size, there’s not quite room to develop all of the material. The first half or so of the book is more focused on the “hard” science, beginning with how neurons communicate with each other, and working its way up through hormones, genes, brain development through childhood and adulthood and how this is affected by trauma, and the evolution of species. The second half is more focused on psychology: us vs. them dichotomies, moral decisionmaking, the causes of violence, and whether the criminal justice system really makes sense when all human behavior is ultimately driven by biology. (Sapolsky argues no, but I’m not so sure. Where would we be as a species, or as individuals, if we all just shrugged our shoulders and gave in to ideas of biological determinism?)I certainly learned a lot from this book, which contains a ton of information presented in a way that is understandable to a non-scientist – though I struggled a bit with some of the early chapters. It provides a strong synthesis and framework for understanding information from biology and social sciences. That said, on the subjects that I did know something about, it seemed a little simplified. Fair enough; entire books have been written on subjects that comprise a single chapter here. As other reviewers have suggested, Sapolsky perhaps accepts too many psychological studies uncritically, without discussing psychology’s replication crisis, in which dozens of famous studies, when run again using the exact same methods and parameters, failed to produce the same headline-worthy results. That said, in general Sapolsky seems to take a fair approach to his material, presenting and evaluating multiple viewpoints in areas that have generated controversy. His writing is readable given the subject matter, and there’s a goofy-professor personality behind it that occasionally shines through. I wouldn’t take everything here as gospel – and I suppose we never should, since new scientific discoveries regularly require us to reevaluate what we thought was true – but the book did leave me a little more educated than I was before."

What is it with biologists and well written non-fiction that does not completely gloss over the details? The book is fairly long and appears to lack a central thesis except that ""it's complicated"". But ""Nothing seems to cause anything, instead everything just modulates everything else"" is probably closer to the truth than the endless internet debates over nature vs nurture.However even though the book is expansive, remembering to critique both sides of the debate (not even Pinker or Ramachandran are spared) while being filled with citation and humorous footnotes, I still had a few minor issues that force me to discount other things as well. Things like Wellesley effect and Freakonomics explanation of drop in crime rate in US are presented without any remarks about the contentious nature of the findings (largely believed to be false I think, but I could be wrong)."

It's probably a little too textbook-like for some readers, but for those who really want to get a good general grounding in what science in 2017 tells us about behavior, there is probably no better place to go.I particularly liked the discussions on the law and neuroscience, and a really nuanced take on role (or lack thereof) of genetics in behavioral determinism, and final chapter relating to war (and peace)."
92,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,4,"It is common these days to come across people who have developed a strong dislike for all reductionist approaches. They prefer holistic views, and are suspicious of any knowledge that has been derived through breaking up a big problem into smaller chunks. I can understand why they feel that way, but I have always felt that such feelings can only be harbored when one is unfamiliar with the depth of the subject in question, and therefore assumes a simplistic view of things. For example, I know of many people who are suspicious of normal medical science because it treats each organ as a separate functional entity, and expertise within the medical profession is divided by such narrow specializations. They prefer a medical science that looks at the big picture, which includes not just the various sub-systems, but combines the body with the mind. This is a wise and noble thought until we realize the complexity of the whole system. Once we do, the justification of breaking it up into smaller systems become obvious. All the knowledge we have about our body could not have been attained without first breaking it up into the various organs and trying to understand how they work in isolation. Once that has reached a certain level of details can we afford to put them back together and investigate the far more complex interactions between these systems. If we tried to bypass the reductionist step in the first place, we would have been stuck with vague and faulty theories of how the body works, as can be found in all ancient texts. A responsible form of holistic science cannot be rushed. In many cases we may not even be ready to take that step, and must wait till we have better understanding of the parts.Of all the systems we have investigated so far, the physical systems of materials and forces, chemical systems, astronomical systems, and biological systems – they all yielded fairly well to the scientific reductionist methodologies. However, the biggest challenge lies ahead in understanding the most complex system we have encountered so far – our mind. Huge progress has been made in this direction in the last few decades. The progress happened through advances in neuroscience, biology, computational science, evolutionary sciences, psychology etc. Problems that were beyond any convincing and demonstrable theory are regularly being converted into understandable bits of knowledge. In this environment of tremendous progress, where all the different branches seems to be converging, it is not unexpected that many specialists start to believe that they have finally figured it out. I have read many books where brilliant minds would try to prove how their specialty, be it neuroscience or evolutionary biology, can finally explain our behavior, our morality, our aesthetic sense, etc. in terms of their science alone.This book is the only one I have read that not only celebrates the great accomplishments of our reductionist approach towards understanding of how the mind works, but also exposes the severe limitations of not appreciating the complexity of all these subsystems when they work together. He systematically shows how each of the systems involved, our neuronal bran, the environment we live in, both in our mother’s womb and the environment outside, our endocrinal systems, our genes, how they all interact and influence each other is incredibly complex ways. The only way we can understand the whole thing is when we allow for these interactions. In other words, why we need to look at the whole thing holistically, while admitting that it can only be done when we understand the parts really well. It is a sobering document because it shows the challenge that lies ahead. Modelling the complexity of the whole system is so complex then we may never be able to crack it open. That is, understanding of an individual mind may remain impossible, while we get better at understanding them in aggregate.The real value of this book is not just in convincing us that full understanding of our mind cannot happen until we integrate all the pieces together, but in nudging us towards a slightly different mindset that can be applied to all complex problems. As in everything else, when we solve one problem, it only presents us with an even more complex problem. And to me, that’s what makes life worth living – that there will never be a shortage of things to ponder."
93,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17937883-avi-singh,5,"Behave is an ambitious book that seeks to explain human behavior at almost every level of abstraction - what parts of the brain lit up in the second before an action (the lizard-ish amygdala, or the primate-y frontal cortex), what sensory information obtained in the past few seconds to minutes “primed” you for it (if people are shown a random string of positive words, they tend to behave nicely in a cooperative game), what hormones were secreted in the past few hours to days (effects of testosterone, oxytocin etc.), what happened in the years before (say during adolescence or childhood), or in the prenatal period (kids show preference to flavors the mother consumed when pregnant, can hear things and show preference to stories they heard while in the womb etc., the “boy/girl” brain development, connections with sexual orientation / identity), what cultural forces in the last few hundred years shaped the behavior (for example, difference between individualistic and collectivistic cultures), and last, but not the least, how evolution in the last thousands of years influence behavior (ideas from sociobiology or evolutionary psychology - kin selection, reciprocative altruism, etc. ). The second part of the book has a slightly different format - as the author delves into specific human behavioral traits (like Us vs Them-ing, hierarchies and obedience, morals, usage of metaphors, violence, etc.), and discusses them in detail, often drawing the fundamental expounded upon in the previous chapters. The book has a entertaining myth-busting style. It will present a hypothesis (say testosterone is responsible for aggression), present experiments in favor of it (castration reduces aggression, injecting testosterone back in brings it back), and then present more experiments that poke holes in the earlier somewhat simplistic explanation (raising testosterone to 10% or 200% of original levels makes no difference as compared to raising to 100%). He also talks about the wars within academia on numerous theories/ideas - neurogenesis, mirror neurons, sociobiology, Stanford Prison Experiment findings etc., which, apart from being entertaining, also reinforce my belief that the author does not only present the theories that he “likes”. Though it’s definitely possible that he did that at certain points in the book, I think he presented the nuanced view more often than not. Sometimes, there’s an information overload, as the author presents results from 5-10 studies in a single paragraph. Also, since a lot of these tend to be psychology studies, their results have to be taken with an appropriate amount of salt. Some of the later chapters are a bit preachy (using intuition vs reason in in-group and out-group interactions, why the current justice system is stupid, how to reduce violence)- but since they are backed by fairly solid science, and logical (to me) explanations, I still enjoyed reading them. In the end, I think it’s a great book, and is peppered with humorous anecdotes, both personal and historical, which makes it easier to go through its ~800 pages. The only “limitation” of the book is its scope - I don’t really think any single book can cover all the issues that this book tackles - but a list compiled from the books referenced here would probably make a great reading list. I might do that at some point. "

For anyone else, that would be enough. For Sapolsky, it's just the start. Behave is entrancing, accessible, and infused with a spirited likability that you just can't help but enjoy. Behave will turn heads and raise controversy in the field of neurobiology, something the field has come to expect from Sapolsky, but Behave will also change science writing. Gone is the jargon and hundred-watt rhetoric that repels the plebians and ill-informed. No more tented-fingered, cross-legged analysis.

It was first published in May, 2017. This is one miracle of a book. I don’t know where to start…“Someone does something lousy and selfish to you in a game, and the extent of insular and amygdaloid activation predicts how much outrage you feel and how much revenge you take.” ― Robert M. Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst Book focuses on Robert Sapolsky’s attempt to tackle seemingly impossible question. That is to look at our behavior from every possible angle: biological, psychological, physiological…and there are some historical and cultural angles thrown in to it too. We start with neurobiological angle: what happens in our brains when some specific behavior occurs, what effect do our hormones have on us, what is our genetic makeup, how are we different or even not that different from rest of the animal kingdom… This is not enough. Sapolsky continues by how environment affects us and also focuses on age-old question: are we formed more by nature or nurture? And indeed as mentioned, then we continue with psychology, history, culture…Behave is among the best nonfiction reads ever. It’s stunning, it’s big and it’s absolutely beautiful. I learned so much and it also changed the way I see some things. Here are some of my picks throughout the chapters of the book:Chapter 4: Hours to Days Before: How testosterone increases confidence and optimism and decreases fear and anxiety. Chapter 5: Days to Months Before: Enough time for Arab spring, for a discontented winter or for STDs to spread a lot during a summer of love…and also plenty of time for our brains to change…How there’s long-term LTP and LTD. And veryy long term LTP and LTD and how they work differently in different regions of our brains.“Testosterone makes people cocky, egocentric, and narcissistic.”― Robert M. Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and WorstChapter 15: Metaphors We Kill By: How Rwandan genocide came to be and how metaphors were used as a weapon. Oh the power of metaphors. I have never before realized this. During Rwandan genocide, Tutsis were described as cockroaches. And those cockroaches would steal your husband. They became something that had to be exterminated, swept away from the country. Almost 1 million people dead within 100 days.“Some translation is needed. The Rwandan genocide did not involve tanks, airplanes, dropping bombs or shelling at civilians. There were no concentration camps. No transport trains. No Zyklon-B. There was no bureaucratic banality of evil. There were hardly even many guns.” ― Robert M. Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and WorstChapters 6 & 16: Author explained PMS syndrome. He also explained how PMS syndrome has been used as a criminal defense. And this is not the only sort of crazy sounding criminal defense in the book. There’s also a lot of talk about the development of the brain in earlier chapters and whether a person is or isn’t fully aware of his actions and consequences of those actions due to it… Adolescence. Or. Dude, where is my frontal cortex as the chapter is called.What else… Sapolsky uses the analogy of a car with faulty brakes to describe antisocial human behaviour. How judges give less harsh sentences after they have had lunch! Yes you read that right, judges’ rulings’ are harsher when they are hungrier. And this also works with smells. If you’re in a place that smells bad, you more likely to judge a person or a thing in a negative manner, how there was a Christmas truce in 1914 and how in many wars since soldiers had to be threatened to go kill soldiers from the opposite side. And how opposite of love is not hate …it’s indifference. And to conclude. There is no such thing as free will.I loved this book. As you can probably tell from my review, it’s packed with loads and loads of information in a very simplified, easily understood form. Moreover, there’s a sense of humor or sarcasm in the writing and that always gets one more star from me because it’s like authors are laughing at how idiotic some of the things we do are and I really appreciate that (…we do a lot of dumb shit). Maybe the only downside to the book as I was listening to audio version were all the: “footnotes” and “i see her see i see her see i see?”. They were a bit much in spoken. All in all, a fantastic piece of literature.5/5 stars"
98,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6179509-derek-ouyang,4,"At over 700 pages, this took almost all year to finish. I can't say the journey is necessarily enjoyable -- it's incredibly dense, and Sapolsky admits in his epilogue that the two word TL;DR of his book is ""It's complicated"". But this staggering work is also incredibly rich, like a mental block of cheese that you can only sample in nibbles, and incredibly plastic, meant in the best neurological sense, like a mind actively at work laid bare. And this mind is an incredibly inspiring one. I never took one of his classes, but I think this book is a great representation of what brilliance looks like in a teacher."
99,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27833247-ann-labar,5,"I love all things Robert M Sapolsky. He's a card. He makes me laugh. I must be his perfect reader-- someone with a working knowledge of popular science, biology, neurology, and psychology-- I get his jokes. He is informative, vastly knowledgable (to put it mildly), speaks to the general reader, and light-handed with his material.I can not think of a better read for the approaching times of neurological understanding of the cause of why people do what they do, and the larger questions of blame in a criminal context. "
100,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81718362-ann,4,"After taking over two months to complete this, I am not sure what to say except 'whew'. This is the most comprehensive book I have read on human behavior. Sapolsky goes beyond the (neuro)biological factors and incorporates cultural, psychological and environmental considerations into the discussion. I wouldn't say this is a difficult read but it is a richly complex and detailed book. Sapolsky's sense of humor helps take the edge off things. By the end, the reader is fully aware of the meaning of, 'it's complicated' when attempting to explain human behavior. In essence, it is very complicated and scientists probably have just scratched the surface in their understanding.What struck me is how 'me' vs 'us' vs 'them' factors into things, even in our split second decision making. The chapters discussing the roles of hormones and neurotransmitters were quite interesting and sometimes the information surprised me. Finally, the chapter titled 'Metaphors We Kill By,' discussing symbolism and symbolic values was actually frightening. The different parts of our brain aren't adept at handling that information in a logical way and symbolic meanings can be interpreted as physical pain or rejection. Ouch and Yikes! Scary stuff. After reading all this, I do believe there is some meaning to the saying 'reality is the stories we tell ourselves' (greatly influenced by our brain's interpretation of things, along with hormonal regulation, genetics, environmental factors, childhood experiences, etc.) For anyone who isn't ready to undertake reading this, I'd recommend checking out some of Sapolsky's lectures from Stanford University on YouTube. There is some overlap between the lectures and the contents of the book. His lecturing style offers a comparable representation to his writing style. "
101,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2976142-thomas-edmund,5,"I'm going to be upfront and explain that I have a huge bias towards this book, in that I purchased it first thing after Lockdown ended (2020 hope that clarification isn't needed in the future) after 2 months of missing having a massive tome of non-fiction to read!That aside I still think this book is amazing, although extremely heavy. Sapolsky covers genetics, neurology, development, just to get STARTED on the important half of the book. I have a Master's in Psychology but my undergrad was in genetics and I struggled to keep up with the technical stuff in this book (luckily Sapolsky provides appendices with 101s for folk)So I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book to someone first diving into a piece on human nature, perhaps starting with something like Sapiens, or Ten Types of Humans. However if feeling confident or having plenty of time and cognitive energy to devote to this it should be fine.Overall the book is huge and covers so much its hard to really summarize, I loved that between the technical stuff there was the odd joke, or personal touch that always seemed brilliant. Some of the insights from this book will stick with me for life and while much of the content was heavy it was worthwhile."

The way neuroscience, endocrinology were explained. Its a more important book than most of the books you have read or will read. The scope is wide - covers almost all aspects of human behavior. It lets you learn something new in every chapter. My favorite part is when Sapolsky explains what goes in our brain when any behavior occurs. I wanted reasons to explain my own irrationalities and then blame it on neurotransmitters, hormones and gene-environment conditions. But it's not black and white. It's complex. It's beautiful."

I read this together with Steven Pinker's ""Enlightenment Now,"" and I felt that the two books complemented one another well, even though the two authors don't necessarily see eye to eye on every point. Both discuss (in somewhat different contexts) the social, cultural, and psychological evolution of the human animal. Both give reasons for cautious optimism, though both also seem to realize the potential for disaster that looms as we move forward as a species. "
105,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66276739-adam-marischuk,2,"Two books and two different ratings, but you could save a lot of time by watching the youtube videos of kids trying to not eat marshmellows and coming to your own conclusions about human nature.The first half (including the three appendices) of Behave are the more scientific chapters of the book. The appendices are worth reading if, like me, you haven't formally studied biology in a couple of decades. They are a well written and easily digested summary of neuroscience, endocrinology and proteins.The first nine chapter have an interesting organisation, even if I feel it was not well executed. The idea of tracing an action backwards in time to evaluate the causes of the action has some merit, but Professor Sapolsky fails to remain on task and hence the excessive length of the sections. In the introduction he rails against ""buckets"" or categories of answers (the distinction between biology, psychology and culture) and then follows his own holistic advice. But the resulting chapters are disjointed at best. An editor could have cut the book in half without sacrificing any of the science or the audiences' ability to understand and a little of Aristotle's four causes would have benefited both author and audience. The digressions are sometimes interesting but usually merely political marginalia from an aging ""vertebarte, mammal, ape, human, male, scientist, lefty"" (p. 405)What was particularly interesting in the first few chapters is Professor Sapolsky's ability to find middle ground in the nature/nuture debate by bridging the gap between the two and noting the maliabiliy of nature.I suppose if the book had ended after chapter nine it would have received 3-4 stars.But then Professor Sapolsky continues into what I could only call socio-psychology with a dabbing of neuroscience to back up some rather radical leftist views. His discussions on hierarchy, free will, ethics, religion and war all take the same politically inspired position and do not flow seemlessly from the science. Sometimes it is bias mascarading as science, and othertimes it simply leaves the science aside. His discussion of ethics and utilitarianism is particularly egregious, and this is coming from someone who has little sympathy for utilitarianism. The construction of straw-man arguments does little to help the cause.Professor Sapolsky attempts to reconstruct the Naked Ape (Desmond Morris) but ends up with some monster who only vaguely resembles a man. I am reminded of the G.K. Chesterton quote, ""Take away the supernatural and all that is left is the unnatural"" (Orthodoxy, p 49) His reductionist materialist approach leads him into some strange territory, where rights exist but free will doesn't. Where a complete (and admittedly impossible) revolution of the criminal justice system is necessary. The very subtitle explicitly mentions our best and worst behaviour but he develops no criteria for evaluating one or the other, prefering to rely on ""context, context, context"" (p. 672). I am inclined to buy Jonathan Haidt and Steven Pinker and never pick up another book by Sapolsky. His politics, philosophy, ethics, criminology, even theology and psychology are all so different from any human's lived experience (and the language that goes along with it) that I can only concluded with E.O. Wilson, ""Wonderful theory, wrong species.""A lot more was said a lot better about materialism by David Hume, or about free will by Nietzsche, or mind-body dualism by Descartes, consciousness by Leibniz etc.And to close, he never justified:""I won't pull any punches- I think that its [agriculture's] invention was one of the all-time human blunders"" (p. 326)"
106,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49565692-ben-torgerson,1,"A shining example of what is wrong in the world of science today - scientists who can't separate their personal prejudices and belief from research-based fact. Sapolsky cherry-picks his research to make political points. He is yet another typical liberal intellectual type (so prevalent in education today) that is unable to set aside his own political and social prejudices and present the research in an unbiased way. That is not to say he does not present some interesting research in this book, but he so damages his own credibility with his misapplications of the scientific results and cherry-picking of the science that supports his own skewed views that no reasonable person can accept any of his characterizations or conclusions at face value. What is even more amusing is his repeated condemnations of people who misapply scientific results and cherry-pick the data, all while doing this himself throughout the length of the book. A good percentage of the book is devoted to using scientific research to prove that people who disagree with his political beliefs are unintelligent, unfeeling, etc., and yet he condemns the Nazis for citing science in a similar way to turn the Germans against the Jews. This book should be regarded as nothing but pure drivel and the author should be completely discredited in the world of science."

Thanks to modern science, variations in human behavior are precisely traceable to various chemical, neurological and biological processes. This book names and catalogs all, and I mean all, of the processes and mechanisms currently known to be ""behind"" human behavior (90% of which reduce to processes in the brain, by the way, at least as portrayed in this book). Sure, there are some interesting twists and quirks, but ultimately for me this book is merely naming things we knew had to be there in the first place. The fact that these things have been named and measured in the lab don't make them any more interesting. "

110,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7208369-miles,5,"Books that examine the relationship between science and morality have become ubiquitous, so readers interested in these important subjects need to choose carefully. It is not an overstatement to say that one could do no better than to alight on Robert M. Sapolsky’s Behave. This engrossing, encyclopedic examination of the causal mechanisms that determine human behavior is a monumental achievement of syncretic thought.This was my first journey into Sapolsky’s singular mind, both joyful and challenging. Covering an almost inconceivably vast landscape of scientific information, this neurobiologist/primatologist takes a playful but responsible approach to some heady topics, delving deep into humanity’s best and worst behaviors while never missing an opportunity to charm the reader with his perspicacious wit. I usually don’t care for comedy in nonfiction, but Sapolsky’s wry humor rarely misses the mark, and is complemented by an impressive ability to synthesize multiple perspectives and extricate sensible conclusions from dense and sometimes-conflicting data. Sapolsky is also transparent about his own biases as a “bleeding heart liberal,” making him a truly lovable genius (and not just in the casual sense).Since it would be folly to try to cover everything this book has to offer in a review, I’ll focus on explaining Sapolsky’s methodology, and then comment on just a few of his most important findings. Sapolsky begins with a necessary critique of how scientists typically explain human behavior, which is to break it down into different “buckets of explanation,” each of which comprises a distinct realm of inquiry:""We tend to use a certain cognitive strategy when dealing with complex, multifaceted phenomena, in that we break down those separate facets into categories, into buckets of explanation…The goal of this book is to avoid such categorial thinking. Putting facts into nice cleanly demarcated buckets of explanation has its advantages––for example, it can help you remember facts better. But it can wreak havoc on your ability to think about those facts. This is because the boundaries between different categories are often arbitrary, but once some arbitrary boundary exists, we forget that it is arbitrary and get way too impressed with its importance…There are not different disciplinary buckets. Instead, each one is the end product of all the biological influences that came before it and will influence all the factors that follow it. Thus, it is impossible to conclude that a behavior is caused by a gene, a hormone, a childhood trauma, because the second you invoke one type of explanation, you are de facto invoking them all. No buckets. A 'neurobiological' or 'genetic' or 'developmental' explanation for a behavior is just shorthand, an expository convenience for temporarily approaching the whole multifactorial arc from a particular perspective."" (5-8, emphasis his)This boundary-busting approach puts Sapolsky squarely in the company of intellectual titans such as Edward O. Wilson and Steven Pinker––interdisciplinary thinkers who have, however imperfectly, combined findings from numerous academics fields to launch humanity into new realms of inquiry and debate. Sapolsky is less poetic than Wilson and less contentious than Pinker, bringing a cautious, even-handed compassion to the science of understanding human nature. As any science reader knows, it is one thing to claim that disciplinary boundaries are arbitrary and ought to be ignored, and quite a different thing to actually demonstrate how this can be done. And while I don’t think Sapolsky fully achieves his stated goal, his efforts to do so are heroic and effectual.The first half of Behave plays out like a tennis match that travels back in time, with the ball representing the focus of Sapolsky’s chapters and the net representing a (somewhat arbitrary) boundary between behavioral mechanisms that operate primarily inside or outside the human body. He begins with “One Second Before,” an explanation of the neurobiology that takes place just before behavior is enacted, then transitions to “Seconds to Minutes Before,” where he discusses immediate environmental stimuli that contribute to behavior. Next comes “Hours to Days Before,” a discussion of how hormones influence behavior, which is followed by “Days to Months Before,” where he takes up long-term neural plasticity (learning and memory).This pattern continues, with subsequent chapters addressing adolescence, early childhood development, genetics, culture, and humanity’s shared evolutionary heritage. So Sapolsky makes use of the buckets of explanation by taking up these topics one at a time (what else could he do?), but also goes to great lengths to show as many interactive areas of overlap between the different causal mechanisms as possible. This truly is a “both/and” story he is telling, with all the moving parts affecting all the other moving parts in profound and intriguing ways.The second half of Behave is more traditionally structured, and wades into dicier territory. Sapolsky tackles tricky subjects such as tribalism, moral intuition and bias, power dynamics, ethical motivation, empathy, the power of symbols to move us to action (or not), free will, criminal justice, and war. These areas of study are all rapidly evolving along with society and technology, so it’s impossible to tell how relevant Sapolsky’s assessments will be in decades to come. But all in all, this is the best and most up-to-date summary of recent findings in these fields one could hope to engage with. I probably had to read between ten and twenty other books to discover most of the insights Sapolsky distills into just a few hundred pages.All of this should be more than enough to convince science and ethics enthusiasts that Behave is essential reading. If you’re eager to run out and pick it up, just stop reading here and go for it. But if you want to stick around, I’ll give some thoughts about what I see as Sapolsky’s most important findings.Sapolsky’s most critical point by far is the importance of context in understanding human behavior. This is hardly a novel position, but Sapolsky lays out the argument for contextualization with sui generis assiduousness and clarity. Over and over he pounds the table about context, tirelessly illuminating the ways in which human behavior is sensitive to myriad influences both inside and outside the body. Most of these influences are partially or completely hidden from our conscious experience of the world, and it is only through scientific inquiry and abstraction that we come to understand their significance. Perhaps the wildest demonstration of this is the role of transcription factors in determining how a person’s genome expresses itself:""95 percent of DNA is noncoding…What is that 95 percent? Some is junk––remnants of pseudogenes inactivated by evolution. But buried in that are the keys to the kingdom, the instructional manual for when to transcribe particular genes, the on/off switches for gene transcription. A gene doesn’t 'decide' when to be photocopied into RNA, to generate its protein. Instead before the start of the stretch of DNA coding for that gene is a short stretch called a promoter––the 'on' switch. What turns the promoter switch on? Something called a transcription factor (TF) binds to the promoter…Thus transcription factors regulate genes. What regulates transcription factors? The answer devastates the concept of genetic determinism: the environment."" (226, emphasis his)Sapolsky goes on to explain that numerous factors––ones present inside cells, inside bodies, and even outside bodies––can all nudge transcription factors one way or another. This means that, while a person’s genome stays constant throughout life, gene expression (the manner in which genes code for the particular proteins that make you you) is keenly sensitive to environmental conditions and constantly in flux. Furthermore, it turns out that transcription factors are usually proteins themselves, and therefore require other transcription factors to instruct genes to code for them:""Genomes aren’t infinite; instead TFs regulate one another’s transcription, solving that pesky infinity problem. Importantly, across the species whose genomes have been sequenced, the longer the genome (i.e., roughly the more genes there are), the greater the percentage of genes coding for TFs. In other words, the more genomically complex the organism, the larger the percentage of the genome devoted to gene regulation by the environment...The human genome codes for about 1,500 different TFs, contains 4,000,000 TF-binding sites, and the average cell uses about 200,000 such sites to generate its distinctive gene-expression profile. This is boggling."" (228-9, emphasis his)Boggling indeed, but also fucking fabulous. O brave new world, that has such people in ‘t! The level of detail and complexity in the example above is indicative of every section and chapter Behave has to offer. Sapolsky doesn’t cut corners or succumb to simplistic reductionism, seeking instead to repeatedly blow the reader’s mind by showing the grand scope of what goes into decisions as simple as deciding whether to reach out to touch someone’s arm. Every step of the way, we are bombarded with caveats, clarifications, contradictions, and pitfalls of empirical limitation. It would be infuriating if it weren’t so damned fascinating! Sapolsky’s main thrust––that context is always crucial and never simple when trying to understand behavior––could not be better delivered. It also carries a hopeful undertone because many of the environmental contexts in which humans must operate are created and controlled by humans, implying that we can genuinely help people lead better lives if we learn how to fiddle the environmental dials the right way. Our power in this regard is far from limitless, but hardly insignificant (I’ll return to this at the end of the review).Behave also contains strong arguments for the elimination of poverty and abuse, especially in the lives of children. Sapolsky grinds out a glut of ghastly facts about how “childhood adversity” can compromise people later in life:""Childhood adversity increases the odds of an adult having (a) depression, anxiety, and/or substance abuse; (b) impaired cognitive capacity, particularly related to frontocortical function; (c) impaired impulse control and emotion regulation; (d) antisocial behavior, including violence; and (e) relationships that replicate the adversities of childhood (e.g., staying with an abusive partner)."" (194)He immediately follows up by pointing out that “some individuals endure miserable childhoods just fine,” and makes it clear that anything goes when looking at a particular case (194). But the trending effects of childhood adversity are undeniable and terrible. Like many other insights in Behave, this is not anything we didn’t already know; it’s the sheer volume and artful presentation of Sapolsky’s converging evidence that gives his work inimitable force. He is also not afraid to bind these findings to strong, empirically-based arguments that reject egregious income inequality and promote investment in public goods:""It’s not so much that poverty predicts poor heath; it’s poverty amid plenty––income inequality. The surest way to make someone feel poor is to rub their nose in what they don’t have…When social capital decreases (thanks to inequality), up goes psychological stress…If you want to improve health and quality of life for the average person in a society, you spend money on public goods––better public transit, safer streets, cleaner water, better public schools, universal health care…Inequality means more secession of the wealthy from contributing to the public good."" (294-5)There’s no denying that this is a kind of liberal do-gooder wishlist, tinged with Sapolsky’s political leanings. Although it leaves him open to criticism, I admire Sapolsky for linking research with certain normative outcomes when he deems it appropriate. It is a fitting strategy for this moment in time, when the notion of any truly “objective” source of information has become obsolete. The best we’ve got are people like Sapolsky, who humbly bend the knee to reason and reality even when they’d rather the universe were otherwise, and who also fight tooth and nail to be heard when reason and reality actually support their political points of view.The final aspects of Behave I want to take up are Sapolsky’s direct claims that we can and should use science to improve the chances of people acting well instead of badly, along with his implicit argument that narrative and storytelling have a huge role to play in this grand project. While science is perhaps humanity’s most powerful method for analyzing and improving environmental conditions, narrative is a timeless tool for teaching people to assume the perspectives of others and to individuate potential enemies instead of reducing them to faceless members of a reviled out-group. This comes through in Sapolsky’s recommendations for dealing with humanity’s inescapably tribal nature:""From massive, breathtaking barbarity to countless pinpricks of microaggression, Us versus Them has produced oceans of pain. Yet our generic goal is not to 'cure' us of Us/Them dichotomizing. It can’t be done…If we accept that there will always be sides, it’s a nontrivial to-do list item to always be on the side of angels. Distrust essentialism. Keep in mind that what seems like rationality is often just rationalization, playing catch-up with subterranean forces that we never suspect. Focus on the larger, shared goals. Practice perspective taking,. Individuate, individuate, individuate. Recall the historical lessons of how often the truly malignant Thems keep themselves hidden and make third parties the fall guy."" (423-4)Sapolsky doesn’t take what I see as the next logical step here, which is to assert that the easiest way people can begin checking off his anti-tribal “to-do list” is to engage with stories that open the way to novel perspectives and unfamiliar modes of moral calculus. We should draw heavily on the power of narrative to simulate social complexity and teach the lessons Sapolsky rightly identifies as essential for ethical education. He points out in a later chapter that, despite its considerable downsides, “our confusion of the literal and the metaphorical, our granting of life-threatening sanctity to the symbolic, can be used to bring about the best of our behaviors” (579). There is a momentous marriage between the arts and sciences embedded in this outlook––a marriage more sacred than any of the supposedly sacrosanct folderol that has hitherto spawned from the imaginative shit-heap of human history.Stories can teach us to think and act better, but only science can deliver the building blocks and blueprints for our better world. When wrapping up a discussion of how former enemies reach reconciliation, Sapolsky implores readers to “recognize that science can teach us how to make events like these more likely” (670). He knows it’s a game of probability; we can’t force people to be good, but we can make it systemically easier for them to make the right choice, even if we know the “rightness” of that choice will always be at least partially if not wholly circumstantial. The more we learn about the light and dark tendencies inherent in human nature and particular arenas of action, the more capable we become of incentivizing instances of good behavior and minimizing instances of bad behavior. Scrupulousness of the highest order is called for, but the project is both worthy and necessary.I’d be delighted to spin out some final words that would drive home everything that is special about this book, but I couldn’t hope to top Sapolsky himself:""If you had to boil this book down to a single phrase, it would be 'It’s complicated.' Nothing seems to cause anything; instead everything just modulates something else. Scientists keep saying, “We used to think X, but now we realize that…” Fixing one thing often messes up ten more, as the law of unintended consequences reigns. On any big, important issue it seems like 51 percent of the scientific studies conclude one thing, and 49 percent conclude the opposite. And so on. Eventually it can seem hopeless that you can actually fix something, can make things better. But we have no choice but to try. And if you are reading this, you are probably ideally suited to do so. You’ve amply proven you have intellectual tenacity. You probably also have running water, a home, adequate calories, and lows odds of festering with a bad parasitic disease. You probably don’t have to worry about Ebola virus, warlords, or being invisible in your world. And you’ve been educated. In other words, you’re one of the lucky humans. So try.""

111,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77785790-david,4,"I think of this book as an introduction to pre-crime. I believe the term that the author uses is ""neurocriminology"", but the essential unifying premise of the book is that human choices are predetermined by complex biological factors which neuroscientists are just beginning to understand in ways that will eventually allow these specialists to predict very specific criminal and antisocial behaviors before, sometimes long before, the actors consciously choose them. We inherently function as if our choices are independent, spontaneous and free. Westerners particularly tend to view ourselves as autonomous individuals. This book will shatter these notions. Most or all of our choices are made before we are consciously aware of them, and most of our choices are not really originate in the individual. Our thoughts and decisions arise from our primordial past, our education, and the biological / environmental conditions immediately preceding ""our"" decisions.The most difficult aspect of the book for me was the insufferable liberalism of the author. The book opens with a gratuitous fantasy about all the horrible things the author would do to Hitler, if given the chance. The author also avails himself of every opportunity to illustrate how racist and bigoted white people are compared to nonwhites. It's never made clear why the author harbors such biases, but it's clear that he feels both justified and righteous for doing so.The concessions which the author makes concerning human biology and behavior are all the more enlightening given his openly hard left bias. For example, Sapolsky conclusively denies that ""nurture"" is the pre-eminent factor in determining human behavior. At the same time, he also gives evidence to show that inherited, genetic traits are strongly modified by the environment, whether that be biochemical or social.Sapolsky affirms the biological reality of kin selection by citing mouse studies showing that mammals produce biochemicals enabling individuals to ""smell"" how closely related other individuals are. Mice, among others, preferentially socialize with individuals whom they sense are more closely related, all else being equal. On the other hand, mice and other animals can be trained artificially to ignore this natural bias for their kin and affiliate with non-related individuals.Similarly, the author points out that human social structures tend to be ethnocentric. Human studies show that whites have an innate, preconscious bias towards their own kind and against blacks. Nevertheless, it's possible to ""overcome"" this ""xenophobia"" with appropriate conditioning, according to the author. Sapolsky consistently recognizes the fact that humans and animals naturally desire to bond with relatives and kin, yet he regularly affirms this natural tendency is ""bad"" or ""xenophobic"".The ""fallacy of naturalism"" struck me as a profound insight into the character not only of Sapolsky, but of the leftist cultural phenomenon as a whole. Such liberals are characterized by the belief that what is natural and instinctive is often wrong and must be artificially re-engineered in order to achieve harmony. By contrast, the opposing view of many conservatives is that nature is correct, even sacrosanct. This view of nature's correctness is easily seen in Austrian Economics, for instance.Another key aspect of the liberal left versus the conservative right that I noticed in this book was the fact that liberal tendencies typically arise from people who are insulated from the exigencies of life relative to those people who are regularly exposed to hardship. Sapolsky cites studies showing, for instance, that conservative people experience nightmares more frequently and suffer from more adversity in general than their liberal counterparts.This adversity-conservatism correlation was also illustrated by a narrative describing the social transformation of a troop of baboons from an endogamous, tribal, aggressive, and patriarchal community to a relatively exogamous, passive, and female-dominant one. How did this transformation occur? It occurred in response to an unlimited supply of low-cost food: the troop settled near a garbage dump where they ate leftovers from human tourists and became ""liberalized"".The same appears to be true for primitive human society. Sapolsky devotes considerable space to the question of whether archaic hunter-gatherer and pastoral human societies were violent and aggressive or peaceful and harmonious. What he shows is that scarcity of resources provokes the former, while abundance promotes the latter. Thus, the ""noble savage"" resolves to the ""well-fed savage"" who becomes more savage and less noble he becomes more hungry.Conservatism and hunger are not only linked in the case of monkeys and tribal humans. Sapolsky notes that criminal justices statistically deliver harsher sentences when they have skipped breakfast. Combined with the observation that conservative people often have more nightmares and other adverse experiences, a theme emerges: liberalism of all kinds is the natural product of affluence and excess, while conservatism is the natural response to adversity and hardship.However, culture is not merely the expression of environmental resources over time. Behavior is embedded in the biology and genetics of the individuals forming a community. Sapolsky cites the famous Dmitry Belyayev Russian Fox study which showed that selective breeding could produce docile foxes. Sapolsky also cited a similar study showing that feral behavioral traits could be bred out of rats. These studies showed, according to Sapolsky, that behaviors which we think of a volitional and ""free"" may, in fact, be the inevitable result of genetic selection.This is a fascinating admission from a leftist author since it forms the key premise of ""A Troublesome Inheritance"" by Nicholas Wade. Wade's book is described as ""controversial"" largely because it applies the Russian Fox study (among others) to human society. Sapolsky shies away from such conclusions, yet both he and Wade agree that human behavior is heritable, just like animal behavior is. Further, both explicitly reject the absurd ""blank slate"" hypothesis of the social constructivists. Sapolsky's book can, in many ways, be seen a single, massive refutation of ""blank slate"" theory, yet in practice, Sapolsky advocates against the idea that our heritable traits are generally good. Our natural proclivity to identify and associate with kin leads, in his view, to violence, ""xenophobia"", and antisocial behavior. Thus, Sapolsky sees it as necessary for social harmony to scientifically overcome our natural tendency towards ""pseudospeciation"" based on biological factors like genes and race.Sapolsky regularly returns to the theme of ""green-beard effects"" wherein individuals in society identify and associate with individuals who share specific phenotypical traits, such as dark skin or blue eyes. Sapolsky automatically asserts that such effects are irrational, even dangerous. With this in mind, he documents various scientifically-validated techniques for replacing natural, racially-based green-beard effects with artificial ones, such as affiliation on the basis of organized sports.Conservative, ethnocentric thinkers like Wade, Pat Buchanan, and Ann Coulter observe the same green-beard and kin-selection effects but that such effects are both good and natural. In the conservative paradigm, separation of the tribe is the solution, not the problem. Both sides admit the existence of the natural tendency to form kin-based tribes, yet authors like Sapolsky generally affirm that advocacy of such nativism constitutes the dangerous logical fallacy of ""moral naturalism"".Sapolsky regularly makes jabs at moral naturalism. His main criticism is that what is perceived to be natural at one time often changes later. Thus, culture mediates our perception of what is ""natural"" and ""good"" versus what is ""unnatural"" and ""bad"". Sapolsky sees this as a an opportunity for reshaping social perceptions to accept new ""unnatural"" things as ""good"" and ""natural"", while the conservative instinct is to pass on what is perceived as natural from one generation to the next.If we accept the essential premise of Behave, then the choice to be liberal (in the sense of adoption what is unnatural and foreign) versus conservative (the preservation of the natural) is biological and subconscious rather than objective and rational. Furthermore, if we accept that the instinct to conserve kin-based groups and ostracize foreign races is dangerous and subversive, then it is easy to cast racial conservatism as a mental disorder rather than a rational decision. The same is true in reverse: if liberal tendencies are heritable, biological, and subversive rather than rational and ""free"", then liberalism is a ultimately disease. This isn't a new idea: Michael Savage, for instance, is notable for his regular insistence that liberalism is a mental disorder. In the opposite camp, it's not uncommon for liberals to insist that conservatism is the result of inbreeding, mental retardation, or childhood trauma.The ultimate end of rational dialog comes when we finally accept that people with views opposite to our own are not going to change their minds or become ""converted"" on the basis of rational argumentation and evidence. Various biological markers predispose people to adopt the views which they hold such that the conscious, rational portion of our brain constitutes a thin veneer over the primal realities of our nature.Viewing liberalism and conservatism as biological traits leads us to the ultimate question: will liberalism or conservatism ultimately wipe out the opposing trait and achieve hegemony in the human population, or at least in specific human population groups? Drawing on the above-mentioned studies, I conclude that while resources are abundant, docile, passive, and liberal traits will be dominant while virile, defensive, and conservative traits will become recessive relics of a dark, irrelevant past."
112,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7422525-scriptor-ignotus,5,"IT’S COMPLICATED “I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.”  — Sir Isaac NewtonWhy do people do what they do? Of all the sciences, that of our own behavior is often the most unsettling in its mysteriousness. Delivering a precise and comprehensive causal explanation for any form of human behavior is almost always impossible, and to attempt even a general account requires one to interface with a bewildering array of methodologies, disciplinary perspectives, spatial and temporal scales of analysis, and the necessary but overwhelmingly nuanced and complex interrelationship between all these factors. If any piece of the causal puzzle is missing—which is always the case, as biologists have not (yet) fully mapped the causal chains that produce our most unique and sophisticated behaviors—then none of the other pieces quite fit together either, leaving unanswered some of the most fundamental questions regarding who and what we are. We are enigmatic even (perhaps especially) to ourselves—as psychology and the humanities have long attested—even though self-knowledge may be the most critical necessity for the survival and flourishing of our species and its planetary habitat. Behave is an incredibly ambitious cross-disciplinary gesture towards a complete picture of the biological substrata of human behavior. As a study which attempts to account for both the profoundest depths of cruelty and sadism and the most exalted heights of compassion and benevolence characteristic of our kind, and which attempts not to override and dismiss but to affirm and buttress the full spectrum of approaches for thinking about human nature, it is the most genuinely humanistic science book I have read. Behave is organized in two main parts. The first part, composed of the first nine chapters, is likely the most thorough exposition of the multilayered biological underpinnings of human behavior ever put in print. Each chapter is framed as part of a skeletal narrative: a behavior has just occurred: what happened in the seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, years, centuries, and millennia beforehand that could help explain why it happened? Each consecutive chapter widens Sapolsky’s analytical lens. When we think about what happened one second before the behavior occurred, we’re in the realm of cellular neurobiology. Neurons in the brain are generating action potentials in response to a stimulus; these disturbances of the negative charge inside of a neuron, caused by openings in the dendritic spines which allow positively-charged ions to flow through, travel from the dendritic spines through the cell body and, if the electrical disturbance passes a certain threshold, through the axon to the axon terminals, which send neurotransmitters across synapses that connect with specialized receptors on the dendritic spines of subsequent neurons, which causes the opening of channels in the membrane for positive ions, which generates action potentials in those neurons, and so on. The collection of 100 billion neurons in each human body and their integrated axonal projections are, at the cellular level, what constitute the vast and intricate circuitry of the nervous system. The generation of collective action potentials in billions of neurons in a particular brain region is what neuroscientists refer to when they speak about the “activation” of brain regions in response to stimuli. Move the timescale back to seconds or minutes before the behavior, and we’re looking at the macro organization of the brain. At this level our behaviors are mediated through the interaction of brain regions. The ancient amygdala, the almond-shaped core of the limbic system, mediates fear, anxiety, and aggression, and is often the first brain region to activate in response to unfamiliar stimuli. People who demonstrate more implicit bias against racial out-groups show more amygdaloid activation when presented with faces of people of another race, and the amygdala shows growth and overactivity in the brains of people suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Overlaying the amygdala are the higher limbic structures, which regulate base emotions, and the cortex, which mediates most of our higher cognitive functions, such as memory, language, motor skills, facial recognition, and contextual judgment. The newest brain region, in evolutionary terms, is the prefrontal cortex (PFC): the crown jewel of executive function, the seat of strategic knowledge organization, delayed gratification, social and cultural acclimation, contextualization, and the regulation of emotionality and impulsivity. It is also the last brain region to mature in an individual lifetime, not coming fully online until around age 25—a critical fact when thinking about the brilliance and deviancy so uniquely characteristic of adolescence.The late maturation of the PFC indicates something astonishing about the evolution of the human brain. The wiring of the PFC is not significantly more complex than that of other cortical regions, nor does it consist of a different type of neuron—with a few limited exceptions. Biologically speaking, it isn’t any “harder” to develop a prefrontal cortex than it is to develop any other part of the brain, which likely means that the delayed development of the PFC was selected for by our hominid ancestors. We evolved in such a way that the makeup of the frontal cortex, because its development is delayed, is shaped by the makeup of our other brain regions, which in turn are shaped by personal experiences. By developing later, the PFC is designed to accommodate the neurological “lessons” of our own, individual lives. The genetic program of our brain development has evolved to liberate the frontal cortex from genetics. Of course, none of these brain regions are discrete entities, and none are free from the influences of hormones and environmental factors. Expanding our timescale to account for the hours to months before a behavior occurs involves reference to endocrinology, the effect of hormones on behavior via their influencing of the nervous system, and the plasticity of the brain. Here Sapolsky debunks some common misunderstandings about the role of certain hormones in behavior; namely testosterone and oxytocin. Hormones are not “instigators” of behavior; in fact, one of the overarching themes of the entire book is that there is never a single biological cause of any behavior, but rather a vast field of facilitating and inhibiting factors that influence the probability of certain behaviors to degrees that are not always quantifiable. Androgens like testosterone are facilitators of behavior. They make the amygdala more sensitive to triggers of aggression, but only among people who are already predisposed to acts of aggression. Nor is aggression the single, inevitable result of testosterone production. Testosterone levels increase not only in response to situations demanding aggression, but also in situations in which one’s social status is uncertain, changing, or perceived to be under threat. In those situations testosterone does not facilitate violence per se; it facilitates whatever behavior is necessary for one to secure status. If a society bases its status relations on, say, charitability, then testosterone won’t cause you to strangle a cheetah; it will cause you to insist on paying the tab at a restaurant. If testosterone has an unfairly negative reputation, oxytocin has an unfairly positive one. This “luv hormone” facilitates bonds between mothers and infants, bonds between humans and their canine pets, and the pair-bonding of monogamous romantic couples; but these salutary effects are relegated to in-group relations. Oxytocin increases our prosociality towards an “Us”, but it also makes us more suspicious of “Thems”. It does not facilitate free love, but rather parochialism. In the second part of the book, Sapolsky attempts to synthesize the complicated layers of knowledge laid out in the first half, and to offer some insight as to how these biological factors influence our best and worst behaviors. I can hardly do justice to the nuances of the discussions in each chapter, but they address such topics as our instinctual categorization of people into In-Groups and Out-Groups and how and why we prioritize some dimensions of “Us-ness” over others; the unique human capacity for establishing and navigating hierarchies and the physically corrosive effects of having the “wrong” status in a particular social context (Sapolsky is a Rousseauian primitivist, and considers the agricultural revolution to be the greatest blunder in human history for the role it played in establishing rigid and dramatic status hierarchies); the neurological correlates of empathy (and how it’s better if our altruism is instinctive rather than an act of willpower); how metaphorical thinking is innate to our biology (and why a society is in extremely dangerous territory if certain members of it are persuasively associated with insects or fecal matter; hyperactivity of the insular cortex, which regulates disgust responses, can make one an ethnic cleanser—or worse, a germaphobe); the question of free will and how our conception of justice should be framed accordingly (Sapolsky is a strong determinist and thinks a criminal justice system based on punishment is totally irrational); and, of course, war and peace. Why do people do what they do? Sapolsky’s short answer is: it’s really complicated. No, really, that’s his answer; that’s the conclusion he comes to at the end of this big, beautiful disaster of a book. But understanding, though difficult, is possible; and with understanding comes a spirit of mercy which could perhaps change the world."

As one of the greatest benefits of such books are the attributions and opportunity to read the books referenced I will add one for consideration that won't disappoint: ""The Archaeology of Mind: Neuroevolutionary Origins of Human Emotion."" by Jaak Panksepp and Lucy Biven. This is worthy of mentioning in the same review as Professor Sapolsky's masterpiece.  As with so many things in life the satisfaction is directly proportional to the effort expended and Robert Sapolsky's book, ""Behave,"" will help you better understand what chemistry and brain structures combined with environmental factors are potentially at the root of this feeling. This is not an author espousing an absolute deterministic view, but leaves room for something more that makes us human that our science has yet to discover the metrology to measure. The intellectual humility is rare and a reflection of the author's wisdom."

A lot of humor (not all of it sophisticated) and storytelling. This is a long book, and I spent a really long time reading it. Well worth taking it in by small chunks."

117,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31302406-lori,5,"I have a very quick rule of thumb to measure up books meant popularise science: if it leaves one thinking ""ow it's much more complicated than that"", then it's a good book. And I was very pleased to see the author echo—explicitly, obviously this was implicit throughout the book— much of the same sentiment in the Epilogue: If you had to boil down this book to a single phrase it would be ""it's complicated"" (p. 674)   Highly recommended to anyone trying to understand what it is to inhabit this meat suit we call a human body. Although, fair warning, you will be left with a great feeling of uncertainty afterwards; i.e. you will be made aware of your own ignorance, and most important—hopefully—you will shut up about ""human nature"" at every turn. You can also expect to have your (yes, your) simplistic notions of biological determinism shattered.  Now, a slightly more elaborate exposition than ""it's complicated"": Any meaningful analysis of the behaviour of human species deals with biology-environment interactions. One can expect to learn that: testosterone, oxytocin, mirror neurons, and pretty much any new fad protein, neurotransmitter, or brain region does not work the way you thought it did.  The negative effects of poverty, inequality, and social hierarchy in general are laid bare—or shorter SES (socio-economic status). The science is in: these societal dynamics wreak havoc on everything from IQ (p. 249) to health, to exacerbating anti-social behavior. Most fascinating is the fact that the lower you are on the wealth inequality ladder, the poorer your health. And get this, only a third of this degradation is due to actual, poorer material conditions. It is the subjective experience that matters, and the definitive knowledge and reality of having someone who's infinitely richer than you, and capable of shitting down the ladder—so to speak—on you. (p. 441 contains a nice bullet-point list of the known effects). Now, I am going to go on a tangent, to something the author did not mention, but as a filthy red I am almost obliged to do so. If we look into the work of Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century, and more importantly in Karl Marx's Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, Vol 1, we see capitalism's inevitable, structural tendency to create utterly obscene inequalities. Now, given that we know the negative effects of inequality on human beings and the causes of these inequalities, it should be trivial to synthesise a necessary political project: anti-capitalism.Ok, now, back to the content of the book. Robert Sapolsky—rightly so—criticizes Steven Pinker's The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined for cherry picking some of the data referring to primitive societies (p. 311-315). Mislabelling of hunter-horticulturalists (p. 321) as hunter gatherers, thus shadowing the plethora of research showing distinct ""pro-social"" behaviour of the former group. Failure to adjust for length of conflict (p. 614-620) in determining how violent historical periods were, doubly baffling given that Pinker all the while (correctly) adjusted the total victim count for overall world population size at that time—glaring oversight. Overall, a fairly positive critique, but one that leaves the reader with the impression ""it's more complicated than that"" (unlike Pinker's own conclusions). Note: the page references in this paragraph are to ""Behave"".  My own point of contention with the book, is that it omits a plethora of anthropological, and historical studies into human civilization (Lewis Mumford, E.A Gutkind, David Graeber)—while tapping into what seems to be a clichee body of work that is being passed around in the same Ivy League circles (essentially the same body of work as used by Pinker). This also leads to the author using some historically impoverished definitions of ""individualist"" and ""collectivist"" cultures—the latter being extremely poorly represented, and mostly by modern ""samples"". Mentions of ancient, medieval, and revolutionary period cities, which would be much better examples than modern ones, are woefully absent.  In short, this books is broad in its analysis of biology, but rather narrow in its analysis of society. But nonetheless, it is still an endless mine of fresh knowledge that would take forever for me to go through in this review. Luckily, the Epilogue has a nice bullet-point list (albeit it is not exhaustive of the content). Overall, Behave it deeply fascinating, and definitely worth a read! I highly recommend this book to everyone!"
118,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30276417-nancy-mills,5,"Fascinating book that begins with some rather difficult lessons in endocrinology and neuroloscience, but after the author lays that foundation, the books blooms into a dense but highly entertaining tomb about how behavior is affected by genes, hormones, environmental factors (that of course affect hormones), and then the guy actually has the nerve to go into the topic of Free Will ... and does a great job all the way. Here I am compelled to add a lengthy quote from the author, in a footnote, of course:""And the one thing I'm not going anywhere near is this New Age-y notion, ""Of course we have free will. You can't say that our behavior is determined by a mechanistic universe, because the universe is indeterminate, because of quantum mechanics."" Argh. What anyone sensible who has thought about this will point out is that (a)the consequences of subatomic indeterminacy of quantum mechanics (about which I understand zero) don't ripple upward enough to influence behavior, and (b) if they did, the result wouldn't be the freedom to will your behavior. It would be the utter randomization of behavior. In the words of philosopher/neuroscientist Sam Harris, a free will trasher, if quantum mechanics actually played a role in any of this, 'Every thought and action would seem to merit the statement ""I don't know what just came over me."""" Except you wouldn't actually be able to make that statement, since you'd just makinggarly sounds because the muscles in your tongue would be doing all sorts of random things.""Well I guess he told THEM!There is a chapter toward the back of the book entitled ""Biology, the Criminal Justice System, and Free Will,"" which will get your frontal cortex neurons twitching if anything will.Conclusions aren't cut and dry, if that's what you were hoping, but certainly will give the reader a tremendous background, if one can manage to absorb even half of the book's contents. If you're not all that into biology and long scientific words, you can get away with skimming the tough parts. I plowed through it and found it very rewarding. There are 3 Appendices, all good that you can skip if you don't want to learn about Neuroscience, Endocrinology or Protein Basics.Dr. Sapolsky is sympathetic, maybe even empathetic (the books discusses these phenomena) toward the the reader who may find the material dense, and his humor more than redeems his asking us to familiarize ourselves with all this stuff. Anterior Something Cingulate. dmELvE. vm LLpe. I don't know. A whole bunch of acronyms. Half way through the book I accidentally found out that there is a glossary in the back that defines each acronym which certainly makes things tons easier. Anyway, the author is understanding. One passage, for example, reads ""This is a bold assertion that the heuristic of dialectical materialism not only extends beyond the economic world into the naturalistic one, but is ontologically rooted in the essential sameness of both worlds' dynamic resolution of irresolvable contradictions."" Before the you throw the book across the room, the author adds this footnote: ""I have no idea what it is that I just wrote..."" He bravely plows ahead with ""It is Marx and Engels as trilobite and snail,"" and immediately footnotes again: ""Ditto."" Truthfully my main complaint is that the footnotes, which are numerous and are at times the best parts of the text, and printed in such teeny print that even with my glasses I had trouble reading them after the sun went down with my 60 watt bulb. There are, of course, about a million end notes to, which I seldom bothered with.Sapolsky, in his final chapter, delves into War and Peace (the subject, not the novel) and reveals some very interesting behaviors on the battlefield versus way back behind the lines where men in fancy uniforms make strategics decisions. And the part about drone pilots, who shoot targets thousands of miles away, nevertheless get bad cases of PTSD in spite of the fact that they are never physically putting their own lives in danger. Remarkable findings.One of the most worthwhile books I've read this year, highly recommended for people who like to read and don't mind a little mental exercise."
119,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,4,"This brick of a book purports to be an interdisciplinary explanation of human behavior, drawing from biology, psychology, and sociology, and everything from primate studies to well-known works in various fields. It’s big, at 717 pages of actual text followed by references; it’s broad; and as such it’s a little bit simplistic. Even at this size, there’s not quite room to develop all of the material. The first half or so of the book is more focused on the “hard” science, beginning with how neurons communicate with each other, and working its way up through hormones, genes, brain development through childhood and adulthood and how this is affected by trauma, and the evolution of species. The second half is more focused on psychology: us vs. them dichotomies, moral decisionmaking, the causes of violence, and whether the criminal justice system really makes sense when all human behavior is ultimately driven by biology. (Sapolsky argues no, but I’m not so sure. Where would we be as a species, or as individuals, if we all just shrugged our shoulders and gave in to ideas of biological determinism?)I certainly learned a lot from this book, which contains a ton of information presented in a way that is understandable to a non-scientist – though I struggled a bit with some of the early chapters. It provides a strong synthesis and framework for understanding information from biology and social sciences. That said, on the subjects that I did know something about, it seemed a little simplified. Fair enough; entire books have been written on subjects that comprise a single chapter here. As other reviewers have suggested, Sapolsky perhaps accepts too many psychological studies uncritically, without discussing psychology’s replication crisis, in which dozens of famous studies, when run again using the exact same methods and parameters, failed to produce the same headline-worthy results. That said, in general Sapolsky seems to take a fair approach to his material, presenting and evaluating multiple viewpoints in areas that have generated controversy. His writing is readable given the subject matter, and there’s a goofy-professor personality behind it that occasionally shines through. I wouldn’t take everything here as gospel – and I suppose we never should, since new scientific discoveries regularly require us to reevaluate what we thought was true – but the book did leave me a little more educated than I was before."
120,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7482598-jayesh,3,"His classes must be very interesting. What is it with biologists and well written non-fiction that does not completely gloss over the details? The book is fairly long and appears to lack a central thesis except that ""it's complicated"". But ""Nothing seems to cause anything, instead everything just modulates everything else"" is probably closer to the truth than the endless internet debates over nature vs nurture.However even though the book is expansive, remembering to critique both sides of the debate (not even Pinker or Ramachandran are spared) while being filled with citation and humorous footnotes, I still had a few minor issues that force me to discount other things as well. Things like Wellesley effect and Freakonomics explanation of drop in crime rate in US are presented without any remarks about the contentious nature of the findings (largely believed to be false I think, but I could be wrong)."

It's probably a little too textbook-like for some readers, but for those who really want to get a good general grounding in what science in 2017 tells us about behavior, there is probably no better place to go.I particularly liked the discussions on the law and neuroscience, and a really nuanced take on role (or lack thereof) of genetics in behavioral determinism, and final chapter relating to war (and peace)."
122,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,4,"It is common these days to come across people who have developed a strong dislike for all reductionist approaches. They prefer holistic views, and are suspicious of any knowledge that has been derived through breaking up a big problem into smaller chunks. I can understand why they feel that way, but I have always felt that such feelings can only be harbored when one is unfamiliar with the depth of the subject in question, and therefore assumes a simplistic view of things. For example, I know of many people who are suspicious of normal medical science because it treats each organ as a separate functional entity, and expertise within the medical profession is divided by such narrow specializations. They prefer a medical science that looks at the big picture, which includes not just the various sub-systems, but combines the body with the mind. This is a wise and noble thought until we realize the complexity of the whole system. Once we do, the justification of breaking it up into smaller systems become obvious. All the knowledge we have about our body could not have been attained without first breaking it up into the various organs and trying to understand how they work in isolation. Once that has reached a certain level of details can we afford to put them back together and investigate the far more complex interactions between these systems. If we tried to bypass the reductionist step in the first place, we would have been stuck with vague and faulty theories of how the body works, as can be found in all ancient texts. A responsible form of holistic science cannot be rushed. In many cases we may not even be ready to take that step, and must wait till we have better understanding of the parts.Of all the systems we have investigated so far, the physical systems of materials and forces, chemical systems, astronomical systems, and biological systems – they all yielded fairly well to the scientific reductionist methodologies. However, the biggest challenge lies ahead in understanding the most complex system we have encountered so far – our mind. Huge progress has been made in this direction in the last few decades. The progress happened through advances in neuroscience, biology, computational science, evolutionary sciences, psychology etc. Problems that were beyond any convincing and demonstrable theory are regularly being converted into understandable bits of knowledge. In this environment of tremendous progress, where all the different branches seems to be converging, it is not unexpected that many specialists start to believe that they have finally figured it out. I have read many books where brilliant minds would try to prove how their specialty, be it neuroscience or evolutionary biology, can finally explain our behavior, our morality, our aesthetic sense, etc. in terms of their science alone.This book is the only one I have read that not only celebrates the great accomplishments of our reductionist approach towards understanding of how the mind works, but also exposes the severe limitations of not appreciating the complexity of all these subsystems when they work together. He systematically shows how each of the systems involved, our neuronal bran, the environment we live in, both in our mother’s womb and the environment outside, our endocrinal systems, our genes, how they all interact and influence each other is incredibly complex ways. The only way we can understand the whole thing is when we allow for these interactions. In other words, why we need to look at the whole thing holistically, while admitting that it can only be done when we understand the parts really well. It is a sobering document because it shows the challenge that lies ahead. Modelling the complexity of the whole system is so complex then we may never be able to crack it open. That is, understanding of an individual mind may remain impossible, while we get better at understanding them in aggregate.The real value of this book is not just in convincing us that full understanding of our mind cannot happen until we integrate all the pieces together, but in nudging us towards a slightly different mindset that can be applied to all complex problems. As in everything else, when we solve one problem, it only presents us with an even more complex problem. And to me, that’s what makes life worth living – that there will never be a shortage of things to ponder."
123,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17937883-avi-singh,5,"Behave is an ambitious book that seeks to explain human behavior at almost every level of abstraction - what parts of the brain lit up in the second before an action (the lizard-ish amygdala, or the primate-y frontal cortex), what sensory information obtained in the past few seconds to minutes “primed” you for it (if people are shown a random string of positive words, they tend to behave nicely in a cooperative game), what hormones were secreted in the past few hours to days (effects of testosterone, oxytocin etc.), what happened in the years before (say during adolescence or childhood), or in the prenatal period (kids show preference to flavors the mother consumed when pregnant, can hear things and show preference to stories they heard while in the womb etc., the “boy/girl” brain development, connections with sexual orientation / identity), what cultural forces in the last few hundred years shaped the behavior (for example, difference between individualistic and collectivistic cultures), and last, but not the least, how evolution in the last thousands of years influence behavior (ideas from sociobiology or evolutionary psychology - kin selection, reciprocative altruism, etc. ). The second part of the book has a slightly different format - as the author delves into specific human behavioral traits (like Us vs Them-ing, hierarchies and obedience, morals, usage of metaphors, violence, etc.), and discusses them in detail, often drawing the fundamental expounded upon in the previous chapters. The book has a entertaining myth-busting style. It will present a hypothesis (say testosterone is responsible for aggression), present experiments in favor of it (castration reduces aggression, injecting testosterone back in brings it back), and then present more experiments that poke holes in the earlier somewhat simplistic explanation (raising testosterone to 10% or 200% of original levels makes no difference as compared to raising to 100%). He also talks about the wars within academia on numerous theories/ideas - neurogenesis, mirror neurons, sociobiology, Stanford Prison Experiment findings etc., which, apart from being entertaining, also reinforce my belief that the author does not only present the theories that he “likes”. Though it’s definitely possible that he did that at certain points in the book, I think he presented the nuanced view more often than not. Sometimes, there’s an information overload, as the author presents results from 5-10 studies in a single paragraph. Also, since a lot of these tend to be psychology studies, their results have to be taken with an appropriate amount of salt. Some of the later chapters are a bit preachy (using intuition vs reason in in-group and out-group interactions, why the current justice system is stupid, how to reduce violence)- but since they are backed by fairly solid science, and logical (to me) explanations, I still enjoyed reading them. In the end, I think it’s a great book, and is peppered with humorous anecdotes, both personal and historical, which makes it easier to go through its ~800 pages. The only “limitation” of the book is its scope - I don’t really think any single book can cover all the issues that this book tackles - but a list compiled from the books referenced here would probably make a great reading list. I might do that at some point. "

Behave will turn heads and raise controversy in the field of neurobiology, something the field has come to expect from Sapolsky, but Behave will also change science writing. Gone is the jargon and hundred-watt rhetoric that repels the plebians and ill-informed. No more tented-fingered, cross-legged analysis.

It was first published in May, 2017. This is one miracle of a book. I don’t know where to start…“Someone does something lousy and selfish to you in a game, and the extent of insular and amygdaloid activation predicts how much outrage you feel and how much revenge you take.” ― Robert M. Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst Book focuses on Robert Sapolsky’s attempt to tackle seemingly impossible question. That is to look at our behavior from every possible angle: biological, psychological, physiological…and there are some historical and cultural angles thrown in to it too. We start with neurobiological angle: what happens in our brains when some specific behavior occurs, what effect do our hormones have on us, what is our genetic makeup, how are we different or even not that different from rest of the animal kingdom… This is not enough. Sapolsky continues by how environment affects us and also focuses on age-old question: are we formed more by nature or nurture? And indeed as mentioned, then we continue with psychology, history, culture…Behave is among the best nonfiction reads ever. It’s stunning, it’s big and it’s absolutely beautiful. I learned so much and it also changed the way I see some things. Here are some of my picks throughout the chapters of the book:Chapter 4: Hours to Days Before: How testosterone increases confidence and optimism and decreases fear and anxiety. Chapter 5: Days to Months Before: Enough time for Arab spring, for a discontented winter or for STDs to spread a lot during a summer of love…and also plenty of time for our brains to change…How there’s long-term LTP and LTD. And veryy long term LTP and LTD and how they work differently in different regions of our brains.“Testosterone makes people cocky, egocentric, and narcissistic.”― Robert M. Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and WorstChapter 15: Metaphors We Kill By: How Rwandan genocide came to be and how metaphors were used as a weapon. Oh the power of metaphors. I have never before realized this. During Rwandan genocide, Tutsis were described as cockroaches. And those cockroaches would steal your husband. They became something that had to be exterminated, swept away from the country. Almost 1 million people dead within 100 days.“Some translation is needed. The Rwandan genocide did not involve tanks, airplanes, dropping bombs or shelling at civilians. There were no concentration camps. No transport trains. No Zyklon-B. There was no bureaucratic banality of evil. There were hardly even many guns.” ― Robert M. Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and WorstChapters 6 & 16: Author explained PMS syndrome. He also explained how PMS syndrome has been used as a criminal defense. And this is not the only sort of crazy sounding criminal defense in the book. There’s also a lot of talk about the development of the brain in earlier chapters and whether a person is or isn’t fully aware of his actions and consequences of those actions due to it… Adolescence. Or. Dude, where is my frontal cortex as the chapter is called.What else… Sapolsky uses the analogy of a car with faulty brakes to describe antisocial human behaviour. How judges give less harsh sentences after they have had lunch! Yes you read that right, judges’ rulings’ are harsher when they are hungrier. And this also works with smells. If you’re in a place that smells bad, you more likely to judge a person or a thing in a negative manner, how there was a Christmas truce in 1914 and how in many wars since soldiers had to be threatened to go kill soldiers from the opposite side. And how opposite of love is not hate …it’s indifference. And to conclude. There is no such thing as free will.I loved this book. As you can probably tell from my review, it’s packed with loads and loads of information in a very simplified, easily understood form. Moreover, there’s a sense of humor or sarcasm in the writing and that always gets one more star from me because it’s like authors are laughing at how idiotic some of the things we do are and I really appreciate that (…we do a lot of dumb shit). Maybe the only downside to the book as I was listening to audio version were all the: “footnotes” and “i see her see i see her see i see?”. They were a bit much in spoken. All in all, a fantastic piece of literature.5/5 stars"

I can't say the journey is necessarily enjoyable -- it's incredibly dense, and Sapolsky admits in his epilogue that the two word TL;DR of his book is ""It's complicated"". But this staggering work is also incredibly rich, like a mental block of cheese that you can only sample in nibbles, and incredibly plastic, meant in the best neurological sense, like a mind actively at work laid bare. And this mind is an incredibly inspiring one. I never took one of his classes, but I think this book is a great representation of what brilliance looks like in a teacher."

I must be his perfect reader-- someone with a working knowledge of popular science, biology, neurology, and psychology-- I get his jokes. He is informative, vastly knowledgable (to put it mildly), speaks to the general reader, and light-handed with his material.I can not think of a better read for the approaching times of neurological understanding of the cause of why people do what they do, and the larger questions of blame in a criminal context. "
130,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81718362-ann,4,"After taking over two months to complete this, I am not sure what to say except 'whew'. This is the most comprehensive book I have read on human behavior. Sapolsky goes beyond the (neuro)biological factors and incorporates cultural, psychological and environmental considerations into the discussion. I wouldn't say this is a difficult read but it is a richly complex and detailed book. Sapolsky's sense of humor helps take the edge off things. By the end, the reader is fully aware of the meaning of, 'it's complicated' when attempting to explain human behavior. In essence, it is very complicated and scientists probably have just scratched the surface in their understanding.What struck me is how 'me' vs 'us' vs 'them' factors into things, even in our split second decision making. The chapters discussing the roles of hormones and neurotransmitters were quite interesting and sometimes the information surprised me. Finally, the chapter titled 'Metaphors We Kill By,' discussing symbolism and symbolic values was actually frightening. The different parts of our brain aren't adept at handling that information in a logical way and symbolic meanings can be interpreted as physical pain or rejection. Ouch and Yikes! Scary stuff. After reading all this, I do believe there is some meaning to the saying 'reality is the stories we tell ourselves' (greatly influenced by our brain's interpretation of things, along with hormonal regulation, genetics, environmental factors, childhood experiences, etc.) For anyone who isn't ready to undertake reading this, I'd recommend checking out some of Sapolsky's lectures from Stanford University on YouTube. There is some overlap between the lectures and the contents of the book. His lecturing style offers a comparable representation to his writing style. "

Sapolsky covers genetics, neurology, development, just to get STARTED on the important half of the book. I have a Master's in Psychology but my undergrad was in genetics and I struggled to keep up with the technical stuff in this book (luckily Sapolsky provides appendices with 101s for folk)So I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book to someone first diving into a piece on human nature, perhaps starting with something like Sapiens, or Ten Types of Humans. However if feeling confident or having plenty of time and cognitive energy to devote to this it should be fine.Overall the book is huge and covers so much its hard to really summarize, I loved that between the technical stuff there was the odd joke, or personal touch that always seemed brilliant. Some of the insights from this book will stick with me for life and while much of the content was heavy it was worthwhile."

Both discuss (in somewhat different contexts) the social, cultural, and psychological evolution of the human animal. Both give reasons for cautious optimism, though both also seem to realize the potential for disaster that looms as we move forward as a species. "

The appendices are worth reading if, like me, you haven't formally studied biology in a couple of decades. They are a well written and easily digested summary of neuroscience, endocrinology and proteins.The first nine chapter have an interesting organisation, even if I feel it was not well executed. The idea of tracing an action backwards in time to evaluate the causes of the action has some merit, but Professor Sapolsky fails to remain on task and hence the excessive length of the sections. In the introduction he rails against ""buckets"" or categories of answers (the distinction between biology, psychology and culture) and then follows his own holistic advice. But the resulting chapters are disjointed at best. An editor could have cut the book in half without sacrificing any of the science or the audiences' ability to understand and a little of Aristotle's four causes would have benefited both author and audience. The digressions are sometimes interesting but usually merely political marginalia from an aging ""vertebarte, mammal, ape, human, male, scientist, lefty"" (p. 405)What was particularly interesting in the first few chapters is Professor Sapolsky's ability to find middle ground in the nature/nuture debate by bridging the gap between the two and noting the maliabiliy of nature.I suppose if the book had ended after chapter nine it would have received 3-4 stars.But then Professor Sapolsky continues into what I could only call socio-psychology with a dabbing of neuroscience to back up some rather radical leftist views. His discussions on hierarchy, free will, ethics, religion and war all take the same politically inspired position and do not flow seemlessly from the science. Sometimes it is bias mascarading as science, and othertimes it simply leaves the science aside. His discussion of ethics and utilitarianism is particularly egregious, and this is coming from someone who has little sympathy for utilitarianism. The construction of straw-man arguments does little to help the cause.Professor Sapolsky attempts to reconstruct the Naked Ape (Desmond Morris) but ends up with some monster who only vaguely resembles a man. I am reminded of the G.K. Chesterton quote, ""Take away the supernatural and all that is left is the unnatural"" (Orthodoxy, p 49) His reductionist materialist approach leads him into some strange territory, where rights exist but free will doesn't. Where a complete (and admittedly impossible) revolution of the criminal justice system is necessary. The very subtitle explicitly mentions our best and worst behaviour but he develops no criteria for evaluating one or the other, prefering to rely on ""context, context, context"" (p. 672). I am inclined to buy Jonathan Haidt and Steven Pinker and never pick up another book by Sapolsky. His politics, philosophy, ethics, criminology, even theology and psychology are all so different from any human's lived experience (and the language that goes along with it) that I can only concluded with E.O. Wilson, ""Wonderful theory, wrong species.""A lot more was said a lot better about materialism by David Hume, or about free will by Nietzsche, or mind-body dualism by Descartes, consciousness by Leibniz etc.And to close, he never justified:""I won't pull any punches- I think that its [agriculture's] invention was one of the all-time human blunders"" (p. 326)"

Sapolsky cherry-picks his research to make political points. He is yet another typical liberal intellectual type (so prevalent in education today) that is unable to set aside his own political and social prejudices and present the research in an unbiased way. That is not to say he does not present some interesting research in this book, but he so damages his own credibility with his misapplications of the scientific results and cherry-picking of the science that supports his own skewed views that no reasonable person can accept any of his characterizations or conclusions at face value. What is even more amusing is his repeated condemnations of people who misapply scientific results and cherry-pick the data, all while doing this himself throughout the length of the book. A good percentage of the book is devoted to using scientific research to prove that people who disagree with his political beliefs are unintelligent, unfeeling, etc., and yet he condemns the Nazis for citing science in a similar way to turn the Germans against the Jews. This book should be regarded as nothing but pure drivel and the author should be completely discredited in the world of science."

140,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7208369-miles,5,"Books that examine the relationship between science and morality have become ubiquitous, so readers interested in these important subjects need to choose carefully. It is not an overstatement to say that one could do no better than to alight on Robert M. Sapolsky’s Behave. This engrossing, encyclopedic examination of the causal mechanisms that determine human behavior is a monumental achievement of syncretic thought.This was my first journey into Sapolsky’s singular mind, both joyful and challenging. Covering an almost inconceivably vast landscape of scientific information, this neurobiologist/primatologist takes a playful but responsible approach to some heady topics, delving deep into humanity’s best and worst behaviors while never missing an opportunity to charm the reader with his perspicacious wit. I usually don’t care for comedy in nonfiction, but Sapolsky’s wry humor rarely misses the mark, and is complemented by an impressive ability to synthesize multiple perspectives and extricate sensible conclusions from dense and sometimes-conflicting data. Sapolsky is also transparent about his own biases as a “bleeding heart liberal,” making him a truly lovable genius (and not just in the casual sense).Since it would be folly to try to cover everything this book has to offer in a review, I’ll focus on explaining Sapolsky’s methodology, and then comment on just a few of his most important findings. Sapolsky begins with a necessary critique of how scientists typically explain human behavior, which is to break it down into different “buckets of explanation,” each of which comprises a distinct realm of inquiry:""We tend to use a certain cognitive strategy when dealing with complex, multifaceted phenomena, in that we break down those separate facets into categories, into buckets of explanation…The goal of this book is to avoid such categorial thinking. Putting facts into nice cleanly demarcated buckets of explanation has its advantages––for example, it can help you remember facts better. But it can wreak havoc on your ability to think about those facts. This is because the boundaries between different categories are often arbitrary, but once some arbitrary boundary exists, we forget that it is arbitrary and get way too impressed with its importance…There are not different disciplinary buckets. Instead, each one is the end product of all the biological influences that came before it and will influence all the factors that follow it. Thus, it is impossible to conclude that a behavior is caused by a gene, a hormone, a childhood trauma, because the second you invoke one type of explanation, you are de facto invoking them all. No buckets. A 'neurobiological' or 'genetic' or 'developmental' explanation for a behavior is just shorthand, an expository convenience for temporarily approaching the whole multifactorial arc from a particular perspective."" (5-8, emphasis his)This boundary-busting approach puts Sapolsky squarely in the company of intellectual titans such as Edward O. Wilson and Steven Pinker––interdisciplinary thinkers who have, however imperfectly, combined findings from numerous academics fields to launch humanity into new realms of inquiry and debate. Sapolsky is less poetic than Wilson and less contentious than Pinker, bringing a cautious, even-handed compassion to the science of understanding human nature. As any science reader knows, it is one thing to claim that disciplinary boundaries are arbitrary and ought to be ignored, and quite a different thing to actually demonstrate how this can be done. And while I don’t think Sapolsky fully achieves his stated goal, his efforts to do so are heroic and effectual.The first half of Behave plays out like a tennis match that travels back in time, with the ball representing the focus of Sapolsky’s chapters and the net representing a (somewhat arbitrary) boundary between behavioral mechanisms that operate primarily inside or outside the human body. He begins with “One Second Before,” an explanation of the neurobiology that takes place just before behavior is enacted, then transitions to “Seconds to Minutes Before,” where he discusses immediate environmental stimuli that contribute to behavior. Next comes “Hours to Days Before,” a discussion of how hormones influence behavior, which is followed by “Days to Months Before,” where he takes up long-term neural plasticity (learning and memory).This pattern continues, with subsequent chapters addressing adolescence, early childhood development, genetics, culture, and humanity’s shared evolutionary heritage. So Sapolsky makes use of the buckets of explanation by taking up these topics one at a time (what else could he do?), but also goes to great lengths to show as many interactive areas of overlap between the different causal mechanisms as possible. This truly is a “both/and” story he is telling, with all the moving parts affecting all the other moving parts in profound and intriguing ways.The second half of Behave is more traditionally structured, and wades into dicier territory. Sapolsky tackles tricky subjects such as tribalism, moral intuition and bias, power dynamics, ethical motivation, empathy, the power of symbols to move us to action (or not), free will, criminal justice, and war. These areas of study are all rapidly evolving along with society and technology, so it’s impossible to tell how relevant Sapolsky’s assessments will be in decades to come. But all in all, this is the best and most up-to-date summary of recent findings in these fields one could hope to engage with. I probably had to read between ten and twenty other books to discover most of the insights Sapolsky distills into just a few hundred pages.All of this should be more than enough to convince science and ethics enthusiasts that Behave is essential reading. If you’re eager to run out and pick it up, just stop reading here and go for it. But if you want to stick around, I’ll give some thoughts about what I see as Sapolsky’s most important findings.Sapolsky’s most critical point by far is the importance of context in understanding human behavior. This is hardly a novel position, but Sapolsky lays out the argument for contextualization with sui generis assiduousness and clarity. Over and over he pounds the table about context, tirelessly illuminating the ways in which human behavior is sensitive to myriad influences both inside and outside the body. Most of these influences are partially or completely hidden from our conscious experience of the world, and it is only through scientific inquiry and abstraction that we come to understand their significance. Perhaps the wildest demonstration of this is the role of transcription factors in determining how a person’s genome expresses itself:""95 percent of DNA is noncoding…What is that 95 percent? Some is junk––remnants of pseudogenes inactivated by evolution. But buried in that are the keys to the kingdom, the instructional manual for when to transcribe particular genes, the on/off switches for gene transcription. A gene doesn’t 'decide' when to be photocopied into RNA, to generate its protein. Instead before the start of the stretch of DNA coding for that gene is a short stretch called a promoter––the 'on' switch. What turns the promoter switch on? Something called a transcription factor (TF) binds to the promoter…Thus transcription factors regulate genes. What regulates transcription factors? The answer devastates the concept of genetic determinism: the environment."" (226, emphasis his)Sapolsky goes on to explain that numerous factors––ones present inside cells, inside bodies, and even outside bodies––can all nudge transcription factors one way or another. This means that, while a person’s genome stays constant throughout life, gene expression (the manner in which genes code for the particular proteins that make you you) is keenly sensitive to environmental conditions and constantly in flux. Furthermore, it turns out that transcription factors are usually proteins themselves, and therefore require other transcription factors to instruct genes to code for them:""Genomes aren’t infinite; instead TFs regulate one another’s transcription, solving that pesky infinity problem. Importantly, across the species whose genomes have been sequenced, the longer the genome (i.e., roughly the more genes there are), the greater the percentage of genes coding for TFs. In other words, the more genomically complex the organism, the larger the percentage of the genome devoted to gene regulation by the environment...The human genome codes for about 1,500 different TFs, contains 4,000,000 TF-binding sites, and the average cell uses about 200,000 such sites to generate its distinctive gene-expression profile. This is boggling."" (228-9, emphasis his)Boggling indeed, but also fucking fabulous. O brave new world, that has such people in ‘t! The level of detail and complexity in the example above is indicative of every section and chapter Behave has to offer. Sapolsky doesn’t cut corners or succumb to simplistic reductionism, seeking instead to repeatedly blow the reader’s mind by showing the grand scope of what goes into decisions as simple as deciding whether to reach out to touch someone’s arm. Every step of the way, we are bombarded with caveats, clarifications, contradictions, and pitfalls of empirical limitation. It would be infuriating if it weren’t so damned fascinating! Sapolsky’s main thrust––that context is always crucial and never simple when trying to understand behavior––could not be better delivered. It also carries a hopeful undertone because many of the environmental contexts in which humans must operate are created and controlled by humans, implying that we can genuinely help people lead better lives if we learn how to fiddle the environmental dials the right way. Our power in this regard is far from limitless, but hardly insignificant (I’ll return to this at the end of the review).Behave also contains strong arguments for the elimination of poverty and abuse, especially in the lives of children. Sapolsky grinds out a glut of ghastly facts about how “childhood adversity” can compromise people later in life:""Childhood adversity increases the odds of an adult having (a) depression, anxiety, and/or substance abuse; (b) impaired cognitive capacity, particularly related to frontocortical function; (c) impaired impulse control and emotion regulation; (d) antisocial behavior, including violence; and (e) relationships that replicate the adversities of childhood (e.g., staying with an abusive partner)."" (194)He immediately follows up by pointing out that “some individuals endure miserable childhoods just fine,” and makes it clear that anything goes when looking at a particular case (194). But the trending effects of childhood adversity are undeniable and terrible. Like many other insights in Behave, this is not anything we didn’t already know; it’s the sheer volume and artful presentation of Sapolsky’s converging evidence that gives his work inimitable force. He is also not afraid to bind these findings to strong, empirically-based arguments that reject egregious income inequality and promote investment in public goods:""It’s not so much that poverty predicts poor heath; it’s poverty amid plenty––income inequality. The surest way to make someone feel poor is to rub their nose in what they don’t have…When social capital decreases (thanks to inequality), up goes psychological stress…If you want to improve health and quality of life for the average person in a society, you spend money on public goods––better public transit, safer streets, cleaner water, better public schools, universal health care…Inequality means more secession of the wealthy from contributing to the public good."" (294-5)There’s no denying that this is a kind of liberal do-gooder wishlist, tinged with Sapolsky’s political leanings. Although it leaves him open to criticism, I admire Sapolsky for linking research with certain normative outcomes when he deems it appropriate. It is a fitting strategy for this moment in time, when the notion of any truly “objective” source of information has become obsolete. The best we’ve got are people like Sapolsky, who humbly bend the knee to reason and reality even when they’d rather the universe were otherwise, and who also fight tooth and nail to be heard when reason and reality actually support their political points of view.The final aspects of Behave I want to take up are Sapolsky’s direct claims that we can and should use science to improve the chances of people acting well instead of badly, along with his implicit argument that narrative and storytelling have a huge role to play in this grand project. While science is perhaps humanity’s most powerful method for analyzing and improving environmental conditions, narrative is a timeless tool for teaching people to assume the perspectives of others and to individuate potential enemies instead of reducing them to faceless members of a reviled out-group. This comes through in Sapolsky’s recommendations for dealing with humanity’s inescapably tribal nature:""From massive, breathtaking barbarity to countless pinpricks of microaggression, Us versus Them has produced oceans of pain. Yet our generic goal is not to 'cure' us of Us/Them dichotomizing. It can’t be done…If we accept that there will always be sides, it’s a nontrivial to-do list item to always be on the side of angels. Distrust essentialism. Keep in mind that what seems like rationality is often just rationalization, playing catch-up with subterranean forces that we never suspect. Focus on the larger, shared goals. Practice perspective taking,. Individuate, individuate, individuate. Recall the historical lessons of how often the truly malignant Thems keep themselves hidden and make third parties the fall guy."" (423-4)Sapolsky doesn’t take what I see as the next logical step here, which is to assert that the easiest way people can begin checking off his anti-tribal “to-do list” is to engage with stories that open the way to novel perspectives and unfamiliar modes of moral calculus. We should draw heavily on the power of narrative to simulate social complexity and teach the lessons Sapolsky rightly identifies as essential for ethical education. He points out in a later chapter that, despite its considerable downsides, “our confusion of the literal and the metaphorical, our granting of life-threatening sanctity to the symbolic, can be used to bring about the best of our behaviors” (579). There is a momentous marriage between the arts and sciences embedded in this outlook––a marriage more sacred than any of the supposedly sacrosanct folderol that has hitherto spawned from the imaginative shit-heap of human history.Stories can teach us to think and act better, but only science can deliver the building blocks and blueprints for our better world. When wrapping up a discussion of how former enemies reach reconciliation, Sapolsky implores readers to “recognize that science can teach us how to make events like these more likely” (670). He knows it’s a game of probability; we can’t force people to be good, but we can make it systemically easier for them to make the right choice, even if we know the “rightness” of that choice will always be at least partially if not wholly circumstantial. The more we learn about the light and dark tendencies inherent in human nature and particular arenas of action, the more capable we become of incentivizing instances of good behavior and minimizing instances of bad behavior. Scrupulousness of the highest order is called for, but the project is both worthy and necessary.I’d be delighted to spin out some final words that would drive home everything that is special about this book, but I couldn’t hope to top Sapolsky himself:""If you had to boil this book down to a single phrase, it would be 'It’s complicated.' Nothing seems to cause anything; instead everything just modulates something else. Scientists keep saying, “We used to think X, but now we realize that…” Fixing one thing often messes up ten more, as the law of unintended consequences reigns. On any big, important issue it seems like 51 percent of the scientific studies conclude one thing, and 49 percent conclude the opposite. And so on. Eventually it can seem hopeless that you can actually fix something, can make things better. But we have no choice but to try. And if you are reading this, you are probably ideally suited to do so. You’ve amply proven you have intellectual tenacity. You probably also have running water, a home, adequate calories, and lows odds of festering with a bad parasitic disease. You probably don’t have to worry about Ebola virus, warlords, or being invisible in your world. And you’ve been educated. In other words, you’re one of the lucky humans. So try.""

141,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77785790-david,4,"I think of this book as an introduction to pre-crime. I believe the term that the author uses is ""neurocriminology"", but the essential unifying premise of the book is that human choices are predetermined by complex biological factors which neuroscientists are just beginning to understand in ways that will eventually allow these specialists to predict very specific criminal and antisocial behaviors before, sometimes long before, the actors consciously choose them. We inherently function as if our choices are independent, spontaneous and free. Westerners particularly tend to view ourselves as autonomous individuals. This book will shatter these notions. Most or all of our choices are made before we are consciously aware of them, and most of our choices are not really originate in the individual. Our thoughts and decisions arise from our primordial past, our education, and the biological / environmental conditions immediately preceding ""our"" decisions.The most difficult aspect of the book for me was the insufferable liberalism of the author. The book opens with a gratuitous fantasy about all the horrible things the author would do to Hitler, if given the chance. The author also avails himself of every opportunity to illustrate how racist and bigoted white people are compared to nonwhites. It's never made clear why the author harbors such biases, but it's clear that he feels both justified and righteous for doing so.The concessions which the author makes concerning human biology and behavior are all the more enlightening given his openly hard left bias. For example, Sapolsky conclusively denies that ""nurture"" is the pre-eminent factor in determining human behavior. At the same time, he also gives evidence to show that inherited, genetic traits are strongly modified by the environment, whether that be biochemical or social.Sapolsky affirms the biological reality of kin selection by citing mouse studies showing that mammals produce biochemicals enabling individuals to ""smell"" how closely related other individuals are. Mice, among others, preferentially socialize with individuals whom they sense are more closely related, all else being equal. On the other hand, mice and other animals can be trained artificially to ignore this natural bias for their kin and affiliate with non-related individuals.Similarly, the author points out that human social structures tend to be ethnocentric. Human studies show that whites have an innate, preconscious bias towards their own kind and against blacks. Nevertheless, it's possible to ""overcome"" this ""xenophobia"" with appropriate conditioning, according to the author. Sapolsky consistently recognizes the fact that humans and animals naturally desire to bond with relatives and kin, yet he regularly affirms this natural tendency is ""bad"" or ""xenophobic"".The ""fallacy of naturalism"" struck me as a profound insight into the character not only of Sapolsky, but of the leftist cultural phenomenon as a whole. Such liberals are characterized by the belief that what is natural and instinctive is often wrong and must be artificially re-engineered in order to achieve harmony. By contrast, the opposing view of many conservatives is that nature is correct, even sacrosanct. This view of nature's correctness is easily seen in Austrian Economics, for instance.Another key aspect of the liberal left versus the conservative right that I noticed in this book was the fact that liberal tendencies typically arise from people who are insulated from the exigencies of life relative to those people who are regularly exposed to hardship. Sapolsky cites studies showing, for instance, that conservative people experience nightmares more frequently and suffer from more adversity in general than their liberal counterparts.This adversity-conservatism correlation was also illustrated by a narrative describing the social transformation of a troop of baboons from an endogamous, tribal, aggressive, and patriarchal community to a relatively exogamous, passive, and female-dominant one. How did this transformation occur? It occurred in response to an unlimited supply of low-cost food: the troop settled near a garbage dump where they ate leftovers from human tourists and became ""liberalized"".The same appears to be true for primitive human society. Sapolsky devotes considerable space to the question of whether archaic hunter-gatherer and pastoral human societies were violent and aggressive or peaceful and harmonious. What he shows is that scarcity of resources provokes the former, while abundance promotes the latter. Thus, the ""noble savage"" resolves to the ""well-fed savage"" who becomes more savage and less noble he becomes more hungry.Conservatism and hunger are not only linked in the case of monkeys and tribal humans. Sapolsky notes that criminal justices statistically deliver harsher sentences when they have skipped breakfast. Combined with the observation that conservative people often have more nightmares and other adverse experiences, a theme emerges: liberalism of all kinds is the natural product of affluence and excess, while conservatism is the natural response to adversity and hardship.However, culture is not merely the expression of environmental resources over time. Behavior is embedded in the biology and genetics of the individuals forming a community. Sapolsky cites the famous Dmitry Belyayev Russian Fox study which showed that selective breeding could produce docile foxes. Sapolsky also cited a similar study showing that feral behavioral traits could be bred out of rats. These studies showed, according to Sapolsky, that behaviors which we think of a volitional and ""free"" may, in fact, be the inevitable result of genetic selection.This is a fascinating admission from a leftist author since it forms the key premise of ""A Troublesome Inheritance"" by Nicholas Wade. Wade's book is described as ""controversial"" largely because it applies the Russian Fox study (among others) to human society. Sapolsky shies away from such conclusions, yet both he and Wade agree that human behavior is heritable, just like animal behavior is. Further, both explicitly reject the absurd ""blank slate"" hypothesis of the social constructivists. Sapolsky's book can, in many ways, be seen a single, massive refutation of ""blank slate"" theory, yet in practice, Sapolsky advocates against the idea that our heritable traits are generally good. Our natural proclivity to identify and associate with kin leads, in his view, to violence, ""xenophobia"", and antisocial behavior. Thus, Sapolsky sees it as necessary for social harmony to scientifically overcome our natural tendency towards ""pseudospeciation"" based on biological factors like genes and race.Sapolsky regularly returns to the theme of ""green-beard effects"" wherein individuals in society identify and associate with individuals who share specific phenotypical traits, such as dark skin or blue eyes. Sapolsky automatically asserts that such effects are irrational, even dangerous. With this in mind, he documents various scientifically-validated techniques for replacing natural, racially-based green-beard effects with artificial ones, such as affiliation on the basis of organized sports.Conservative, ethnocentric thinkers like Wade, Pat Buchanan, and Ann Coulter observe the same green-beard and kin-selection effects but that such effects are both good and natural. In the conservative paradigm, separation of the tribe is the solution, not the problem. Both sides admit the existence of the natural tendency to form kin-based tribes, yet authors like Sapolsky generally affirm that advocacy of such nativism constitutes the dangerous logical fallacy of ""moral naturalism"".Sapolsky regularly makes jabs at moral naturalism. His main criticism is that what is perceived to be natural at one time often changes later. Thus, culture mediates our perception of what is ""natural"" and ""good"" versus what is ""unnatural"" and ""bad"". Sapolsky sees this as a an opportunity for reshaping social perceptions to accept new ""unnatural"" things as ""good"" and ""natural"", while the conservative instinct is to pass on what is perceived as natural from one generation to the next.If we accept the essential premise of Behave, then the choice to be liberal (in the sense of adoption what is unnatural and foreign) versus conservative (the preservation of the natural) is biological and subconscious rather than objective and rational. Furthermore, if we accept that the instinct to conserve kin-based groups and ostracize foreign races is dangerous and subversive, then it is easy to cast racial conservatism as a mental disorder rather than a rational decision. The same is true in reverse: if liberal tendencies are heritable, biological, and subversive rather than rational and ""free"", then liberalism is a ultimately disease. This isn't a new idea: Michael Savage, for instance, is notable for his regular insistence that liberalism is a mental disorder. In the opposite camp, it's not uncommon for liberals to insist that conservatism is the result of inbreeding, mental retardation, or childhood trauma.The ultimate end of rational dialog comes when we finally accept that people with views opposite to our own are not going to change their minds or become ""converted"" on the basis of rational argumentation and evidence. Various biological markers predispose people to adopt the views which they hold such that the conscious, rational portion of our brain constitutes a thin veneer over the primal realities of our nature.Viewing liberalism and conservatism as biological traits leads us to the ultimate question: will liberalism or conservatism ultimately wipe out the opposing trait and achieve hegemony in the human population, or at least in specific human population groups? Drawing on the above-mentioned studies, I conclude that while resources are abundant, docile, passive, and liberal traits will be dominant while virile, defensive, and conservative traits will become recessive relics of a dark, irrelevant past."
142,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7422525-scriptor-ignotus,5,"IT’S COMPLICATED “I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.”  — Sir Isaac NewtonWhy do people do what they do? Of all the sciences, that of our own behavior is often the most unsettling in its mysteriousness. Delivering a precise and comprehensive causal explanation for any form of human behavior is almost always impossible, and to attempt even a general account requires one to interface with a bewildering array of methodologies, disciplinary perspectives, spatial and temporal scales of analysis, and the necessary but overwhelmingly nuanced and complex interrelationship between all these factors. If any piece of the causal puzzle is missing—which is always the case, as biologists have not (yet) fully mapped the causal chains that produce our most unique and sophisticated behaviors—then none of the other pieces quite fit together either, leaving unanswered some of the most fundamental questions regarding who and what we are. We are enigmatic even (perhaps especially) to ourselves—as psychology and the humanities have long attested—even though self-knowledge may be the most critical necessity for the survival and flourishing of our species and its planetary habitat. Behave is an incredibly ambitious cross-disciplinary gesture towards a complete picture of the biological substrata of human behavior. As a study which attempts to account for both the profoundest depths of cruelty and sadism and the most exalted heights of compassion and benevolence characteristic of our kind, and which attempts not to override and dismiss but to affirm and buttress the full spectrum of approaches for thinking about human nature, it is the most genuinely humanistic science book I have read. Behave is organized in two main parts. The first part, composed of the first nine chapters, is likely the most thorough exposition of the multilayered biological underpinnings of human behavior ever put in print. Each chapter is framed as part of a skeletal narrative: a behavior has just occurred: what happened in the seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, years, centuries, and millennia beforehand that could help explain why it happened? Each consecutive chapter widens Sapolsky’s analytical lens. When we think about what happened one second before the behavior occurred, we’re in the realm of cellular neurobiology. Neurons in the brain are generating action potentials in response to a stimulus; these disturbances of the negative charge inside of a neuron, caused by openings in the dendritic spines which allow positively-charged ions to flow through, travel from the dendritic spines through the cell body and, if the electrical disturbance passes a certain threshold, through the axon to the axon terminals, which send neurotransmitters across synapses that connect with specialized receptors on the dendritic spines of subsequent neurons, which causes the opening of channels in the membrane for positive ions, which generates action potentials in those neurons, and so on. The collection of 100 billion neurons in each human body and their integrated axonal projections are, at the cellular level, what constitute the vast and intricate circuitry of the nervous system. The generation of collective action potentials in billions of neurons in a particular brain region is what neuroscientists refer to when they speak about the “activation” of brain regions in response to stimuli. Move the timescale back to seconds or minutes before the behavior, and we’re looking at the macro organization of the brain. At this level our behaviors are mediated through the interaction of brain regions. The ancient amygdala, the almond-shaped core of the limbic system, mediates fear, anxiety, and aggression, and is often the first brain region to activate in response to unfamiliar stimuli. People who demonstrate more implicit bias against racial out-groups show more amygdaloid activation when presented with faces of people of another race, and the amygdala shows growth and overactivity in the brains of people suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Overlaying the amygdala are the higher limbic structures, which regulate base emotions, and the cortex, which mediates most of our higher cognitive functions, such as memory, language, motor skills, facial recognition, and contextual judgment. The newest brain region, in evolutionary terms, is the prefrontal cortex (PFC): the crown jewel of executive function, the seat of strategic knowledge organization, delayed gratification, social and cultural acclimation, contextualization, and the regulation of emotionality and impulsivity. It is also the last brain region to mature in an individual lifetime, not coming fully online until around age 25—a critical fact when thinking about the brilliance and deviancy so uniquely characteristic of adolescence.The late maturation of the PFC indicates something astonishing about the evolution of the human brain. The wiring of the PFC is not significantly more complex than that of other cortical regions, nor does it consist of a different type of neuron—with a few limited exceptions. Biologically speaking, it isn’t any “harder” to develop a prefrontal cortex than it is to develop any other part of the brain, which likely means that the delayed development of the PFC was selected for by our hominid ancestors. We evolved in such a way that the makeup of the frontal cortex, because its development is delayed, is shaped by the makeup of our other brain regions, which in turn are shaped by personal experiences. By developing later, the PFC is designed to accommodate the neurological “lessons” of our own, individual lives. The genetic program of our brain development has evolved to liberate the frontal cortex from genetics. Of course, none of these brain regions are discrete entities, and none are free from the influences of hormones and environmental factors. Expanding our timescale to account for the hours to months before a behavior occurs involves reference to endocrinology, the effect of hormones on behavior via their influencing of the nervous system, and the plasticity of the brain. Here Sapolsky debunks some common misunderstandings about the role of certain hormones in behavior; namely testosterone and oxytocin. Hormones are not “instigators” of behavior; in fact, one of the overarching themes of the entire book is that there is never a single biological cause of any behavior, but rather a vast field of facilitating and inhibiting factors that influence the probability of certain behaviors to degrees that are not always quantifiable. Androgens like testosterone are facilitators of behavior. They make the amygdala more sensitive to triggers of aggression, but only among people who are already predisposed to acts of aggression. Nor is aggression the single, inevitable result of testosterone production. Testosterone levels increase not only in response to situations demanding aggression, but also in situations in which one’s social status is uncertain, changing, or perceived to be under threat. In those situations testosterone does not facilitate violence per se; it facilitates whatever behavior is necessary for one to secure status. If a society bases its status relations on, say, charitability, then testosterone won’t cause you to strangle a cheetah; it will cause you to insist on paying the tab at a restaurant. If testosterone has an unfairly negative reputation, oxytocin has an unfairly positive one. This “luv hormone” facilitates bonds between mothers and infants, bonds between humans and their canine pets, and the pair-bonding of monogamous romantic couples; but these salutary effects are relegated to in-group relations. Oxytocin increases our prosociality towards an “Us”, but it also makes us more suspicious of “Thems”. It does not facilitate free love, but rather parochialism. In the second part of the book, Sapolsky attempts to synthesize the complicated layers of knowledge laid out in the first half, and to offer some insight as to how these biological factors influence our best and worst behaviors. I can hardly do justice to the nuances of the discussions in each chapter, but they address such topics as our instinctual categorization of people into In-Groups and Out-Groups and how and why we prioritize some dimensions of “Us-ness” over others; the unique human capacity for establishing and navigating hierarchies and the physically corrosive effects of having the “wrong” status in a particular social context (Sapolsky is a Rousseauian primitivist, and considers the agricultural revolution to be the greatest blunder in human history for the role it played in establishing rigid and dramatic status hierarchies); the neurological correlates of empathy (and how it’s better if our altruism is instinctive rather than an act of willpower); how metaphorical thinking is innate to our biology (and why a society is in extremely dangerous territory if certain members of it are persuasively associated with insects or fecal matter; hyperactivity of the insular cortex, which regulates disgust responses, can make one an ethnic cleanser—or worse, a germaphobe); the question of free will and how our conception of justice should be framed accordingly (Sapolsky is a strong determinist and thinks a criminal justice system based on punishment is totally irrational); and, of course, war and peace. Why do people do what they do? Sapolsky’s short answer is: it’s really complicated. No, really, that’s his answer; that’s the conclusion he comes to at the end of this big, beautiful disaster of a book. But understanding, though difficult, is possible; and with understanding comes a spirit of mercy which could perhaps change the world."

This is one of those rare authors who can educate the reader while entertaining regarding a topic of staggering complexity. I hope this gift does indeed carry over to his classroom at Stanford in which case there will undoubtedly be a lot of inspired youth pursuing answers to the mysteries of the brain. I took considerable time to read this book as there were many opportunities to reread the passage or concept at hand and contemplate the subject in depth. There is also great reference information and appendices to help those of us needing liberal doses of assistance. As one of the greatest benefits of such books are the attributions and opportunity to read the books referenced I will add one for consideration that won't disappoint: ""The Archaeology of Mind: Neuroevolutionary Origins of Human Emotion."" by Jaak Panksepp and Lucy Biven. This is worthy of mentioning in the same review as Professor Sapolsky's masterpiece.  As with so many things in life the satisfaction is directly proportional to the effort expended and Robert Sapolsky's book, ""Behave,"" will help you better understand what chemistry and brain structures combined with environmental factors are potentially at the root of this feeling. This is not an author espousing an absolute deterministic view, but leaves room for something more that makes us human that our science has yet to discover the metrology to measure. The intellectual humility is rare and a reflection of the author's wisdom."

147,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31302406-lori,5,"I have a very quick rule of thumb to measure up books meant popularise science: if it leaves one thinking ""ow it's much more complicated than that"", then it's a good book. And I was very pleased to see the author echo—explicitly, obviously this was implicit throughout the book— much of the same sentiment in the Epilogue: If you had to boil down this book to a single phrase it would be ""it's complicated"" (p. 674)   Highly recommended to anyone trying to understand what it is to inhabit this meat suit we call a human body. Although, fair warning, you will be left with a great feeling of uncertainty afterwards; i.e. you will be made aware of your own ignorance, and most important—hopefully—you will shut up about ""human nature"" at every turn. You can also expect to have your (yes, your) simplistic notions of biological determinism shattered.  Now, a slightly more elaborate exposition than ""it's complicated"": Any meaningful analysis of the behaviour of human species deals with biology-environment interactions. One can expect to learn that: testosterone, oxytocin, mirror neurons, and pretty much any new fad protein, neurotransmitter, or brain region does not work the way you thought it did.  The negative effects of poverty, inequality, and social hierarchy in general are laid bare—or shorter SES (socio-economic status). The science is in: these societal dynamics wreak havoc on everything from IQ (p. 249) to health, to exacerbating anti-social behavior. Most fascinating is the fact that the lower you are on the wealth inequality ladder, the poorer your health. And get this, only a third of this degradation is due to actual, poorer material conditions. It is the subjective experience that matters, and the definitive knowledge and reality of having someone who's infinitely richer than you, and capable of shitting down the ladder—so to speak—on you. (p. 441 contains a nice bullet-point list of the known effects). Now, I am going to go on a tangent, to something the author did not mention, but as a filthy red I am almost obliged to do so. If we look into the work of Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century, and more importantly in Karl Marx's Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, Vol 1, we see capitalism's inevitable, structural tendency to create utterly obscene inequalities. Now, given that we know the negative effects of inequality on human beings and the causes of these inequalities, it should be trivial to synthesise a necessary political project: anti-capitalism.Ok, now, back to the content of the book. Robert Sapolsky—rightly so—criticizes Steven Pinker's The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined for cherry picking some of the data referring to primitive societies (p. 311-315). Mislabelling of hunter-horticulturalists (p. 321) as hunter gatherers, thus shadowing the plethora of research showing distinct ""pro-social"" behaviour of the former group. Failure to adjust for length of conflict (p. 614-620) in determining how violent historical periods were, doubly baffling given that Pinker all the while (correctly) adjusted the total victim count for overall world population size at that time—glaring oversight. Overall, a fairly positive critique, but one that leaves the reader with the impression ""it's more complicated than that"" (unlike Pinker's own conclusions). Note: the page references in this paragraph are to ""Behave"".  My own point of contention with the book, is that it omits a plethora of anthropological, and historical studies into human civilization (Lewis Mumford, E.A Gutkind, David Graeber)—while tapping into what seems to be a clichee body of work that is being passed around in the same Ivy League circles (essentially the same body of work as used by Pinker). This also leads to the author using some historically impoverished definitions of ""individualist"" and ""collectivist"" cultures—the latter being extremely poorly represented, and mostly by modern ""samples"". Mentions of ancient, medieval, and revolutionary period cities, which would be much better examples than modern ones, are woefully absent.  In short, this books is broad in its analysis of biology, but rather narrow in its analysis of society. But nonetheless, it is still an endless mine of fresh knowledge that would take forever for me to go through in this review. Luckily, the Epilogue has a nice bullet-point list (albeit it is not exhaustive of the content). Overall, Behave it deeply fascinating, and definitely worth a read! I highly recommend this book to everyone!"
148,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30276417-nancy-mills,5,"Fascinating book that begins with some rather difficult lessons in endocrinology and neuroloscience, but after the author lays that foundation, the books blooms into a dense but highly entertaining tomb about how behavior is affected by genes, hormones, environmental factors (that of course affect hormones), and then the guy actually has the nerve to go into the topic of Free Will ... and does a great job all the way. Here I am compelled to add a lengthy quote from the author, in a footnote, of course:""And the one thing I'm not going anywhere near is this New Age-y notion, ""Of course we have free will. You can't say that our behavior is determined by a mechanistic universe, because the universe is indeterminate, because of quantum mechanics."" Argh. What anyone sensible who has thought about this will point out is that (a)the consequences of subatomic indeterminacy of quantum mechanics (about which I understand zero) don't ripple upward enough to influence behavior, and (b) if they did, the result wouldn't be the freedom to will your behavior. It would be the utter randomization of behavior. In the words of philosopher/neuroscientist Sam Harris, a free will trasher, if quantum mechanics actually played a role in any of this, 'Every thought and action would seem to merit the statement ""I don't know what just came over me."""" Except you wouldn't actually be able to make that statement, since you'd just makinggarly sounds because the muscles in your tongue would be doing all sorts of random things.""Well I guess he told THEM!There is a chapter toward the back of the book entitled ""Biology, the Criminal Justice System, and Free Will,"" which will get your frontal cortex neurons twitching if anything will.Conclusions aren't cut and dry, if that's what you were hoping, but certainly will give the reader a tremendous background, if one can manage to absorb even half of the book's contents. If you're not all that into biology and long scientific words, you can get away with skimming the tough parts. I plowed through it and found it very rewarding. There are 3 Appendices, all good that you can skip if you don't want to learn about Neuroscience, Endocrinology or Protein Basics.Dr. Sapolsky is sympathetic, maybe even empathetic (the books discusses these phenomena) toward the the reader who may find the material dense, and his humor more than redeems his asking us to familiarize ourselves with all this stuff. Anterior Something Cingulate. dmELvE. vm LLpe. I don't know. A whole bunch of acronyms. Half way through the book I accidentally found out that there is a glossary in the back that defines each acronym which certainly makes things tons easier. Anyway, the author is understanding. One passage, for example, reads ""This is a bold assertion that the heuristic of dialectical materialism not only extends beyond the economic world into the naturalistic one, but is ontologically rooted in the essential sameness of both worlds' dynamic resolution of irresolvable contradictions."" Before the you throw the book across the room, the author adds this footnote: ""I have no idea what it is that I just wrote..."" He bravely plows ahead with ""It is Marx and Engels as trilobite and snail,"" and immediately footnotes again: ""Ditto."" Truthfully my main complaint is that the footnotes, which are numerous and are at times the best parts of the text, and printed in such teeny print that even with my glasses I had trouble reading them after the sun went down with my 60 watt bulb. There are, of course, about a million end notes to, which I seldom bothered with.Sapolsky, in his final chapter, delves into War and Peace (the subject, not the novel) and reveals some very interesting behaviors on the battlefield versus way back behind the lines where men in fancy uniforms make strategics decisions. And the part about drone pilots, who shoot targets thousands of miles away, nevertheless get bad cases of PTSD in spite of the fact that they are never physically putting their own lives in danger. Remarkable findings.One of the most worthwhile books I've read this year, highly recommended for people who like to read and don't mind a little mental exercise."
149,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,4,"This brick of a book purports to be an interdisciplinary explanation of human behavior, drawing from biology, psychology, and sociology, and everything from primate studies to well-known works in various fields. It’s big, at 717 pages of actual text followed by references; it’s broad; and as such it’s a little bit simplistic. Even at this size, there’s not quite room to develop all of the material. The first half or so of the book is more focused on the “hard” science, beginning with how neurons communicate with each other, and working its way up through hormones, genes, brain development through childhood and adulthood and how this is affected by trauma, and the evolution of species. The second half is more focused on psychology: us vs. them dichotomies, moral decisionmaking, the causes of violence, and whether the criminal justice system really makes sense when all human behavior is ultimately driven by biology. (Sapolsky argues no, but I’m not so sure. Where would we be as a species, or as individuals, if we all just shrugged our shoulders and gave in to ideas of biological determinism?)I certainly learned a lot from this book, which contains a ton of information presented in a way that is understandable to a non-scientist – though I struggled a bit with some of the early chapters. It provides a strong synthesis and framework for understanding information from biology and social sciences. That said, on the subjects that I did know something about, it seemed a little simplified. Fair enough; entire books have been written on subjects that comprise a single chapter here. As other reviewers have suggested, Sapolsky perhaps accepts too many psychological studies uncritically, without discussing psychology’s replication crisis, in which dozens of famous studies, when run again using the exact same methods and parameters, failed to produce the same headline-worthy results. That said, in general Sapolsky seems to take a fair approach to his material, presenting and evaluating multiple viewpoints in areas that have generated controversy. His writing is readable given the subject matter, and there’s a goofy-professor personality behind it that occasionally shines through. I wouldn’t take everything here as gospel – and I suppose we never should, since new scientific discoveries regularly require us to reevaluate what we thought was true – but the book did leave me a little more educated than I was before."

What is it with biologists and well written non-fiction that does not completely gloss over the details? The book is fairly long and appears to lack a central thesis except that ""it's complicated"". But ""Nothing seems to cause anything, instead everything just modulates everything else"" is probably closer to the truth than the endless internet debates over nature vs nurture.However even though the book is expansive, remembering to critique both sides of the debate (not even Pinker or Ramachandran are spared) while being filled with citation and humorous footnotes, I still had a few minor issues that force me to discount other things as well. Things like Wellesley effect and Freakonomics explanation of drop in crime rate in US are presented without any remarks about the contentious nature of the findings (largely believed to be false I think, but I could be wrong)."

It's probably a little too textbook-like for some readers, but for those who really want to get a good general grounding in what science in 2017 tells us about behavior, there is probably no better place to go.I particularly liked the discussions on the law and neuroscience, and a really nuanced take on role (or lack thereof) of genetics in behavioral determinism, and final chapter relating to war (and peace)."
152,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,4,"It is common these days to come across people who have developed a strong dislike for all reductionist approaches. They prefer holistic views, and are suspicious of any knowledge that has been derived through breaking up a big problem into smaller chunks. I can understand why they feel that way, but I have always felt that such feelings can only be harbored when one is unfamiliar with the depth of the subject in question, and therefore assumes a simplistic view of things. For example, I know of many people who are suspicious of normal medical science because it treats each organ as a separate functional entity, and expertise within the medical profession is divided by such narrow specializations. They prefer a medical science that looks at the big picture, which includes not just the various sub-systems, but combines the body with the mind. This is a wise and noble thought until we realize the complexity of the whole system. Once we do, the justification of breaking it up into smaller systems become obvious. All the knowledge we have about our body could not have been attained without first breaking it up into the various organs and trying to understand how they work in isolation. Once that has reached a certain level of details can we afford to put them back together and investigate the far more complex interactions between these systems. If we tried to bypass the reductionist step in the first place, we would have been stuck with vague and faulty theories of how the body works, as can be found in all ancient texts. A responsible form of holistic science cannot be rushed. In many cases we may not even be ready to take that step, and must wait till we have better understanding of the parts.Of all the systems we have investigated so far, the physical systems of materials and forces, chemical systems, astronomical systems, and biological systems – they all yielded fairly well to the scientific reductionist methodologies. However, the biggest challenge lies ahead in understanding the most complex system we have encountered so far – our mind. Huge progress has been made in this direction in the last few decades. The progress happened through advances in neuroscience, biology, computational science, evolutionary sciences, psychology etc. Problems that were beyond any convincing and demonstrable theory are regularly being converted into understandable bits of knowledge. In this environment of tremendous progress, where all the different branches seems to be converging, it is not unexpected that many specialists start to believe that they have finally figured it out. I have read many books where brilliant minds would try to prove how their specialty, be it neuroscience or evolutionary biology, can finally explain our behavior, our morality, our aesthetic sense, etc. in terms of their science alone.This book is the only one I have read that not only celebrates the great accomplishments of our reductionist approach towards understanding of how the mind works, but also exposes the severe limitations of not appreciating the complexity of all these subsystems when they work together. He systematically shows how each of the systems involved, our neuronal bran, the environment we live in, both in our mother’s womb and the environment outside, our endocrinal systems, our genes, how they all interact and influence each other is incredibly complex ways. The only way we can understand the whole thing is when we allow for these interactions. In other words, why we need to look at the whole thing holistically, while admitting that it can only be done when we understand the parts really well. It is a sobering document because it shows the challenge that lies ahead. Modelling the complexity of the whole system is so complex then we may never be able to crack it open. That is, understanding of an individual mind may remain impossible, while we get better at understanding them in aggregate.The real value of this book is not just in convincing us that full understanding of our mind cannot happen until we integrate all the pieces together, but in nudging us towards a slightly different mindset that can be applied to all complex problems. As in everything else, when we solve one problem, it only presents us with an even more complex problem. And to me, that’s what makes life worth living – that there will never be a shortage of things to ponder."
153,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17937883-avi-singh,5,"Behave is an ambitious book that seeks to explain human behavior at almost every level of abstraction - what parts of the brain lit up in the second before an action (the lizard-ish amygdala, or the primate-y frontal cortex), what sensory information obtained in the past few seconds to minutes “primed” you for it (if people are shown a random string of positive words, they tend to behave nicely in a cooperative game), what hormones were secreted in the past few hours to days (effects of testosterone, oxytocin etc.), what happened in the years before (say during adolescence or childhood), or in the prenatal period (kids show preference to flavors the mother consumed when pregnant, can hear things and show preference to stories they heard while in the womb etc., the “boy/girl” brain development, connections with sexual orientation / identity), what cultural forces in the last few hundred years shaped the behavior (for example, difference between individualistic and collectivistic cultures), and last, but not the least, how evolution in the last thousands of years influence behavior (ideas from sociobiology or evolutionary psychology - kin selection, reciprocative altruism, etc. ). The second part of the book has a slightly different format - as the author delves into specific human behavioral traits (like Us vs Them-ing, hierarchies and obedience, morals, usage of metaphors, violence, etc.), and discusses them in detail, often drawing the fundamental expounded upon in the previous chapters. The book has a entertaining myth-busting style. It will present a hypothesis (say testosterone is responsible for aggression), present experiments in favor of it (castration reduces aggression, injecting testosterone back in brings it back), and then present more experiments that poke holes in the earlier somewhat simplistic explanation (raising testosterone to 10% or 200% of original levels makes no difference as compared to raising to 100%). He also talks about the wars within academia on numerous theories/ideas - neurogenesis, mirror neurons, sociobiology, Stanford Prison Experiment findings etc., which, apart from being entertaining, also reinforce my belief that the author does not only present the theories that he “likes”. Though it’s definitely possible that he did that at certain points in the book, I think he presented the nuanced view more often than not. Sometimes, there’s an information overload, as the author presents results from 5-10 studies in a single paragraph. Also, since a lot of these tend to be psychology studies, their results have to be taken with an appropriate amount of salt. Some of the later chapters are a bit preachy (using intuition vs reason in in-group and out-group interactions, why the current justice system is stupid, how to reduce violence)- but since they are backed by fairly solid science, and logical (to me) explanations, I still enjoyed reading them. In the end, I think it’s a great book, and is peppered with humorous anecdotes, both personal and historical, which makes it easier to go through its ~800 pages. The only “limitation” of the book is its scope - I don’t really think any single book can cover all the issues that this book tackles - but a list compiled from the books referenced here would probably make a great reading list. I might do that at some point. "

It was first published in May, 2017. This is one miracle of a book. I don’t know where to start…“Someone does something lousy and selfish to you in a game, and the extent of insular and amygdaloid activation predicts how much outrage you feel and how much revenge you take.” ― Robert M. Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst Book focuses on Robert Sapolsky’s attempt to tackle seemingly impossible question. That is to look at our behavior from every possible angle: biological, psychological, physiological…and there are some historical and cultural angles thrown in to it too. We start with neurobiological angle: what happens in our brains when some specific behavior occurs, what effect do our hormones have on us, what is our genetic makeup, how are we different or even not that different from rest of the animal kingdom… This is not enough. Sapolsky continues by how environment affects us and also focuses on age-old question: are we formed more by nature or nurture? And indeed as mentioned, then we continue with psychology, history, culture…Behave is among the best nonfiction reads ever. It’s stunning, it’s big and it’s absolutely beautiful. I learned so much and it also changed the way I see some things. Here are some of my picks throughout the chapters of the book:Chapter 4: Hours to Days Before: How testosterone increases confidence and optimism and decreases fear and anxiety. Chapter 5: Days to Months Before: Enough time for Arab spring, for a discontented winter or for STDs to spread a lot during a summer of love…and also plenty of time for our brains to change…How there’s long-term LTP and LTD. And veryy long term LTP and LTD and how they work differently in different regions of our brains.“Testosterone makes people cocky, egocentric, and narcissistic.”― Robert M. Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and WorstChapter 15: Metaphors We Kill By: How Rwandan genocide came to be and how metaphors were used as a weapon. Oh the power of metaphors. I have never before realized this. During Rwandan genocide, Tutsis were described as cockroaches. And those cockroaches would steal your husband. They became something that had to be exterminated, swept away from the country. Almost 1 million people dead within 100 days.“Some translation is needed. The Rwandan genocide did not involve tanks, airplanes, dropping bombs or shelling at civilians. There were no concentration camps. No transport trains. No Zyklon-B. There was no bureaucratic banality of evil. There were hardly even many guns.” ― Robert M. Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and WorstChapters 6 & 16: Author explained PMS syndrome. He also explained how PMS syndrome has been used as a criminal defense. And this is not the only sort of crazy sounding criminal defense in the book. There’s also a lot of talk about the development of the brain in earlier chapters and whether a person is or isn’t fully aware of his actions and consequences of those actions due to it… Adolescence. Or. Dude, where is my frontal cortex as the chapter is called.What else… Sapolsky uses the analogy of a car with faulty brakes to describe antisocial human behaviour. How judges give less harsh sentences after they have had lunch! Yes you read that right, judges’ rulings’ are harsher when they are hungrier. And this also works with smells. If you’re in a place that smells bad, you more likely to judge a person or a thing in a negative manner, how there was a Christmas truce in 1914 and how in many wars since soldiers had to be threatened to go kill soldiers from the opposite side. And how opposite of love is not hate …it’s indifference. And to conclude. There is no such thing as free will.I loved this book. As you can probably tell from my review, it’s packed with loads and loads of information in a very simplified, easily understood form. Moreover, there’s a sense of humor or sarcasm in the writing and that always gets one more star from me because it’s like authors are laughing at how idiotic some of the things we do are and I really appreciate that (…we do a lot of dumb shit). Maybe the only downside to the book as I was listening to audio version were all the: “footnotes” and “i see her see i see her see i see?”. They were a bit much in spoken. All in all, a fantastic piece of literature.5/5 stars"

But this staggering work is also incredibly rich, like a mental block of cheese that you can only sample in nibbles, and incredibly plastic, meant in the best neurological sense, like a mind actively at work laid bare. And this mind is an incredibly inspiring one. I never took one of his classes, but I think this book is a great representation of what brilliance looks like in a teacher."

I must be his perfect reader-- someone with a working knowledge of popular science, biology, neurology, and psychology-- I get his jokes. He is informative, vastly knowledgable (to put it mildly), speaks to the general reader, and light-handed with his material.I can not think of a better read for the approaching times of neurological understanding of the cause of why people do what they do, and the larger questions of blame in a criminal context.

This is the most comprehensive book I have read on human behavior. Sapolsky goes beyond the (neuro)biological factors and incorporates cultural, psychological and environmental considerations into the discussion. I wouldn't say this is a difficult read but it is a richly complex and detailed book. Sapolsky's sense of humor helps take the edge off things. By the end, the reader is fully aware of the meaning of, 'it's complicated' when attempting to explain human behavior. In essence, it is very complicated and scientists probably have just scratched the surface in their understanding.What struck me is how 'me' vs 'us' vs 'them' factors into things, even in our split second decision making. The chapters discussing the roles of hormones and neurotransmitters were quite interesting and sometimes the information surprised me. Finally, the chapter titled 'Metaphors We Kill By,' discussing symbolism and symbolic values was actually frightening. The different parts of our brain aren't adept at handling that information in a logical way and symbolic meanings can be interpreted as physical pain or rejection. Ouch and Yikes! Scary stuff. After reading all this, I do believe there is some meaning to the saying 'reality is the stories we tell ourselves' (greatly influenced by our brain's interpretation of things, along with hormonal regulation, genetics, environmental factors, childhood experiences, etc.) For anyone who isn't ready to undertake reading this, I'd recommend checking out some of Sapolsky's lectures from Stanford University on YouTube. There is some overlap between the lectures and the contents of the book. His lecturing style offers a comparable representation to his writing style. "

Sapolsky covers genetics, neurology, development, just to get STARTED on the important half of the book. I have a Master's in Psychology but my undergrad was in genetics and I struggled to keep up with the technical stuff in this book (luckily Sapolsky provides appendices with 101s for folk)So I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book to someone first diving into a piece on human nature, perhaps starting with something like Sapiens, or Ten Types of Humans. However if feeling confident or having plenty of time and cognitive energy to devote to this it should be fine.Overall the book is huge and covers so much its hard to really summarize, I loved that between the technical stuff there was the odd joke, or personal touch that always seemed brilliant. Some of the insights from this book will stick with me for life and while much of the content was heavy it was worthwhile."

165,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66276739-adam-marischuk,2,"Two books and two different ratings, but you could save a lot of time by watching the youtube videos of kids trying to not eat marshmellows and coming to your own conclusions about human nature.The first half (including the three appendices) of Behave are the more scientific chapters of the book. The appendices are worth reading if, like me, you haven't formally studied biology in a couple of decades. They are a well written and easily digested summary of neuroscience, endocrinology and proteins.The first nine chapter have an interesting organisation, even if I feel it was not well executed. The idea of tracing an action backwards in time to evaluate the causes of the action has some merit, but Professor Sapolsky fails to remain on task and hence the excessive length of the sections. In the introduction he rails against ""buckets"" or categories of answers (the distinction between biology, psychology and culture) and then follows his own holistic advice. But the resulting chapters are disjointed at best. An editor could have cut the book in half without sacrificing any of the science or the audiences' ability to understand and a little of Aristotle's four causes would have benefited both author and audience. The digressions are sometimes interesting but usually merely political marginalia from an aging ""vertebarte, mammal, ape, human, male, scientist, lefty"" (p. 405)What was particularly interesting in the first few chapters is Professor Sapolsky's ability to find middle ground in the nature/nuture debate by bridging the gap between the two and noting the maliabiliy of nature.I suppose if the book had ended after chapter nine it would have received 3-4 stars.But then Professor Sapolsky continues into what I could only call socio-psychology with a dabbing of neuroscience to back up some rather radical leftist views. His discussions on hierarchy, free will, ethics, religion and war all take the same politically inspired position and do not flow seemlessly from the science. Sometimes it is bias mascarading as science, and othertimes it simply leaves the science aside. His discussion of ethics and utilitarianism is particularly egregious, and this is coming from someone who has little sympathy for utilitarianism. The construction of straw-man arguments does little to help the cause.Professor Sapolsky attempts to reconstruct the Naked Ape (Desmond Morris) but ends up with some monster who only vaguely resembles a man. I am reminded of the G.K. Chesterton quote, ""Take away the supernatural and all that is left is the unnatural"" (Orthodoxy, p 49) His reductionist materialist approach leads him into some strange territory, where rights exist but free will doesn't. Where a complete (and admittedly impossible) revolution of the criminal justice system is necessary. The very subtitle explicitly mentions our best and worst behaviour but he develops no criteria for evaluating one or the other, prefering to rely on ""context, context, context"" (p. 672). I am inclined to buy Jonathan Haidt and Steven Pinker and never pick up another book by Sapolsky. His politics, philosophy, ethics, criminology, even theology and psychology are all so different from any human's lived experience (and the language that goes along with it) that I can only concluded with E.O. Wilson, ""Wonderful theory, wrong species.""A lot more was said a lot better about materialism by David Hume, or about free will by Nietzsche, or mind-body dualism by Descartes, consciousness by Leibniz etc.And to close, he never justified:""I won't pull any punches- I think that its [agriculture's] invention was one of the all-time human blunders"" (p. 326)"

Sapolsky cherry-picks his research to make political points. He is yet another typical liberal intellectual type (so prevalent in education today) that is unable to set aside his own political and social prejudices and present the research in an unbiased way. That is not to say he does not present some interesting research in this book, but he so damages his own credibility with his misapplications of the scientific results and cherry-picking of the science that supports his own skewed views that no reasonable person can accept any of his characterizations or conclusions at face value. What is even more amusing is his repeated condemnations of people who misapply scientific results and cherry-pick the data, all while doing this himself throughout the length of the book. A good percentage of the book is devoted to using scientific research to prove that people who disagree with his political beliefs are unintelligent, unfeeling, etc., and yet he condemns the Nazis for citing science in a similar way to turn the Germans against the Jews. This book should be regarded as nothing but pure drivel and the author should be completely discredited in the world of science."

170,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7208369-miles,5,"Books that examine the relationship between science and morality have become ubiquitous, so readers interested in these important subjects need to choose carefully. It is not an overstatement to say that one could do no better than to alight on Robert M. Sapolsky’s Behave. This engrossing, encyclopedic examination of the causal mechanisms that determine human behavior is a monumental achievement of syncretic thought.This was my first journey into Sapolsky’s singular mind, both joyful and challenging. Covering an almost inconceivably vast landscape of scientific information, this neurobiologist/primatologist takes a playful but responsible approach to some heady topics, delving deep into humanity’s best and worst behaviors while never missing an opportunity to charm the reader with his perspicacious wit. I usually don’t care for comedy in nonfiction, but Sapolsky’s wry humor rarely misses the mark, and is complemented by an impressive ability to synthesize multiple perspectives and extricate sensible conclusions from dense and sometimes-conflicting data. Sapolsky is also transparent about his own biases as a “bleeding heart liberal,” making him a truly lovable genius (and not just in the casual sense).Since it would be folly to try to cover everything this book has to offer in a review, I’ll focus on explaining Sapolsky’s methodology, and then comment on just a few of his most important findings. Sapolsky begins with a necessary critique of how scientists typically explain human behavior, which is to break it down into different “buckets of explanation,” each of which comprises a distinct realm of inquiry:""We tend to use a certain cognitive strategy when dealing with complex, multifaceted phenomena, in that we break down those separate facets into categories, into buckets of explanation…The goal of this book is to avoid such categorial thinking. Putting facts into nice cleanly demarcated buckets of explanation has its advantages––for example, it can help you remember facts better. But it can wreak havoc on your ability to think about those facts. This is because the boundaries between different categories are often arbitrary, but once some arbitrary boundary exists, we forget that it is arbitrary and get way too impressed with its importance…There are not different disciplinary buckets. Instead, each one is the end product of all the biological influences that came before it and will influence all the factors that follow it. Thus, it is impossible to conclude that a behavior is caused by a gene, a hormone, a childhood trauma, because the second you invoke one type of explanation, you are de facto invoking them all. No buckets. A 'neurobiological' or 'genetic' or 'developmental' explanation for a behavior is just shorthand, an expository convenience for temporarily approaching the whole multifactorial arc from a particular perspective."" (5-8, emphasis his)This boundary-busting approach puts Sapolsky squarely in the company of intellectual titans such as Edward O. Wilson and Steven Pinker––interdisciplinary thinkers who have, however imperfectly, combined findings from numerous academics fields to launch humanity into new realms of inquiry and debate. Sapolsky is less poetic than Wilson and less contentious than Pinker, bringing a cautious, even-handed compassion to the science of understanding human nature. As any science reader knows, it is one thing to claim that disciplinary boundaries are arbitrary and ought to be ignored, and quite a different thing to actually demonstrate how this can be done. And while I don’t think Sapolsky fully achieves his stated goal, his efforts to do so are heroic and effectual.The first half of Behave plays out like a tennis match that travels back in time, with the ball representing the focus of Sapolsky’s chapters and the net representing a (somewhat arbitrary) boundary between behavioral mechanisms that operate primarily inside or outside the human body. He begins with “One Second Before,” an explanation of the neurobiology that takes place just before behavior is enacted, then transitions to “Seconds to Minutes Before,” where he discusses immediate environmental stimuli that contribute to behavior. Next comes “Hours to Days Before,” a discussion of how hormones influence behavior, which is followed by “Days to Months Before,” where he takes up long-term neural plasticity (learning and memory).This pattern continues, with subsequent chapters addressing adolescence, early childhood development, genetics, culture, and humanity’s shared evolutionary heritage. So Sapolsky makes use of the buckets of explanation by taking up these topics one at a time (what else could he do?), but also goes to great lengths to show as many interactive areas of overlap between the different causal mechanisms as possible. This truly is a “both/and” story he is telling, with all the moving parts affecting all the other moving parts in profound and intriguing ways.The second half of Behave is more traditionally structured, and wades into dicier territory. Sapolsky tackles tricky subjects such as tribalism, moral intuition and bias, power dynamics, ethical motivation, empathy, the power of symbols to move us to action (or not), free will, criminal justice, and war. These areas of study are all rapidly evolving along with society and technology, so it’s impossible to tell how relevant Sapolsky’s assessments will be in decades to come. But all in all, this is the best and most up-to-date summary of recent findings in these fields one could hope to engage with. I probably had to read between ten and twenty other books to discover most of the insights Sapolsky distills into just a few hundred pages.All of this should be more than enough to convince science and ethics enthusiasts that Behave is essential reading. If you’re eager to run out and pick it up, just stop reading here and go for it. But if you want to stick around, I’ll give some thoughts about what I see as Sapolsky’s most important findings.Sapolsky’s most critical point by far is the importance of context in understanding human behavior. This is hardly a novel position, but Sapolsky lays out the argument for contextualization with sui generis assiduousness and clarity. Over and over he pounds the table about context, tirelessly illuminating the ways in which human behavior is sensitive to myriad influences both inside and outside the body. Most of these influences are partially or completely hidden from our conscious experience of the world, and it is only through scientific inquiry and abstraction that we come to understand their significance. Perhaps the wildest demonstration of this is the role of transcription factors in determining how a person’s genome expresses itself:""95 percent of DNA is noncoding…What is that 95 percent? Some is junk––remnants of pseudogenes inactivated by evolution. But buried in that are the keys to the kingdom, the instructional manual for when to transcribe particular genes, the on/off switches for gene transcription. A gene doesn’t 'decide' when to be photocopied into RNA, to generate its protein. Instead before the start of the stretch of DNA coding for that gene is a short stretch called a promoter––the 'on' switch. What turns the promoter switch on? Something called a transcription factor (TF) binds to the promoter…Thus transcription factors regulate genes. What regulates transcription factors? The answer devastates the concept of genetic determinism: the environment."" (226, emphasis his)Sapolsky goes on to explain that numerous factors––ones present inside cells, inside bodies, and even outside bodies––can all nudge transcription factors one way or another. This means that, while a person’s genome stays constant throughout life, gene expression (the manner in which genes code for the particular proteins that make you you) is keenly sensitive to environmental conditions and constantly in flux. Furthermore, it turns out that transcription factors are usually proteins themselves, and therefore require other transcription factors to instruct genes to code for them:""Genomes aren’t infinite; instead TFs regulate one another’s transcription, solving that pesky infinity problem. Importantly, across the species whose genomes have been sequenced, the longer the genome (i.e., roughly the more genes there are), the greater the percentage of genes coding for TFs. In other words, the more genomically complex the organism, the larger the percentage of the genome devoted to gene regulation by the environment...The human genome codes for about 1,500 different TFs, contains 4,000,000 TF-binding sites, and the average cell uses about 200,000 such sites to generate its distinctive gene-expression profile. This is boggling."" (228-9, emphasis his)Boggling indeed, but also fucking fabulous. O brave new world, that has such people in ‘t! The level of detail and complexity in the example above is indicative of every section and chapter Behave has to offer. Sapolsky doesn’t cut corners or succumb to simplistic reductionism, seeking instead to repeatedly blow the reader’s mind by showing the grand scope of what goes into decisions as simple as deciding whether to reach out to touch someone’s arm. Every step of the way, we are bombarded with caveats, clarifications, contradictions, and pitfalls of empirical limitation. It would be infuriating if it weren’t so damned fascinating! Sapolsky’s main thrust––that context is always crucial and never simple when trying to understand behavior––could not be better delivered. It also carries a hopeful undertone because many of the environmental contexts in which humans must operate are created and controlled by humans, implying that we can genuinely help people lead better lives if we learn how to fiddle the environmental dials the right way. Our power in this regard is far from limitless, but hardly insignificant (I’ll return to this at the end of the review).Behave also contains strong arguments for the elimination of poverty and abuse, especially in the lives of children. Sapolsky grinds out a glut of ghastly facts about how “childhood adversity” can compromise people later in life:""Childhood adversity increases the odds of an adult having (a) depression, anxiety, and/or substance abuse; (b) impaired cognitive capacity, particularly related to frontocortical function; (c) impaired impulse control and emotion regulation; (d) antisocial behavior, including violence; and (e) relationships that replicate the adversities of childhood (e.g., staying with an abusive partner)."" (194)He immediately follows up by pointing out that “some individuals endure miserable childhoods just fine,” and makes it clear that anything goes when looking at a particular case (194). But the trending effects of childhood adversity are undeniable and terrible. Like many other insights in Behave, this is not anything we didn’t already know; it’s the sheer volume and artful presentation of Sapolsky’s converging evidence that gives his work inimitable force. He is also not afraid to bind these findings to strong, empirically-based arguments that reject egregious income inequality and promote investment in public goods:""It’s not so much that poverty predicts poor heath; it’s poverty amid plenty––income inequality. The surest way to make someone feel poor is to rub their nose in what they don’t have…When social capital decreases (thanks to inequality), up goes psychological stress…If you want to improve health and quality of life for the average person in a society, you spend money on public goods––better public transit, safer streets, cleaner water, better public schools, universal health care…Inequality means more secession of the wealthy from contributing to the public good."" (294-5)There’s no denying that this is a kind of liberal do-gooder wishlist, tinged with Sapolsky’s political leanings. Although it leaves him open to criticism, I admire Sapolsky for linking research with certain normative outcomes when he deems it appropriate. It is a fitting strategy for this moment in time, when the notion of any truly “objective” source of information has become obsolete. The best we’ve got are people like Sapolsky, who humbly bend the knee to reason and reality even when they’d rather the universe were otherwise, and who also fight tooth and nail to be heard when reason and reality actually support their political points of view.The final aspects of Behave I want to take up are Sapolsky’s direct claims that we can and should use science to improve the chances of people acting well instead of badly, along with his implicit argument that narrative and storytelling have a huge role to play in this grand project. While science is perhaps humanity’s most powerful method for analyzing and improving environmental conditions, narrative is a timeless tool for teaching people to assume the perspectives of others and to individuate potential enemies instead of reducing them to faceless members of a reviled out-group. This comes through in Sapolsky’s recommendations for dealing with humanity’s inescapably tribal nature:""From massive, breathtaking barbarity to countless pinpricks of microaggression, Us versus Them has produced oceans of pain. Yet our generic goal is not to 'cure' us of Us/Them dichotomizing. It can’t be done…If we accept that there will always be sides, it’s a nontrivial to-do list item to always be on the side of angels. Distrust essentialism. Keep in mind that what seems like rationality is often just rationalization, playing catch-up with subterranean forces that we never suspect. Focus on the larger, shared goals. Practice perspective taking,. Individuate, individuate, individuate. Recall the historical lessons of how often the truly malignant Thems keep themselves hidden and make third parties the fall guy."" (423-4)Sapolsky doesn’t take what I see as the next logical step here, which is to assert that the easiest way people can begin checking off his anti-tribal “to-do list” is to engage with stories that open the way to novel perspectives and unfamiliar modes of moral calculus. We should draw heavily on the power of narrative to simulate social complexity and teach the lessons Sapolsky rightly identifies as essential for ethical education. He points out in a later chapter that, despite its considerable downsides, “our confusion of the literal and the metaphorical, our granting of life-threatening sanctity to the symbolic, can be used to bring about the best of our behaviors” (579). There is a momentous marriage between the arts and sciences embedded in this outlook––a marriage more sacred than any of the supposedly sacrosanct folderol that has hitherto spawned from the imaginative shit-heap of human history.Stories can teach us to think and act better, but only science can deliver the building blocks and blueprints for our better world. When wrapping up a discussion of how former enemies reach reconciliation, Sapolsky implores readers to “recognize that science can teach us how to make events like these more likely” (670). He knows it’s a game of probability; we can’t force people to be good, but we can make it systemically easier for them to make the right choice, even if we know the “rightness” of that choice will always be at least partially if not wholly circumstantial. The more we learn about the light and dark tendencies inherent in human nature and particular arenas of action, the more capable we become of incentivizing instances of good behavior and minimizing instances of bad behavior. Scrupulousness of the highest order is called for, but the project is both worthy and necessary.I’d be delighted to spin out some final words that would drive home everything that is special about this book, but I couldn’t hope to top Sapolsky himself:""If you had to boil this book down to a single phrase, it would be 'It’s complicated.' Nothing seems to cause anything; instead everything just modulates something else. Scientists keep saying, “We used to think X, but now we realize that…” Fixing one thing often messes up ten more, as the law of unintended consequences reigns. On any big, important issue it seems like 51 percent of the scientific studies conclude one thing, and 49 percent conclude the opposite. And so on. Eventually it can seem hopeless that you can actually fix something, can make things better. But we have no choice but to try. And if you are reading this, you are probably ideally suited to do so. You’ve amply proven you have intellectual tenacity. You probably also have running water, a home, adequate calories, and lows odds of festering with a bad parasitic disease. You probably don’t have to worry about Ebola virus, warlords, or being invisible in your world. And you’ve been educated. In other words, you’re one of the lucky humans. So try.""

171,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77785790-david,4,"I think of this book as an introduction to pre-crime. I believe the term that the author uses is ""neurocriminology"", but the essential unifying premise of the book is that human choices are predetermined by complex biological factors which neuroscientists are just beginning to understand in ways that will eventually allow these specialists to predict very specific criminal and antisocial behaviors before, sometimes long before, the actors consciously choose them. We inherently function as if our choices are independent, spontaneous and free. Westerners particularly tend to view ourselves as autonomous individuals. This book will shatter these notions. Most or all of our choices are made before we are consciously aware of them, and most of our choices are not really originate in the individual. Our thoughts and decisions arise from our primordial past, our education, and the biological / environmental conditions immediately preceding ""our"" decisions.The most difficult aspect of the book for me was the insufferable liberalism of the author. The book opens with a gratuitous fantasy about all the horrible things the author would do to Hitler, if given the chance. The author also avails himself of every opportunity to illustrate how racist and bigoted white people are compared to nonwhites. It's never made clear why the author harbors such biases, but it's clear that he feels both justified and righteous for doing so.The concessions which the author makes concerning human biology and behavior are all the more enlightening given his openly hard left bias. For example, Sapolsky conclusively denies that ""nurture"" is the pre-eminent factor in determining human behavior. At the same time, he also gives evidence to show that inherited, genetic traits are strongly modified by the environment, whether that be biochemical or social.Sapolsky affirms the biological reality of kin selection by citing mouse studies showing that mammals produce biochemicals enabling individuals to ""smell"" how closely related other individuals are. Mice, among others, preferentially socialize with individuals whom they sense are more closely related, all else being equal. On the other hand, mice and other animals can be trained artificially to ignore this natural bias for their kin and affiliate with non-related individuals.Similarly, the author points out that human social structures tend to be ethnocentric. Human studies show that whites have an innate, preconscious bias towards their own kind and against blacks. Nevertheless, it's possible to ""overcome"" this ""xenophobia"" with appropriate conditioning, according to the author. Sapolsky consistently recognizes the fact that humans and animals naturally desire to bond with relatives and kin, yet he regularly affirms this natural tendency is ""bad"" or ""xenophobic"".The ""fallacy of naturalism"" struck me as a profound insight into the character not only of Sapolsky, but of the leftist cultural phenomenon as a whole. Such liberals are characterized by the belief that what is natural and instinctive is often wrong and must be artificially re-engineered in order to achieve harmony. By contrast, the opposing view of many conservatives is that nature is correct, even sacrosanct. This view of nature's correctness is easily seen in Austrian Economics, for instance.Another key aspect of the liberal left versus the conservative right that I noticed in this book was the fact that liberal tendencies typically arise from people who are insulated from the exigencies of life relative to those people who are regularly exposed to hardship. Sapolsky cites studies showing, for instance, that conservative people experience nightmares more frequently and suffer from more adversity in general than their liberal counterparts.This adversity-conservatism correlation was also illustrated by a narrative describing the social transformation of a troop of baboons from an endogamous, tribal, aggressive, and patriarchal community to a relatively exogamous, passive, and female-dominant one. How did this transformation occur? It occurred in response to an unlimited supply of low-cost food: the troop settled near a garbage dump where they ate leftovers from human tourists and became ""liberalized"".The same appears to be true for primitive human society. Sapolsky devotes considerable space to the question of whether archaic hunter-gatherer and pastoral human societies were violent and aggressive or peaceful and harmonious. What he shows is that scarcity of resources provokes the former, while abundance promotes the latter. Thus, the ""noble savage"" resolves to the ""well-fed savage"" who becomes more savage and less noble he becomes more hungry.Conservatism and hunger are not only linked in the case of monkeys and tribal humans. Sapolsky notes that criminal justices statistically deliver harsher sentences when they have skipped breakfast. Combined with the observation that conservative people often have more nightmares and other adverse experiences, a theme emerges: liberalism of all kinds is the natural product of affluence and excess, while conservatism is the natural response to adversity and hardship.However, culture is not merely the expression of environmental resources over time. Behavior is embedded in the biology and genetics of the individuals forming a community. Sapolsky cites the famous Dmitry Belyayev Russian Fox study which showed that selective breeding could produce docile foxes. Sapolsky also cited a similar study showing that feral behavioral traits could be bred out of rats. These studies showed, according to Sapolsky, that behaviors which we think of a volitional and ""free"" may, in fact, be the inevitable result of genetic selection.This is a fascinating admission from a leftist author since it forms the key premise of ""A Troublesome Inheritance"" by Nicholas Wade. Wade's book is described as ""controversial"" largely because it applies the Russian Fox study (among others) to human society. Sapolsky shies away from such conclusions, yet both he and Wade agree that human behavior is heritable, just like animal behavior is. Further, both explicitly reject the absurd ""blank slate"" hypothesis of the social constructivists. Sapolsky's book can, in many ways, be seen a single, massive refutation of ""blank slate"" theory, yet in practice, Sapolsky advocates against the idea that our heritable traits are generally good. Our natural proclivity to identify and associate with kin leads, in his view, to violence, ""xenophobia"", and antisocial behavior. Thus, Sapolsky sees it as necessary for social harmony to scientifically overcome our natural tendency towards ""pseudospeciation"" based on biological factors like genes and race.Sapolsky regularly returns to the theme of ""green-beard effects"" wherein individuals in society identify and associate with individuals who share specific phenotypical traits, such as dark skin or blue eyes. Sapolsky automatically asserts that such effects are irrational, even dangerous. With this in mind, he documents various scientifically-validated techniques for replacing natural, racially-based green-beard effects with artificial ones, such as affiliation on the basis of organized sports.Conservative, ethnocentric thinkers like Wade, Pat Buchanan, and Ann Coulter observe the same green-beard and kin-selection effects but that such effects are both good and natural. In the conservative paradigm, separation of the tribe is the solution, not the problem. Both sides admit the existence of the natural tendency to form kin-based tribes, yet authors like Sapolsky generally affirm that advocacy of such nativism constitutes the dangerous logical fallacy of ""moral naturalism"".Sapolsky regularly makes jabs at moral naturalism. His main criticism is that what is perceived to be natural at one time often changes later. Thus, culture mediates our perception of what is ""natural"" and ""good"" versus what is ""unnatural"" and ""bad"". Sapolsky sees this as a an opportunity for reshaping social perceptions to accept new ""unnatural"" things as ""good"" and ""natural"", while the conservative instinct is to pass on what is perceived as natural from one generation to the next.If we accept the essential premise of Behave, then the choice to be liberal (in the sense of adoption what is unnatural and foreign) versus conservative (the preservation of the natural) is biological and subconscious rather than objective and rational. Furthermore, if we accept that the instinct to conserve kin-based groups and ostracize foreign races is dangerous and subversive, then it is easy to cast racial conservatism as a mental disorder rather than a rational decision. The same is true in reverse: if liberal tendencies are heritable, biological, and subversive rather than rational and ""free"", then liberalism is a ultimately disease. This isn't a new idea: Michael Savage, for instance, is notable for his regular insistence that liberalism is a mental disorder. In the opposite camp, it's not uncommon for liberals to insist that conservatism is the result of inbreeding, mental retardation, or childhood trauma.The ultimate end of rational dialog comes when we finally accept that people with views opposite to our own are not going to change their minds or become ""converted"" on the basis of rational argumentation and evidence. Various biological markers predispose people to adopt the views which they hold such that the conscious, rational portion of our brain constitutes a thin veneer over the primal realities of our nature.Viewing liberalism and conservatism as biological traits leads us to the ultimate question: will liberalism or conservatism ultimately wipe out the opposing trait and achieve hegemony in the human population, or at least in specific human population groups? Drawing on the above-mentioned studies, I conclude that while resources are abundant, docile, passive, and liberal traits will be dominant while virile, defensive, and conservative traits will become recessive relics of a dark, irrelevant past."

Of all the sciences, that of our own behavior is often the most unsettling in its mysteriousness. Delivering a precise and comprehensive causal explanation for any form of human behavior is almost always impossible, and to attempt even a general account requires one to interface with a bewildering array of methodologies, disciplinary perspectives, spatial and temporal scales of analysis, and the necessary but overwhelmingly nuanced and complex interrelationship between all these factors. If any piece of the causal puzzle is missing—which is always the case, as biologists have not (yet) fully mapped the causal chains that produce our most unique and sophisticated behaviors—then none of the other pieces quite fit together either, leaving unanswered some of the most fundamental questions regarding who and what we are. We are enigmatic even (perhaps especially) to ourselves—as psychology and the humanities have long attested—even though self-knowledge may be the most critical necessity for the survival and flourishing of our species and its planetary habitat. Behave is an incredibly ambitious cross-disciplinary gesture towards a complete picture of the biological substrata of human behavior. As a study which attempts to account for both the profoundest depths of cruelty and sadism and the most exalted heights of compassion and benevolence characteristic of our kind, and which attempts not to override and dismiss but to affirm and buttress the full spectrum of approaches for thinking about human nature, it is the most genuinely humanistic science book I have read. Behave is organized in two main parts. The first part, composed of the first nine chapters, is likely the most thorough exposition of the multilayered biological underpinnings of human behavior ever put in print. Each chapter is framed as part of a skeletal narrative: a behavior has just occurred: what happened in the seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, years, centuries, and millennia beforehand that could help explain why it happened? Each consecutive chapter widens Sapolsky’s analytical lens. When we think about what happened one second before the behavior occurred, we’re in the realm of cellular neurobiology. Neurons in the brain are generating action potentials in response to a stimulus; these disturbances of the negative charge inside of a neuron, caused by openings in the dendritic spines which allow positively-charged ions to flow through, travel from the dendritic spines through the cell body and, if the electrical disturbance passes a certain threshold, through the axon to the axon terminals, which send neurotransmitters across synapses that connect with specialized receptors on the dendritic spines of subsequent neurons, which causes the opening of channels in the membrane for positive ions, which generates action potentials in those neurons, and so on. The collection of 100 billion neurons in each human body and their integrated axonal projections are, at the cellular level, what constitute the vast and intricate circuitry of the nervous system. The generation of collective action potentials in billions of neurons in a particular brain region is what neuroscientists refer to when they speak about the “activation” of brain regions in response to stimuli. Move the timescale back to seconds or minutes before the behavior, and we’re looking at the macro organization of the brain. At this level our behaviors are mediated through the interaction of brain regions. The ancient amygdala, the almond-shaped core of the limbic system, mediates fear, anxiety, and aggression, and is often the first brain region to activate in response to unfamiliar stimuli. People who demonstrate more implicit bias against racial out-groups show more amygdaloid activation when presented with faces of people of another race, and the amygdala shows growth and overactivity in the brains of people suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Overlaying the amygdala are the higher limbic structures, which regulate base emotions, and the cortex, which mediates most of our higher cognitive functions, such as memory, language, motor skills, facial recognition, and contextual judgment. The newest brain region, in evolutionary terms, is the prefrontal cortex (PFC): the crown jewel of executive function, the seat of strategic knowledge organization, delayed gratification, social and cultural acclimation, contextualization, and the regulation of emotionality and impulsivity. It is also the last brain region to mature in an individual lifetime, not coming fully online until around age 25—a critical fact when thinking about the brilliance and deviancy so uniquely characteristic of adolescence.The late maturation of the PFC indicates something astonishing about the evolution of the human brain. The wiring of the PFC is not significantly more complex than that of other cortical regions, nor does it consist of a different type of neuron—with a few limited exceptions. Biologically speaking, it isn’t any “harder” to develop a prefrontal cortex than it is to develop any other part of the brain, which likely means that the delayed development of the PFC was selected for by our hominid ancestors. We evolved in such a way that the makeup of the frontal cortex, because its development is delayed, is shaped by the makeup of our other brain regions, which in turn are shaped by personal experiences. By developing later, the PFC is designed to accommodate the neurological “lessons” of our own, individual lives. The genetic program of our brain development has evolved to liberate the frontal cortex from genetics. Of course, none of these brain regions are discrete entities, and none are free from the influences of hormones and environmental factors. Expanding our timescale to account for the hours to months before a behavior occurs involves reference to endocrinology, the effect of hormones on behavior via their influencing of the nervous system, and the plasticity of the brain. Here Sapolsky debunks some common misunderstandings about the role of certain hormones in behavior; namely testosterone and oxytocin. Hormones are not “instigators” of behavior; in fact, one of the overarching themes of the entire book is that there is never a single biological cause of any behavior, but rather a vast field of facilitating and inhibiting factors that influence the probability of certain behaviors to degrees that are not always quantifiable. Androgens like testosterone are facilitators of behavior. They make the amygdala more sensitive to triggers of aggression, but only among people who are already predisposed to acts of aggression. Nor is aggression the single, inevitable result of testosterone production. Testosterone levels increase not only in response to situations demanding aggression, but also in situations in which one’s social status is uncertain, changing, or perceived to be under threat. In those situations testosterone does not facilitate violence per se; it facilitates whatever behavior is necessary for one to secure status. If a society bases its status relations on, say, charitability, then testosterone won’t cause you to strangle a cheetah; it will cause you to insist on paying the tab at a restaurant. If testosterone has an unfairly negative reputation, oxytocin has an unfairly positive one. This “luv hormone” facilitates bonds between mothers and infants, bonds between humans and their canine pets, and the pair-bonding of monogamous romantic couples; but these salutary effects are relegated to in-group relations. Oxytocin increases our prosociality towards an “Us”, but it also makes us more suspicious of “Thems”. It does not facilitate free love, but rather parochialism. In the second part of the book, Sapolsky attempts to synthesize the complicated layers of knowledge laid out in the first half, and to offer some insight as to how these biological factors influence our best and worst behaviors. I can hardly do justice to the nuances of the discussions in each chapter, but they address such topics as our instinctual categorization of people into In-Groups and Out-Groups and how and why we prioritize some dimensions of “Us-ness” over others; the unique human capacity for establishing and navigating hierarchies and the physically corrosive effects of having the “wrong” status in a particular social context (Sapolsky is a Rousseauian primitivist, and considers the agricultural revolution to be the greatest blunder in human history for the role it played in establishing rigid and dramatic status hierarchies); the neurological correlates of empathy (and how it’s better if our altruism is instinctive rather than an act of willpower); how metaphorical thinking is innate to our biology (and why a society is in extremely dangerous territory if certain members of it are persuasively associated with insects or fecal matter; hyperactivity of the insular cortex, which regulates disgust responses, can make one an ethnic cleanser—or worse, a germaphobe); the question of free will and how our conception of justice should be framed accordingly (Sapolsky is a strong determinist and thinks a criminal justice system based on punishment is totally irrational); and, of course, war and peace. Why do people do what they do? Sapolsky’s short answer is: it’s really complicated. No, really, that’s his answer; that’s the conclusion he comes to at the end of this big, beautiful disaster of a book. But understanding, though difficult, is possible; and with understanding comes a spirit of mercy which could perhaps change the world."
173,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22844682-pat-rolston,5,"If Professor Sapolsky teaches as well as he writes then his students are among the most fortunate in any classroom on the planet. This is one of those rare authors who can educate the reader while entertaining regarding a topic of staggering complexity. I hope this gift does indeed carry over to his classroom at Stanford in which case there will undoubtedly be a lot of inspired youth pursuing answers to the mysteries of the brain. I took considerable time to read this book as there were many opportunities to reread the passage or concept at hand and contemplate the subject in depth. There is also great reference information and appendices to help those of us needing liberal doses of assistance. As one of the greatest benefits of such books are the attributions and opportunity to read the books referenced I will add one for consideration that won't disappoint: ""The Archaeology of Mind: Neuroevolutionary Origins of Human Emotion."" by Jaak Panksepp and Lucy Biven. This is worthy of mentioning in the same review as Professor Sapolsky's masterpiece.  As with so many things in life the satisfaction is directly proportional to the effort expended and Robert Sapolsky's book, ""Behave,"" will help you better understand what chemistry and brain structures combined with environmental factors are potentially at the root of this feeling. This is not an author espousing an absolute deterministic view, but leaves room for something more that makes us human that our science has yet to discover the metrology to measure. The intellectual humility is rare and a reflection of the author's wisdom."

177,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31302406-lori,5,"I have a very quick rule of thumb to measure up books meant popularise science: if it leaves one thinking ""ow it's much more complicated than that"", then it's a good book. And I was very pleased to see the author echo—explicitly, obviously this was implicit throughout the book— much of the same sentiment in the Epilogue: If you had to boil down this book to a single phrase it would be ""it's complicated"" (p. 674)   Highly recommended to anyone trying to understand what it is to inhabit this meat suit we call a human body. Although, fair warning, you will be left with a great feeling of uncertainty afterwards; i.e. you will be made aware of your own ignorance, and most important—hopefully—you will shut up about ""human nature"" at every turn. You can also expect to have your (yes, your) simplistic notions of biological determinism shattered.  Now, a slightly more elaborate exposition than ""it's complicated"": Any meaningful analysis of the behaviour of human species deals with biology-environment interactions. One can expect to learn that: testosterone, oxytocin, mirror neurons, and pretty much any new fad protein, neurotransmitter, or brain region does not work the way you thought it did.  The negative effects of poverty, inequality, and social hierarchy in general are laid bare—or shorter SES (socio-economic status). The science is in: these societal dynamics wreak havoc on everything from IQ (p. 249) to health, to exacerbating anti-social behavior. Most fascinating is the fact that the lower you are on the wealth inequality ladder, the poorer your health. And get this, only a third of this degradation is due to actual, poorer material conditions. It is the subjective experience that matters, and the definitive knowledge and reality of having someone who's infinitely richer than you, and capable of shitting down the ladder—so to speak—on you. (p. 441 contains a nice bullet-point list of the known effects). Now, I am going to go on a tangent, to something the author did not mention, but as a filthy red I am almost obliged to do so. If we look into the work of Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century, and more importantly in Karl Marx's Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, Vol 1, we see capitalism's inevitable, structural tendency to create utterly obscene inequalities. Now, given that we know the negative effects of inequality on human beings and the causes of these inequalities, it should be trivial to synthesise a necessary political project: anti-capitalism.Ok, now, back to the content of the book. Robert Sapolsky—rightly so—criticizes Steven Pinker's The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined for cherry picking some of the data referring to primitive societies (p. 311-315). Mislabelling of hunter-horticulturalists (p. 321) as hunter gatherers, thus shadowing the plethora of research showing distinct ""pro-social"" behaviour of the former group. Failure to adjust for length of conflict (p. 614-620) in determining how violent historical periods were, doubly baffling given that Pinker all the while (correctly) adjusted the total victim count for overall world population size at that time—glaring oversight. Overall, a fairly positive critique, but one that leaves the reader with the impression ""it's more complicated than that"" (unlike Pinker's own conclusions). Note: the page references in this paragraph are to ""Behave"".  My own point of contention with the book, is that it omits a plethora of anthropological, and historical studies into human civilization (Lewis Mumford, E.A Gutkind, David Graeber)—while tapping into what seems to be a clichee body of work that is being passed around in the same Ivy League circles (essentially the same body of work as used by Pinker). This also leads to the author using some historically impoverished definitions of ""individualist"" and ""collectivist"" cultures—the latter being extremely poorly represented, and mostly by modern ""samples"". Mentions of ancient, medieval, and revolutionary period cities, which would be much better examples than modern ones, are woefully absent.  In short, this books is broad in its analysis of biology, but rather narrow in its analysis of society. But nonetheless, it is still an endless mine of fresh knowledge that would take forever for me to go through in this review. Luckily, the Epilogue has a nice bullet-point list (albeit it is not exhaustive of the content). Overall, Behave it deeply fascinating, and definitely worth a read! I highly recommend this book to everyone!"
178,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30276417-nancy-mills,5,"Fascinating book that begins with some rather difficult lessons in endocrinology and neuroloscience, but after the author lays that foundation, the books blooms into a dense but highly entertaining tomb about how behavior is affected by genes, hormones, environmental factors (that of course affect hormones), and then the guy actually has the nerve to go into the topic of Free Will ... and does a great job all the way. Here I am compelled to add a lengthy quote from the author, in a footnote, of course:""And the one thing I'm not going anywhere near is this New Age-y notion, ""Of course we have free will. You can't say that our behavior is determined by a mechanistic universe, because the universe is indeterminate, because of quantum mechanics."" Argh. What anyone sensible who has thought about this will point out is that (a)the consequences of subatomic indeterminacy of quantum mechanics (about which I understand zero) don't ripple upward enough to influence behavior, and (b) if they did, the result wouldn't be the freedom to will your behavior. It would be the utter randomization of behavior. In the words of philosopher/neuroscientist Sam Harris, a free will trasher, if quantum mechanics actually played a role in any of this, 'Every thought and action would seem to merit the statement ""I don't know what just came over me."""" Except you wouldn't actually be able to make that statement, since you'd just makinggarly sounds because the muscles in your tongue would be doing all sorts of random things.""Well I guess he told THEM!There is a chapter toward the back of the book entitled ""Biology, the Criminal Justice System, and Free Will,"" which will get your frontal cortex neurons twitching if anything will.Conclusions aren't cut and dry, if that's what you were hoping, but certainly will give the reader a tremendous background, if one can manage to absorb even half of the book's contents. If you're not all that into biology and long scientific words, you can get away with skimming the tough parts. I plowed through it and found it very rewarding. There are 3 Appendices, all good that you can skip if you don't want to learn about Neuroscience, Endocrinology or Protein Basics.Dr. Sapolsky is sympathetic, maybe even empathetic (the books discusses these phenomena) toward the the reader who may find the material dense, and his humor more than redeems his asking us to familiarize ourselves with all this stuff. Anterior Something Cingulate. dmELvE. vm LLpe. I don't know. A whole bunch of acronyms. Half way through the book I accidentally found out that there is a glossary in the back that defines each acronym which certainly makes things tons easier. Anyway, the author is understanding. One passage, for example, reads ""This is a bold assertion that the heuristic of dialectical materialism not only extends beyond the economic world into the naturalistic one, but is ontologically rooted in the essential sameness of both worlds' dynamic resolution of irresolvable contradictions."" Before the you throw the book across the room, the author adds this footnote: ""I have no idea what it is that I just wrote..."" He bravely plows ahead with ""It is Marx and Engels as trilobite and snail,"" and immediately footnotes again: ""Ditto."" Truthfully my main complaint is that the footnotes, which are numerous and are at times the best parts of the text, and printed in such teeny print that even with my glasses I had trouble reading them after the sun went down with my 60 watt bulb. There are, of course, about a million end notes to, which I seldom bothered with.Sapolsky, in his final chapter, delves into War and Peace (the subject, not the novel) and reveals some very interesting behaviors on the battlefield versus way back behind the lines where men in fancy uniforms make strategics decisions. And the part about drone pilots, who shoot targets thousands of miles away, nevertheless get bad cases of PTSD in spite of the fact that they are never physically putting their own lives in danger. Remarkable findings.One of the most worthwhile books I've read this year, highly recommended for people who like to read and don't mind a little mental exercise."
179,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,4,"This brick of a book purports to be an interdisciplinary explanation of human behavior, drawing from biology, psychology, and sociology, and everything from primate studies to well-known works in various fields. It’s big, at 717 pages of actual text followed by references; it’s broad; and as such it’s a little bit simplistic. Even at this size, there’s not quite room to develop all of the material. The first half or so of the book is more focused on the “hard” science, beginning with how neurons communicate with each other, and working its way up through hormones, genes, brain development through childhood and adulthood and how this is affected by trauma, and the evolution of species. The second half is more focused on psychology: us vs. them dichotomies, moral decisionmaking, the causes of violence, and whether the criminal justice system really makes sense when all human behavior is ultimately driven by biology. (Sapolsky argues no, but I’m not so sure. Where would we be as a species, or as individuals, if we all just shrugged our shoulders and gave in to ideas of biological determinism?)I certainly learned a lot from this book, which contains a ton of information presented in a way that is understandable to a non-scientist – though I struggled a bit with some of the early chapters. It provides a strong synthesis and framework for understanding information from biology and social sciences. That said, on the subjects that I did know something about, it seemed a little simplified. Fair enough; entire books have been written on subjects that comprise a single chapter here. As other reviewers have suggested, Sapolsky perhaps accepts too many psychological studies uncritically, without discussing psychology’s replication crisis, in which dozens of famous studies, when run again using the exact same methods and parameters, failed to produce the same headline-worthy results. That said, in general Sapolsky seems to take a fair approach to his material, presenting and evaluating multiple viewpoints in areas that have generated controversy. His writing is readable given the subject matter, and there’s a goofy-professor personality behind it that occasionally shines through. I wouldn’t take everything here as gospel – and I suppose we never should, since new scientific discoveries regularly require us to reevaluate what we thought was true – but the book did leave me a little more educated than I was before."

What is it with biologists and well written non-fiction that does not completely gloss over the details? The book is fairly long and appears to lack a central thesis except that ""it's complicated"". But ""Nothing seems to cause anything, instead everything just modulates everything else"" is probably closer to the truth than the endless internet debates over nature vs nurture.However even though the book is expansive, remembering to critique both sides of the debate (not even Pinker or Ramachandran are spared) while being filled with citation and humorous footnotes, I still had a few minor issues that force me to discount other things as well. Things like Wellesley effect and Freakonomics explanation of drop in crime rate in US are presented without any remarks about the contentious nature of the findings (largely believed to be false I think, but I could be wrong)."

182,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,4,"It is common these days to come across people who have developed a strong dislike for all reductionist approaches. They prefer holistic views, and are suspicious of any knowledge that has been derived through breaking up a big problem into smaller chunks. I can understand why they feel that way, but I have always felt that such feelings can only be harbored when one is unfamiliar with the depth of the subject in question, and therefore assumes a simplistic view of things. For example, I know of many people who are suspicious of normal medical science because it treats each organ as a separate functional entity, and expertise within the medical profession is divided by such narrow specializations. They prefer a medical science that looks at the big picture, which includes not just the various sub-systems, but combines the body with the mind. This is a wise and noble thought until we realize the complexity of the whole system. Once we do, the justification of breaking it up into smaller systems become obvious. All the knowledge we have about our body could not have been attained without first breaking it up into the various organs and trying to understand how they work in isolation. Once that has reached a certain level of details can we afford to put them back together and investigate the far more complex interactions between these systems. If we tried to bypass the reductionist step in the first place, we would have been stuck with vague and faulty theories of how the body works, as can be found in all ancient texts. A responsible form of holistic science cannot be rushed. In many cases we may not even be ready to take that step, and must wait till we have better understanding of the parts.Of all the systems we have investigated so far, the physical systems of materials and forces, chemical systems, astronomical systems, and biological systems – they all yielded fairly well to the scientific reductionist methodologies. However, the biggest challenge lies ahead in understanding the most complex system we have encountered so far – our mind. Huge progress has been made in this direction in the last few decades. The progress happened through advances in neuroscience, biology, computational science, evolutionary sciences, psychology etc. Problems that were beyond any convincing and demonstrable theory are regularly being converted into understandable bits of knowledge. In this environment of tremendous progress, where all the different branches seems to be converging, it is not unexpected that many specialists start to believe that they have finally figured it out. I have read many books where brilliant minds would try to prove how their specialty, be it neuroscience or evolutionary biology, can finally explain our behavior, our morality, our aesthetic sense, etc. in terms of their science alone.This book is the only one I have read that not only celebrates the great accomplishments of our reductionist approach towards understanding of how the mind works, but also exposes the severe limitations of not appreciating the complexity of all these subsystems when they work together. He systematically shows how each of the systems involved, our neuronal bran, the environment we live in, both in our mother’s womb and the environment outside, our endocrinal systems, our genes, how they all interact and influence each other is incredibly complex ways. The only way we can understand the whole thing is when we allow for these interactions. In other words, why we need to look at the whole thing holistically, while admitting that it can only be done when we understand the parts really well. It is a sobering document because it shows the challenge that lies ahead. Modelling the complexity of the whole system is so complex then we may never be able to crack it open. That is, understanding of an individual mind may remain impossible, while we get better at understanding them in aggregate.The real value of this book is not just in convincing us that full understanding of our mind cannot happen until we integrate all the pieces together, but in nudging us towards a slightly different mindset that can be applied to all complex problems. As in everything else, when we solve one problem, it only presents us with an even more complex problem. And to me, that’s what makes life worth living – that there will never be a shortage of things to ponder."
183,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17937883-avi-singh,5,"Behave is an ambitious book that seeks to explain human behavior at almost every level of abstraction - what parts of the brain lit up in the second before an action (the lizard-ish amygdala, or the primate-y frontal cortex), what sensory information obtained in the past few seconds to minutes “primed” you for it (if people are shown a random string of positive words, they tend to behave nicely in a cooperative game), what hormones were secreted in the past few hours to days (effects of testosterone, oxytocin etc.), what happened in the years before (say during adolescence or childhood), or in the prenatal period (kids show preference to flavors the mother consumed when pregnant, can hear things and show preference to stories they heard while in the womb etc., the “boy/girl” brain development, connections with sexual orientation / identity), what cultural forces in the last few hundred years shaped the behavior (for example, difference between individualistic and collectivistic cultures), and last, but not the least, how evolution in the last thousands of years influence behavior (ideas from sociobiology or evolutionary psychology - kin selection, reciprocative altruism, etc. ). The second part of the book has a slightly different format - as the author delves into specific human behavioral traits (like Us vs Them-ing, hierarchies and obedience, morals, usage of metaphors, violence, etc.), and discusses them in detail, often drawing the fundamental expounded upon in the previous chapters. The book has a entertaining myth-busting style. It will present a hypothesis (say testosterone is responsible for aggression), present experiments in favor of it (castration reduces aggression, injecting testosterone back in brings it back), and then present more experiments that poke holes in the earlier somewhat simplistic explanation (raising testosterone to 10% or 200% of original levels makes no difference as compared to raising to 100%). He also talks about the wars within academia on numerous theories/ideas - neurogenesis, mirror neurons, sociobiology, Stanford Prison Experiment findings etc., which, apart from being entertaining, also reinforce my belief that the author does not only present the theories that he “likes”. Though it’s definitely possible that he did that at certain points in the book, I think he presented the nuanced view more often than not. Sometimes, there’s an information overload, as the author presents results from 5-10 studies in a single paragraph. Also, since a lot of these tend to be psychology studies, their results have to be taken with an appropriate amount of salt. Some of the later chapters are a bit preachy (using intuition vs reason in in-group and out-group interactions, why the current justice system is stupid, how to reduce violence)- but since they are backed by fairly solid science, and logical (to me) explanations, I still enjoyed reading them. In the end, I think it’s a great book, and is peppered with humorous anecdotes, both personal and historical, which makes it easier to go through its ~800 pages. The only “limitation” of the book is its scope - I don’t really think any single book can cover all the issues that this book tackles - but a list compiled from the books referenced here would probably make a great reading list. I might do that at some point. "

For anyone else, that would be enough. For Sapolsky, it's just the start. Behave is entrancing, accessible, and infused with a spirited likability that you just can't help but enjoy. Behave will turn heads and raise controversy in the field of neurobiology, something the field has come to expect from Sapolsky, but Behave will also change science writing. Gone is the jargon and hundred-watt rhetoric that repels the plebians and ill-informed. No more tented-fingered, cross-legged analysis. This may be the definitive book on behavior, but it's a book for everyone"

It was first published in May, 2017. This is one miracle of a book. I don’t know where to start…“Someone does something lousy and selfish to you in a game, and the extent of insular and amygdaloid activation predicts how much outrage you feel and how much revenge you take.” ― Robert M. Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst Book focuses on Robert Sapolsky’s attempt to tackle seemingly impossible question. That is to look at our behavior from every possible angle: biological, psychological, physiological…and there are some historical and cultural angles thrown in to it too. We start with neurobiological angle: what happens in our brains when some specific behavior occurs, what effect do our hormones have on us, what is our genetic makeup, how are we different or even not that different from rest of the animal kingdom… This is not enough. Sapolsky continues by how environment affects us and also focuses on age-old question: are we formed more by nature or nurture? And indeed as mentioned, then we continue with psychology, history, culture…Behave is among the best nonfiction reads ever. It’s stunning, it’s big and it’s absolutely beautiful. I learned so much and it also changed the way I see some things. Here are some of my picks throughout the chapters of the book:Chapter 4: Hours to Days Before: How testosterone increases confidence and optimism and decreases fear and anxiety. Chapter 5: Days to Months Before: Enough time for Arab spring, for a discontented winter or for STDs to spread a lot during a summer of love…and also plenty of time for our brains to change…How there’s long-term LTP and LTD. And veryy long term LTP and LTD and how they work differently in different regions of our brains.“Testosterone makes people cocky, egocentric, and narcissistic.”― Robert M. Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and WorstChapter 15: Metaphors We Kill By: How Rwandan genocide came to be and how metaphors were used as a weapon. Oh the power of metaphors. I have never before realized this. During Rwandan genocide, Tutsis were described as cockroaches. And those cockroaches would steal your husband. They became something that had to be exterminated, swept away from the country. Almost 1 million people dead within 100 days.“Some translation is needed. The Rwandan genocide did not involve tanks, airplanes, dropping bombs or shelling at civilians. There were no concentration camps. No transport trains. No Zyklon-B. There was no bureaucratic banality of evil. There were hardly even many guns.” ― Robert M. Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and WorstChapters 6 & 16: Author explained PMS syndrome. He also explained how PMS syndrome has been used as a criminal defense. And this is not the only sort of crazy sounding criminal defense in the book. There’s also a lot of talk about the development of the brain in earlier chapters and whether a person is or isn’t fully aware of his actions and consequences of those actions due to it… Adolescence. Or. Dude, where is my frontal cortex as the chapter is called.What else… Sapolsky uses the analogy of a car with faulty brakes to describe antisocial human behaviour. How judges give less harsh sentences after they have had lunch! Yes you read that right, judges’ rulings’ are harsher when they are hungrier. And this also works with smells. If you’re in a place that smells bad, you more likely to judge a person or a thing in a negative manner, how there was a Christmas truce in 1914 and how in many wars since soldiers had to be threatened to go kill soldiers from the opposite side. And how opposite of love is not hate …it’s indifference. And to conclude. There is no such thing as free will.I loved this book. As you can probably tell from my review, it’s packed with loads and loads of information in a very simplified, easily understood form. Moreover, there’s a sense of humor or sarcasm in the writing and that always gets one more star from me because it’s like authors are laughing at how idiotic some of the things we do are and I really appreciate that (…we do a lot of dumb shit). Maybe the only downside to the book as I was listening to audio version were all the: “footnotes” and “i see her see i see her see i see?”. They were a bit much in spoken. All in all, a fantastic piece of literature.5/5 stars"
188,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6179509-derek-ouyang,4,"At over 700 pages, this took almost all year to finish. I can't say the journey is necessarily enjoyable -- it's incredibly dense, and Sapolsky admits in his epilogue that the two word TL;DR of his book is ""It's complicated"". But this staggering work is also incredibly rich, like a mental block of cheese that you can only sample in nibbles, and incredibly plastic, meant in the best neurological sense, like a mind actively at work laid bare. And this mind is an incredibly inspiring one. I never took one of his classes, but I think this book is a great representation of what brilliance looks like in a teacher."

I must be his perfect reader-- someone with a working knowledge of popular science, biology, neurology, and psychology-- I get his jokes. He is informative, vastly knowledgable (to put it mildly), speaks to the general reader, and light-handed with his material.I can not think of a better read for the approaching times of neurological understanding of the cause of why people do what they do, and the larger questions of blame in a criminal context. "
190,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81718362-ann,4,"After taking over two months to complete this, I am not sure what to say except 'whew'. This is the most comprehensive book I have read on human behavior. Sapolsky goes beyond the (neuro)biological factors and incorporates cultural, psychological and environmental considerations into the discussion. I wouldn't say this is a difficult read but it is a richly complex and detailed book. Sapolsky's sense of humor helps take the edge off things. By the end, the reader is fully aware of the meaning of, 'it's complicated' when attempting to explain human behavior. In essence, it is very complicated and scientists probably have just scratched the surface in their understanding.What struck me is how 'me' vs 'us' vs 'them' factors into things, even in our split second decision making. The chapters discussing the roles of hormones and neurotransmitters were quite interesting and sometimes the information surprised me. Finally, the chapter titled 'Metaphors We Kill By,' discussing symbolism and symbolic values was actually frightening. The different parts of our brain aren't adept at handling that information in a logical way and symbolic meanings can be interpreted as physical pain or rejection. Ouch and Yikes! Scary stuff. After reading all this, I do believe there is some meaning to the saying 'reality is the stories we tell ourselves' (greatly influenced by our brain's interpretation of things, along with hormonal regulation, genetics, environmental factors, childhood experiences, etc.) For anyone who isn't ready to undertake reading this, I'd recommend checking out some of Sapolsky's lectures from Stanford University on YouTube. There is some overlap between the lectures and the contents of the book. His lecturing style offers a comparable representation to his writing style. "
191,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2976142-thomas-edmund,5,"I'm going to be upfront and explain that I have a huge bias towards this book, in that I purchased it first thing after Lockdown ended (2020 hope that clarification isn't needed in the future) after 2 months of missing having a massive tome of non-fiction to read!That aside I still think this book is amazing, although extremely heavy. Sapolsky covers genetics, neurology, development, just to get STARTED on the important half of the book. I have a Master's in Psychology but my undergrad was in genetics and I struggled to keep up with the technical stuff in this book (luckily Sapolsky provides appendices with 101s for folk)So I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book to someone first diving into a piece on human nature, perhaps starting with something like Sapiens, or Ten Types of Humans. However if feeling confident or having plenty of time and cognitive energy to devote to this it should be fine.Overall the book is huge and covers so much its hard to really summarize, I loved that between the technical stuff there was the odd joke, or personal touch that always seemed brilliant. Some of the insights from this book will stick with me for life and while much of the content was heavy it was worthwhile."

The way neuroscience, endocrinology were explained. Its a more important book than most of the books you have read or will read. The scope is wide - covers almost all aspects of human behavior. It lets you learn something new in every chapter. My favorite part is when Sapolsky explains what goes in our brain when any behavior occurs. I wanted reasons to explain my own irrationalities and then blame it on neurotransmitters, hormones and gene-environment conditions. But it's not black and white. It's complex. It's beautiful."

Interesting insight into the causes of human behavior, good and bad. (Spoiler: ""It's complicated."") I read this together with Steven Pinker's ""Enlightenment Now,"" and I felt that the two books complemented one another well, even though the two authors don't necessarily see eye to eye on every point. Both discuss (in somewhat different contexts) the social, cultural, and psychological evolution of the human animal. Both give reasons for cautious optimism, though both also seem to realize the potential for disaster that looms as we move forward as a species. "
195,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66276739-adam-marischuk,2,"Two books and two different ratings, but you could save a lot of time by watching the youtube videos of kids trying to not eat marshmellows and coming to your own conclusions about human nature.The first half (including the three appendices) of Behave are the more scientific chapters of the book. The appendices are worth reading if, like me, you haven't formally studied biology in a couple of decades. They are a well written and easily digested summary of neuroscience, endocrinology and proteins.The first nine chapter have an interesting organisation, even if I feel it was not well executed. The idea of tracing an action backwards in time to evaluate the causes of the action has some merit, but Professor Sapolsky fails to remain on task and hence the excessive length of the sections. In the introduction he rails against ""buckets"" or categories of answers (the distinction between biology, psychology and culture) and then follows his own holistic advice. But the resulting chapters are disjointed at best. An editor could have cut the book in half without sacrificing any of the science or the audiences' ability to understand and a little of Aristotle's four causes would have benefited both author and audience. The digressions are sometimes interesting but usually merely political marginalia from an aging ""vertebarte, mammal, ape, human, male, scientist, lefty"" (p. 405)What was particularly interesting in the first few chapters is Professor Sapolsky's ability to find middle ground in the nature/nuture debate by bridging the gap between the two and noting the maliabiliy of nature.I suppose if the book had ended after chapter nine it would have received 3-4 stars.But then Professor Sapolsky continues into what I could only call socio-psychology with a dabbing of neuroscience to back up some rather radical leftist views. His discussions on hierarchy, free will, ethics, religion and war all take the same politically inspired position and do not flow seemlessly from the science. Sometimes it is bias mascarading as science, and othertimes it simply leaves the science aside. His discussion of ethics and utilitarianism is particularly egregious, and this is coming from someone who has little sympathy for utilitarianism. The construction of straw-man arguments does little to help the cause.Professor Sapolsky attempts to reconstruct the Naked Ape (Desmond Morris) but ends up with some monster who only vaguely resembles a man. I am reminded of the G.K. Chesterton quote, ""Take away the supernatural and all that is left is the unnatural"" (Orthodoxy, p 49) His reductionist materialist approach leads him into some strange territory, where rights exist but free will doesn't. Where a complete (and admittedly impossible) revolution of the criminal justice system is necessary. The very subtitle explicitly mentions our best and worst behaviour but he develops no criteria for evaluating one or the other, prefering to rely on ""context, context, context"" (p. 672). I am inclined to buy Jonathan Haidt and Steven Pinker and never pick up another book by Sapolsky. His politics, philosophy, ethics, criminology, even theology and psychology are all so different from any human's lived experience (and the language that goes along with it) that I can only concluded with E.O. Wilson, ""Wonderful theory, wrong species.""A lot more was said a lot better about materialism by David Hume, or about free will by Nietzsche, or mind-body dualism by Descartes, consciousness by Leibniz etc.And to close, he never justified:""I won't pull any punches- I think that its [agriculture's] invention was one of the all-time human blunders"" (p. 326)"
196,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49565692-ben-torgerson,1,"A shining example of what is wrong in the world of science today - scientists who can't separate their personal prejudices and belief from research-based fact. Sapolsky cherry-picks his research to make political points. He is yet another typical liberal intellectual type (so prevalent in education today) that is unable to set aside his own political and social prejudices and present the research in an unbiased way. That is not to say he does not present some interesting research in this book, but he so damages his own credibility with his misapplications of the scientific results and cherry-picking of the science that supports his own skewed views that no reasonable person can accept any of his characterizations or conclusions at face value. What is even more amusing is his repeated condemnations of people who misapply scientific results and cherry-pick the data, all while doing this himself throughout the length of the book. A good percentage of the book is devoted to using scientific research to prove that people who disagree with his political beliefs are unintelligent, unfeeling, etc., and yet he condemns the Nazis for citing science in a similar way to turn the Germans against the Jews. This book should be regarded as nothing but pure drivel and the author should be completely discredited in the world of science."

Sure, there are some interesting twists and quirks, but ultimately for me this book is merely naming things we knew had to be there in the first place. The fact that these things have been named and measured in the lab don't make them any more interesting. "

200,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7208369-miles,5,"Books that examine the relationship between science and morality have become ubiquitous, so readers interested in these important subjects need to choose carefully. It is not an overstatement to say that one could do no better than to alight on Robert M. Sapolsky’s Behave. This engrossing, encyclopedic examination of the causal mechanisms that determine human behavior is a monumental achievement of syncretic thought.This was my first journey into Sapolsky’s singular mind, both joyful and challenging. Covering an almost inconceivably vast landscape of scientific information, this neurobiologist/primatologist takes a playful but responsible approach to some heady topics, delving deep into humanity’s best and worst behaviors while never missing an opportunity to charm the reader with his perspicacious wit. I usually don’t care for comedy in nonfiction, but Sapolsky’s wry humor rarely misses the mark, and is complemented by an impressive ability to synthesize multiple perspectives and extricate sensible conclusions from dense and sometimes-conflicting data. Sapolsky is also transparent about his own biases as a “bleeding heart liberal,” making him a truly lovable genius (and not just in the casual sense).Since it would be folly to try to cover everything this book has to offer in a review, I’ll focus on explaining Sapolsky’s methodology, and then comment on just a few of his most important findings. Sapolsky begins with a necessary critique of how scientists typically explain human behavior, which is to break it down into different “buckets of explanation,” each of which comprises a distinct realm of inquiry:""We tend to use a certain cognitive strategy when dealing with complex, multifaceted phenomena, in that we break down those separate facets into categories, into buckets of explanation…The goal of this book is to avoid such categorial thinking. Putting facts into nice cleanly demarcated buckets of explanation has its advantages––for example, it can help you remember facts better. But it can wreak havoc on your ability to think about those facts. This is because the boundaries between different categories are often arbitrary, but once some arbitrary boundary exists, we forget that it is arbitrary and get way too impressed with its importance…There are not different disciplinary buckets. Instead, each one is the end product of all the biological influences that came before it and will influence all the factors that follow it. Thus, it is impossible to conclude that a behavior is caused by a gene, a hormone, a childhood trauma, because the second you invoke one type of explanation, you are de facto invoking them all. No buckets. A 'neurobiological' or 'genetic' or 'developmental' explanation for a behavior is just shorthand, an expository convenience for temporarily approaching the whole multifactorial arc from a particular perspective."" (5-8, emphasis his)This boundary-busting approach puts Sapolsky squarely in the company of intellectual titans such as Edward O. Wilson and Steven Pinker––interdisciplinary thinkers who have, however imperfectly, combined findings from numerous academics fields to launch humanity into new realms of inquiry and debate. Sapolsky is less poetic than Wilson and less contentious than Pinker, bringing a cautious, even-handed compassion to the science of understanding human nature. As any science reader knows, it is one thing to claim that disciplinary boundaries are arbitrary and ought to be ignored, and quite a different thing to actually demonstrate how this can be done. And while I don’t think Sapolsky fully achieves his stated goal, his efforts to do so are heroic and effectual.The first half of Behave plays out like a tennis match that travels back in time, with the ball representing the focus of Sapolsky’s chapters and the net representing a (somewhat arbitrary) boundary between behavioral mechanisms that operate primarily inside or outside the human body. He begins with “One Second Before,” an explanation of the neurobiology that takes place just before behavior is enacted, then transitions to “Seconds to Minutes Before,” where he discusses immediate environmental stimuli that contribute to behavior. Next comes “Hours to Days Before,” a discussion of how hormones influence behavior, which is followed by “Days to Months Before,” where he takes up long-term neural plasticity (learning and memory).This pattern continues, with subsequent chapters addressing adolescence, early childhood development, genetics, culture, and humanity’s shared evolutionary heritage. So Sapolsky makes use of the buckets of explanation by taking up these topics one at a time (what else could he do?), but also goes to great lengths to show as many interactive areas of overlap between the different causal mechanisms as possible. This truly is a “both/and” story he is telling, with all the moving parts affecting all the other moving parts in profound and intriguing ways.The second half of Behave is more traditionally structured, and wades into dicier territory. Sapolsky tackles tricky subjects such as tribalism, moral intuition and bias, power dynamics, ethical motivation, empathy, the power of symbols to move us to action (or not), free will, criminal justice, and war. These areas of study are all rapidly evolving along with society and technology, so it’s impossible to tell how relevant Sapolsky’s assessments will be in decades to come. But all in all, this is the best and most up-to-date summary of recent findings in these fields one could hope to engage with. I probably had to read between ten and twenty other books to discover most of the insights Sapolsky distills into just a few hundred pages.All of this should be more than enough to convince science and ethics enthusiasts that Behave is essential reading. If you’re eager to run out and pick it up, just stop reading here and go for it. But if you want to stick around, I’ll give some thoughts about what I see as Sapolsky’s most important findings.Sapolsky’s most critical point by far is the importance of context in understanding human behavior. This is hardly a novel position, but Sapolsky lays out the argument for contextualization with sui generis assiduousness and clarity. Over and over he pounds the table about context, tirelessly illuminating the ways in which human behavior is sensitive to myriad influences both inside and outside the body. Most of these influences are partially or completely hidden from our conscious experience of the world, and it is only through scientific inquiry and abstraction that we come to understand their significance. Perhaps the wildest demonstration of this is the role of transcription factors in determining how a person’s genome expresses itself:""95 percent of DNA is noncoding…What is that 95 percent? Some is junk––remnants of pseudogenes inactivated by evolution. But buried in that are the keys to the kingdom, the instructional manual for when to transcribe particular genes, the on/off switches for gene transcription. A gene doesn’t 'decide' when to be photocopied into RNA, to generate its protein. Instead before the start of the stretch of DNA coding for that gene is a short stretch called a promoter––the 'on' switch. What turns the promoter switch on? Something called a transcription factor (TF) binds to the promoter…Thus transcription factors regulate genes. What regulates transcription factors? The answer devastates the concept of genetic determinism: the environment."" (226, emphasis his)Sapolsky goes on to explain that numerous factors––ones present inside cells, inside bodies, and even outside bodies––can all nudge transcription factors one way or another. This means that, while a person’s genome stays constant throughout life, gene expression (the manner in which genes code for the particular proteins that make you you) is keenly sensitive to environmental conditions and constantly in flux. Furthermore, it turns out that transcription factors are usually proteins themselves, and therefore require other transcription factors to instruct genes to code for them:""Genomes aren’t infinite; instead TFs regulate one another’s transcription, solving that pesky infinity problem. Importantly, across the species whose genomes have been sequenced, the longer the genome (i.e., roughly the more genes there are), the greater the percentage of genes coding for TFs. In other words, the more genomically complex the organism, the larger the percentage of the genome devoted to gene regulation by the environment...The human genome codes for about 1,500 different TFs, contains 4,000,000 TF-binding sites, and the average cell uses about 200,000 such sites to generate its distinctive gene-expression profile. This is boggling."" (228-9, emphasis his)Boggling indeed, but also fucking fabulous. O brave new world, that has such people in ‘t! The level of detail and complexity in the example above is indicative of every section and chapter Behave has to offer. Sapolsky doesn’t cut corners or succumb to simplistic reductionism, seeking instead to repeatedly blow the reader’s mind by showing the grand scope of what goes into decisions as simple as deciding whether to reach out to touch someone’s arm. Every step of the way, we are bombarded with caveats, clarifications, contradictions, and pitfalls of empirical limitation. It would be infuriating if it weren’t so damned fascinating! Sapolsky’s main thrust––that context is always crucial and never simple when trying to understand behavior––could not be better delivered. It also carries a hopeful undertone because many of the environmental contexts in which humans must operate are created and controlled by humans, implying that we can genuinely help people lead better lives if we learn how to fiddle the environmental dials the right way. Our power in this regard is far from limitless, but hardly insignificant (I’ll return to this at the end of the review).Behave also contains strong arguments for the elimination of poverty and abuse, especially in the lives of children. Sapolsky grinds out a glut of ghastly facts about how “childhood adversity” can compromise people later in life:""Childhood adversity increases the odds of an adult having (a) depression, anxiety, and/or substance abuse; (b) impaired cognitive capacity, particularly related to frontocortical function; (c) impaired impulse control and emotion regulation; (d) antisocial behavior, including violence; and (e) relationships that replicate the adversities of childhood (e.g., staying with an abusive partner)."" (194)He immediately follows up by pointing out that “some individuals endure miserable childhoods just fine,” and makes it clear that anything goes when looking at a particular case (194). But the trending effects of childhood adversity are undeniable and terrible. Like many other insights in Behave, this is not anything we didn’t already know; it’s the sheer volume and artful presentation of Sapolsky’s converging evidence that gives his work inimitable force. He is also not afraid to bind these findings to strong, empirically-based arguments that reject egregious income inequality and promote investment in public goods:""It’s not so much that poverty predicts poor heath; it’s poverty amid plenty––income inequality. The surest way to make someone feel poor is to rub their nose in what they don’t have…When social capital decreases (thanks to inequality), up goes psychological stress…If you want to improve health and quality of life for the average person in a society, you spend money on public goods––better public transit, safer streets, cleaner water, better public schools, universal health care…Inequality means more secession of the wealthy from contributing to the public good."" (294-5)There’s no denying that this is a kind of liberal do-gooder wishlist, tinged with Sapolsky’s political leanings. Although it leaves him open to criticism, I admire Sapolsky for linking research with certain normative outcomes when he deems it appropriate. It is a fitting strategy for this moment in time, when the notion of any truly “objective” source of information has become obsolete. The best we’ve got are people like Sapolsky, who humbly bend the knee to reason and reality even when they’d rather the universe were otherwise, and who also fight tooth and nail to be heard when reason and reality actually support their political points of view.The final aspects of Behave I want to take up are Sapolsky’s direct claims that we can and should use science to improve the chances of people acting well instead of badly, along with his implicit argument that narrative and storytelling have a huge role to play in this grand project. While science is perhaps humanity’s most powerful method for analyzing and improving environmental conditions, narrative is a timeless tool for teaching people to assume the perspectives of others and to individuate potential enemies instead of reducing them to faceless members of a reviled out-group. This comes through in Sapolsky’s recommendations for dealing with humanity’s inescapably tribal nature:""From massive, breathtaking barbarity to countless pinpricks of microaggression, Us versus Them has produced oceans of pain. Yet our generic goal is not to 'cure' us of Us/Them dichotomizing. It can’t be done…If we accept that there will always be sides, it’s a nontrivial to-do list item to always be on the side of angels. Distrust essentialism. Keep in mind that what seems like rationality is often just rationalization, playing catch-up with subterranean forces that we never suspect. Focus on the larger, shared goals. Practice perspective taking,. Individuate, individuate, individuate. Recall the historical lessons of how often the truly malignant Thems keep themselves hidden and make third parties the fall guy."" (423-4)Sapolsky doesn’t take what I see as the next logical step here, which is to assert that the easiest way people can begin checking off his anti-tribal “to-do list” is to engage with stories that open the way to novel perspectives and unfamiliar modes of moral calculus. We should draw heavily on the power of narrative to simulate social complexity and teach the lessons Sapolsky rightly identifies as essential for ethical education. He points out in a later chapter that, despite its considerable downsides, “our confusion of the literal and the metaphorical, our granting of life-threatening sanctity to the symbolic, can be used to bring about the best of our behaviors” (579). There is a momentous marriage between the arts and sciences embedded in this outlook––a marriage more sacred than any of the supposedly sacrosanct folderol that has hitherto spawned from the imaginative shit-heap of human history.Stories can teach us to think and act better, but only science can deliver the building blocks and blueprints for our better world. When wrapping up a discussion of how former enemies reach reconciliation, Sapolsky implores readers to “recognize that science can teach us how to make events like these more likely” (670). He knows it’s a game of probability; we can’t force people to be good, but we can make it systemically easier for them to make the right choice, even if we know the “rightness” of that choice will always be at least partially if not wholly circumstantial. The more we learn about the light and dark tendencies inherent in human nature and particular arenas of action, the more capable we become of incentivizing instances of good behavior and minimizing instances of bad behavior. Scrupulousness of the highest order is called for, but the project is both worthy and necessary.I’d be delighted to spin out some final words that would drive home everything that is special about this book, but I couldn’t hope to top Sapolsky himself:""If you had to boil this book down to a single phrase, it would be 'It’s complicated.' Nothing seems to cause anything; instead everything just modulates something else. Scientists keep saying, “We used to think X, but now we realize that…” Fixing one thing often messes up ten more, as the law of unintended consequences reigns. On any big, important issue it seems like 51 percent of the scientific studies conclude one thing, and 49 percent conclude the opposite. And so on. Eventually it can seem hopeless that you can actually fix something, can make things better. But we have no choice but to try. And if you are reading this, you are probably ideally suited to do so. You’ve amply proven you have intellectual tenacity. You probably also have running water, a home, adequate calories, and lows odds of festering with a bad parasitic disease. You probably don’t have to worry about Ebola virus, warlords, or being invisible in your world. And you’ve been educated. In other words, you’re one of the lucky humans. So try.""

201,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77785790-david,4,"I think of this book as an introduction to pre-crime. I believe the term that the author uses is ""neurocriminology"", but the essential unifying premise of the book is that human choices are predetermined by complex biological factors which neuroscientists are just beginning to understand in ways that will eventually allow these specialists to predict very specific criminal and antisocial behaviors before, sometimes long before, the actors consciously choose them. We inherently function as if our choices are independent, spontaneous and free. Westerners particularly tend to view ourselves as autonomous individuals. This book will shatter these notions. Most or all of our choices are made before we are consciously aware of them, and most of our choices are not really originate in the individual. Our thoughts and decisions arise from our primordial past, our education, and the biological / environmental conditions immediately preceding ""our"" decisions.The most difficult aspect of the book for me was the insufferable liberalism of the author. The book opens with a gratuitous fantasy about all the horrible things the author would do to Hitler, if given the chance. The author also avails himself of every opportunity to illustrate how racist and bigoted white people are compared to nonwhites. It's never made clear why the author harbors such biases, but it's clear that he feels both justified and righteous for doing so.The concessions which the author makes concerning human biology and behavior are all the more enlightening given his openly hard left bias. For example, Sapolsky conclusively denies that ""nurture"" is the pre-eminent factor in determining human behavior. At the same time, he also gives evidence to show that inherited, genetic traits are strongly modified by the environment, whether that be biochemical or social.Sapolsky affirms the biological reality of kin selection by citing mouse studies showing that mammals produce biochemicals enabling individuals to ""smell"" how closely related other individuals are. Mice, among others, preferentially socialize with individuals whom they sense are more closely related, all else being equal. On the other hand, mice and other animals can be trained artificially to ignore this natural bias for their kin and affiliate with non-related individuals.Similarly, the author points out that human social structures tend to be ethnocentric. Human studies show that whites have an innate, preconscious bias towards their own kind and against blacks. Nevertheless, it's possible to ""overcome"" this ""xenophobia"" with appropriate conditioning, according to the author. Sapolsky consistently recognizes the fact that humans and animals naturally desire to bond with relatives and kin, yet he regularly affirms this natural tendency is ""bad"" or ""xenophobic"".The ""fallacy of naturalism"" struck me as a profound insight into the character not only of Sapolsky, but of the leftist cultural phenomenon as a whole. Such liberals are characterized by the belief that what is natural and instinctive is often wrong and must be artificially re-engineered in order to achieve harmony. By contrast, the opposing view of many conservatives is that nature is correct, even sacrosanct. This view of nature's correctness is easily seen in Austrian Economics, for instance.Another key aspect of the liberal left versus the conservative right that I noticed in this book was the fact that liberal tendencies typically arise from people who are insulated from the exigencies of life relative to those people who are regularly exposed to hardship. Sapolsky cites studies showing, for instance, that conservative people experience nightmares more frequently and suffer from more adversity in general than their liberal counterparts.This adversity-conservatism correlation was also illustrated by a narrative describing the social transformation of a troop of baboons from an endogamous, tribal, aggressive, and patriarchal community to a relatively exogamous, passive, and female-dominant one. How did this transformation occur? It occurred in response to an unlimited supply of low-cost food: the troop settled near a garbage dump where they ate leftovers from human tourists and became ""liberalized"".The same appears to be true for primitive human society. Sapolsky devotes considerable space to the question of whether archaic hunter-gatherer and pastoral human societies were violent and aggressive or peaceful and harmonious. What he shows is that scarcity of resources provokes the former, while abundance promotes the latter. Thus, the ""noble savage"" resolves to the ""well-fed savage"" who becomes more savage and less noble he becomes more hungry.Conservatism and hunger are not only linked in the case of monkeys and tribal humans. Sapolsky notes that criminal justices statistically deliver harsher sentences when they have skipped breakfast. Combined with the observation that conservative people often have more nightmares and other adverse experiences, a theme emerges: liberalism of all kinds is the natural product of affluence and excess, while conservatism is the natural response to adversity and hardship.However, culture is not merely the expression of environmental resources over time. Behavior is embedded in the biology and genetics of the individuals forming a community. Sapolsky cites the famous Dmitry Belyayev Russian Fox study which showed that selective breeding could produce docile foxes. Sapolsky also cited a similar study showing that feral behavioral traits could be bred out of rats. These studies showed, according to Sapolsky, that behaviors which we think of a volitional and ""free"" may, in fact, be the inevitable result of genetic selection.This is a fascinating admission from a leftist author since it forms the key premise of ""A Troublesome Inheritance"" by Nicholas Wade. Wade's book is described as ""controversial"" largely because it applies the Russian Fox study (among others) to human society. Sapolsky shies away from such conclusions, yet both he and Wade agree that human behavior is heritable, just like animal behavior is. Further, both explicitly reject the absurd ""blank slate"" hypothesis of the social constructivists. Sapolsky's book can, in many ways, be seen a single, massive refutation of ""blank slate"" theory, yet in practice, Sapolsky advocates against the idea that our heritable traits are generally good. Our natural proclivity to identify and associate with kin leads, in his view, to violence, ""xenophobia"", and antisocial behavior. Thus, Sapolsky sees it as necessary for social harmony to scientifically overcome our natural tendency towards ""pseudospeciation"" based on biological factors like genes and race.Sapolsky regularly returns to the theme of ""green-beard effects"" wherein individuals in society identify and associate with individuals who share specific phenotypical traits, such as dark skin or blue eyes. Sapolsky automatically asserts that such effects are irrational, even dangerous. With this in mind, he documents various scientifically-validated techniques for replacing natural, racially-based green-beard effects with artificial ones, such as affiliation on the basis of organized sports.Conservative, ethnocentric thinkers like Wade, Pat Buchanan, and Ann Coulter observe the same green-beard and kin-selection effects but that such effects are both good and natural. In the conservative paradigm, separation of the tribe is the solution, not the problem. Both sides admit the existence of the natural tendency to form kin-based tribes, yet authors like Sapolsky generally affirm that advocacy of such nativism constitutes the dangerous logical fallacy of ""moral naturalism"".Sapolsky regularly makes jabs at moral naturalism. His main criticism is that what is perceived to be natural at one time often changes later. Thus, culture mediates our perception of what is ""natural"" and ""good"" versus what is ""unnatural"" and ""bad"". Sapolsky sees this as a an opportunity for reshaping social perceptions to accept new ""unnatural"" things as ""good"" and ""natural"", while the conservative instinct is to pass on what is perceived as natural from one generation to the next.If we accept the essential premise of Behave, then the choice to be liberal (in the sense of adoption what is unnatural and foreign) versus conservative (the preservation of the natural) is biological and subconscious rather than objective and rational. Furthermore, if we accept that the instinct to conserve kin-based groups and ostracize foreign races is dangerous and subversive, then it is easy to cast racial conservatism as a mental disorder rather than a rational decision. The same is true in reverse: if liberal tendencies are heritable, biological, and subversive rather than rational and ""free"", then liberalism is a ultimately disease. This isn't a new idea: Michael Savage, for instance, is notable for his regular insistence that liberalism is a mental disorder. In the opposite camp, it's not uncommon for liberals to insist that conservatism is the result of inbreeding, mental retardation, or childhood trauma.The ultimate end of rational dialog comes when we finally accept that people with views opposite to our own are not going to change their minds or become ""converted"" on the basis of rational argumentation and evidence. Various biological markers predispose people to adopt the views which they hold such that the conscious, rational portion of our brain constitutes a thin veneer over the primal realities of our nature.Viewing liberalism and conservatism as biological traits leads us to the ultimate question: will liberalism or conservatism ultimately wipe out the opposing trait and achieve hegemony in the human population, or at least in specific human population groups? Drawing on the above-mentioned studies, I conclude that while resources are abundant, docile, passive, and liberal traits will be dominant while virile, defensive, and conservative traits will become recessive relics of a dark, irrelevant past."
202,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7422525-scriptor-ignotus,5,"IT’S COMPLICATED “I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.”  — Sir Isaac NewtonWhy do people do what they do? Of all the sciences, that of our own behavior is often the most unsettling in its mysteriousness. Delivering a precise and comprehensive causal explanation for any form of human behavior is almost always impossible, and to attempt even a general account requires one to interface with a bewildering array of methodologies, disciplinary perspectives, spatial and temporal scales of analysis, and the necessary but overwhelmingly nuanced and complex interrelationship between all these factors. If any piece of the causal puzzle is missing—which is always the case, as biologists have not (yet) fully mapped the causal chains that produce our most unique and sophisticated behaviors—then none of the other pieces quite fit together either, leaving unanswered some of the most fundamental questions regarding who and what we are. We are enigmatic even (perhaps especially) to ourselves—as psychology and the humanities have long attested—even though self-knowledge may be the most critical necessity for the survival and flourishing of our species and its planetary habitat. Behave is an incredibly ambitious cross-disciplinary gesture towards a complete picture of the biological substrata of human behavior. As a study which attempts to account for both the profoundest depths of cruelty and sadism and the most exalted heights of compassion and benevolence characteristic of our kind, and which attempts not to override and dismiss but to affirm and buttress the full spectrum of approaches for thinking about human nature, it is the most genuinely humanistic science book I have read. Behave is organized in two main parts. The first part, composed of the first nine chapters, is likely the most thorough exposition of the multilayered biological underpinnings of human behavior ever put in print. Each chapter is framed as part of a skeletal narrative: a behavior has just occurred: what happened in the seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, years, centuries, and millennia beforehand that could help explain why it happened? Each consecutive chapter widens Sapolsky’s analytical lens. When we think about what happened one second before the behavior occurred, we’re in the realm of cellular neurobiology. Neurons in the brain are generating action potentials in response to a stimulus; these disturbances of the negative charge inside of a neuron, caused by openings in the dendritic spines which allow positively-charged ions to flow through, travel from the dendritic spines through the cell body and, if the electrical disturbance passes a certain threshold, through the axon to the axon terminals, which send neurotransmitters across synapses that connect with specialized receptors on the dendritic spines of subsequent neurons, which causes the opening of channels in the membrane for positive ions, which generates action potentials in those neurons, and so on. The collection of 100 billion neurons in each human body and their integrated axonal projections are, at the cellular level, what constitute the vast and intricate circuitry of the nervous system. The generation of collective action potentials in billions of neurons in a particular brain region is what neuroscientists refer to when they speak about the “activation” of brain regions in response to stimuli. Move the timescale back to seconds or minutes before the behavior, and we’re looking at the macro organization of the brain. At this level our behaviors are mediated through the interaction of brain regions. The ancient amygdala, the almond-shaped core of the limbic system, mediates fear, anxiety, and aggression, and is often the first brain region to activate in response to unfamiliar stimuli. People who demonstrate more implicit bias against racial out-groups show more amygdaloid activation when presented with faces of people of another race, and the amygdala shows growth and overactivity in the brains of people suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Overlaying the amygdala are the higher limbic structures, which regulate base emotions, and the cortex, which mediates most of our higher cognitive functions, such as memory, language, motor skills, facial recognition, and contextual judgment. The newest brain region, in evolutionary terms, is the prefrontal cortex (PFC): the crown jewel of executive function, the seat of strategic knowledge organization, delayed gratification, social and cultural acclimation, contextualization, and the regulation of emotionality and impulsivity. It is also the last brain region to mature in an individual lifetime, not coming fully online until around age 25—a critical fact when thinking about the brilliance and deviancy so uniquely characteristic of adolescence.The late maturation of the PFC indicates something astonishing about the evolution of the human brain. The wiring of the PFC is not significantly more complex than that of other cortical regions, nor does it consist of a different type of neuron—with a few limited exceptions. Biologically speaking, it isn’t any “harder” to develop a prefrontal cortex than it is to develop any other part of the brain, which likely means that the delayed development of the PFC was selected for by our hominid ancestors. We evolved in such a way that the makeup of the frontal cortex, because its development is delayed, is shaped by the makeup of our other brain regions, which in turn are shaped by personal experiences. By developing later, the PFC is designed to accommodate the neurological “lessons” of our own, individual lives. The genetic program of our brain development has evolved to liberate the frontal cortex from genetics. Of course, none of these brain regions are discrete entities, and none are free from the influences of hormones and environmental factors. Expanding our timescale to account for the hours to months before a behavior occurs involves reference to endocrinology, the effect of hormones on behavior via their influencing of the nervous system, and the plasticity of the brain. Here Sapolsky debunks some common misunderstandings about the role of certain hormones in behavior; namely testosterone and oxytocin. Hormones are not “instigators” of behavior; in fact, one of the overarching themes of the entire book is that there is never a single biological cause of any behavior, but rather a vast field of facilitating and inhibiting factors that influence the probability of certain behaviors to degrees that are not always quantifiable. Androgens like testosterone are facilitators of behavior. They make the amygdala more sensitive to triggers of aggression, but only among people who are already predisposed to acts of aggression. Nor is aggression the single, inevitable result of testosterone production. Testosterone levels increase not only in response to situations demanding aggression, but also in situations in which one’s social status is uncertain, changing, or perceived to be under threat. In those situations testosterone does not facilitate violence per se; it facilitates whatever behavior is necessary for one to secure status. If a society bases its status relations on, say, charitability, then testosterone won’t cause you to strangle a cheetah; it will cause you to insist on paying the tab at a restaurant. If testosterone has an unfairly negative reputation, oxytocin has an unfairly positive one. This “luv hormone” facilitates bonds between mothers and infants, bonds between humans and their canine pets, and the pair-bonding of monogamous romantic couples; but these salutary effects are relegated to in-group relations. Oxytocin increases our prosociality towards an “Us”, but it also makes us more suspicious of “Thems”. It does not facilitate free love, but rather parochialism. In the second part of the book, Sapolsky attempts to synthesize the complicated layers of knowledge laid out in the first half, and to offer some insight as to how these biological factors influence our best and worst behaviors. I can hardly do justice to the nuances of the discussions in each chapter, but they address such topics as our instinctual categorization of people into In-Groups and Out-Groups and how and why we prioritize some dimensions of “Us-ness” over others; the unique human capacity for establishing and navigating hierarchies and the physically corrosive effects of having the “wrong” status in a particular social context (Sapolsky is a Rousseauian primitivist, and considers the agricultural revolution to be the greatest blunder in human history for the role it played in establishing rigid and dramatic status hierarchies); the neurological correlates of empathy (and how it’s better if our altruism is instinctive rather than an act of willpower); how metaphorical thinking is innate to our biology (and why a society is in extremely dangerous territory if certain members of it are persuasively associated with insects or fecal matter; hyperactivity of the insular cortex, which regulates disgust responses, can make one an ethnic cleanser—or worse, a germaphobe); the question of free will and how our conception of justice should be framed accordingly (Sapolsky is a strong determinist and thinks a criminal justice system based on punishment is totally irrational); and, of course, war and peace. Why do people do what they do? Sapolsky’s short answer is: it’s really complicated. No, really, that’s his answer; that’s the conclusion he comes to at the end of this big, beautiful disaster of a book. But understanding, though difficult, is possible; and with understanding comes a spirit of mercy which could perhaps change the world."
203,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22844682-pat-rolston,5,"If Professor Sapolsky teaches as well as he writes then his students are among the most fortunate in any classroom on the planet. This is one of those rare authors who can educate the reader while entertaining regarding a topic of staggering complexity. I hope this gift does indeed carry over to his classroom at Stanford in which case there will undoubtedly be a lot of inspired youth pursuing answers to the mysteries of the brain. I took considerable time to read this book as there were many opportunities to reread the passage or concept at hand and contemplate the subject in depth. There is also great reference information and appendices to help those of us needing liberal doses of assistance. As one of the greatest benefits of such books are the attributions and opportunity to read the books referenced I will add one for consideration that won't disappoint: ""The Archaeology of Mind: Neuroevolutionary Origins of Human Emotion."" by Jaak Panksepp and Lucy Biven. This is worthy of mentioning in the same review as Professor Sapolsky's masterpiece.  As with so many things in life the satisfaction is directly proportional to the effort expended and Robert Sapolsky's book, ""Behave,"" will help you better understand what chemistry and brain structures combined with environmental factors are potentially at the root of this feeling. This is not an author espousing an absolute deterministic view, but leaves room for something more that makes us human that our science has yet to discover the metrology to measure. The intellectual humility is rare and a reflection of the author's wisdom."

207,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31302406-lori,5,"I have a very quick rule of thumb to measure up books meant popularise science: if it leaves one thinking ""ow it's much more complicated than that"", then it's a good book. And I was very pleased to see the author echo—explicitly, obviously this was implicit throughout the book— much of the same sentiment in the Epilogue: If you had to boil down this book to a single phrase it would be ""it's complicated"" (p. 674)   Highly recommended to anyone trying to understand what it is to inhabit this meat suit we call a human body. Although, fair warning, you will be left with a great feeling of uncertainty afterwards; i.e. you will be made aware of your own ignorance, and most important—hopefully—you will shut up about ""human nature"" at every turn. You can also expect to have your (yes, your) simplistic notions of biological determinism shattered.  Now, a slightly more elaborate exposition than ""it's complicated"": Any meaningful analysis of the behaviour of human species deals with biology-environment interactions. One can expect to learn that: testosterone, oxytocin, mirror neurons, and pretty much any new fad protein, neurotransmitter, or brain region does not work the way you thought it did.  The negative effects of poverty, inequality, and social hierarchy in general are laid bare—or shorter SES (socio-economic status). The science is in: these societal dynamics wreak havoc on everything from IQ (p. 249) to health, to exacerbating anti-social behavior. Most fascinating is the fact that the lower you are on the wealth inequality ladder, the poorer your health. And get this, only a third of this degradation is due to actual, poorer material conditions. It is the subjective experience that matters, and the definitive knowledge and reality of having someone who's infinitely richer than you, and capable of shitting down the ladder—so to speak—on you. (p. 441 contains a nice bullet-point list of the known effects). Now, I am going to go on a tangent, to something the author did not mention, but as a filthy red I am almost obliged to do so. If we look into the work of Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century, and more importantly in Karl Marx's Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, Vol 1, we see capitalism's inevitable, structural tendency to create utterly obscene inequalities. Now, given that we know the negative effects of inequality on human beings and the causes of these inequalities, it should be trivial to synthesise a necessary political project: anti-capitalism.Ok, now, back to the content of the book. Robert Sapolsky—rightly so—criticizes Steven Pinker's The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined for cherry picking some of the data referring to primitive societies (p. 311-315). Mislabelling of hunter-horticulturalists (p. 321) as hunter gatherers, thus shadowing the plethora of research showing distinct ""pro-social"" behaviour of the former group. Failure to adjust for length of conflict (p. 614-620) in determining how violent historical periods were, doubly baffling given that Pinker all the while (correctly) adjusted the total victim count for overall world population size at that time—glaring oversight. Overall, a fairly positive critique, but one that leaves the reader with the impression ""it's more complicated than that"" (unlike Pinker's own conclusions). Note: the page references in this paragraph are to ""Behave"".  My own point of contention with the book, is that it omits a plethora of anthropological, and historical studies into human civilization (Lewis Mumford, E.A Gutkind, David Graeber)—while tapping into what seems to be a clichee body of work that is being passed around in the same Ivy League circles (essentially the same body of work as used by Pinker). This also leads to the author using some historically impoverished definitions of ""individualist"" and ""collectivist"" cultures—the latter being extremely poorly represented, and mostly by modern ""samples"". Mentions of ancient, medieval, and revolutionary period cities, which would be much better examples than modern ones, are woefully absent.  In short, this books is broad in its analysis of biology, but rather narrow in its analysis of society. But nonetheless, it is still an endless mine of fresh knowledge that would take forever for me to go through in this review. Luckily, the Epilogue has a nice bullet-point list (albeit it is not exhaustive of the content). Overall, Behave it deeply fascinating, and definitely worth a read! I highly recommend this book to everyone!"
208,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30276417-nancy-mills,5,"Fascinating book that begins with some rather difficult lessons in endocrinology and neuroloscience, but after the author lays that foundation, the books blooms into a dense but highly entertaining tomb about how behavior is affected by genes, hormones, environmental factors (that of course affect hormones), and then the guy actually has the nerve to go into the topic of Free Will ... and does a great job all the way. Here I am compelled to add a lengthy quote from the author, in a footnote, of course:""And the one thing I'm not going anywhere near is this New Age-y notion, ""Of course we have free will. You can't say that our behavior is determined by a mechanistic universe, because the universe is indeterminate, because of quantum mechanics."" Argh. What anyone sensible who has thought about this will point out is that (a)the consequences of subatomic indeterminacy of quantum mechanics (about which I understand zero) don't ripple upward enough to influence behavior, and (b) if they did, the result wouldn't be the freedom to will your behavior. It would be the utter randomization of behavior. In the words of philosopher/neuroscientist Sam Harris, a free will trasher, if quantum mechanics actually played a role in any of this, 'Every thought and action would seem to merit the statement ""I don't know what just came over me."""" Except you wouldn't actually be able to make that statement, since you'd just makinggarly sounds because the muscles in your tongue would be doing all sorts of random things.""Well I guess he told THEM!There is a chapter toward the back of the book entitled ""Biology, the Criminal Justice System, and Free Will,"" which will get your frontal cortex neurons twitching if anything will.Conclusions aren't cut and dry, if that's what you were hoping, but certainly will give the reader a tremendous background, if one can manage to absorb even half of the book's contents. If you're not all that into biology and long scientific words, you can get away with skimming the tough parts. I plowed through it and found it very rewarding. There are 3 Appendices, all good that you can skip if you don't want to learn about Neuroscience, Endocrinology or Protein Basics.Dr. Sapolsky is sympathetic, maybe even empathetic (the books discusses these phenomena) toward the the reader who may find the material dense, and his humor more than redeems his asking us to familiarize ourselves with all this stuff. Anterior Something Cingulate. dmELvE. vm LLpe. I don't know. A whole bunch of acronyms. Half way through the book I accidentally found out that there is a glossary in the back that defines each acronym which certainly makes things tons easier. Anyway, the author is understanding. One passage, for example, reads ""This is a bold assertion that the heuristic of dialectical materialism not only extends beyond the economic world into the naturalistic one, but is ontologically rooted in the essential sameness of both worlds' dynamic resolution of irresolvable contradictions."" Before the you throw the book across the room, the author adds this footnote: ""I have no idea what it is that I just wrote..."" He bravely plows ahead with ""It is Marx and Engels as trilobite and snail,"" and immediately footnotes again: ""Ditto."" Truthfully my main complaint is that the footnotes, which are numerous and are at times the best parts of the text, and printed in such teeny print that even with my glasses I had trouble reading them after the sun went down with my 60 watt bulb. There are, of course, about a million end notes to, which I seldom bothered with.Sapolsky, in his final chapter, delves into War and Peace (the subject, not the novel) and reveals some very interesting behaviors on the battlefield versus way back behind the lines where men in fancy uniforms make strategics decisions. And the part about drone pilots, who shoot targets thousands of miles away, nevertheless get bad cases of PTSD in spite of the fact that they are never physically putting their own lives in danger. Remarkable findings.One of the most worthwhile books I've read this year, highly recommended for people who like to read and don't mind a little mental exercise."
209,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,4,"This brick of a book purports to be an interdisciplinary explanation of human behavior, drawing from biology, psychology, and sociology, and everything from primate studies to well-known works in various fields. It’s big, at 717 pages of actual text followed by references; it’s broad; and as such it’s a little bit simplistic. Even at this size, there’s not quite room to develop all of the material. The first half or so of the book is more focused on the “hard” science, beginning with how neurons communicate with each other, and working its way up through hormones, genes, brain development through childhood and adulthood and how this is affected by trauma, and the evolution of species. The second half is more focused on psychology: us vs. them dichotomies, moral decisionmaking, the causes of violence, and whether the criminal justice system really makes sense when all human behavior is ultimately driven by biology. (Sapolsky argues no, but I’m not so sure. Where would we be as a species, or as individuals, if we all just shrugged our shoulders and gave in to ideas of biological determinism?)I certainly learned a lot from this book, which contains a ton of information presented in a way that is understandable to a non-scientist – though I struggled a bit with some of the early chapters. It provides a strong synthesis and framework for understanding information from biology and social sciences. That said, on the subjects that I did know something about, it seemed a little simplified. Fair enough; entire books have been written on subjects that comprise a single chapter here. As other reviewers have suggested, Sapolsky perhaps accepts too many psychological studies uncritically, without discussing psychology’s replication crisis, in which dozens of famous studies, when run again using the exact same methods and parameters, failed to produce the same headline-worthy results. That said, in general Sapolsky seems to take a fair approach to his material, presenting and evaluating multiple viewpoints in areas that have generated controversy. His writing is readable given the subject matter, and there’s a goofy-professor personality behind it that occasionally shines through. I wouldn’t take everything here as gospel – and I suppose we never should, since new scientific discoveries regularly require us to reevaluate what we thought was true – but the book did leave me a little more educated than I was before."

What is it with biologists and well written non-fiction that does not completely gloss over the details? The book is fairly long and appears to lack a central thesis except that ""it's complicated"". But ""Nothing seems to cause anything, instead everything just modulates everything else"" is probably closer to the truth than the endless internet debates over nature vs nurture.However even though the book is expansive, remembering to critique both sides of the debate (not even Pinker or Ramachandran are spared) while being filled with citation and humorous footnotes, I still had a few minor issues that force me to discount other things as well. Things like Wellesley effect and Freakonomics explanation of drop in crime rate in US are presented without any remarks about the contentious nature of the findings (largely believed to be false I think, but I could be wrong)."

212,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,4,"It is common these days to come across people who have developed a strong dislike for all reductionist approaches. They prefer holistic views, and are suspicious of any knowledge that has been derived through breaking up a big problem into smaller chunks. I can understand why they feel that way, but I have always felt that such feelings can only be harbored when one is unfamiliar with the depth of the subject in question, and therefore assumes a simplistic view of things. For example, I know of many people who are suspicious of normal medical science because it treats each organ as a separate functional entity, and expertise within the medical profession is divided by such narrow specializations. They prefer a medical science that looks at the big picture, which includes not just the various sub-systems, but combines the body with the mind. This is a wise and noble thought until we realize the complexity of the whole system. Once we do, the justification of breaking it up into smaller systems become obvious. All the knowledge we have about our body could not have been attained without first breaking it up into the various organs and trying to understand how they work in isolation. Once that has reached a certain level of details can we afford to put them back together and investigate the far more complex interactions between these systems. If we tried to bypass the reductionist step in the first place, we would have been stuck with vague and faulty theories of how the body works, as can be found in all ancient texts. A responsible form of holistic science cannot be rushed. In many cases we may not even be ready to take that step, and must wait till we have better understanding of the parts.Of all the systems we have investigated so far, the physical systems of materials and forces, chemical systems, astronomical systems, and biological systems – they all yielded fairly well to the scientific reductionist methodologies. However, the biggest challenge lies ahead in understanding the most complex system we have encountered so far – our mind. Huge progress has been made in this direction in the last few decades. The progress happened through advances in neuroscience, biology, computational science, evolutionary sciences, psychology etc. Problems that were beyond any convincing and demonstrable theory are regularly being converted into understandable bits of knowledge. In this environment of tremendous progress, where all the different branches seems to be converging, it is not unexpected that many specialists start to believe that they have finally figured it out. I have read many books where brilliant minds would try to prove how their specialty, be it neuroscience or evolutionary biology, can finally explain our behavior, our morality, our aesthetic sense, etc. in terms of their science alone.This book is the only one I have read that not only celebrates the great accomplishments of our reductionist approach towards understanding of how the mind works, but also exposes the severe limitations of not appreciating the complexity of all these subsystems when they work together. He systematically shows how each of the systems involved, our neuronal bran, the environment we live in, both in our mother’s womb and the environment outside, our endocrinal systems, our genes, how they all interact and influence each other is incredibly complex ways. The only way we can understand the whole thing is when we allow for these interactions. In other words, why we need to look at the whole thing holistically, while admitting that it can only be done when we understand the parts really well. It is a sobering document because it shows the challenge that lies ahead. Modelling the complexity of the whole system is so complex then we may never be able to crack it open. That is, understanding of an individual mind may remain impossible, while we get better at understanding them in aggregate.The real value of this book is not just in convincing us that full understanding of our mind cannot happen until we integrate all the pieces together, but in nudging us towards a slightly different mindset that can be applied to all complex problems. As in everything else, when we solve one problem, it only presents us with an even more complex problem. And to me, that’s what makes life worth living – that there will never be a shortage of things to ponder."
213,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17937883-avi-singh,5,"Behave is an ambitious book that seeks to explain human behavior at almost every level of abstraction - what parts of the brain lit up in the second before an action (the lizard-ish amygdala, or the primate-y frontal cortex), what sensory information obtained in the past few seconds to minutes “primed” you for it (if people are shown a random string of positive words, they tend to behave nicely in a cooperative game), what hormones were secreted in the past few hours to days (effects of testosterone, oxytocin etc.), what happened in the years before (say during adolescence or childhood), or in the prenatal period (kids show preference to flavors the mother consumed when pregnant, can hear things and show preference to stories they heard while in the womb etc., the “boy/girl” brain development, connections with sexual orientation / identity), what cultural forces in the last few hundred years shaped the behavior (for example, difference between individualistic and collectivistic cultures), and last, but not the least, how evolution in the last thousands of years influence behavior (ideas from sociobiology or evolutionary psychology - kin selection, reciprocative altruism, etc. ). The second part of the book has a slightly different format - as the author delves into specific human behavioral traits (like Us vs Them-ing, hierarchies and obedience, morals, usage of metaphors, violence, etc.), and discusses them in detail, often drawing the fundamental expounded upon in the previous chapters. The book has a entertaining myth-busting style. It will present a hypothesis (say testosterone is responsible for aggression), present experiments in favor of it (castration reduces aggression, injecting testosterone back in brings it back), and then present more experiments that poke holes in the earlier somewhat simplistic explanation (raising testosterone to 10% or 200% of original levels makes no difference as compared to raising to 100%). He also talks about the wars within academia on numerous theories/ideas - neurogenesis, mirror neurons, sociobiology, Stanford Prison Experiment findings etc., which, apart from being entertaining, also reinforce my belief that the author does not only present the theories that he “likes”. Though it’s definitely possible that he did that at certain points in the book, I think he presented the nuanced view more often than not. Sometimes, there’s an information overload, as the author presents results from 5-10 studies in a single paragraph. Also, since a lot of these tend to be psychology studies, their results have to be taken with an appropriate amount of salt. Some of the later chapters are a bit preachy (using intuition vs reason in in-group and out-group interactions, why the current justice system is stupid, how to reduce violence)- but since they are backed by fairly solid science, and logical (to me) explanations, I still enjoyed reading them. In the end, I think it’s a great book, and is peppered with humorous anecdotes, both personal and historical, which makes it easier to go through its ~800 pages. The only “limitation” of the book is its scope - I don’t really think any single book can cover all the issues that this book tackles - but a list compiled from the books referenced here would probably make a great reading list. I might do that at some point. "

For anyone else, that would be enough. For Sapolsky, it's just the start. Behave is entrancing, accessible, and infused with a spirited likability that you just can't help but enjoy. Behave will turn heads and raise controversy in the field of neurobiology, something the field has come to expect from Sapolsky, but Behave will also change science writing. Gone is the jargon and hundred-watt rhetoric that repels the plebians and ill-informed. No more tented-fingered, cross-legged analysis.

217,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21610643-anastasia,5,"Why do we do things we do?Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst is a book by American author Robert Maurice Sapolsky. It was first published in May, 2017. This is one miracle of a book. I don’t know where to start…“Someone does something lousy and selfish to you in a game, and the extent of insular and amygdaloid activation predicts how much outrage you feel and how much revenge you take.” ― Robert M. Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst Book focuses on Robert Sapolsky’s attempt to tackle seemingly impossible question. That is to look at our behavior from every possible angle: biological, psychological, physiological…and there are some historical and cultural angles thrown in to it too. We start with neurobiological angle: what happens in our brains when some specific behavior occurs, what effect do our hormones have on us, what is our genetic makeup, how are we different or even not that different from rest of the animal kingdom… This is not enough. Sapolsky continues by how environment affects us and also focuses on age-old question: are we formed more by nature or nurture? And indeed as mentioned, then we continue with psychology, history, culture…Behave is among the best nonfiction reads ever. It’s stunning, it’s big and it’s absolutely beautiful. I learned so much and it also changed the way I see some things. Here are some of my picks throughout the chapters of the book:Chapter 4: Hours to Days Before: How testosterone increases confidence and optimism and decreases fear and anxiety. Chapter 5: Days to Months Before: Enough time for Arab spring, for a discontented winter or for STDs to spread a lot during a summer of love…and also plenty of time for our brains to change…How there’s long-term LTP and LTD. And veryy long term LTP and LTD and how they work differently in different regions of our brains.“Testosterone makes people cocky, egocentric, and narcissistic.”― Robert M. Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and WorstChapter 15: Metaphors We Kill By: How Rwandan genocide came to be and how metaphors were used as a weapon. Oh the power of metaphors. I have never before realized this. During Rwandan genocide, Tutsis were described as cockroaches. And those cockroaches would steal your husband. They became something that had to be exterminated, swept away from the country. Almost 1 million people dead within 100 days.“Some translation is needed. The Rwandan genocide did not involve tanks, airplanes, dropping bombs or shelling at civilians. There were no concentration camps. No transport trains. No Zyklon-B. There was no bureaucratic banality of evil. There were hardly even many guns.” ― Robert M. Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and WorstChapters 6 & 16: Author explained PMS syndrome. He also explained how PMS syndrome has been used as a criminal defense. And this is not the only sort of crazy sounding criminal defense in the book. There’s also a lot of talk about the development of the brain in earlier chapters and whether a person is or isn’t fully aware of his actions and consequences of those actions due to it… Adolescence. Or. Dude, where is my frontal cortex as the chapter is called.What else… Sapolsky uses the analogy of a car with faulty brakes to describe antisocial human behaviour. How judges give less harsh sentences after they have had lunch! Yes you read that right, judges’ rulings’ are harsher when they are hungrier. And this also works with smells. If you’re in a place that smells bad, you more likely to judge a person or a thing in a negative manner, how there was a Christmas truce in 1914 and how in many wars since soldiers had to be threatened to go kill soldiers from the opposite side. And how opposite of love is not hate …it’s indifference. And to conclude. There is no such thing as free will.I loved this book. As you can probably tell from my review, it’s packed with loads and loads of information in a very simplified, easily understood form. Moreover, there’s a sense of humor or sarcasm in the writing and that always gets one more star from me because it’s like authors are laughing at how idiotic some of the things we do are and I really appreciate that (…we do a lot of dumb shit). Maybe the only downside to the book as I was listening to audio version were all the: “footnotes” and “i see her see i see her see i see?”. They were a bit much in spoken. All in all, a fantastic piece of literature.5/5 stars"
218,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6179509-derek-ouyang,4,"At over 700 pages, this took almost all year to finish. I can't say the journey is necessarily enjoyable -- it's incredibly dense, and Sapolsky admits in his epilogue that the two word TL;DR of his book is ""It's complicated"". But this staggering work is also incredibly rich, like a mental block of cheese that you can only sample in nibbles, and incredibly plastic, meant in the best neurological sense, like a mind actively at work laid bare. And this mind is an incredibly inspiring one. I never took one of his classes, but I think this book is a great representation of what brilliance looks like in a teacher."

I must be his perfect reader-- someone with a working knowledge of popular science, biology, neurology, and psychology-- I get his jokes. He is informative, vastly knowledgable (to put it mildly), speaks to the general reader, and light-handed with his material.I can not think of a better read for the approaching times of neurological understanding of the cause of why people do what they do, and the larger questions of blame in a criminal context. "
220,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81718362-ann,4,"After taking over two months to complete this, I am not sure what to say except 'whew'. This is the most comprehensive book I have read on human behavior. Sapolsky goes beyond the (neuro)biological factors and incorporates cultural, psychological and environmental considerations into the discussion. I wouldn't say this is a difficult read but it is a richly complex and detailed book. Sapolsky's sense of humor helps take the edge off things. By the end, the reader is fully aware of the meaning of, 'it's complicated' when attempting to explain human behavior. In essence, it is very complicated and scientists probably have just scratched the surface in their understanding.What struck me is how 'me' vs 'us' vs 'them' factors into things, even in our split second decision making. The chapters discussing the roles of hormones and neurotransmitters were quite interesting and sometimes the information surprised me. Finally, the chapter titled 'Metaphors We Kill By,' discussing symbolism and symbolic values was actually frightening. The different parts of our brain aren't adept at handling that information in a logical way and symbolic meanings can be interpreted as physical pain or rejection. Ouch and Yikes! Scary stuff. After reading all this, I do believe there is some meaning to the saying 'reality is the stories we tell ourselves' (greatly influenced by our brain's interpretation of things, along with hormonal regulation, genetics, environmental factors, childhood experiences, etc.) For anyone who isn't ready to undertake reading this, I'd recommend checking out some of Sapolsky's lectures from Stanford University on YouTube. There is some overlap between the lectures and the contents of the book. His lecturing style offers a comparable representation to his writing style. "
221,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2976142-thomas-edmund,5,"I'm going to be upfront and explain that I have a huge bias towards this book, in that I purchased it first thing after Lockdown ended (2020 hope that clarification isn't needed in the future) after 2 months of missing having a massive tome of non-fiction to read!That aside I still think this book is amazing, although extremely heavy. Sapolsky covers genetics, neurology, development, just to get STARTED on the important half of the book. I have a Master's in Psychology but my undergrad was in genetics and I struggled to keep up with the technical stuff in this book (luckily Sapolsky provides appendices with 101s for folk)So I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book to someone first diving into a piece on human nature, perhaps starting with something like Sapiens, or Ten Types of Humans. However if feeling confident or having plenty of time and cognitive energy to devote to this it should be fine.Overall the book is huge and covers so much its hard to really summarize, I loved that between the technical stuff there was the odd joke, or personal touch that always seemed brilliant. Some of the insights from this book will stick with me for life and while much of the content was heavy it was worthwhile."

The way neuroscience, endocrinology were explained. Its a more important book than most of the books you have read or will read. The scope is wide - covers almost all aspects of human behavior. It lets you learn something new in every chapter. My favorite part is when Sapolsky explains what goes in our brain when any behavior occurs.

I read this together with Steven Pinker's ""Enlightenment Now,"" and I felt that the two books complemented one another well, even though the two authors don't necessarily see eye to eye on every point. Both discuss (in somewhat different contexts) the social, cultural, and psychological evolution of the human animal. Both give reasons for cautious optimism, though both also seem to realize the potential for disaster that looms as we move forward as a species. "
225,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66276739-adam-marischuk,2,"Two books and two different ratings, but you could save a lot of time by watching the youtube videos of kids trying to not eat marshmellows and coming to your own conclusions about human nature.The first half (including the three appendices) of Behave are the more scientific chapters of the book. The appendices are worth reading if, like me, you haven't formally studied biology in a couple of decades. They are a well written and easily digested summary of neuroscience, endocrinology and proteins.The first nine chapter have an interesting organisation, even if I feel it was not well executed. The idea of tracing an action backwards in time to evaluate the causes of the action has some merit, but Professor Sapolsky fails to remain on task and hence the excessive length of the sections. In the introduction he rails against ""buckets"" or categories of answers (the distinction between biology, psychology and culture) and then follows his own holistic advice. But the resulting chapters are disjointed at best. An editor could have cut the book in half without sacrificing any of the science or the audiences' ability to understand and a little of Aristotle's four causes would have benefited both author and audience. The digressions are sometimes interesting but usually merely political marginalia from an aging ""vertebarte, mammal, ape, human, male, scientist, lefty"" (p. 405)What was particularly interesting in the first few chapters is Professor Sapolsky's ability to find middle ground in the nature/nuture debate by bridging the gap between the two and noting the maliabiliy of nature.I suppose if the book had ended after chapter nine it would have received 3-4 stars.But then Professor Sapolsky continues into what I could only call socio-psychology with a dabbing of neuroscience to back up some rather radical leftist views. His discussions on hierarchy, free will, ethics, religion and war all take the same politically inspired position and do not flow seemlessly from the science. Sometimes it is bias mascarading as science, and othertimes it simply leaves the science aside. His discussion of ethics and utilitarianism is particularly egregious, and this is coming from someone who has little sympathy for utilitarianism. The construction of straw-man arguments does little to help the cause.Professor Sapolsky attempts to reconstruct the Naked Ape (Desmond Morris) but ends up with some monster who only vaguely resembles a man. I am reminded of the G.K. Chesterton quote, ""Take away the supernatural and all that is left is the unnatural"" (Orthodoxy, p 49) His reductionist materialist approach leads him into some strange territory, where rights exist but free will doesn't. Where a complete (and admittedly impossible) revolution of the criminal justice system is necessary. The very subtitle explicitly mentions our best and worst behaviour but he develops no criteria for evaluating one or the other, prefering to rely on ""context, context, context"" (p. 672). I am inclined to buy Jonathan Haidt and Steven Pinker and never pick up another book by Sapolsky. His politics, philosophy, ethics, criminology, even theology and psychology are all so different from any human's lived experience (and the language that goes along with it) that I can only concluded with E.O. Wilson, ""Wonderful theory, wrong species.""A lot more was said a lot better about materialism by David Hume, or about free will by Nietzsche, or mind-body dualism by Descartes, consciousness by Leibniz etc.And to close, he never justified:""I won't pull any punches- I think that its [agriculture's] invention was one of the all-time human blunders"" (p. 326)"
226,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49565692-ben-torgerson,1,"A shining example of what is wrong in the world of science today - scientists who can't separate their personal prejudices and belief from research-based fact. Sapolsky cherry-picks his research to make political points. He is yet another typical liberal intellectual type (so prevalent in education today) that is unable to set aside his own political and social prejudices and present the research in an unbiased way. That is not to say he does not present some interesting research in this book, but he so damages his own credibility with his misapplications of the scientific results and cherry-picking of the science that supports his own skewed views that no reasonable person can accept any of his characterizations or conclusions at face value. What is even more amusing is his repeated condemnations of people who misapply scientific results and cherry-pick the data, all while doing this himself throughout the length of the book. A good percentage of the book is devoted to using scientific research to prove that people who disagree with his political beliefs are unintelligent, unfeeling, etc., and yet he condemns the Nazis for citing science in a similar way to turn the Germans against the Jews. This book should be regarded as nothing but pure drivel and the author should be completely discredited in the world of science."

230,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7208369-miles,5,"Books that examine the relationship between science and morality have become ubiquitous, so readers interested in these important subjects need to choose carefully. It is not an overstatement to say that one could do no better than to alight on Robert M. Sapolsky’s Behave. This engrossing, encyclopedic examination of the causal mechanisms that determine human behavior is a monumental achievement of syncretic thought.This was my first journey into Sapolsky’s singular mind, both joyful and challenging. Covering an almost inconceivably vast landscape of scientific information, this neurobiologist/primatologist takes a playful but responsible approach to some heady topics, delving deep into humanity’s best and worst behaviors while never missing an opportunity to charm the reader with his perspicacious wit. I usually don’t care for comedy in nonfiction, but Sapolsky’s wry humor rarely misses the mark, and is complemented by an impressive ability to synthesize multiple perspectives and extricate sensible conclusions from dense and sometimes-conflicting data. Sapolsky is also transparent about his own biases as a “bleeding heart liberal,” making him a truly lovable genius (and not just in the casual sense).Since it would be folly to try to cover everything this book has to offer in a review, I’ll focus on explaining Sapolsky’s methodology, and then comment on just a few of his most important findings. Sapolsky begins with a necessary critique of how scientists typically explain human behavior, which is to break it down into different “buckets of explanation,” each of which comprises a distinct realm of inquiry:""We tend to use a certain cognitive strategy when dealing with complex, multifaceted phenomena, in that we break down those separate facets into categories, into buckets of explanation…The goal of this book is to avoid such categorial thinking. Putting facts into nice cleanly demarcated buckets of explanation has its advantages––for example, it can help you remember facts better. But it can wreak havoc on your ability to think about those facts. This is because the boundaries between different categories are often arbitrary, but once some arbitrary boundary exists, we forget that it is arbitrary and get way too impressed with its importance…There are not different disciplinary buckets. Instead, each one is the end product of all the biological influences that came before it and will influence all the factors that follow it. Thus, it is impossible to conclude that a behavior is caused by a gene, a hormone, a childhood trauma, because the second you invoke one type of explanation, you are de facto invoking them all. No buckets. A 'neurobiological' or 'genetic' or 'developmental' explanation for a behavior is just shorthand, an expository convenience for temporarily approaching the whole multifactorial arc from a particular perspective."" (5-8, emphasis his)This boundary-busting approach puts Sapolsky squarely in the company of intellectual titans such as Edward O. Wilson and Steven Pinker––interdisciplinary thinkers who have, however imperfectly, combined findings from numerous academics fields to launch humanity into new realms of inquiry and debate. Sapolsky is less poetic than Wilson and less contentious than Pinker, bringing a cautious, even-handed compassion to the science of understanding human nature. As any science reader knows, it is one thing to claim that disciplinary boundaries are arbitrary and ought to be ignored, and quite a different thing to actually demonstrate how this can be done. And while I don’t think Sapolsky fully achieves his stated goal, his efforts to do so are heroic and effectual.The first half of Behave plays out like a tennis match that travels back in time, with the ball representing the focus of Sapolsky’s chapters and the net representing a (somewhat arbitrary) boundary between behavioral mechanisms that operate primarily inside or outside the human body. He begins with “One Second Before,” an explanation of the neurobiology that takes place just before behavior is enacted, then transitions to “Seconds to Minutes Before,” where he discusses immediate environmental stimuli that contribute to behavior. Next comes “Hours to Days Before,” a discussion of how hormones influence behavior, which is followed by “Days to Months Before,” where he takes up long-term neural plasticity (learning and memory).This pattern continues, with subsequent chapters addressing adolescence, early childhood development, genetics, culture, and humanity’s shared evolutionary heritage. So Sapolsky makes use of the buckets of explanation by taking up these topics one at a time (what else could he do?), but also goes to great lengths to show as many interactive areas of overlap between the different causal mechanisms as possible. This truly is a “both/and” story he is telling, with all the moving parts affecting all the other moving parts in profound and intriguing ways.The second half of Behave is more traditionally structured, and wades into dicier territory. Sapolsky tackles tricky subjects such as tribalism, moral intuition and bias, power dynamics, ethical motivation, empathy, the power of symbols to move us to action (or not), free will, criminal justice, and war. These areas of study are all rapidly evolving along with society and technology, so it’s impossible to tell how relevant Sapolsky’s assessments will be in decades to come. But all in all, this is the best and most up-to-date summary of recent findings in these fields one could hope to engage with. I probably had to read between ten and twenty other books to discover most of the insights Sapolsky distills into just a few hundred pages.All of this should be more than enough to convince science and ethics enthusiasts that Behave is essential reading. If you’re eager to run out and pick it up, just stop reading here and go for it. But if you want to stick around, I’ll give some thoughts about what I see as Sapolsky’s most important findings.Sapolsky’s most critical point by far is the importance of context in understanding human behavior. This is hardly a novel position, but Sapolsky lays out the argument for contextualization with sui generis assiduousness and clarity. Over and over he pounds the table about context, tirelessly illuminating the ways in which human behavior is sensitive to myriad influences both inside and outside the body. Most of these influences are partially or completely hidden from our conscious experience of the world, and it is only through scientific inquiry and abstraction that we come to understand their significance. Perhaps the wildest demonstration of this is the role of transcription factors in determining how a person’s genome expresses itself:""95 percent of DNA is noncoding…What is that 95 percent? Some is junk––remnants of pseudogenes inactivated by evolution. But buried in that are the keys to the kingdom, the instructional manual for when to transcribe particular genes, the on/off switches for gene transcription. A gene doesn’t 'decide' when to be photocopied into RNA, to generate its protein. Instead before the start of the stretch of DNA coding for that gene is a short stretch called a promoter––the 'on' switch. What turns the promoter switch on? Something called a transcription factor (TF) binds to the promoter…Thus transcription factors regulate genes. What regulates transcription factors? The answer devastates the concept of genetic determinism: the environment."" (226, emphasis his)Sapolsky goes on to explain that numerous factors––ones present inside cells, inside bodies, and even outside bodies––can all nudge transcription factors one way or another. This means that, while a person’s genome stays constant throughout life, gene expression (the manner in which genes code for the particular proteins that make you you) is keenly sensitive to environmental conditions and constantly in flux. Furthermore, it turns out that transcription factors are usually proteins themselves, and therefore require other transcription factors to instruct genes to code for them:""Genomes aren’t infinite; instead TFs regulate one another’s transcription, solving that pesky infinity problem. Importantly, across the species whose genomes have been sequenced, the longer the genome (i.e., roughly the more genes there are), the greater the percentage of genes coding for TFs. In other words, the more genomically complex the organism, the larger the percentage of the genome devoted to gene regulation by the environment...The human genome codes for about 1,500 different TFs, contains 4,000,000 TF-binding sites, and the average cell uses about 200,000 such sites to generate its distinctive gene-expression profile. This is boggling."" (228-9, emphasis his)Boggling indeed, but also fucking fabulous. O brave new world, that has such people in ‘t! The level of detail and complexity in the example above is indicative of every section and chapter Behave has to offer. Sapolsky doesn’t cut corners or succumb to simplistic reductionism, seeking instead to repeatedly blow the reader’s mind by showing the grand scope of what goes into decisions as simple as deciding whether to reach out to touch someone’s arm. Every step of the way, we are bombarded with caveats, clarifications, contradictions, and pitfalls of empirical limitation. It would be infuriating if it weren’t so damned fascinating! Sapolsky’s main thrust––that context is always crucial and never simple when trying to understand behavior––could not be better delivered. It also carries a hopeful undertone because many of the environmental contexts in which humans must operate are created and controlled by humans, implying that we can genuinely help people lead better lives if we learn how to fiddle the environmental dials the right way. Our power in this regard is far from limitless, but hardly insignificant (I’ll return to this at the end of the review).Behave also contains strong arguments for the elimination of poverty and abuse, especially in the lives of children. Sapolsky grinds out a glut of ghastly facts about how “childhood adversity” can compromise people later in life:""Childhood adversity increases the odds of an adult having (a) depression, anxiety, and/or substance abuse; (b) impaired cognitive capacity, particularly related to frontocortical function; (c) impaired impulse control and emotion regulation; (d) antisocial behavior, including violence; and (e) relationships that replicate the adversities of childhood (e.g., staying with an abusive partner)."" (194)He immediately follows up by pointing out that “some individuals endure miserable childhoods just fine,” and makes it clear that anything goes when looking at a particular case (194). But the trending effects of childhood adversity are undeniable and terrible. Like many other insights in Behave, this is not anything we didn’t already know; it’s the sheer volume and artful presentation of Sapolsky’s converging evidence that gives his work inimitable force. He is also not afraid to bind these findings to strong, empirically-based arguments that reject egregious income inequality and promote investment in public goods:""It’s not so much that poverty predicts poor heath; it’s poverty amid plenty––income inequality. The surest way to make someone feel poor is to rub their nose in what they don’t have…When social capital decreases (thanks to inequality), up goes psychological stress…If you want to improve health and quality of life for the average person in a society, you spend money on public goods––better public transit, safer streets, cleaner water, better public schools, universal health care…Inequality means more secession of the wealthy from contributing to the public good."" (294-5)There’s no denying that this is a kind of liberal do-gooder wishlist, tinged with Sapolsky’s political leanings. Although it leaves him open to criticism, I admire Sapolsky for linking research with certain normative outcomes when he deems it appropriate. It is a fitting strategy for this moment in time, when the notion of any truly “objective” source of information has become obsolete. The best we’ve got are people like Sapolsky, who humbly bend the knee to reason and reality even when they’d rather the universe were otherwise, and who also fight tooth and nail to be heard when reason and reality actually support their political points of view.The final aspects of Behave I want to take up are Sapolsky’s direct claims that we can and should use science to improve the chances of people acting well instead of badly, along with his implicit argument that narrative and storytelling have a huge role to play in this grand project. While science is perhaps humanity’s most powerful method for analyzing and improving environmental conditions, narrative is a timeless tool for teaching people to assume the perspectives of others and to individuate potential enemies instead of reducing them to faceless members of a reviled out-group. This comes through in Sapolsky’s recommendations for dealing with humanity’s inescapably tribal nature:""From massive, breathtaking barbarity to countless pinpricks of microaggression, Us versus Them has produced oceans of pain. Yet our generic goal is not to 'cure' us of Us/Them dichotomizing. It can’t be done…If we accept that there will always be sides, it’s a nontrivial to-do list item to always be on the side of angels. Distrust essentialism. Keep in mind that what seems like rationality is often just rationalization, playing catch-up with subterranean forces that we never suspect. Focus on the larger, shared goals. Practice perspective taking,. Individuate, individuate, individuate. Recall the historical lessons of how often the truly malignant Thems keep themselves hidden and make third parties the fall guy."" (423-4)Sapolsky doesn’t take what I see as the next logical step here, which is to assert that the easiest way people can begin checking off his anti-tribal “to-do list” is to engage with stories that open the way to novel perspectives and unfamiliar modes of moral calculus. We should draw heavily on the power of narrative to simulate social complexity and teach the lessons Sapolsky rightly identifies as essential for ethical education. He points out in a later chapter that, despite its considerable downsides, “our confusion of the literal and the metaphorical, our granting of life-threatening sanctity to the symbolic, can be used to bring about the best of our behaviors” (579). There is a momentous marriage between the arts and sciences embedded in this outlook––a marriage more sacred than any of the supposedly sacrosanct folderol that has hitherto spawned from the imaginative shit-heap of human history.Stories can teach us to think and act better, but only science can deliver the building blocks and blueprints for our better world. When wrapping up a discussion of how former enemies reach reconciliation, Sapolsky implores readers to “recognize that science can teach us how to make events like these more likely” (670). He knows it’s a game of probability; we can’t force people to be good, but we can make it systemically easier for them to make the right choice, even if we know the “rightness” of that choice will always be at least partially if not wholly circumstantial. The more we learn about the light and dark tendencies inherent in human nature and particular arenas of action, the more capable we become of incentivizing instances of good behavior and minimizing instances of bad behavior. Scrupulousness of the highest order is called for, but the project is both worthy and necessary.I’d be delighted to spin out some final words that would drive home everything that is special about this book, but I couldn’t hope to top Sapolsky himself:""If you had to boil this book down to a single phrase, it would be 'It’s complicated.' Nothing seems to cause anything; instead everything just modulates something else. Scientists keep saying, “We used to think X, but now we realize that…” Fixing one thing often messes up ten more, as the law of unintended consequences reigns. On any big, important issue it seems like 51 percent of the scientific studies conclude one thing, and 49 percent conclude the opposite. And so on. Eventually it can seem hopeless that you can actually fix something, can make things better. But we have no choice but to try. And if you are reading this, you are probably ideally suited to do so. You’ve amply proven you have intellectual tenacity. You probably also have running water, a home, adequate calories, and lows odds of festering with a bad parasitic disease. You probably don’t have to worry about Ebola virus, warlords, or being invisible in your world. And you’ve been educated. In other words, you’re one of the lucky humans. So try.""

231,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77785790-david,4,"I think of this book as an introduction to pre-crime. I believe the term that the author uses is ""neurocriminology"", but the essential unifying premise of the book is that human choices are predetermined by complex biological factors which neuroscientists are just beginning to understand in ways that will eventually allow these specialists to predict very specific criminal and antisocial behaviors before, sometimes long before, the actors consciously choose them. We inherently function as if our choices are independent, spontaneous and free. Westerners particularly tend to view ourselves as autonomous individuals. This book will shatter these notions. Most or all of our choices are made before we are consciously aware of them, and most of our choices are not really originate in the individual. Our thoughts and decisions arise from our primordial past, our education, and the biological / environmental conditions immediately preceding ""our"" decisions.The most difficult aspect of the book for me was the insufferable liberalism of the author. The book opens with a gratuitous fantasy about all the horrible things the author would do to Hitler, if given the chance. The author also avails himself of every opportunity to illustrate how racist and bigoted white people are compared to nonwhites. It's never made clear why the author harbors such biases, but it's clear that he feels both justified and righteous for doing so.The concessions which the author makes concerning human biology and behavior are all the more enlightening given his openly hard left bias. For example, Sapolsky conclusively denies that ""nurture"" is the pre-eminent factor in determining human behavior. At the same time, he also gives evidence to show that inherited, genetic traits are strongly modified by the environment, whether that be biochemical or social.Sapolsky affirms the biological reality of kin selection by citing mouse studies showing that mammals produce biochemicals enabling individuals to ""smell"" how closely related other individuals are. Mice, among others, preferentially socialize with individuals whom they sense are more closely related, all else being equal. On the other hand, mice and other animals can be trained artificially to ignore this natural bias for their kin and affiliate with non-related individuals.Similarly, the author points out that human social structures tend to be ethnocentric. Human studies show that whites have an innate, preconscious bias towards their own kind and against blacks. Nevertheless, it's possible to ""overcome"" this ""xenophobia"" with appropriate conditioning, according to the author. Sapolsky consistently recognizes the fact that humans and animals naturally desire to bond with relatives and kin, yet he regularly affirms this natural tendency is ""bad"" or ""xenophobic"".The ""fallacy of naturalism"" struck me as a profound insight into the character not only of Sapolsky, but of the leftist cultural phenomenon as a whole. Such liberals are characterized by the belief that what is natural and instinctive is often wrong and must be artificially re-engineered in order to achieve harmony. By contrast, the opposing view of many conservatives is that nature is correct, even sacrosanct. This view of nature's correctness is easily seen in Austrian Economics, for instance.Another key aspect of the liberal left versus the conservative right that I noticed in this book was the fact that liberal tendencies typically arise from people who are insulated from the exigencies of life relative to those people who are regularly exposed to hardship. Sapolsky cites studies showing, for instance, that conservative people experience nightmares more frequently and suffer from more adversity in general than their liberal counterparts.This adversity-conservatism correlation was also illustrated by a narrative describing the social transformation of a troop of baboons from an endogamous, tribal, aggressive, and patriarchal community to a relatively exogamous, passive, and female-dominant one. How did this transformation occur? It occurred in response to an unlimited supply of low-cost food: the troop settled near a garbage dump where they ate leftovers from human tourists and became ""liberalized"".The same appears to be true for primitive human society. Sapolsky devotes considerable space to the question of whether archaic hunter-gatherer and pastoral human societies were violent and aggressive or peaceful and harmonious. What he shows is that scarcity of resources provokes the former, while abundance promotes the latter. Thus, the ""noble savage"" resolves to the ""well-fed savage"" who becomes more savage and less noble he becomes more hungry.Conservatism and hunger are not only linked in the case of monkeys and tribal humans. Sapolsky notes that criminal justices statistically deliver harsher sentences when they have skipped breakfast. Combined with the observation that conservative people often have more nightmares and other adverse experiences, a theme emerges: liberalism of all kinds is the natural product of affluence and excess, while conservatism is the natural response to adversity and hardship.However, culture is not merely the expression of environmental resources over time. Behavior is embedded in the biology and genetics of the individuals forming a community. Sapolsky cites the famous Dmitry Belyayev Russian Fox study which showed that selective breeding could produce docile foxes. Sapolsky also cited a similar study showing that feral behavioral traits could be bred out of rats. These studies showed, according to Sapolsky, that behaviors which we think of a volitional and ""free"" may, in fact, be the inevitable result of genetic selection.This is a fascinating admission from a leftist author since it forms the key premise of ""A Troublesome Inheritance"" by Nicholas Wade. Wade's book is described as ""controversial"" largely because it applies the Russian Fox study (among others) to human society. Sapolsky shies away from such conclusions, yet both he and Wade agree that human behavior is heritable, just like animal behavior is. Further, both explicitly reject the absurd ""blank slate"" hypothesis of the social constructivists. Sapolsky's book can, in many ways, be seen a single, massive refutation of ""blank slate"" theory, yet in practice, Sapolsky advocates against the idea that our heritable traits are generally good. Our natural proclivity to identify and associate with kin leads, in his view, to violence, ""xenophobia"", and antisocial behavior. Thus, Sapolsky sees it as necessary for social harmony to scientifically overcome our natural tendency towards ""pseudospeciation"" based on biological factors like genes and race.Sapolsky regularly returns to the theme of ""green-beard effects"" wherein individuals in society identify and associate with individuals who share specific phenotypical traits, such as dark skin or blue eyes. Sapolsky automatically asserts that such effects are irrational, even dangerous. With this in mind, he documents various scientifically-validated techniques for replacing natural, racially-based green-beard effects with artificial ones, such as affiliation on the basis of organized sports.Conservative, ethnocentric thinkers like Wade, Pat Buchanan, and Ann Coulter observe the same green-beard and kin-selection effects but that such effects are both good and natural. In the conservative paradigm, separation of the tribe is the solution, not the problem. Both sides admit the existence of the natural tendency to form kin-based tribes, yet authors like Sapolsky generally affirm that advocacy of such nativism constitutes the dangerous logical fallacy of ""moral naturalism"".Sapolsky regularly makes jabs at moral naturalism. His main criticism is that what is perceived to be natural at one time often changes later. Thus, culture mediates our perception of what is ""natural"" and ""good"" versus what is ""unnatural"" and ""bad"". Sapolsky sees this as a an opportunity for reshaping social perceptions to accept new ""unnatural"" things as ""good"" and ""natural"", while the conservative instinct is to pass on what is perceived as natural from one generation to the next.If we accept the essential premise of Behave, then the choice to be liberal (in the sense of adoption what is unnatural and foreign) versus conservative (the preservation of the natural) is biological and subconscious rather than objective and rational. Furthermore, if we accept that the instinct to conserve kin-based groups and ostracize foreign races is dangerous and subversive, then it is easy to cast racial conservatism as a mental disorder rather than a rational decision. The same is true in reverse: if liberal tendencies are heritable, biological, and subversive rather than rational and ""free"", then liberalism is a ultimately disease. This isn't a new idea: Michael Savage, for instance, is notable for his regular insistence that liberalism is a mental disorder. In the opposite camp, it's not uncommon for liberals to insist that conservatism is the result of inbreeding, mental retardation, or childhood trauma.The ultimate end of rational dialog comes when we finally accept that people with views opposite to our own are not going to change their minds or become ""converted"" on the basis of rational argumentation and evidence. Various biological markers predispose people to adopt the views which they hold such that the conscious, rational portion of our brain constitutes a thin veneer over the primal realities of our nature.Viewing liberalism and conservatism as biological traits leads us to the ultimate question: will liberalism or conservatism ultimately wipe out the opposing trait and achieve hegemony in the human population, or at least in specific human population groups? Drawing on the above-mentioned studies, I conclude that while resources are abundant, docile, passive, and liberal traits will be dominant while virile, defensive, and conservative traits will become recessive relics of a dark, irrelevant past."
232,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7422525-scriptor-ignotus,5,"IT’S COMPLICATED “I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.”  — Sir Isaac NewtonWhy do people do what they do? Of all the sciences, that of our own behavior is often the most unsettling in its mysteriousness. Delivering a precise and comprehensive causal explanation for any form of human behavior is almost always impossible, and to attempt even a general account requires one to interface with a bewildering array of methodologies, disciplinary perspectives, spatial and temporal scales of analysis, and the necessary but overwhelmingly nuanced and complex interrelationship between all these factors. If any piece of the causal puzzle is missing—which is always the case, as biologists have not (yet) fully mapped the causal chains that produce our most unique and sophisticated behaviors—then none of the other pieces quite fit together either, leaving unanswered some of the most fundamental questions regarding who and what we are. We are enigmatic even (perhaps especially) to ourselves—as psychology and the humanities have long attested—even though self-knowledge may be the most critical necessity for the survival and flourishing of our species and its planetary habitat. Behave is an incredibly ambitious cross-disciplinary gesture towards a complete picture of the biological substrata of human behavior. As a study which attempts to account for both the profoundest depths of cruelty and sadism and the most exalted heights of compassion and benevolence characteristic of our kind, and which attempts not to override and dismiss but to affirm and buttress the full spectrum of approaches for thinking about human nature, it is the most genuinely humanistic science book I have read. Behave is organized in two main parts. The first part, composed of the first nine chapters, is likely the most thorough exposition of the multilayered biological underpinnings of human behavior ever put in print. Each chapter is framed as part of a skeletal narrative: a behavior has just occurred: what happened in the seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, years, centuries, and millennia beforehand that could help explain why it happened? Each consecutive chapter widens Sapolsky’s analytical lens. When we think about what happened one second before the behavior occurred, we’re in the realm of cellular neurobiology. Neurons in the brain are generating action potentials in response to a stimulus; these disturbances of the negative charge inside of a neuron, caused by openings in the dendritic spines which allow positively-charged ions to flow through, travel from the dendritic spines through the cell body and, if the electrical disturbance passes a certain threshold, through the axon to the axon terminals, which send neurotransmitters across synapses that connect with specialized receptors on the dendritic spines of subsequent neurons, which causes the opening of channels in the membrane for positive ions, which generates action potentials in those neurons, and so on. The collection of 100 billion neurons in each human body and their integrated axonal projections are, at the cellular level, what constitute the vast and intricate circuitry of the nervous system. The generation of collective action potentials in billions of neurons in a particular brain region is what neuroscientists refer to when they speak about the “activation” of brain regions in response to stimuli. Move the timescale back to seconds or minutes before the behavior, and we’re looking at the macro organization of the brain. At this level our behaviors are mediated through the interaction of brain regions. The ancient amygdala, the almond-shaped core of the limbic system, mediates fear, anxiety, and aggression, and is often the first brain region to activate in response to unfamiliar stimuli. People who demonstrate more implicit bias against racial out-groups show more amygdaloid activation when presented with faces of people of another race, and the amygdala shows growth and overactivity in the brains of people suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Overlaying the amygdala are the higher limbic structures, which regulate base emotions, and the cortex, which mediates most of our higher cognitive functions, such as memory, language, motor skills, facial recognition, and contextual judgment. The newest brain region, in evolutionary terms, is the prefrontal cortex (PFC): the crown jewel of executive function, the seat of strategic knowledge organization, delayed gratification, social and cultural acclimation, contextualization, and the regulation of emotionality and impulsivity. It is also the last brain region to mature in an individual lifetime, not coming fully online until around age 25—a critical fact when thinking about the brilliance and deviancy so uniquely characteristic of adolescence.The late maturation of the PFC indicates something astonishing about the evolution of the human brain. The wiring of the PFC is not significantly more complex than that of other cortical regions, nor does it consist of a different type of neuron—with a few limited exceptions. Biologically speaking, it isn’t any “harder” to develop a prefrontal cortex than it is to develop any other part of the brain, which likely means that the delayed development of the PFC was selected for by our hominid ancestors. We evolved in such a way that the makeup of the frontal cortex, because its development is delayed, is shaped by the makeup of our other brain regions, which in turn are shaped by personal experiences. By developing later, the PFC is designed to accommodate the neurological “lessons” of our own, individual lives. The genetic program of our brain development has evolved to liberate the frontal cortex from genetics. Of course, none of these brain regions are discrete entities, and none are free from the influences of hormones and environmental factors. Expanding our timescale to account for the hours to months before a behavior occurs involves reference to endocrinology, the effect of hormones on behavior via their influencing of the nervous system, and the plasticity of the brain. Here Sapolsky debunks some common misunderstandings about the role of certain hormones in behavior; namely testosterone and oxytocin. Hormones are not “instigators” of behavior; in fact, one of the overarching themes of the entire book is that there is never a single biological cause of any behavior, but rather a vast field of facilitating and inhibiting factors that influence the probability of certain behaviors to degrees that are not always quantifiable. Androgens like testosterone are facilitators of behavior. They make the amygdala more sensitive to triggers of aggression, but only among people who are already predisposed to acts of aggression. Nor is aggression the single, inevitable result of testosterone production. Testosterone levels increase not only in response to situations demanding aggression, but also in situations in which one’s social status is uncertain, changing, or perceived to be under threat. In those situations testosterone does not facilitate violence per se; it facilitates whatever behavior is necessary for one to secure status. If a society bases its status relations on, say, charitability, then testosterone won’t cause you to strangle a cheetah; it will cause you to insist on paying the tab at a restaurant. If testosterone has an unfairly negative reputation, oxytocin has an unfairly positive one. This “luv hormone” facilitates bonds between mothers and infants, bonds between humans and their canine pets, and the pair-bonding of monogamous romantic couples; but these salutary effects are relegated to in-group relations. Oxytocin increases our prosociality towards an “Us”, but it also makes us more suspicious of “Thems”. It does not facilitate free love, but rather parochialism. In the second part of the book, Sapolsky attempts to synthesize the complicated layers of knowledge laid out in the first half, and to offer some insight as to how these biological factors influence our best and worst behaviors. I can hardly do justice to the nuances of the discussions in each chapter, but they address such topics as our instinctual categorization of people into In-Groups and Out-Groups and how and why we prioritize some dimensions of “Us-ness” over others; the unique human capacity for establishing and navigating hierarchies and the physically corrosive effects of having the “wrong” status in a particular social context (Sapolsky is a Rousseauian primitivist, and considers the agricultural revolution to be the greatest blunder in human history for the role it played in establishing rigid and dramatic status hierarchies); the neurological correlates of empathy (and how it’s better if our altruism is instinctive rather than an act of willpower); how metaphorical thinking is innate to our biology (and why a society is in extremely dangerous territory if certain members of it are persuasively associated with insects or fecal matter; hyperactivity of the insular cortex, which regulates disgust responses, can make one an ethnic cleanser—or worse, a germaphobe); the question of free will and how our conception of justice should be framed accordingly (Sapolsky is a strong determinist and thinks a criminal justice system based on punishment is totally irrational); and, of course, war and peace. Why do people do what they do? Sapolsky’s short answer is: it’s really complicated. No, really, that’s his answer; that’s the conclusion he comes to at the end of this big, beautiful disaster of a book. But understanding, though difficult, is possible; and with understanding comes a spirit of mercy which could perhaps change the world."
233,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22844682-pat-rolston,5,"If Professor Sapolsky teaches as well as he writes then his students are among the most fortunate in any classroom on the planet. This is one of those rare authors who can educate the reader while entertaining regarding a topic of staggering complexity. I hope this gift does indeed carry over to his classroom at Stanford in which case there will undoubtedly be a lot of inspired youth pursuing answers to the mysteries of the brain. I took considerable time to read this book as there were many opportunities to reread the passage or concept at hand and contemplate the subject in depth. There is also great reference information and appendices to help those of us needing liberal doses of assistance. As one of the greatest benefits of such books are the attributions and opportunity to read the books referenced I will add one for consideration that won't disappoint: ""The Archaeology of Mind: Neuroevolutionary Origins of Human Emotion."" by Jaak Panksepp and Lucy Biven. This is worthy of mentioning in the same review as Professor Sapolsky's masterpiece.  As with so many things in life the satisfaction is directly proportional to the effort expended and Robert Sapolsky's book, ""Behave,"" will help you better understand what chemistry and brain structures combined with environmental factors are potentially at the root of this feeling. This is not an author espousing an absolute deterministic view, but leaves room for something more that makes us human that our science has yet to discover the metrology to measure.

237,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31302406-lori,5,"I have a very quick rule of thumb to measure up books meant popularise science: if it leaves one thinking ""ow it's much more complicated than that"", then it's a good book. And I was very pleased to see the author echo—explicitly, obviously this was implicit throughout the book— much of the same sentiment in the Epilogue: If you had to boil down this book to a single phrase it would be ""it's complicated"" (p. 674)   Highly recommended to anyone trying to understand what it is to inhabit this meat suit we call a human body. Although, fair warning, you will be left with a great feeling of uncertainty afterwards; i.e. you will be made aware of your own ignorance, and most important—hopefully—you will shut up about ""human nature"" at every turn. You can also expect to have your (yes, your) simplistic notions of biological determinism shattered.  Now, a slightly more elaborate exposition than ""it's complicated"": Any meaningful analysis of the behaviour of human species deals with biology-environment interactions. One can expect to learn that: testosterone, oxytocin, mirror neurons, and pretty much any new fad protein, neurotransmitter, or brain region does not work the way you thought it did.  The negative effects of poverty, inequality, and social hierarchy in general are laid bare—or shorter SES (socio-economic status). The science is in: these societal dynamics wreak havoc on everything from IQ (p. 249) to health, to exacerbating anti-social behavior. Most fascinating is the fact that the lower you are on the wealth inequality ladder, the poorer your health. And get this, only a third of this degradation is due to actual, poorer material conditions. It is the subjective experience that matters, and the definitive knowledge and reality of having someone who's infinitely richer than you, and capable of shitting down the ladder—so to speak—on you. (p. 441 contains a nice bullet-point list of the known effects). Now, I am going to go on a tangent, to something the author did not mention, but as a filthy red I am almost obliged to do so. If we look into the work of Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century, and more importantly in Karl Marx's Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, Vol 1, we see capitalism's inevitable, structural tendency to create utterly obscene inequalities. Now, given that we know the negative effects of inequality on human beings and the causes of these inequalities, it should be trivial to synthesise a necessary political project: anti-capitalism.Ok, now, back to the content of the book. Robert Sapolsky—rightly so—criticizes Steven Pinker's The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined for cherry picking some of the data referring to primitive societies (p. 311-315). Mislabelling of hunter-horticulturalists (p. 321) as hunter gatherers, thus shadowing the plethora of research showing distinct ""pro-social"" behaviour of the former group. Failure to adjust for length of conflict (p. 614-620) in determining how violent historical periods were, doubly baffling given that Pinker all the while (correctly) adjusted the total victim count for overall world population size at that time—glaring oversight. Overall, a fairly positive critique, but one that leaves the reader with the impression ""it's more complicated than that"" (unlike Pinker's own conclusions). Note: the page references in this paragraph are to ""Behave"".  My own point of contention with the book, is that it omits a plethora of anthropological, and historical studies into human civilization (Lewis Mumford, E.A Gutkind, David Graeber)—while tapping into what seems to be a clichee body of work that is being passed around in the same Ivy League circles (essentially the same body of work as used by Pinker). This also leads to the author using some historically impoverished definitions of ""individualist"" and ""collectivist"" cultures—the latter being extremely poorly represented, and mostly by modern ""samples"". Mentions of ancient, medieval, and revolutionary period cities, which would be much better examples than modern ones, are woefully absent.  In short, this books is broad in its analysis of biology, but rather narrow in its analysis of society. But nonetheless, it is still an endless mine of fresh knowledge that would take forever for me to go through in this review. Luckily, the Epilogue has a nice bullet-point list (albeit it is not exhaustive of the content). Overall, Behave it deeply fascinating, and definitely worth a read! I highly recommend this book to everyone!"
238,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30276417-nancy-mills,5,"Fascinating book that begins with some rather difficult lessons in endocrinology and neuroloscience, but after the author lays that foundation, the books blooms into a dense but highly entertaining tomb about how behavior is affected by genes, hormones, environmental factors (that of course affect hormones), and then the guy actually has the nerve to go into the topic of Free Will ... and does a great job all the way. Here I am compelled to add a lengthy quote from the author, in a footnote, of course:""And the one thing I'm not going anywhere near is this New Age-y notion, ""Of course we have free will. You can't say that our behavior is determined by a mechanistic universe, because the universe is indeterminate, because of quantum mechanics."" Argh. What anyone sensible who has thought about this will point out is that (a)the consequences of subatomic indeterminacy of quantum mechanics (about which I understand zero) don't ripple upward enough to influence behavior, and (b) if they did, the result wouldn't be the freedom to will your behavior. It would be the utter randomization of behavior. In the words of philosopher/neuroscientist Sam Harris, a free will trasher, if quantum mechanics actually played a role in any of this, 'Every thought and action would seem to merit the statement ""I don't know what just came over me."""" Except you wouldn't actually be able to make that statement, since you'd just makinggarly sounds because the muscles in your tongue would be doing all sorts of random things.""Well I guess he told THEM!There is a chapter toward the back of the book entitled ""Biology, the Criminal Justice System, and Free Will,"" which will get your frontal cortex neurons twitching if anything will.Conclusions aren't cut and dry, if that's what you were hoping, but certainly will give the reader a tremendous background, if one can manage to absorb even half of the book's contents. If you're not all that into biology and long scientific words, you can get away with skimming the tough parts. I plowed through it and found it very rewarding. There are 3 Appendices, all good that you can skip if you don't want to learn about Neuroscience, Endocrinology or Protein Basics.Dr. Sapolsky is sympathetic, maybe even empathetic (the books discusses these phenomena) toward the the reader who may find the material dense, and his humor more than redeems his asking us to familiarize ourselves with all this stuff. Anterior Something Cingulate. dmELvE. vm LLpe. I don't know. A whole bunch of acronyms. Half way through the book I accidentally found out that there is a glossary in the back that defines each acronym which certainly makes things tons easier. Anyway, the author is understanding. One passage, for example, reads ""This is a bold assertion that the heuristic of dialectical materialism not only extends beyond the economic world into the naturalistic one, but is ontologically rooted in the essential sameness of both worlds' dynamic resolution of irresolvable contradictions."" Before the you throw the book across the room, the author adds this footnote: ""I have no idea what it is that I just wrote..."" He bravely plows ahead with ""It is Marx and Engels as trilobite and snail,"" and immediately footnotes again: ""Ditto."" Truthfully my main complaint is that the footnotes, which are numerous and are at times the best parts of the text, and printed in such teeny print that even with my glasses I had trouble reading them after the sun went down with my 60 watt bulb. There are, of course, about a million end notes to, which I seldom bothered with.Sapolsky, in his final chapter, delves into War and Peace (the subject, not the novel) and reveals some very interesting behaviors on the battlefield versus way back behind the lines where men in fancy uniforms make strategics decisions. And the part about drone pilots, who shoot targets thousands of miles away, nevertheless get bad cases of PTSD in spite of the fact that they are never physically putting their own lives in danger. Remarkable findings.One of the most worthwhile books I've read this year, highly recommended for people who like to read and don't mind a little mental exercise."
239,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,4,"This brick of a book purports to be an interdisciplinary explanation of human behavior, drawing from biology, psychology, and sociology, and everything from primate studies to well-known works in various fields. It’s big, at 717 pages of actual text followed by references; it’s broad; and as such it’s a little bit simplistic. Even at this size, there’s not quite room to develop all of the material. The first half or so of the book is more focused on the “hard” science, beginning with how neurons communicate with each other, and working its way up through hormones, genes, brain development through childhood and adulthood and how this is affected by trauma, and the evolution of species. The second half is more focused on psychology: us vs. them dichotomies, moral decisionmaking, the causes of violence, and whether the criminal justice system really makes sense when all human behavior is ultimately driven by biology. (Sapolsky argues no, but I’m not so sure. Where would we be as a species, or as individuals, if we all just shrugged our shoulders and gave in to ideas of biological determinism?)I certainly learned a lot from this book, which contains a ton of information presented in a way that is understandable to a non-scientist – though I struggled a bit with some of the early chapters. It provides a strong synthesis and framework for understanding information from biology and social sciences. That said, on the subjects that I did know something about, it seemed a little simplified. Fair enough; entire books have been written on subjects that comprise a single chapter here. As other reviewers have suggested, Sapolsky perhaps accepts too many psychological studies uncritically, without discussing psychology’s replication crisis, in which dozens of famous studies, when run again using the exact same methods and parameters, failed to produce the same headline-worthy results. That said, in general Sapolsky seems to take a fair approach to his material, presenting and evaluating multiple viewpoints in areas that have generated controversy. His writing is readable given the subject matter, and there’s a goofy-professor personality behind it that occasionally shines through. I wouldn’t take everything here as gospel – and I suppose we never should, since new scientific discoveries regularly require us to reevaluate what we thought was true – but the book did leave me a little more educated than I was before."

What is it with biologists and well written non-fiction that does not completely gloss over the details? The book is fairly long and appears to lack a central thesis except that ""it's complicated"". But ""Nothing seems to cause anything, instead everything just modulates everything else"" is probably closer to the truth than the endless internet debates over nature vs nurture.However even though the book is expansive, remembering to critique both sides of the debate (not even Pinker or Ramachandran are spared) while being filled with citation and humorous footnotes, I still had a few minor issues that force me to discount other things as well. Things like Wellesley effect and Freakonomics explanation of drop in crime rate in US are presented without any remarks about the contentious nature of the findings (largely believed to be false I think, but I could be wrong)."

It's probably a little too textbook-like for some readers, but for those who really want to get a good general grounding in what science in 2017 tells us about behavior, there is probably no better place to go.I particularly liked the discussions on the law and neuroscience, and a really nuanced take on role (or lack thereof) of genetics in behavioral determinism, and final chapter relating to war (and peace)."
242,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,4,"It is common these days to come across people who have developed a strong dislike for all reductionist approaches. They prefer holistic views, and are suspicious of any knowledge that has been derived through breaking up a big problem into smaller chunks. I can understand why they feel that way, but I have always felt that such feelings can only be harbored when one is unfamiliar with the depth of the subject in question, and therefore assumes a simplistic view of things. For example, I know of many people who are suspicious of normal medical science because it treats each organ as a separate functional entity, and expertise within the medical profession is divided by such narrow specializations. They prefer a medical science that looks at the big picture, which includes not just the various sub-systems, but combines the body with the mind. This is a wise and noble thought until we realize the complexity of the whole system. Once we do, the justification of breaking it up into smaller systems become obvious. All the knowledge we have about our body could not have been attained without first breaking it up into the various organs and trying to understand how they work in isolation. Once that has reached a certain level of details can we afford to put them back together and investigate the far more complex interactions between these systems. If we tried to bypass the reductionist step in the first place, we would have been stuck with vague and faulty theories of how the body works, as can be found in all ancient texts. A responsible form of holistic science cannot be rushed. In many cases we may not even be ready to take that step, and must wait till we have better understanding of the parts.Of all the systems we have investigated so far, the physical systems of materials and forces, chemical systems, astronomical systems, and biological systems – they all yielded fairly well to the scientific reductionist methodologies. However, the biggest challenge lies ahead in understanding the most complex system we have encountered so far – our mind. Huge progress has been made in this direction in the last few decades. The progress happened through advances in neuroscience, biology, computational science, evolutionary sciences, psychology etc. Problems that were beyond any convincing and demonstrable theory are regularly being converted into understandable bits of knowledge. In this environment of tremendous progress, where all the different branches seems to be converging, it is not unexpected that many specialists start to believe that they have finally figured it out. I have read many books where brilliant minds would try to prove how their specialty, be it neuroscience or evolutionary biology, can finally explain our behavior, our morality, our aesthetic sense, etc. in terms of their science alone.This book is the only one I have read that not only celebrates the great accomplishments of our reductionist approach towards understanding of how the mind works, but also exposes the severe limitations of not appreciating the complexity of all these subsystems when they work together. He systematically shows how each of the systems involved, our neuronal bran, the environment we live in, both in our mother’s womb and the environment outside, our endocrinal systems, our genes, how they all interact and influence each other is incredibly complex ways. The only way we can understand the whole thing is when we allow for these interactions. In other words, why we need to look at the whole thing holistically, while admitting that it can only be done when we understand the parts really well. It is a sobering document because it shows the challenge that lies ahead. Modelling the complexity of the whole system is so complex then we may never be able to crack it open. That is, understanding of an individual mind may remain impossible, while we get better at understanding them in aggregate.The real value of this book is not just in convincing us that full understanding of our mind cannot happen until we integrate all the pieces together, but in nudging us towards a slightly different mindset that can be applied to all complex problems. As in everything else, when we solve one problem, it only presents us with an even more complex problem. And to me, that’s what makes life worth living – that there will never be a shortage of things to ponder."
243,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17937883-avi-singh,5,"Behave is an ambitious book that seeks to explain human behavior at almost every level of abstraction - what parts of the brain lit up in the second before an action (the lizard-ish amygdala, or the primate-y frontal cortex), what sensory information obtained in the past few seconds to minutes “primed” you for it (if people are shown a random string of positive words, they tend to behave nicely in a cooperative game), what hormones were secreted in the past few hours to days (effects of testosterone, oxytocin etc.), what happened in the years before (say during adolescence or childhood), or in the prenatal period (kids show preference to flavors the mother consumed when pregnant, can hear things and show preference to stories they heard while in the womb etc., the “boy/girl” brain development, connections with sexual orientation / identity), what cultural forces in the last few hundred years shaped the behavior (for example, difference between individualistic and collectivistic cultures), and last, but not the least, how evolution in the last thousands of years influence behavior (ideas from sociobiology or evolutionary psychology - kin selection, reciprocative altruism, etc. ). The second part of the book has a slightly different format - as the author delves into specific human behavioral traits (like Us vs Them-ing, hierarchies and obedience, morals, usage of metaphors, violence, etc.), and discusses them in detail, often drawing the fundamental expounded upon in the previous chapters. The book has a entertaining myth-busting style. It will present a hypothesis (say testosterone is responsible for aggression), present experiments in favor of it (castration reduces aggression, injecting testosterone back in brings it back), and then present more experiments that poke holes in the earlier somewhat simplistic explanation (raising testosterone to 10% or 200% of original levels makes no difference as compared to raising to 100%). He also talks about the wars within academia on numerous theories/ideas - neurogenesis, mirror neurons, sociobiology, Stanford Prison Experiment findings etc., which, apart from being entertaining, also reinforce my belief that the author does not only present the theories that he “likes”. Though it’s definitely possible that he did that at certain points in the book, I think he presented the nuanced view more often than not. Sometimes, there’s an information overload, as the author presents results from 5-10 studies in a single paragraph. Also, since a lot of these tend to be psychology studies, their results have to be taken with an appropriate amount of salt. Some of the later chapters are a bit preachy (using intuition vs reason in in-group and out-group interactions, why the current justice system is stupid, how to reduce violence)- but since they are backed by fairly solid science, and logical (to me) explanations, I still enjoyed reading them. In the end, I think it’s a great book, and is peppered with humorous anecdotes, both personal and historical, which makes it easier to go through its ~800 pages. The only “limitation” of the book is its scope - I don’t really think any single book can cover all the issues that this book tackles - but a list compiled from the books referenced here would probably make a great reading list. I might do that at some point. "

Behave will turn heads and raise controversy in the field of neurobiology, something the field has come to expect from Sapolsky, but Behave will also change science writing. Gone is the jargon and hundred-watt rhetoric that repels the plebians and ill-informed. No more tented-fingered, cross-legged analysis.

It was first published in May, 2017. This is one miracle of a book. I don’t know where to start…“Someone does something lousy and selfish to you in a game, and the extent of insular and amygdaloid activation predicts how much outrage you feel and how much revenge you take.” ― Robert M. Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst Book focuses on Robert Sapolsky’s attempt to tackle seemingly impossible question. That is to look at our behavior from every possible angle: biological, psychological, physiological…and there are some historical and cultural angles thrown in to it too. We start with neurobiological angle: what happens in our brains when some specific behavior occurs, what effect do our hormones have on us, what is our genetic makeup, how are we different or even not that different from rest of the animal kingdom… This is not enough. Sapolsky continues by how environment affects us and also focuses on age-old question: are we formed more by nature or nurture? And indeed as mentioned, then we continue with psychology, history, culture…Behave is among the best nonfiction reads ever. It’s stunning, it’s big and it’s absolutely beautiful. I learned so much and it also changed the way I see some things. Here are some of my picks throughout the chapters of the book:Chapter 4: Hours to Days Before: How testosterone increases confidence and optimism and decreases fear and anxiety. Chapter 5: Days to Months Before: Enough time for Arab spring, for a discontented winter or for STDs to spread a lot during a summer of love…and also plenty of time for our brains to change…How there’s long-term LTP and LTD. And veryy long term LTP and LTD and how they work differently in different regions of our brains.“Testosterone makes people cocky, egocentric, and narcissistic.”― Robert M. Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and WorstChapter 15: Metaphors We Kill By: How Rwandan genocide came to be and how metaphors were used as a weapon. Oh the power of metaphors. I have never before realized this. During Rwandan genocide, Tutsis were described as cockroaches. And those cockroaches would steal your husband. They became something that had to be exterminated, swept away from the country. Almost 1 million people dead within 100 days.“Some translation is needed. The Rwandan genocide did not involve tanks, airplanes, dropping bombs or shelling at civilians. There were no concentration camps. No transport trains. No Zyklon-B. There was no bureaucratic banality of evil. There were hardly even many guns.” ― Robert M. Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and WorstChapters 6 & 16: Author explained PMS syndrome. He also explained how PMS syndrome has been used as a criminal defense. And this is not the only sort of crazy sounding criminal defense in the book. There’s also a lot of talk about the development of the brain in earlier chapters and whether a person is or isn’t fully aware of his actions and consequences of those actions due to it… Adolescence. Or. Dude, where is my frontal cortex as the chapter is called.What else… Sapolsky uses the analogy of a car with faulty brakes to describe antisocial human behaviour. How judges give less harsh sentences after they have had lunch! Yes you read that right, judges’ rulings’ are harsher when they are hungrier. And this also works with smells. If you’re in a place that smells bad, you more likely to judge a person or a thing in a negative manner, how there was a Christmas truce in 1914 and how in many wars since soldiers had to be threatened to go kill soldiers from the opposite side. And how opposite of love is not hate …it’s indifference. And to conclude. There is no such thing as free will.I loved this book. As you can probably tell from my review, it’s packed with loads and loads of information in a very simplified, easily understood form. Moreover, there’s a sense of humor or sarcasm in the writing and that always gets one more star from me because it’s like authors are laughing at how idiotic some of the things we do are and I really appreciate that (…we do a lot of dumb shit). Maybe the only downside to the book as I was listening to audio version were all the: “footnotes” and “i see her see i see her see i see?”. They were a bit much in spoken. All in all, a fantastic piece of literature.5/5 stars"
248,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6179509-derek-ouyang,4,"At over 700 pages, this took almost all year to finish. I can't say the journey is necessarily enjoyable -- it's incredibly dense, and Sapolsky admits in his epilogue that the two word TL;DR of his book is ""It's complicated"". But this staggering work is also incredibly rich, like a mental block of cheese that you can only sample in nibbles, and incredibly plastic, meant in the best neurological sense, like a mind actively at work laid bare. And this mind is an incredibly inspiring one. I never took one of his classes, but I think this book is a great representation of what brilliance looks like in a teacher."

I must be his perfect reader-- someone with a working knowledge of popular science, biology, neurology, and psychology-- I get his jokes. He is informative, vastly knowledgable (to put it mildly), speaks to the general reader, and light-handed with his material.I can not think of a better read for the approaching times of neurological understanding of the cause of why people do what they do, and the larger questions of blame in a criminal context. "
250,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81718362-ann,4,"After taking over two months to complete this, I am not sure what to say except 'whew'. This is the most comprehensive book I have read on human behavior. Sapolsky goes beyond the (neuro)biological factors and incorporates cultural, psychological and environmental considerations into the discussion. I wouldn't say this is a difficult read but it is a richly complex and detailed book. Sapolsky's sense of humor helps take the edge off things. By the end, the reader is fully aware of the meaning of, 'it's complicated' when attempting to explain human behavior. In essence, it is very complicated and scientists probably have just scratched the surface in their understanding.What struck me is how 'me' vs 'us' vs 'them' factors into things, even in our split second decision making. The chapters discussing the roles of hormones and neurotransmitters were quite interesting and sometimes the information surprised me. Finally, the chapter titled 'Metaphors We Kill By,' discussing symbolism and symbolic values was actually frightening. The different parts of our brain aren't adept at handling that information in a logical way and symbolic meanings can be interpreted as physical pain or rejection. Ouch and Yikes! Scary stuff. After reading all this, I do believe there is some meaning to the saying 'reality is the stories we tell ourselves' (greatly influenced by our brain's interpretation of things, along with hormonal regulation, genetics, environmental factors, childhood experiences, etc.) For anyone who isn't ready to undertake reading this, I'd recommend checking out some of Sapolsky's lectures from Stanford University on YouTube. There is some overlap between the lectures and the contents of the book. His lecturing style offers a comparable representation to his writing style. "

Sapolsky covers genetics, neurology, development, just to get STARTED on the important half of the book. I have a Master's in Psychology but my undergrad was in genetics and I struggled to keep up with the technical stuff in this book (luckily Sapolsky provides appendices with 101s for folk)So I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book to someone first diving into a piece on human nature, perhaps starting with something like Sapiens, or Ten Types of Humans. However if feeling confident or having plenty of time and cognitive energy to devote to this it should be fine.Overall the book is huge and covers so much its hard to really summarize, I loved that between the technical stuff there was the odd joke, or personal touch that always seemed brilliant. Some of the insights from this book will stick with me for life and while much of the content was heavy it was worthwhile."

The way neuroscience, endocrinology were explained. Its a more important book than most of the books you have read or will read. The scope is wide - covers almost all aspects of human behavior. It lets you learn something new in every chapter. My favorite part is when Sapolsky explains what goes in our brain when any behavior occurs.

Both discuss (in somewhat different contexts) the social, cultural, and psychological evolution of the human animal. Both give reasons for cautious optimism, though both also seem to realize the potential for disaster that looms as we move forward as a species. "
255,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66276739-adam-marischuk,2,"Two books and two different ratings, but you could save a lot of time by watching the youtube videos of kids trying to not eat marshmellows and coming to your own conclusions about human nature.The first half (including the three appendices) of Behave are the more scientific chapters of the book. The appendices are worth reading if, like me, you haven't formally studied biology in a couple of decades. They are a well written and easily digested summary of neuroscience, endocrinology and proteins.The first nine chapter have an interesting organisation, even if I feel it was not well executed. The idea of tracing an action backwards in time to evaluate the causes of the action has some merit, but Professor Sapolsky fails to remain on task and hence the excessive length of the sections. In the introduction he rails against ""buckets"" or categories of answers (the distinction between biology, psychology and culture) and then follows his own holistic advice. But the resulting chapters are disjointed at best. An editor could have cut the book in half without sacrificing any of the science or the audiences' ability to understand and a little of Aristotle's four causes would have benefited both author and audience. The digressions are sometimes interesting but usually merely political marginalia from an aging ""vertebarte, mammal, ape, human, male, scientist, lefty"" (p. 405)What was particularly interesting in the first few chapters is Professor Sapolsky's ability to find middle ground in the nature/nuture debate by bridging the gap between the two and noting the maliabiliy of nature.I suppose if the book had ended after chapter nine it would have received 3-4 stars.But then Professor Sapolsky continues into what I could only call socio-psychology with a dabbing of neuroscience to back up some rather radical leftist views. His discussions on hierarchy, free will, ethics, religion and war all take the same politically inspired position and do not flow seemlessly from the science. Sometimes it is bias mascarading as science, and othertimes it simply leaves the science aside. His discussion of ethics and utilitarianism is particularly egregious, and this is coming from someone who has little sympathy for utilitarianism. The construction of straw-man arguments does little to help the cause.Professor Sapolsky attempts to reconstruct the Naked Ape (Desmond Morris) but ends up with some monster who only vaguely resembles a man. I am reminded of the G.K. Chesterton quote, ""Take away the supernatural and all that is left is the unnatural"" (Orthodoxy, p 49) His reductionist materialist approach leads him into some strange territory, where rights exist but free will doesn't. Where a complete (and admittedly impossible) revolution of the criminal justice system is necessary. The very subtitle explicitly mentions our best and worst behaviour but he develops no criteria for evaluating one or the other, prefering to rely on ""context, context, context"" (p. 672). I am inclined to buy Jonathan Haidt and Steven Pinker and never pick up another book by Sapolsky. His politics, philosophy, ethics, criminology, even theology and psychology are all so different from any human's lived experience (and the language that goes along with it) that I can only concluded with E.O. Wilson, ""Wonderful theory, wrong species.""A lot more was said a lot better about materialism by David Hume, or about free will by Nietzsche, or mind-body dualism by Descartes, consciousness by Leibniz etc.And to close, he never justified:""I won't pull any punches- I think that its [agriculture's] invention was one of the all-time human blunders"" (p. 326)"
256,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49565692-ben-torgerson,1,"A shining example of what is wrong in the world of science today - scientists who can't separate their personal prejudices and belief from research-based fact. Sapolsky cherry-picks his research to make political points. He is yet another typical liberal intellectual type (so prevalent in education today) that is unable to set aside his own political and social prejudices and present the research in an unbiased way. That is not to say he does not present some interesting research in this book, but he so damages his own credibility with his misapplications of the scientific results and cherry-picking of the science that supports his own skewed views that no reasonable person can accept any of his characterizations or conclusions at face value. What is even more amusing is his repeated condemnations of people who misapply scientific results and cherry-pick the data, all while doing this himself throughout the length of the book. A good percentage of the book is devoted to using scientific research to prove that people who disagree with his political beliefs are unintelligent, unfeeling, etc., and yet he condemns the Nazis for citing science in a similar way to turn the Germans against the Jews. This book should be regarded as nothing but pure drivel and the author should be completely discredited in the world of science."

It is not an overstatement to say that one could do no better than to alight on Robert M. Sapolsky’s Behave. This engrossing, encyclopedic examination of the causal mechanisms that determine human behavior is a monumental achievement of syncretic thought.This was my first journey into Sapolsky’s singular mind, both joyful and challenging. Covering an almost inconceivably vast landscape of scientific information, this neurobiologist/primatologist takes a playful but responsible approach to some heady topics, delving deep into humanity’s best and worst behaviors while never missing an opportunity to charm the reader with his perspicacious wit. I usually don’t care for comedy in nonfiction, but Sapolsky’s wry humor rarely misses the mark, and is complemented by an impressive ability to synthesize multiple perspectives and extricate sensible conclusions from dense and sometimes-conflicting data. Sapolsky is also transparent about his own biases as a “bleeding heart liberal,” making him a truly lovable genius (and not just in the casual sense).Since it would be folly to try to cover everything this book has to offer in a review, I’ll focus on explaining Sapolsky’s methodology, and then comment on just a few of his most important findings. Sapolsky begins with a necessary critique of how scientists typically explain human behavior, which is to break it down into different “buckets of explanation,” each of which comprises a distinct realm of inquiry:""We tend to use a certain cognitive strategy when dealing with complex, multifaceted phenomena, in that we break down those separate facets into categories, into buckets of explanation…The goal of this book is to avoid such categorial thinking. Putting facts into nice cleanly demarcated buckets of explanation has its advantages––for example, it can help you remember facts better. But it can wreak havoc on your ability to think about those facts. This is because the boundaries between different categories are often arbitrary, but once some arbitrary boundary exists, we forget that it is arbitrary and get way too impressed with its importance…There are not different disciplinary buckets. Instead, each one is the end product of all the biological influences that came before it and will influence all the factors that follow it. Thus, it is impossible to conclude that a behavior is caused by a gene, a hormone, a childhood trauma, because the second you invoke one type of explanation, you are de facto invoking them all. No buckets. A 'neurobiological' or 'genetic' or 'developmental' explanation for a behavior is just shorthand, an expository convenience for temporarily approaching the whole multifactorial arc from a particular perspective."" (5-8, emphasis his)This boundary-busting approach puts Sapolsky squarely in the company of intellectual titans such as Edward O. Wilson and Steven Pinker––interdisciplinary thinkers who have, however imperfectly, combined findings from numerous academics fields to launch humanity into new realms of inquiry and debate. Sapolsky is less poetic than Wilson and less contentious than Pinker, bringing a cautious, even-handed compassion to the science of understanding human nature. As any science reader knows, it is one thing to claim that disciplinary boundaries are arbitrary and ought to be ignored, and quite a different thing to actually demonstrate how this can be done. And while I don’t think Sapolsky fully achieves his stated goal, his efforts to do so are heroic and effectual.The first half of Behave plays out like a tennis match that travels back in time, with the ball representing the focus of Sapolsky’s chapters and the net representing a (somewhat arbitrary) boundary between behavioral mechanisms that operate primarily inside or outside the human body. He begins with “One Second Before,” an explanation of the neurobiology that takes place just before behavior is enacted, then transitions to “Seconds to Minutes Before,” where he discusses immediate environmental stimuli that contribute to behavior. Next comes “Hours to Days Before,” a discussion of how hormones influence behavior, which is followed by “Days to Months Before,” where he takes up long-term neural plasticity (learning and memory).This pattern continues, with subsequent chapters addressing adolescence, early childhood development, genetics, culture, and humanity’s shared evolutionary heritage. So Sapolsky makes use of the buckets of explanation by taking up these topics one at a time (what else could he do?), but also goes to great lengths to show as many interactive areas of overlap between the different causal mechanisms as possible. This truly is a “both/and” story he is telling, with all the moving parts affecting all the other moving parts in profound and intriguing ways.The second half of Behave is more traditionally structured, and wades into dicier territory. Sapolsky tackles tricky subjects such as tribalism, moral intuition and bias, power dynamics, ethical motivation, empathy, the power of symbols to move us to action (or not), free will, criminal justice, and war. These areas of study are all rapidly evolving along with society and technology, so it’s impossible to tell how relevant Sapolsky’s assessments will be in decades to come. But all in all, this is the best and most up-to-date summary of recent findings in these fields one could hope to engage with. I probably had to read between ten and twenty other books to discover most of the insights Sapolsky distills into just a few hundred pages.All of this should be more than enough to convince science and ethics enthusiasts that Behave is essential reading. If you’re eager to run out and pick it up, just stop reading here and go for it. But if you want to stick around, I’ll give some thoughts about what I see as Sapolsky’s most important findings.Sapolsky’s most critical point by far is the importance of context in understanding human behavior. This is hardly a novel position, but Sapolsky lays out the argument for contextualization with sui generis assiduousness and clarity. Over and over he pounds the table about context, tirelessly illuminating the ways in which human behavior is sensitive to myriad influences both inside and outside the body. Most of these influences are partially or completely hidden from our conscious experience of the world, and it is only through scientific inquiry and abstraction that we come to understand their significance. Perhaps the wildest demonstration of this is the role of transcription factors in determining how a person’s genome expresses itself:""95 percent of DNA is noncoding…What is that 95 percent? Some is junk––remnants of pseudogenes inactivated by evolution. But buried in that are the keys to the kingdom, the instructional manual for when to transcribe particular genes, the on/off switches for gene transcription. A gene doesn’t 'decide' when to be photocopied into RNA, to generate its protein. Instead before the start of the stretch of DNA coding for that gene is a short stretch called a promoter––the 'on' switch. What turns the promoter switch on? Something called a transcription factor (TF) binds to the promoter…Thus transcription factors regulate genes. What regulates transcription factors? The answer devastates the concept of genetic determinism: the environment."" (226, emphasis his)Sapolsky goes on to explain that numerous factors––ones present inside cells, inside bodies, and even outside bodies––can all nudge transcription factors one way or another. This means that, while a person’s genome stays constant throughout life, gene expression (the manner in which genes code for the particular proteins that make you you) is keenly sensitive to environmental conditions and constantly in flux. Furthermore, it turns out that transcription factors are usually proteins themselves, and therefore require other transcription factors to instruct genes to code for them:""Genomes aren’t infinite; instead TFs regulate one another’s transcription, solving that pesky infinity problem. Importantly, across the species whose genomes have been sequenced, the longer the genome (i.e., roughly the more genes there are), the greater the percentage of genes coding for TFs. In other words, the more genomically complex the organism, the larger the percentage of the genome devoted to gene regulation by the environment...The human genome codes for about 1,500 different TFs, contains 4,000,000 TF-binding sites, and the average cell uses about 200,000 such sites to generate its distinctive gene-expression profile. This is boggling."" (228-9, emphasis his)Boggling indeed, but also fucking fabulous. O brave new world, that has such people in ‘t! The level of detail and complexity in the example above is indicative of every section and chapter Behave has to offer. Sapolsky doesn’t cut corners or succumb to simplistic reductionism, seeking instead to repeatedly blow the reader’s mind by showing the grand scope of what goes into decisions as simple as deciding whether to reach out to touch someone’s arm. Every step of the way, we are bombarded with caveats, clarifications, contradictions, and pitfalls of empirical limitation. It would be infuriating if it weren’t so damned fascinating! Sapolsky’s main thrust––that context is always crucial and never simple when trying to understand behavior––could not be better delivered. It also carries a hopeful undertone because many of the environmental contexts in which humans must operate are created and controlled by humans, implying that we can genuinely help people lead better lives if we learn how to fiddle the environmental dials the right way. Our power in this regard is far from limitless, but hardly insignificant (I’ll return to this at the end of the review).Behave also contains strong arguments for the elimination of poverty and abuse, especially in the lives of children. Sapolsky grinds out a glut of ghastly facts about how “childhood adversity” can compromise people later in life:""Childhood adversity increases the odds of an adult having (a) depression, anxiety, and/or substance abuse; (b) impaired cognitive capacity, particularly related to frontocortical function; (c) impaired impulse control and emotion regulation; (d) antisocial behavior, including violence; and (e) relationships that replicate the adversities of childhood (e.g., staying with an abusive partner)."" (194)He immediately follows up by pointing out that “some individuals endure miserable childhoods just fine,” and makes it clear that anything goes when looking at a particular case (194). But the trending effects of childhood adversity are undeniable and terrible. Like many other insights in Behave, this is not anything we didn’t already know; it’s the sheer volume and artful presentation of Sapolsky’s converging evidence that gives his work inimitable force. He is also not afraid to bind these findings to strong, empirically-based arguments that reject egregious income inequality and promote investment in public goods:""It’s not so much that poverty predicts poor heath; it’s poverty amid plenty––income inequality. The surest way to make someone feel poor is to rub their nose in what they don’t have…When social capital decreases (thanks to inequality), up goes psychological stress…If you want to improve health and quality of life for the average person in a society, you spend money on public goods––better public transit, safer streets, cleaner water, better public schools, universal health care…Inequality means more secession of the wealthy from contributing to the public good."" (294-5)There’s no denying that this is a kind of liberal do-gooder wishlist, tinged with Sapolsky’s political leanings. Although it leaves him open to criticism, I admire Sapolsky for linking research with certain normative outcomes when he deems it appropriate. It is a fitting strategy for this moment in time, when the notion of any truly “objective” source of information has become obsolete. The best we’ve got are people like Sapolsky, who humbly bend the knee to reason and reality even when they’d rather the universe were otherwise, and who also fight tooth and nail to be heard when reason and reality actually support their political points of view.The final aspects of Behave I want to take up are Sapolsky’s direct claims that we can and should use science to improve the chances of people acting well instead of badly, along with his implicit argument that narrative and storytelling have a huge role to play in this grand project. While science is perhaps humanity’s most powerful method for analyzing and improving environmental conditions, narrative is a timeless tool for teaching people to assume the perspectives of others and to individuate potential enemies instead of reducing them to faceless members of a reviled out-group. This comes through in Sapolsky’s recommendations for dealing with humanity’s inescapably tribal nature:""From massive, breathtaking barbarity to countless pinpricks of microaggression, Us versus Them has produced oceans of pain. Yet our generic goal is not to 'cure' us of Us/Them dichotomizing. It can’t be done…If we accept that there will always be sides, it’s a nontrivial to-do list item to always be on the side of angels. Distrust essentialism. Keep in mind that what seems like rationality is often just rationalization, playing catch-up with subterranean forces that we never suspect. Focus on the larger, shared goals. Practice perspective taking,. Individuate, individuate, individuate. Recall the historical lessons of how often the truly malignant Thems keep themselves hidden and make third parties the fall guy."" (423-4)Sapolsky doesn’t take what I see as the next logical step here, which is to assert that the easiest way people can begin checking off his anti-tribal “to-do list” is to engage with stories that open the way to novel perspectives and unfamiliar modes of moral calculus. We should draw heavily on the power of narrative to simulate social complexity and teach the lessons Sapolsky rightly identifies as essential for ethical education. He points out in a later chapter that, despite its considerable downsides, “our confusion of the literal and the metaphorical, our granting of life-threatening sanctity to the symbolic, can be used to bring about the best of our behaviors” (579). There is a momentous marriage between the arts and sciences embedded in this outlook––a marriage more sacred than any of the supposedly sacrosanct folderol that has hitherto spawned from the imaginative shit-heap of human history.Stories can teach us to think and act better, but only science can deliver the building blocks and blueprints for our better world. When wrapping up a discussion of how former enemies reach reconciliation, Sapolsky implores readers to “recognize that science can teach us how to make events like these more likely” (670). He knows it’s a game of probability; we can’t force people to be good, but we can make it systemically easier for them to make the right choice, even if we know the “rightness” of that choice will always be at least partially if not wholly circumstantial. The more we learn about the light and dark tendencies inherent in human nature and particular arenas of action, the more capable we become of incentivizing instances of good behavior and minimizing instances of bad behavior. Scrupulousness of the highest order is called for, but the project is both worthy and necessary.I’d be delighted to spin out some final words that would drive home everything that is special about this book, but I couldn’t hope to top Sapolsky himself:""If you had to boil this book down to a single phrase, it would be 'It’s complicated.' Nothing seems to cause anything; instead everything just modulates something else. Scientists keep saying, “We used to think X, but now we realize that…” Fixing one thing often messes up ten more, as the law of unintended consequences reigns. On any big, important issue it seems like 51 percent of the scientific studies conclude one thing, and 49 percent conclude the opposite. And so on. Eventually it can seem hopeless that you can actually fix something, can make things better. But we have no choice but to try. And if you are reading this, you are probably ideally suited to do so. You’ve amply proven you have intellectual tenacity. You probably also have running water, a home, adequate calories, and lows odds of festering with a bad parasitic disease. You probably don’t have to worry about Ebola virus, warlords, or being invisible in your world. And you’ve been educated. In other words, you’re one of the lucky humans. So try.""

261,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77785790-david,4,"I think of this book as an introduction to pre-crime. I believe the term that the author uses is ""neurocriminology"", but the essential unifying premise of the book is that human choices are predetermined by complex biological factors which neuroscientists are just beginning to understand in ways that will eventually allow these specialists to predict very specific criminal and antisocial behaviors before, sometimes long before, the actors consciously choose them. We inherently function as if our choices are independent, spontaneous and free. Westerners particularly tend to view ourselves as autonomous individuals. This book will shatter these notions. Most or all of our choices are made before we are consciously aware of them, and most of our choices are not really originate in the individual. Our thoughts and decisions arise from our primordial past, our education, and the biological / environmental conditions immediately preceding ""our"" decisions.The most difficult aspect of the book for me was the insufferable liberalism of the author. The book opens with a gratuitous fantasy about all the horrible things the author would do to Hitler, if given the chance. The author also avails himself of every opportunity to illustrate how racist and bigoted white people are compared to nonwhites. It's never made clear why the author harbors such biases, but it's clear that he feels both justified and righteous for doing so.The concessions which the author makes concerning human biology and behavior are all the more enlightening given his openly hard left bias. For example, Sapolsky conclusively denies that ""nurture"" is the pre-eminent factor in determining human behavior. At the same time, he also gives evidence to show that inherited, genetic traits are strongly modified by the environment, whether that be biochemical or social.Sapolsky affirms the biological reality of kin selection by citing mouse studies showing that mammals produce biochemicals enabling individuals to ""smell"" how closely related other individuals are. Mice, among others, preferentially socialize with individuals whom they sense are more closely related, all else being equal. On the other hand, mice and other animals can be trained artificially to ignore this natural bias for their kin and affiliate with non-related individuals.Similarly, the author points out that human social structures tend to be ethnocentric. Human studies show that whites have an innate, preconscious bias towards their own kind and against blacks. Nevertheless, it's possible to ""overcome"" this ""xenophobia"" with appropriate conditioning, according to the author. Sapolsky consistently recognizes the fact that humans and animals naturally desire to bond with relatives and kin, yet he regularly affirms this natural tendency is ""bad"" or ""xenophobic"".The ""fallacy of naturalism"" struck me as a profound insight into the character not only of Sapolsky, but of the leftist cultural phenomenon as a whole. Such liberals are characterized by the belief that what is natural and instinctive is often wrong and must be artificially re-engineered in order to achieve harmony. By contrast, the opposing view of many conservatives is that nature is correct, even sacrosanct. This view of nature's correctness is easily seen in Austrian Economics, for instance.Another key aspect of the liberal left versus the conservative right that I noticed in this book was the fact that liberal tendencies typically arise from people who are insulated from the exigencies of life relative to those people who are regularly exposed to hardship. Sapolsky cites studies showing, for instance, that conservative people experience nightmares more frequently and suffer from more adversity in general than their liberal counterparts.This adversity-conservatism correlation was also illustrated by a narrative describing the social transformation of a troop of baboons from an endogamous, tribal, aggressive, and patriarchal community to a relatively exogamous, passive, and female-dominant one. How did this transformation occur? It occurred in response to an unlimited supply of low-cost food: the troop settled near a garbage dump where they ate leftovers from human tourists and became ""liberalized"".The same appears to be true for primitive human society. Sapolsky devotes considerable space to the question of whether archaic hunter-gatherer and pastoral human societies were violent and aggressive or peaceful and harmonious. What he shows is that scarcity of resources provokes the former, while abundance promotes the latter. Thus, the ""noble savage"" resolves to the ""well-fed savage"" who becomes more savage and less noble he becomes more hungry.Conservatism and hunger are not only linked in the case of monkeys and tribal humans. Sapolsky notes that criminal justices statistically deliver harsher sentences when they have skipped breakfast. Combined with the observation that conservative people often have more nightmares and other adverse experiences, a theme emerges: liberalism of all kinds is the natural product of affluence and excess, while conservatism is the natural response to adversity and hardship.However, culture is not merely the expression of environmental resources over time. Behavior is embedded in the biology and genetics of the individuals forming a community. Sapolsky cites the famous Dmitry Belyayev Russian Fox study which showed that selective breeding could produce docile foxes. Sapolsky also cited a similar study showing that feral behavioral traits could be bred out of rats. These studies showed, according to Sapolsky, that behaviors which we think of a volitional and ""free"" may, in fact, be the inevitable result of genetic selection.This is a fascinating admission from a leftist author since it forms the key premise of ""A Troublesome Inheritance"" by Nicholas Wade. Wade's book is described as ""controversial"" largely because it applies the Russian Fox study (among others) to human society. Sapolsky shies away from such conclusions, yet both he and Wade agree that human behavior is heritable, just like animal behavior is. Further, both explicitly reject the absurd ""blank slate"" hypothesis of the social constructivists. Sapolsky's book can, in many ways, be seen a single, massive refutation of ""blank slate"" theory, yet in practice, Sapolsky advocates against the idea that our heritable traits are generally good. Our natural proclivity to identify and associate with kin leads, in his view, to violence, ""xenophobia"", and antisocial behavior. Thus, Sapolsky sees it as necessary for social harmony to scientifically overcome our natural tendency towards ""pseudospeciation"" based on biological factors like genes and race.Sapolsky regularly returns to the theme of ""green-beard effects"" wherein individuals in society identify and associate with individuals who share specific phenotypical traits, such as dark skin or blue eyes. Sapolsky automatically asserts that such effects are irrational, even dangerous. With this in mind, he documents various scientifically-validated techniques for replacing natural, racially-based green-beard effects with artificial ones, such as affiliation on the basis of organized sports.Conservative, ethnocentric thinkers like Wade, Pat Buchanan, and Ann Coulter observe the same green-beard and kin-selection effects but that such effects are both good and natural. In the conservative paradigm, separation of the tribe is the solution, not the problem. Both sides admit the existence of the natural tendency to form kin-based tribes, yet authors like Sapolsky generally affirm that advocacy of such nativism constitutes the dangerous logical fallacy of ""moral naturalism"".Sapolsky regularly makes jabs at moral naturalism. His main criticism is that what is perceived to be natural at one time often changes later. Thus, culture mediates our perception of what is ""natural"" and ""good"" versus what is ""unnatural"" and ""bad"". Sapolsky sees this as a an opportunity for reshaping social perceptions to accept new ""unnatural"" things as ""good"" and ""natural"", while the conservative instinct is to pass on what is perceived as natural from one generation to the next.If we accept the essential premise of Behave, then the choice to be liberal (in the sense of adoption what is unnatural and foreign) versus conservative (the preservation of the natural) is biological and subconscious rather than objective and rational. Furthermore, if we accept that the instinct to conserve kin-based groups and ostracize foreign races is dangerous and subversive, then it is easy to cast racial conservatism as a mental disorder rather than a rational decision. The same is true in reverse: if liberal tendencies are heritable, biological, and subversive rather than rational and ""free"", then liberalism is a ultimately disease. This isn't a new idea: Michael Savage, for instance, is notable for his regular insistence that liberalism is a mental disorder. In the opposite camp, it's not uncommon for liberals to insist that conservatism is the result of inbreeding, mental retardation, or childhood trauma.The ultimate end of rational dialog comes when we finally accept that people with views opposite to our own are not going to change their minds or become ""converted"" on the basis of rational argumentation and evidence. Various biological markers predispose people to adopt the views which they hold such that the conscious, rational portion of our brain constitutes a thin veneer over the primal realities of our nature.Viewing liberalism and conservatism as biological traits leads us to the ultimate question: will liberalism or conservatism ultimately wipe out the opposing trait and achieve hegemony in the human population, or at least in specific human population groups? Drawing on the above-mentioned studies, I conclude that while resources are abundant, docile, passive, and liberal traits will be dominant while virile, defensive, and conservative traits will become recessive relics of a dark, irrelevant past."
262,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7422525-scriptor-ignotus,5,"IT’S COMPLICATED “I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.”  — Sir Isaac NewtonWhy do people do what they do? Of all the sciences, that of our own behavior is often the most unsettling in its mysteriousness. Delivering a precise and comprehensive causal explanation for any form of human behavior is almost always impossible, and to attempt even a general account requires one to interface with a bewildering array of methodologies, disciplinary perspectives, spatial and temporal scales of analysis, and the necessary but overwhelmingly nuanced and complex interrelationship between all these factors. If any piece of the causal puzzle is missing—which is always the case, as biologists have not (yet) fully mapped the causal chains that produce our most unique and sophisticated behaviors—then none of the other pieces quite fit together either, leaving unanswered some of the most fundamental questions regarding who and what we are. We are enigmatic even (perhaps especially) to ourselves—as psychology and the humanities have long attested—even though self-knowledge may be the most critical necessity for the survival and flourishing of our species and its planetary habitat. Behave is an incredibly ambitious cross-disciplinary gesture towards a complete picture of the biological substrata of human behavior. As a study which attempts to account for both the profoundest depths of cruelty and sadism and the most exalted heights of compassion and benevolence characteristic of our kind, and which attempts not to override and dismiss but to affirm and buttress the full spectrum of approaches for thinking about human nature, it is the most genuinely humanistic science book I have read. Behave is organized in two main parts. The first part, composed of the first nine chapters, is likely the most thorough exposition of the multilayered biological underpinnings of human behavior ever put in print. Each chapter is framed as part of a skeletal narrative: a behavior has just occurred: what happened in the seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, years, centuries, and millennia beforehand that could help explain why it happened? Each consecutive chapter widens Sapolsky’s analytical lens. When we think about what happened one second before the behavior occurred, we’re in the realm of cellular neurobiology. Neurons in the brain are generating action potentials in response to a stimulus; these disturbances of the negative charge inside of a neuron, caused by openings in the dendritic spines which allow positively-charged ions to flow through, travel from the dendritic spines through the cell body and, if the electrical disturbance passes a certain threshold, through the axon to the axon terminals, which send neurotransmitters across synapses that connect with specialized receptors on the dendritic spines of subsequent neurons, which causes the opening of channels in the membrane for positive ions, which generates action potentials in those neurons, and so on. The collection of 100 billion neurons in each human body and their integrated axonal projections are, at the cellular level, what constitute the vast and intricate circuitry of the nervous system. The generation of collective action potentials in billions of neurons in a particular brain region is what neuroscientists refer to when they speak about the “activation” of brain regions in response to stimuli. Move the timescale back to seconds or minutes before the behavior, and we’re looking at the macro organization of the brain. At this level our behaviors are mediated through the interaction of brain regions. The ancient amygdala, the almond-shaped core of the limbic system, mediates fear, anxiety, and aggression, and is often the first brain region to activate in response to unfamiliar stimuli. People who demonstrate more implicit bias against racial out-groups show more amygdaloid activation when presented with faces of people of another race, and the amygdala shows growth and overactivity in the brains of people suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Overlaying the amygdala are the higher limbic structures, which regulate base emotions, and the cortex, which mediates most of our higher cognitive functions, such as memory, language, motor skills, facial recognition, and contextual judgment. The newest brain region, in evolutionary terms, is the prefrontal cortex (PFC): the crown jewel of executive function, the seat of strategic knowledge organization, delayed gratification, social and cultural acclimation, contextualization, and the regulation of emotionality and impulsivity. It is also the last brain region to mature in an individual lifetime, not coming fully online until around age 25—a critical fact when thinking about the brilliance and deviancy so uniquely characteristic of adolescence.The late maturation of the PFC indicates something astonishing about the evolution of the human brain. The wiring of the PFC is not significantly more complex than that of other cortical regions, nor does it consist of a different type of neuron—with a few limited exceptions. Biologically speaking, it isn’t any “harder” to develop a prefrontal cortex than it is to develop any other part of the brain, which likely means that the delayed development of the PFC was selected for by our hominid ancestors. We evolved in such a way that the makeup of the frontal cortex, because its development is delayed, is shaped by the makeup of our other brain regions, which in turn are shaped by personal experiences. By developing later, the PFC is designed to accommodate the neurological “lessons” of our own, individual lives. The genetic program of our brain development has evolved to liberate the frontal cortex from genetics. Of course, none of these brain regions are discrete entities, and none are free from the influences of hormones and environmental factors. Expanding our timescale to account for the hours to months before a behavior occurs involves reference to endocrinology, the effect of hormones on behavior via their influencing of the nervous system, and the plasticity of the brain. Here Sapolsky debunks some common misunderstandings about the role of certain hormones in behavior; namely testosterone and oxytocin. Hormones are not “instigators” of behavior; in fact, one of the overarching themes of the entire book is that there is never a single biological cause of any behavior, but rather a vast field of facilitating and inhibiting factors that influence the probability of certain behaviors to degrees that are not always quantifiable. Androgens like testosterone are facilitators of behavior. They make the amygdala more sensitive to triggers of aggression, but only among people who are already predisposed to acts of aggression. Nor is aggression the single, inevitable result of testosterone production. Testosterone levels increase not only in response to situations demanding aggression, but also in situations in which one’s social status is uncertain, changing, or perceived to be under threat. In those situations testosterone does not facilitate violence per se; it facilitates whatever behavior is necessary for one to secure status. If a society bases its status relations on, say, charitability, then testosterone won’t cause you to strangle a cheetah; it will cause you to insist on paying the tab at a restaurant. If testosterone has an unfairly negative reputation, oxytocin has an unfairly positive one. This “luv hormone” facilitates bonds between mothers and infants, bonds between humans and their canine pets, and the pair-bonding of monogamous romantic couples; but these salutary effects are relegated to in-group relations. Oxytocin increases our prosociality towards an “Us”, but it also makes us more suspicious of “Thems”. It does not facilitate free love, but rather parochialism. In the second part of the book, Sapolsky attempts to synthesize the complicated layers of knowledge laid out in the first half, and to offer some insight as to how these biological factors influence our best and worst behaviors. I can hardly do justice to the nuances of the discussions in each chapter, but they address such topics as our instinctual categorization of people into In-Groups and Out-Groups and how and why we prioritize some dimensions of “Us-ness” over others; the unique human capacity for establishing and navigating hierarchies and the physically corrosive effects of having the “wrong” status in a particular social context (Sapolsky is a Rousseauian primitivist, and considers the agricultural revolution to be the greatest blunder in human history for the role it played in establishing rigid and dramatic status hierarchies); the neurological correlates of empathy (and how it’s better if our altruism is instinctive rather than an act of willpower); how metaphorical thinking is innate to our biology (and why a society is in extremely dangerous territory if certain members of it are persuasively associated with insects or fecal matter; hyperactivity of the insular cortex, which regulates disgust responses, can make one an ethnic cleanser—or worse, a germaphobe); the question of free will and how our conception of justice should be framed accordingly (Sapolsky is a strong determinist and thinks a criminal justice system based on punishment is totally irrational); and, of course, war and peace. Why do people do what they do? Sapolsky’s short answer is: it’s really complicated. No, really, that’s his answer; that’s the conclusion he comes to at the end of this big, beautiful disaster of a book. But understanding, though difficult, is possible; and with understanding comes a spirit of mercy which could perhaps change the world."

This is one of those rare authors who can educate the reader while entertaining regarding a topic of staggering complexity. I hope this gift does indeed carry over to his classroom at Stanford in which case there will undoubtedly be a lot of inspired youth pursuing answers to the mysteries of the brain. I took considerable time to read this book as there were many opportunities to reread the passage or concept at hand and contemplate the subject in depth. There is also great reference information and appendices to help those of us needing liberal doses of assistance. As one of the greatest benefits of such books are the attributions and opportunity to read the books referenced I will add one for consideration that won't disappoint: ""The Archaeology of Mind: Neuroevolutionary Origins of Human Emotion."" by Jaak Panksepp and Lucy Biven. This is worthy of mentioning in the same review as Professor Sapolsky's masterpiece.  As with so many things in life the satisfaction is directly proportional to the effort expended and Robert Sapolsky's book, ""Behave,"" will help you better understand what chemistry and brain structures combined with environmental factors are potentially at the root of this feeling. This is not an author espousing an absolute deterministic view, but leaves room for something more that makes us human that our science has yet to discover the metrology to measure.

Although, fair warning, you will be left with a great feeling of uncertainty afterwards; i.e. you will be made aware of your own ignorance, and most important—hopefully—you will shut up about ""human nature"" at every turn. You can also expect to have your (yes, your) simplistic notions of biological determinism shattered.  Now, a slightly more elaborate exposition than ""it's complicated"": Any meaningful analysis of the behaviour of human species deals with biology-environment interactions. One can expect to learn that: testosterone, oxytocin, mirror neurons, and pretty much any new fad protein, neurotransmitter, or brain region does not work the way you thought it did.  The negative effects of poverty, inequality, and social hierarchy in general are laid bare—or shorter SES (socio-economic status).

Most fascinating is the fact that the lower you are on the wealth inequality ladder, the poorer your health. And get this, only a third of this degradation is due to actual, poorer material conditions. It is the subjective experience that matters, and the definitive knowledge and reality of having someone who's infinitely richer than you, and capable of shitting down the ladder—so to speak—on you. (p. 441 contains a nice bullet-point list of the known effects). Now, I am going to go on a tangent, to something the author did not mention, but as a filthy red I am almost obliged to do so. If we look into the work of Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century, and more importantly in Karl Marx's Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, Vol 1, we see capitalism's inevitable, structural tendency to create utterly obscene inequalities. Now, given that we know the negative effects of inequality on human beings and the causes of these inequalities, it should be trivial to synthesise a necessary political project: anti-capitalism.Ok, now, back to the content of the book. Robert Sapolsky—rightly so—criticizes Steven Pinker's The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined for cherry picking some of the data referring to primitive societies (p. 311-315). Mislabelling of hunter-horticulturalists (p. 321) as hunter gatherers, thus shadowing the plethora of research showing distinct ""pro-social"" behaviour of the former group. Failure to adjust for length of conflict (p. 614-620) in determining how violent historical periods were, doubly baffling given that Pinker all the while (correctly) adjusted the total victim count for overall world population size at that time—glaring oversight. Overall, a fairly positive critique, but one that leaves the reader with the impression ""it's more complicated than that"" (unlike Pinker's own conclusions). Note: the page references in this paragraph are to ""Behave"".  My own point of contention with the book, is that it omits a plethora of anthropological, and historical studies into human civilization (Lewis Mumford, E.A Gutkind, David Graeber)—while tapping into what seems to be a clichee body of work that is being passed around in the same Ivy League circles (essentially the same body of work as used by Pinker). This also leads to the author using some historically impoverished definitions of ""individualist"" and ""collectivist"" cultures—the latter being extremely poorly represented, and mostly by modern ""samples"". Mentions of ancient, medieval, and revolutionary period cities, which would be much better examples than modern ones, are woefully absent.  In short, this books is broad in its analysis of biology, but rather narrow in its analysis of society. But nonetheless, it is still an endless mine of fresh knowledge that would take forever for me to go through in this review. Luckily, the Epilogue has a nice bullet-point list (albeit it is not exhaustive of the content). Overall, Behave it deeply fascinating, and definitely worth a read! I highly recommend this book to everyone!"
268,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30276417-nancy-mills,5,"Fascinating book that begins with some rather difficult lessons in endocrinology and neuroloscience, but after the author lays that foundation, the books blooms into a dense but highly entertaining tomb about how behavior is affected by genes, hormones, environmental factors (that of course affect hormones), and then the guy actually has the nerve to go into the topic of Free Will ... and does a great job all the way. Here I am compelled to add a lengthy quote from the author, in a footnote, of course:""And the one thing I'm not going anywhere near is this New Age-y notion, ""Of course we have free will. You can't say that our behavior is determined by a mechanistic universe, because the universe is indeterminate, because of quantum mechanics."" Argh. What anyone sensible who has thought about this will point out is that (a)the consequences of subatomic indeterminacy of quantum mechanics (about which I understand zero) don't ripple upward enough to influence behavior, and (b) if they did, the result wouldn't be the freedom to will your behavior. It would be the utter randomization of behavior. In the words of philosopher/neuroscientist Sam Harris, a free will trasher, if quantum mechanics actually played a role in any of this, 'Every thought and action would seem to merit the statement ""I don't know what just came over me."""" Except you wouldn't actually be able to make that statement, since you'd just makinggarly sounds because the muscles in your tongue would be doing all sorts of random things.""Well I guess he told THEM!There is a chapter toward the back of the book entitled ""Biology, the Criminal Justice System, and Free Will,"" which will get your frontal cortex neurons twitching if anything will.Conclusions aren't cut and dry, if that's what you were hoping, but certainly will give the reader a tremendous background, if one can manage to absorb even half of the book's contents. If you're not all that into biology and long scientific words, you can get away with skimming the tough parts. I plowed through it and found it very rewarding. There are 3 Appendices, all good that you can skip if you don't want to learn about Neuroscience, Endocrinology or Protein Basics.Dr. Sapolsky is sympathetic, maybe even empathetic (the books discusses these phenomena) toward the the reader who may find the material dense, and his humor more than redeems his asking us to familiarize ourselves with all this stuff. Anterior Something Cingulate. dmELvE. vm LLpe. I don't know. A whole bunch of acronyms. Half way through the book I accidentally found out that there is a glossary in the back that defines each acronym which certainly makes things tons easier. Anyway, the author is understanding. One passage, for example, reads ""This is a bold assertion that the heuristic of dialectical materialism not only extends beyond the economic world into the naturalistic one, but is ontologically rooted in the essential sameness of both worlds' dynamic resolution of irresolvable contradictions."" Before the you throw the book across the room, the author adds this footnote: ""I have no idea what it is that I just wrote..."" He bravely plows ahead with ""It is Marx and Engels as trilobite and snail,"" and immediately footnotes again: ""Ditto."" Truthfully my main complaint is that the footnotes, which are numerous and are at times the best parts of the text, and printed in such teeny print that even with my glasses I had trouble reading them after the sun went down with my 60 watt bulb. There are, of course, about a million end notes to, which I seldom bothered with.Sapolsky, in his final chapter, delves into War and Peace (the subject, not the novel) and reveals some very interesting behaviors on the battlefield versus way back behind the lines where men in fancy uniforms make strategics decisions. And the part about drone pilots, who shoot targets thousands of miles away, nevertheless get bad cases of PTSD in spite of the fact that they are never physically putting their own lives in danger. Remarkable findings.One of the most worthwhile books I've read this year, highly recommended for people who like to read and don't mind a little mental exercise."
269,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,4,"This brick of a book purports to be an interdisciplinary explanation of human behavior, drawing from biology, psychology, and sociology, and everything from primate studies to well-known works in various fields. It’s big, at 717 pages of actual text followed by references; it’s broad; and as such it’s a little bit simplistic. Even at this size, there’s not quite room to develop all of the material. The first half or so of the book is more focused on the “hard” science, beginning with how neurons communicate with each other, and working its way up through hormones, genes, brain development through childhood and adulthood and how this is affected by trauma, and the evolution of species. The second half is more focused on psychology: us vs. them dichotomies, moral decisionmaking, the causes of violence, and whether the criminal justice system really makes sense when all human behavior is ultimately driven by biology. (Sapolsky argues no, but I’m not so sure. Where would we be as a species, or as individuals, if we all just shrugged our shoulders and gave in to ideas of biological determinism?)I certainly learned a lot from this book, which contains a ton of information presented in a way that is understandable to a non-scientist – though I struggled a bit with some of the early chapters. It provides a strong synthesis and framework for understanding information from biology and social sciences. That said, on the subjects that I did know something about, it seemed a little simplified. Fair enough; entire books have been written on subjects that comprise a single chapter here. As other reviewers have suggested, Sapolsky perhaps accepts too many psychological studies uncritically, without discussing psychology’s replication crisis, in which dozens of famous studies, when run again using the exact same methods and parameters, failed to produce the same headline-worthy results. That said, in general Sapolsky seems to take a fair approach to his material, presenting and evaluating multiple viewpoints in areas that have generated controversy. His writing is readable given the subject matter, and there’s a goofy-professor personality behind it that occasionally shines through. I wouldn’t take everything here as gospel – and I suppose we never should, since new scientific discoveries regularly require us to reevaluate what we thought was true – but the book did leave me a little more educated than I was before."

What is it with biologists and well written non-fiction that does not completely gloss over the details? The book is fairly long and appears to lack a central thesis except that ""it's complicated"". But ""Nothing seems to cause anything, instead everything just modulates everything else"" is probably closer to the truth than the endless internet debates over nature vs nurture.However even though the book is expansive, remembering to critique both sides of the debate (not even Pinker or Ramachandran are spared) while being filled with citation and humorous footnotes, I still had a few minor issues that force me to discount other things as well. Things like Wellesley effect and Freakonomics explanation of drop in crime rate in US are presented without any remarks about the contentious nature of the findings (largely believed to be false I think, but I could be wrong)."

It's probably a little too textbook-like for some readers, but for those who really want to get a good general grounding in what science in 2017 tells us about behavior, there is probably no better place to go.I particularly liked the discussions on the law and neuroscience, and a really nuanced take on role (or lack thereof) of genetics in behavioral determinism, and final chapter relating to war (and peace)."
272,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,4,"It is common these days to come across people who have developed a strong dislike for all reductionist approaches. They prefer holistic views, and are suspicious of any knowledge that has been derived through breaking up a big problem into smaller chunks. I can understand why they feel that way, but I have always felt that such feelings can only be harbored when one is unfamiliar with the depth of the subject in question, and therefore assumes a simplistic view of things. For example, I know of many people who are suspicious of normal medical science because it treats each organ as a separate functional entity, and expertise within the medical profession is divided by such narrow specializations. They prefer a medical science that looks at the big picture, which includes not just the various sub-systems, but combines the body with the mind. This is a wise and noble thought until we realize the complexity of the whole system. Once we do, the justification of breaking it up into smaller systems become obvious. All the knowledge we have about our body could not have been attained without first breaking it up into the various organs and trying to understand how they work in isolation. Once that has reached a certain level of details can we afford to put them back together and investigate the far more complex interactions between these systems. If we tried to bypass the reductionist step in the first place, we would have been stuck with vague and faulty theories of how the body works, as can be found in all ancient texts. A responsible form of holistic science cannot be rushed. In many cases we may not even be ready to take that step, and must wait till we have better understanding of the parts.Of all the systems we have investigated so far, the physical systems of materials and forces, chemical systems, astronomical systems, and biological systems – they all yielded fairly well to the scientific reductionist methodologies. However, the biggest challenge lies ahead in understanding the most complex system we have encountered so far – our mind. Huge progress has been made in this direction in the last few decades. The progress happened through advances in neuroscience, biology, computational science, evolutionary sciences, psychology etc. Problems that were beyond any convincing and demonstrable theory are regularly being converted into understandable bits of knowledge. In this environment of tremendous progress, where all the different branches seems to be converging, it is not unexpected that many specialists start to believe that they have finally figured it out. I have read many books where brilliant minds would try to prove how their specialty, be it neuroscience or evolutionary biology, can finally explain our behavior, our morality, our aesthetic sense, etc. in terms of their science alone.This book is the only one I have read that not only celebrates the great accomplishments of our reductionist approach towards understanding of how the mind works, but also exposes the severe limitations of not appreciating the complexity of all these subsystems when they work together. He systematically shows how each of the systems involved, our neuronal bran, the environment we live in, both in our mother’s womb and the environment outside, our endocrinal systems, our genes, how they all interact and influence each other is incredibly complex ways. The only way we can understand the whole thing is when we allow for these interactions. In other words, why we need to look at the whole thing holistically, while admitting that it can only be done when we understand the parts really well. It is a sobering document because it shows the challenge that lies ahead. Modelling the complexity of the whole system is so complex then we may never be able to crack it open. That is, understanding of an individual mind may remain impossible, while we get better at understanding them in aggregate.The real value of this book is not just in convincing us that full understanding of our mind cannot happen until we integrate all the pieces together, but in nudging us towards a slightly different mindset that can be applied to all complex problems. As in everything else, when we solve one problem, it only presents us with an even more complex problem. And to me, that’s what makes life worth living – that there will never be a shortage of things to ponder."
273,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17937883-avi-singh,5,"Behave is an ambitious book that seeks to explain human behavior at almost every level of abstraction - what parts of the brain lit up in the second before an action (the lizard-ish amygdala, or the primate-y frontal cortex), what sensory information obtained in the past few seconds to minutes “primed” you for it (if people are shown a random string of positive words, they tend to behave nicely in a cooperative game), what hormones were secreted in the past few hours to days (effects of testosterone, oxytocin etc.), what happened in the years before (say during adolescence or childhood), or in the prenatal period (kids show preference to flavors the mother consumed when pregnant, can hear things and show preference to stories they heard while in the womb etc., the “boy/girl” brain development, connections with sexual orientation / identity), what cultural forces in the last few hundred years shaped the behavior (for example, difference between individualistic and collectivistic cultures), and last, but not the least, how evolution in the last thousands of years influence behavior (ideas from sociobiology or evolutionary psychology - kin selection, reciprocative altruism, etc. ). The second part of the book has a slightly different format - as the author delves into specific human behavioral traits (like Us vs Them-ing, hierarchies and obedience, morals, usage of metaphors, violence, etc.), and discusses them in detail, often drawing the fundamental expounded upon in the previous chapters. The book has a entertaining myth-busting style. It will present a hypothesis (say testosterone is responsible for aggression), present experiments in favor of it (castration reduces aggression, injecting testosterone back in brings it back), and then present more experiments that poke holes in the earlier somewhat simplistic explanation (raising testosterone to 10% or 200% of original levels makes no difference as compared to raising to 100%). He also talks about the wars within academia on numerous theories/ideas - neurogenesis, mirror neurons, sociobiology, Stanford Prison Experiment findings etc., which, apart from being entertaining, also reinforce my belief that the author does not only present the theories that he “likes”. Though it’s definitely possible that he did that at certain points in the book, I think he presented the nuanced view more often than not. Sometimes, there’s an information overload, as the author presents results from 5-10 studies in a single paragraph. Also, since a lot of these tend to be psychology studies, their results have to be taken with an appropriate amount of salt. Some of the later chapters are a bit preachy (using intuition vs reason in in-group and out-group interactions, why the current justice system is stupid, how to reduce violence)- but since they are backed by fairly solid science, and logical (to me) explanations, I still enjoyed reading them. In the end, I think it’s a great book, and is peppered with humorous anecdotes, both personal and historical, which makes it easier to go through its ~800 pages. The only “limitation” of the book is its scope - I don’t really think any single book can cover all the issues that this book tackles - but a list compiled from the books referenced here would probably make a great reading list. I might do that at some point. "

Behave will turn heads and raise controversy in the field of neurobiology, something the field has come to expect from Sapolsky, but Behave will also change science writing. Gone is the jargon and hundred-watt rhetoric that repels the plebians and ill-informed. No more tented-fingered, cross-legged analysis.

It was first published in May, 2017. This is one miracle of a book. I don’t know where to start…“Someone does something lousy and selfish to you in a game, and the extent of insular and amygdaloid activation predicts how much outrage you feel and how much revenge you take.” ― Robert M. Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst Book focuses on Robert Sapolsky’s attempt to tackle seemingly impossible question. That is to look at our behavior from every possible angle: biological, psychological, physiological…and there are some historical and cultural angles thrown in to it too. We start with neurobiological angle: what happens in our brains when some specific behavior occurs, what effect do our hormones have on us, what is our genetic makeup, how are we different or even not that different from rest of the animal kingdom… This is not enough. Sapolsky continues by how environment affects us and also focuses on age-old question: are we formed more by nature or nurture? And indeed as mentioned, then we continue with psychology, history, culture…Behave is among the best nonfiction reads ever. It’s stunning, it’s big and it’s absolutely beautiful. I learned so much and it also changed the way I see some things. Here are some of my picks throughout the chapters of the book:Chapter 4: Hours to Days Before: How testosterone increases confidence and optimism and decreases fear and anxiety. Chapter 5: Days to Months Before: Enough time for Arab spring, for a discontented winter or for STDs to spread a lot during a summer of love…and also plenty of time for our brains to change…How there’s long-term LTP and LTD. And veryy long term LTP and LTD and how they work differently in different regions of our brains.“Testosterone makes people cocky, egocentric, and narcissistic.”― Robert M. Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and WorstChapter 15: Metaphors We Kill By: How Rwandan genocide came to be and how metaphors were used as a weapon. Oh the power of metaphors. I have never before realized this. During Rwandan genocide, Tutsis were described as cockroaches. And those cockroaches would steal your husband. They became something that had to be exterminated, swept away from the country. Almost 1 million people dead within 100 days.“Some translation is needed. The Rwandan genocide did not involve tanks, airplanes, dropping bombs or shelling at civilians. There were no concentration camps. No transport trains. No Zyklon-B. There was no bureaucratic banality of evil. There were hardly even many guns.” ― Robert M. Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and WorstChapters 6 & 16: Author explained PMS syndrome. He also explained how PMS syndrome has been used as a criminal defense. And this is not the only sort of crazy sounding criminal defense in the book. There’s also a lot of talk about the development of the brain in earlier chapters and whether a person is or isn’t fully aware of his actions and consequences of those actions due to it… Adolescence. Or. Dude, where is my frontal cortex as the chapter is called.What else… Sapolsky uses the analogy of a car with faulty brakes to describe antisocial human behaviour. How judges give less harsh sentences after they have had lunch! Yes you read that right, judges’ rulings’ are harsher when they are hungrier. And this also works with smells. If you’re in a place that smells bad, you more likely to judge a person or a thing in a negative manner, how there was a Christmas truce in 1914 and how in many wars since soldiers had to be threatened to go kill soldiers from the opposite side. And how opposite of love is not hate …it’s indifference. And to conclude. There is no such thing as free will.I loved this book. As you can probably tell from my review, it’s packed with loads and loads of information in a very simplified, easily understood form. Moreover, there’s a sense of humor or sarcasm in the writing and that always gets one more star from me because it’s like authors are laughing at how idiotic some of the things we do are and I really appreciate that (…we do a lot of dumb shit). Maybe the only downside to the book as I was listening to audio version were all the: “footnotes” and “i see her see i see her see i see?”. They were a bit much in spoken. All in all, a fantastic piece of literature.5/5 stars"

I can't say the journey is necessarily enjoyable -- it's incredibly dense, and Sapolsky admits in his epilogue that the two word TL;DR of his book is ""It's complicated"". But this staggering work is also incredibly rich, like a mental block of cheese that you can only sample in nibbles, and incredibly plastic, meant in the best neurological sense, like a mind actively at work laid bare. And this mind is an incredibly inspiring one. I never took one of his classes, but I think this book is a great representation of what brilliance looks like in a teacher."

I must be his perfect reader-- someone with a working knowledge of popular science, biology, neurology, and psychology-- I get his jokes. He is informative, vastly knowledgable (to put it mildly), speaks to the general reader, and light-handed with his material.I can not think of a better read for the approaching times of neurological understanding of the cause of why people do what they do, and the larger questions of blame in a criminal context. "
280,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81718362-ann,4,"After taking over two months to complete this, I am not sure what to say except 'whew'. This is the most comprehensive book I have read on human behavior. Sapolsky goes beyond the (neuro)biological factors and incorporates cultural, psychological and environmental considerations into the discussion. I wouldn't say this is a difficult read but it is a richly complex and detailed book. Sapolsky's sense of humor helps take the edge off things. By the end, the reader is fully aware of the meaning of, 'it's complicated' when attempting to explain human behavior. In essence, it is very complicated and scientists probably have just scratched the surface in their understanding.What struck me is how 'me' vs 'us' vs 'them' factors into things, even in our split second decision making. The chapters discussing the roles of hormones and neurotransmitters were quite interesting and sometimes the information surprised me. Finally, the chapter titled 'Metaphors We Kill By,' discussing symbolism and symbolic values was actually frightening. The different parts of our brain aren't adept at handling that information in a logical way and symbolic meanings can be interpreted as physical pain or rejection. Ouch and Yikes! Scary stuff. After reading all this, I do believe there is some meaning to the saying 'reality is the stories we tell ourselves' (greatly influenced by our brain's interpretation of things, along with hormonal regulation, genetics, environmental factors, childhood experiences, etc.) For anyone who isn't ready to undertake reading this, I'd recommend checking out some of Sapolsky's lectures from Stanford University on YouTube. There is some overlap between the lectures and the contents of the book. His lecturing style offers a comparable representation to his writing style. "

Sapolsky covers genetics, neurology, development, just to get STARTED on the important half of the book. I have a Master's in Psychology but my undergrad was in genetics and I struggled to keep up with the technical stuff in this book (luckily Sapolsky provides appendices with 101s for folk)So I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book to someone first diving into a piece on human nature, perhaps starting with something like Sapiens, or Ten Types of Humans. However if feeling confident or having plenty of time and cognitive energy to devote to this it should be fine.Overall the book is huge and covers so much its hard to really summarize, I loved that between the technical stuff there was the odd joke, or personal touch that always seemed brilliant. Some of the insights from this book will stick with me for life and while much of the content was heavy it was worthwhile."

It lets you learn something new in every chapter. My favorite part is when Sapolsky explains what goes in our brain when any behavior occurs.

Both give reasons for cautious optimism, though both also seem to realize the potential for disaster that looms as we move forward as a species. "
285,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66276739-adam-marischuk,2,"Two books and two different ratings, but you could save a lot of time by watching the youtube videos of kids trying to not eat marshmellows and coming to your own conclusions about human nature.The first half (including the three appendices) of Behave are the more scientific chapters of the book. The appendices are worth reading if, like me, you haven't formally studied biology in a couple of decades. They are a well written and easily digested summary of neuroscience, endocrinology and proteins.The first nine chapter have an interesting organisation, even if I feel it was not well executed. The idea of tracing an action backwards in time to evaluate the causes of the action has some merit, but Professor Sapolsky fails to remain on task and hence the excessive length of the sections. In the introduction he rails against ""buckets"" or categories of answers (the distinction between biology, psychology and culture) and then follows his own holistic advice. But the resulting chapters are disjointed at best. An editor could have cut the book in half without sacrificing any of the science or the audiences' ability to understand and a little of Aristotle's four causes would have benefited both author and audience. The digressions are sometimes interesting but usually merely political marginalia from an aging ""vertebarte, mammal, ape, human, male, scientist, lefty"" (p. 405)What was particularly interesting in the first few chapters is Professor Sapolsky's ability to find middle ground in the nature/nuture debate by bridging the gap between the two and noting the maliabiliy of nature.I suppose if the book had ended after chapter nine it would have received 3-4 stars.But then Professor Sapolsky continues into what I could only call socio-psychology with a dabbing of neuroscience to back up some rather radical leftist views. His discussions on hierarchy, free will, ethics, religion and war all take the same politically inspired position and do not flow seemlessly from the science. Sometimes it is bias mascarading as science, and othertimes it simply leaves the science aside. His discussion of ethics and utilitarianism is particularly egregious, and this is coming from someone who has little sympathy for utilitarianism. The construction of straw-man arguments does little to help the cause.Professor Sapolsky attempts to reconstruct the Naked Ape (Desmond Morris) but ends up with some monster who only vaguely resembles a man. I am reminded of the G.K. Chesterton quote, ""Take away the supernatural and all that is left is the unnatural"" (Orthodoxy, p 49) His reductionist materialist approach leads him into some strange territory, where rights exist but free will doesn't. Where a complete (and admittedly impossible) revolution of the criminal justice system is necessary. The very subtitle explicitly mentions our best and worst behaviour but he develops no criteria for evaluating one or the other, prefering to rely on ""context, context, context"" (p. 672). I am inclined to buy Jonathan Haidt and Steven Pinker and never pick up another book by Sapolsky. His politics, philosophy, ethics, criminology, even theology and psychology are all so different from any human's lived experience (and the language that goes along with it) that I can only concluded with E.O. Wilson, ""Wonderful theory, wrong species.""A lot more was said a lot better about materialism by David Hume, or about free will by Nietzsche, or mind-body dualism by Descartes, consciousness by Leibniz etc.And to close, he never justified:""I won't pull any punches- I think that its [agriculture's] invention was one of the all-time human blunders"" (p. 326)"

Sapolsky cherry-picks his research to make political points. He is yet another typical liberal intellectual type (so prevalent in education today) that is unable to set aside his own political and social prejudices and present the research in an unbiased way. That is not to say he does not present some interesting research in this book, but he so damages his own credibility with his misapplications of the scientific results and cherry-picking of the science that supports his own skewed views that no reasonable person can accept any of his characterizations or conclusions at face value. What is even more amusing is his repeated condemnations of people who misapply scientific results and cherry-pick the data, all while doing this himself throughout the length of the book. A good percentage of the book is devoted to using scientific research to prove that people who disagree with his political beliefs are unintelligent, unfeeling, etc., and yet he condemns the Nazis for citing science in a similar way to turn the Germans against the Jews. This book should be regarded as nothing but pure drivel and the author should be completely discredited in the world of science."

The not being the technical details, and the tiny-print footnotes, way too small for these old eyes.Lots of interesting stuff, ala Pinker, ""Better Angels"". 15th C.

290,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7208369-miles,5,"Books that examine the relationship between science and morality have become ubiquitous, so readers interested in these important subjects need to choose carefully. It is not an overstatement to say that one could do no better than to alight on Robert M. Sapolsky’s Behave. This engrossing, encyclopedic examination of the causal mechanisms that determine human behavior is a monumental achievement of syncretic thought.This was my first journey into Sapolsky’s singular mind, both joyful and challenging. Covering an almost inconceivably vast landscape of scientific information, this neurobiologist/primatologist takes a playful but responsible approach to some heady topics, delving deep into humanity’s best and worst behaviors while never missing an opportunity to charm the reader with his perspicacious wit. I usually don’t care for comedy in nonfiction, but Sapolsky’s wry humor rarely misses the mark, and is complemented by an impressive ability to synthesize multiple perspectives and extricate sensible conclusions from dense and sometimes-conflicting data. Sapolsky is also transparent about his own biases as a “bleeding heart liberal,” making him a truly lovable genius (and not just in the casual sense).Since it would be folly to try to cover everything this book has to offer in a review, I’ll focus on explaining Sapolsky’s methodology, and then comment on just a few of his most important findings. Sapolsky begins with a necessary critique of how scientists typically explain human behavior, which is to break it down into different “buckets of explanation,” each of which comprises a distinct realm of inquiry:""We tend to use a certain cognitive strategy when dealing with complex, multifaceted phenomena, in that we break down those separate facets into categories, into buckets of explanation…The goal of this book is to avoid such categorial thinking. Putting facts into nice cleanly demarcated buckets of explanation has its advantages––for example, it can help you remember facts better. But it can wreak havoc on your ability to think about those facts. This is because the boundaries between different categories are often arbitrary, but once some arbitrary boundary exists, we forget that it is arbitrary and get way too impressed with its importance…There are not different disciplinary buckets. Instead, each one is the end product of all the biological influences that came before it and will influence all the factors that follow it. Thus, it is impossible to conclude that a behavior is caused by a gene, a hormone, a childhood trauma, because the second you invoke one type of explanation, you are de facto invoking them all. No buckets. A 'neurobiological' or 'genetic' or 'developmental' explanation for a behavior is just shorthand, an expository convenience for temporarily approaching the whole multifactorial arc from a particular perspective."" (5-8, emphasis his)This boundary-busting approach puts Sapolsky squarely in the company of intellectual titans such as Edward O. Wilson and Steven Pinker––interdisciplinary thinkers who have, however imperfectly, combined findings from numerous academics fields to launch humanity into new realms of inquiry and debate. Sapolsky is less poetic than Wilson and less contentious than Pinker, bringing a cautious, even-handed compassion to the science of understanding human nature. As any science reader knows, it is one thing to claim that disciplinary boundaries are arbitrary and ought to be ignored, and quite a different thing to actually demonstrate how this can be done. And while I don’t think Sapolsky fully achieves his stated goal, his efforts to do so are heroic and effectual.The first half of Behave plays out like a tennis match that travels back in time, with the ball representing the focus of Sapolsky’s chapters and the net representing a (somewhat arbitrary) boundary between behavioral mechanisms that operate primarily inside or outside the human body. He begins with “One Second Before,” an explanation of the neurobiology that takes place just before behavior is enacted, then transitions to “Seconds to Minutes Before,” where he discusses immediate environmental stimuli that contribute to behavior. Next comes “Hours to Days Before,” a discussion of how hormones influence behavior, which is followed by “Days to Months Before,” where he takes up long-term neural plasticity (learning and memory).This pattern continues, with subsequent chapters addressing adolescence, early childhood development, genetics, culture, and humanity’s shared evolutionary heritage. So Sapolsky makes use of the buckets of explanation by taking up these topics one at a time (what else could he do?), but also goes to great lengths to show as many interactive areas of overlap between the different causal mechanisms as possible. This truly is a “both/and” story he is telling, with all the moving parts affecting all the other moving parts in profound and intriguing ways.The second half of Behave is more traditionally structured, and wades into dicier territory. Sapolsky tackles tricky subjects such as tribalism, moral intuition and bias, power dynamics, ethical motivation, empathy, the power of symbols to move us to action (or not), free will, criminal justice, and war. These areas of study are all rapidly evolving along with society and technology, so it’s impossible to tell how relevant Sapolsky’s assessments will be in decades to come. But all in all, this is the best and most up-to-date summary of recent findings in these fields one could hope to engage with. I probably had to read between ten and twenty other books to discover most of the insights Sapolsky distills into just a few hundred pages.All of this should be more than enough to convince science and ethics enthusiasts that Behave is essential reading. If you’re eager to run out and pick it up, just stop reading here and go for it. But if you want to stick around, I’ll give some thoughts about what I see as Sapolsky’s most important findings.Sapolsky’s most critical point by far is the importance of context in understanding human behavior. This is hardly a novel position, but Sapolsky lays out the argument for contextualization with sui generis assiduousness and clarity. Over and over he pounds the table about context, tirelessly illuminating the ways in which human behavior is sensitive to myriad influences both inside and outside the body. Most of these influences are partially or completely hidden from our conscious experience of the world, and it is only through scientific inquiry and abstraction that we come to understand their significance. Perhaps the wildest demonstration of this is the role of transcription factors in determining how a person’s genome expresses itself:""95 percent of DNA is noncoding…What is that 95 percent? Some is junk––remnants of pseudogenes inactivated by evolution. But buried in that are the keys to the kingdom, the instructional manual for when to transcribe particular genes, the on/off switches for gene transcription. A gene doesn’t 'decide' when to be photocopied into RNA, to generate its protein. Instead before the start of the stretch of DNA coding for that gene is a short stretch called a promoter––the 'on' switch. What turns the promoter switch on? Something called a transcription factor (TF) binds to the promoter…Thus transcription factors regulate genes. What regulates transcription factors? The answer devastates the concept of genetic determinism: the environment."" (226, emphasis his)Sapolsky goes on to explain that numerous factors––ones present inside cells, inside bodies, and even outside bodies––can all nudge transcription factors one way or another. This means that, while a person’s genome stays constant throughout life, gene expression (the manner in which genes code for the particular proteins that make you you) is keenly sensitive to environmental conditions and constantly in flux. Furthermore, it turns out that transcription factors are usually proteins themselves, and therefore require other transcription factors to instruct genes to code for them:""Genomes aren’t infinite; instead TFs regulate one another’s transcription, solving that pesky infinity problem. Importantly, across the species whose genomes have been sequenced, the longer the genome (i.e., roughly the more genes there are), the greater the percentage of genes coding for TFs. In other words, the more genomically complex the organism, the larger the percentage of the genome devoted to gene regulation by the environment...The human genome codes for about 1,500 different TFs, contains 4,000,000 TF-binding sites, and the average cell uses about 200,000 such sites to generate its distinctive gene-expression profile. This is boggling."" (228-9, emphasis his)Boggling indeed, but also fucking fabulous. O brave new world, that has such people in ‘t! The level of detail and complexity in the example above is indicative of every section and chapter Behave has to offer. Sapolsky doesn’t cut corners or succumb to simplistic reductionism, seeking instead to repeatedly blow the reader’s mind by showing the grand scope of what goes into decisions as simple as deciding whether to reach out to touch someone’s arm. Every step of the way, we are bombarded with caveats, clarifications, contradictions, and pitfalls of empirical limitation. It would be infuriating if it weren’t so damned fascinating! Sapolsky’s main thrust––that context is always crucial and never simple when trying to understand behavior––could not be better delivered. It also carries a hopeful undertone because many of the environmental contexts in which humans must operate are created and controlled by humans, implying that we can genuinely help people lead better lives if we learn how to fiddle the environmental dials the right way. Our power in this regard is far from limitless, but hardly insignificant (I’ll return to this at the end of the review).Behave also contains strong arguments for the elimination of poverty and abuse, especially in the lives of children. Sapolsky grinds out a glut of ghastly facts about how “childhood adversity” can compromise people later in life:""Childhood adversity increases the odds of an adult having (a) depression, anxiety, and/or substance abuse; (b) impaired cognitive capacity, particularly related to frontocortical function; (c) impaired impulse control and emotion regulation; (d) antisocial behavior, including violence; and (e) relationships that replicate the adversities of childhood (e.g., staying with an abusive partner)."" (194)He immediately follows up by pointing out that “some individuals endure miserable childhoods just fine,” and makes it clear that anything goes when looking at a particular case (194). But the trending effects of childhood adversity are undeniable and terrible. Like many other insights in Behave, this is not anything we didn’t already know; it’s the sheer volume and artful presentation of Sapolsky’s converging evidence that gives his work inimitable force. He is also not afraid to bind these findings to strong, empirically-based arguments that reject egregious income inequality and promote investment in public goods:""It’s not so much that poverty predicts poor heath; it’s poverty amid plenty––income inequality. The surest way to make someone feel poor is to rub their nose in what they don’t have…When social capital decreases (thanks to inequality), up goes psychological stress…If you want to improve health and quality of life for the average person in a society, you spend money on public goods––better public transit, safer streets, cleaner water, better public schools, universal health care…Inequality means more secession of the wealthy from contributing to the public good."" (294-5)There’s no denying that this is a kind of liberal do-gooder wishlist, tinged with Sapolsky’s political leanings. Although it leaves him open to criticism, I admire Sapolsky for linking research with certain normative outcomes when he deems it appropriate. It is a fitting strategy for this moment in time, when the notion of any truly “objective” source of information has become obsolete. The best we’ve got are people like Sapolsky, who humbly bend the knee to reason and reality even when they’d rather the universe were otherwise, and who also fight tooth and nail to be heard when reason and reality actually support their political points of view.The final aspects of Behave I want to take up are Sapolsky’s direct claims that we can and should use science to improve the chances of people acting well instead of badly, along with his implicit argument that narrative and storytelling have a huge role to play in this grand project. While science is perhaps humanity’s most powerful method for analyzing and improving environmental conditions, narrative is a timeless tool for teaching people to assume the perspectives of others and to individuate potential enemies instead of reducing them to faceless members of a reviled out-group. This comes through in Sapolsky’s recommendations for dealing with humanity’s inescapably tribal nature:""From massive, breathtaking barbarity to countless pinpricks of microaggression, Us versus Them has produced oceans of pain. Yet our generic goal is not to 'cure' us of Us/Them dichotomizing. It can’t be done…If we accept that there will always be sides, it’s a nontrivial to-do list item to always be on the side of angels. Distrust essentialism. Keep in mind that what seems like rationality is often just rationalization, playing catch-up with subterranean forces that we never suspect. Focus on the larger, shared goals. Practice perspective taking,. Individuate, individuate, individuate. Recall the historical lessons of how often the truly malignant Thems keep themselves hidden and make third parties the fall guy."" (423-4)Sapolsky doesn’t take what I see as the next logical step here, which is to assert that the easiest way people can begin checking off his anti-tribal “to-do list” is to engage with stories that open the way to novel perspectives and unfamiliar modes of moral calculus. We should draw heavily on the power of narrative to simulate social complexity and teach the lessons Sapolsky rightly identifies as essential for ethical education. He points out in a later chapter that, despite its considerable downsides, “our confusion of the literal and the metaphorical, our granting of life-threatening sanctity to the symbolic, can be used to bring about the best of our behaviors” (579). There is a momentous marriage between the arts and sciences embedded in this outlook––a marriage more sacred than any of the supposedly sacrosanct folderol that has hitherto spawned from the imaginative shit-heap of human history.Stories can teach us to think and act better, but only science can deliver the building blocks and blueprints for our better world. When wrapping up a discussion of how former enemies reach reconciliation, Sapolsky implores readers to “recognize that science can teach us how to make events like these more likely” (670). He knows it’s a game of probability; we can’t force people to be good, but we can make it systemically easier for them to make the right choice, even if we know the “rightness” of that choice will always be at least partially if not wholly circumstantial. The more we learn about the light and dark tendencies inherent in human nature and particular arenas of action, the more capable we become of incentivizing instances of good behavior and minimizing instances of bad behavior. Scrupulousness of the highest order is called for, but the project is both worthy and necessary.I’d be delighted to spin out some final words that would drive home everything that is special about this book, but I couldn’t hope to top Sapolsky himself:""If you had to boil this book down to a single phrase, it would be 'It’s complicated.' Nothing seems to cause anything; instead everything just modulates something else. Scientists keep saying, “We used to think X, but now we realize that…” Fixing one thing often messes up ten more, as the law of unintended consequences reigns. On any big, important issue it seems like 51 percent of the scientific studies conclude one thing, and 49 percent conclude the opposite. And so on. Eventually it can seem hopeless that you can actually fix something, can make things better. But we have no choice but to try. And if you are reading this, you are probably ideally suited to do so. You’ve amply proven you have intellectual tenacity. You probably also have running water, a home, adequate calories, and lows odds of festering with a bad parasitic disease. You probably don’t have to worry about Ebola virus, warlords, or being invisible in your world. And you’ve been educated. In other words, you’re one of the lucky humans. So try.""

291,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77785790-david,4,"I think of this book as an introduction to pre-crime. I believe the term that the author uses is ""neurocriminology"", but the essential unifying premise of the book is that human choices are predetermined by complex biological factors which neuroscientists are just beginning to understand in ways that will eventually allow these specialists to predict very specific criminal and antisocial behaviors before, sometimes long before, the actors consciously choose them. We inherently function as if our choices are independent, spontaneous and free. Westerners particularly tend to view ourselves as autonomous individuals. This book will shatter these notions. Most or all of our choices are made before we are consciously aware of them, and most of our choices are not really originate in the individual. Our thoughts and decisions arise from our primordial past, our education, and the biological / environmental conditions immediately preceding ""our"" decisions.The most difficult aspect of the book for me was the insufferable liberalism of the author. The book opens with a gratuitous fantasy about all the horrible things the author would do to Hitler, if given the chance. The author also avails himself of every opportunity to illustrate how racist and bigoted white people are compared to nonwhites. It's never made clear why the author harbors such biases, but it's clear that he feels both justified and righteous for doing so.The concessions which the author makes concerning human biology and behavior are all the more enlightening given his openly hard left bias. For example, Sapolsky conclusively denies that ""nurture"" is the pre-eminent factor in determining human behavior. At the same time, he also gives evidence to show that inherited, genetic traits are strongly modified by the environment, whether that be biochemical or social.Sapolsky affirms the biological reality of kin selection by citing mouse studies showing that mammals produce biochemicals enabling individuals to ""smell"" how closely related other individuals are. Mice, among others, preferentially socialize with individuals whom they sense are more closely related, all else being equal. On the other hand, mice and other animals can be trained artificially to ignore this natural bias for their kin and affiliate with non-related individuals.Similarly, the author points out that human social structures tend to be ethnocentric. Human studies show that whites have an innate, preconscious bias towards their own kind and against blacks. Nevertheless, it's possible to ""overcome"" this ""xenophobia"" with appropriate conditioning, according to the author. Sapolsky consistently recognizes the fact that humans and animals naturally desire to bond with relatives and kin, yet he regularly affirms this natural tendency is ""bad"" or ""xenophobic"".The ""fallacy of naturalism"" struck me as a profound insight into the character not only of Sapolsky, but of the leftist cultural phenomenon as a whole. Such liberals are characterized by the belief that what is natural and instinctive is often wrong and must be artificially re-engineered in order to achieve harmony. By contrast, the opposing view of many conservatives is that nature is correct, even sacrosanct. This view of nature's correctness is easily seen in Austrian Economics, for instance.Another key aspect of the liberal left versus the conservative right that I noticed in this book was the fact that liberal tendencies typically arise from people who are insulated from the exigencies of life relative to those people who are regularly exposed to hardship. Sapolsky cites studies showing, for instance, that conservative people experience nightmares more frequently and suffer from more adversity in general than their liberal counterparts.This adversity-conservatism correlation was also illustrated by a narrative describing the social transformation of a troop of baboons from an endogamous, tribal, aggressive, and patriarchal community to a relatively exogamous, passive, and female-dominant one. How did this transformation occur? It occurred in response to an unlimited supply of low-cost food: the troop settled near a garbage dump where they ate leftovers from human tourists and became ""liberalized"".The same appears to be true for primitive human society. Sapolsky devotes considerable space to the question of whether archaic hunter-gatherer and pastoral human societies were violent and aggressive or peaceful and harmonious. What he shows is that scarcity of resources provokes the former, while abundance promotes the latter. Thus, the ""noble savage"" resolves to the ""well-fed savage"" who becomes more savage and less noble he becomes more hungry.Conservatism and hunger are not only linked in the case of monkeys and tribal humans. Sapolsky notes that criminal justices statistically deliver harsher sentences when they have skipped breakfast. Combined with the observation that conservative people often have more nightmares and other adverse experiences, a theme emerges: liberalism of all kinds is the natural product of affluence and excess, while conservatism is the natural response to adversity and hardship.However, culture is not merely the expression of environmental resources over time. Behavior is embedded in the biology and genetics of the individuals forming a community. Sapolsky cites the famous Dmitry Belyayev Russian Fox study which showed that selective breeding could produce docile foxes. Sapolsky also cited a similar study showing that feral behavioral traits could be bred out of rats. These studies showed, according to Sapolsky, that behaviors which we think of a volitional and ""free"" may, in fact, be the inevitable result of genetic selection.This is a fascinating admission from a leftist author since it forms the key premise of ""A Troublesome Inheritance"" by Nicholas Wade. Wade's book is described as ""controversial"" largely because it applies the Russian Fox study (among others) to human society. Sapolsky shies away from such conclusions, yet both he and Wade agree that human behavior is heritable, just like animal behavior is. Further, both explicitly reject the absurd ""blank slate"" hypothesis of the social constructivists. Sapolsky's book can, in many ways, be seen a single, massive refutation of ""blank slate"" theory, yet in practice, Sapolsky advocates against the idea that our heritable traits are generally good. Our natural proclivity to identify and associate with kin leads, in his view, to violence, ""xenophobia"", and antisocial behavior. Thus, Sapolsky sees it as necessary for social harmony to scientifically overcome our natural tendency towards ""pseudospeciation"" based on biological factors like genes and race.Sapolsky regularly returns to the theme of ""green-beard effects"" wherein individuals in society identify and associate with individuals who share specific phenotypical traits, such as dark skin or blue eyes. Sapolsky automatically asserts that such effects are irrational, even dangerous. With this in mind, he documents various scientifically-validated techniques for replacing natural, racially-based green-beard effects with artificial ones, such as affiliation on the basis of organized sports.Conservative, ethnocentric thinkers like Wade, Pat Buchanan, and Ann Coulter observe the same green-beard and kin-selection effects but that such effects are both good and natural. In the conservative paradigm, separation of the tribe is the solution, not the problem. Both sides admit the existence of the natural tendency to form kin-based tribes, yet authors like Sapolsky generally affirm that advocacy of such nativism constitutes the dangerous logical fallacy of ""moral naturalism"".Sapolsky regularly makes jabs at moral naturalism. His main criticism is that what is perceived to be natural at one time often changes later. Thus, culture mediates our perception of what is ""natural"" and ""good"" versus what is ""unnatural"" and ""bad"". Sapolsky sees this as a an opportunity for reshaping social perceptions to accept new ""unnatural"" things as ""good"" and ""natural"", while the conservative instinct is to pass on what is perceived as natural from one generation to the next.If we accept the essential premise of Behave, then the choice to be liberal (in the sense of adoption what is unnatural and foreign) versus conservative (the preservation of the natural) is biological and subconscious rather than objective and rational. Furthermore, if we accept that the instinct to conserve kin-based groups and ostracize foreign races is dangerous and subversive, then it is easy to cast racial conservatism as a mental disorder rather than a rational decision. The same is true in reverse: if liberal tendencies are heritable, biological, and subversive rather than rational and ""free"", then liberalism is a ultimately disease. This isn't a new idea: Michael Savage, for instance, is notable for his regular insistence that liberalism is a mental disorder. In the opposite camp, it's not uncommon for liberals to insist that conservatism is the result of inbreeding, mental retardation, or childhood trauma.The ultimate end of rational dialog comes when we finally accept that people with views opposite to our own are not going to change their minds or become ""converted"" on the basis of rational argumentation and evidence. Various biological markers predispose people to adopt the views which they hold such that the conscious, rational portion of our brain constitutes a thin veneer over the primal realities of our nature.Viewing liberalism and conservatism as biological traits leads us to the ultimate question: will liberalism or conservatism ultimately wipe out the opposing trait and achieve hegemony in the human population, or at least in specific human population groups? Drawing on the above-mentioned studies, I conclude that while resources are abundant, docile, passive, and liberal traits will be dominant while virile, defensive, and conservative traits will become recessive relics of a dark, irrelevant past."
292,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7422525-scriptor-ignotus,5,"IT’S COMPLICATED “I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.”  — Sir Isaac NewtonWhy do people do what they do? Of all the sciences, that of our own behavior is often the most unsettling in its mysteriousness. Delivering a precise and comprehensive causal explanation for any form of human behavior is almost always impossible, and to attempt even a general account requires one to interface with a bewildering array of methodologies, disciplinary perspectives, spatial and temporal scales of analysis, and the necessary but overwhelmingly nuanced and complex interrelationship between all these factors. If any piece of the causal puzzle is missing—which is always the case, as biologists have not (yet) fully mapped the causal chains that produce our most unique and sophisticated behaviors—then none of the other pieces quite fit together either, leaving unanswered some of the most fundamental questions regarding who and what we are. We are enigmatic even (perhaps especially) to ourselves—as psychology and the humanities have long attested—even though self-knowledge may be the most critical necessity for the survival and flourishing of our species and its planetary habitat. Behave is an incredibly ambitious cross-disciplinary gesture towards a complete picture of the biological substrata of human behavior. As a study which attempts to account for both the profoundest depths of cruelty and sadism and the most exalted heights of compassion and benevolence characteristic of our kind, and which attempts not to override and dismiss but to affirm and buttress the full spectrum of approaches for thinking about human nature, it is the most genuinely humanistic science book I have read. Behave is organized in two main parts. The first part, composed of the first nine chapters, is likely the most thorough exposition of the multilayered biological underpinnings of human behavior ever put in print. Each chapter is framed as part of a skeletal narrative: a behavior has just occurred: what happened in the seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, years, centuries, and millennia beforehand that could help explain why it happened? Each consecutive chapter widens Sapolsky’s analytical lens. When we think about what happened one second before the behavior occurred, we’re in the realm of cellular neurobiology. Neurons in the brain are generating action potentials in response to a stimulus; these disturbances of the negative charge inside of a neuron, caused by openings in the dendritic spines which allow positively-charged ions to flow through, travel from the dendritic spines through the cell body and, if the electrical disturbance passes a certain threshold, through the axon to the axon terminals, which send neurotransmitters across synapses that connect with specialized receptors on the dendritic spines of subsequent neurons, which causes the opening of channels in the membrane for positive ions, which generates action potentials in those neurons, and so on. The collection of 100 billion neurons in each human body and their integrated axonal projections are, at the cellular level, what constitute the vast and intricate circuitry of the nervous system. The generation of collective action potentials in billions of neurons in a particular brain region is what neuroscientists refer to when they speak about the “activation” of brain regions in response to stimuli. Move the timescale back to seconds or minutes before the behavior, and we’re looking at the macro organization of the brain. At this level our behaviors are mediated through the interaction of brain regions. The ancient amygdala, the almond-shaped core of the limbic system, mediates fear, anxiety, and aggression, and is often the first brain region to activate in response to unfamiliar stimuli. People who demonstrate more implicit bias against racial out-groups show more amygdaloid activation when presented with faces of people of another race, and the amygdala shows growth and overactivity in the brains of people suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Overlaying the amygdala are the higher limbic structures, which regulate base emotions, and the cortex, which mediates most of our higher cognitive functions, such as memory, language, motor skills, facial recognition, and contextual judgment. The newest brain region, in evolutionary terms, is the prefrontal cortex (PFC): the crown jewel of executive function, the seat of strategic knowledge organization, delayed gratification, social and cultural acclimation, contextualization, and the regulation of emotionality and impulsivity. It is also the last brain region to mature in an individual lifetime, not coming fully online until around age 25—a critical fact when thinking about the brilliance and deviancy so uniquely characteristic of adolescence.The late maturation of the PFC indicates something astonishing about the evolution of the human brain. The wiring of the PFC is not significantly more complex than that of other cortical regions, nor does it consist of a different type of neuron—with a few limited exceptions. Biologically speaking, it isn’t any “harder” to develop a prefrontal cortex than it is to develop any other part of the brain, which likely means that the delayed development of the PFC was selected for by our hominid ancestors. We evolved in such a way that the makeup of the frontal cortex, because its development is delayed, is shaped by the makeup of our other brain regions, which in turn are shaped by personal experiences. By developing later, the PFC is designed to accommodate the neurological “lessons” of our own, individual lives. The genetic program of our brain development has evolved to liberate the frontal cortex from genetics. Of course, none of these brain regions are discrete entities, and none are free from the influences of hormones and environmental factors. Expanding our timescale to account for the hours to months before a behavior occurs involves reference to endocrinology, the effect of hormones on behavior via their influencing of the nervous system, and the plasticity of the brain. Here Sapolsky debunks some common misunderstandings about the role of certain hormones in behavior; namely testosterone and oxytocin. Hormones are not “instigators” of behavior; in fact, one of the overarching themes of the entire book is that there is never a single biological cause of any behavior, but rather a vast field of facilitating and inhibiting factors that influence the probability of certain behaviors to degrees that are not always quantifiable. Androgens like testosterone are facilitators of behavior. They make the amygdala more sensitive to triggers of aggression, but only among people who are already predisposed to acts of aggression. Nor is aggression the single, inevitable result of testosterone production. Testosterone levels increase not only in response to situations demanding aggression, but also in situations in which one’s social status is uncertain, changing, or perceived to be under threat. In those situations testosterone does not facilitate violence per se; it facilitates whatever behavior is necessary for one to secure status. If a society bases its status relations on, say, charitability, then testosterone won’t cause you to strangle a cheetah; it will cause you to insist on paying the tab at a restaurant. If testosterone has an unfairly negative reputation, oxytocin has an unfairly positive one. This “luv hormone” facilitates bonds between mothers and infants, bonds between humans and their canine pets, and the pair-bonding of monogamous romantic couples; but these salutary effects are relegated to in-group relations. Oxytocin increases our prosociality towards an “Us”, but it also makes us more suspicious of “Thems”. It does not facilitate free love, but rather parochialism. In the second part of the book, Sapolsky attempts to synthesize the complicated layers of knowledge laid out in the first half, and to offer some insight as to how these biological factors influence our best and worst behaviors. I can hardly do justice to the nuances of the discussions in each chapter, but they address such topics as our instinctual categorization of people into In-Groups and Out-Groups and how and why we prioritize some dimensions of “Us-ness” over others; the unique human capacity for establishing and navigating hierarchies and the physically corrosive effects of having the “wrong” status in a particular social context (Sapolsky is a Rousseauian primitivist, and considers the agricultural revolution to be the greatest blunder in human history for the role it played in establishing rigid and dramatic status hierarchies); the neurological correlates of empathy (and how it’s better if our altruism is instinctive rather than an act of willpower); how metaphorical thinking is innate to our biology (and why a society is in extremely dangerous territory if certain members of it are persuasively associated with insects or fecal matter; hyperactivity of the insular cortex, which regulates disgust responses, can make one an ethnic cleanser—or worse, a germaphobe); the question of free will and how our conception of justice should be framed accordingly (Sapolsky is a strong determinist and thinks a criminal justice system based on punishment is totally irrational); and, of course, war and peace. Why do people do what they do? Sapolsky’s short answer is: it’s really complicated. No, really, that’s his answer; that’s the conclusion he comes to at the end of this big, beautiful disaster of a book. But understanding, though difficult, is possible; and with understanding comes a spirit of mercy which could perhaps change the world."

This is one of those rare authors who can educate the reader while entertaining regarding a topic of staggering complexity. I hope this gift does indeed carry over to his classroom at Stanford in which case there will undoubtedly be a lot of inspired youth pursuing answers to the mysteries of the brain. I took considerable time to read this book as there were many opportunities to reread the passage or concept at hand and contemplate the subject in depth. There is also great reference information and appendices to help those of us needing liberal doses of assistance. As one of the greatest benefits of such books are the attributions and opportunity to read the books referenced I will add one for consideration that won't disappoint: ""The Archaeology of Mind: Neuroevolutionary Origins of Human Emotion."" by Jaak Panksepp and Lucy Biven. This is worthy of mentioning in the same review as Professor Sapolsky's masterpiece.  As with so many things in life the satisfaction is directly proportional to the effort expended and Robert Sapolsky's book, ""Behave,"" will help you better understand what chemistry and brain structures combined with environmental factors are potentially at the root of this feeling. This is not an author espousing an absolute deterministic view, but leaves room for something more that makes us human that our science has yet to discover the metrology to measure. The intellectual humility is rare and a reflection of the author's wisdom."

A lot of humor (not all of it sophisticated) and storytelling. This is a long book, and I spent a really long time reading it. Well worth taking it in by small chunks."

297,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31302406-lori,5,"I have a very quick rule of thumb to measure up books meant popularise science: if it leaves one thinking ""ow it's much more complicated than that"", then it's a good book. And I was very pleased to see the author echo—explicitly, obviously this was implicit throughout the book— much of the same sentiment in the Epilogue: If you had to boil down this book to a single phrase it would be ""it's complicated"" (p. 674)   Highly recommended to anyone trying to understand what it is to inhabit this meat suit we call a human body. Although, fair warning, you will be left with a great feeling of uncertainty afterwards; i.e. you will be made aware of your own ignorance, and most important—hopefully—you will shut up about ""human nature"" at every turn. You can also expect to have your (yes, your) simplistic notions of biological determinism shattered.  Now, a slightly more elaborate exposition than ""it's complicated"": Any meaningful analysis of the behaviour of human species deals with biology-environment interactions. One can expect to learn that: testosterone, oxytocin, mirror neurons, and pretty much any new fad protein, neurotransmitter, or brain region does not work the way you thought it did.  The negative effects of poverty, inequality, and social hierarchy in general are laid bare—or shorter SES (socio-economic status). The science is in: these societal dynamics wreak havoc on everything from IQ (p. 249) to health, to exacerbating anti-social behavior. Most fascinating is the fact that the lower you are on the wealth inequality ladder, the poorer your health. And get this, only a third of this degradation is due to actual, poorer material conditions. It is the subjective experience that matters, and the definitive knowledge and reality of having someone who's infinitely richer than you, and capable of shitting down the ladder—so to speak—on you. (p. 441 contains a nice bullet-point list of the known effects). Now, I am going to go on a tangent, to something the author did not mention, but as a filthy red I am almost obliged to do so. If we look into the work of Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century, and more importantly in Karl Marx's Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, Vol 1, we see capitalism's inevitable, structural tendency to create utterly obscene inequalities. Now, given that we know the negative effects of inequality on human beings and the causes of these inequalities, it should be trivial to synthesise a necessary political project: anti-capitalism.Ok, now, back to the content of the book. Robert Sapolsky—rightly so—criticizes Steven Pinker's The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined for cherry picking some of the data referring to primitive societies (p. 311-315). Mislabelling of hunter-horticulturalists (p. 321) as hunter gatherers, thus shadowing the plethora of research showing distinct ""pro-social"" behaviour of the former group. Failure to adjust for length of conflict (p. 614-620) in determining how violent historical periods were, doubly baffling given that Pinker all the while (correctly) adjusted the total victim count for overall world population size at that time—glaring oversight. Overall, a fairly positive critique, but one that leaves the reader with the impression ""it's more complicated than that"" (unlike Pinker's own conclusions). Note: the page references in this paragraph are to ""Behave"".  My own point of contention with the book, is that it omits a plethora of anthropological, and historical studies into human civilization (Lewis Mumford, E.A Gutkind, David Graeber)—while tapping into what seems to be a clichee body of work that is being passed around in the same Ivy League circles (essentially the same body of work as used by Pinker). This also leads to the author using some historically impoverished definitions of ""individualist"" and ""collectivist"" cultures—the latter being extremely poorly represented, and mostly by modern ""samples"". Mentions of ancient, medieval, and revolutionary period cities, which would be much better examples than modern ones, are woefully absent.  In short, this books is broad in its analysis of biology, but rather narrow in its analysis of society. But nonetheless, it is still an endless mine of fresh knowledge that would take forever for me to go through in this review. Luckily, the Epilogue has a nice bullet-point list (albeit it is not exhaustive of the content). Overall, Behave it deeply fascinating, and definitely worth a read! I highly recommend this book to everyone!"
298,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30276417-nancy-mills,5,"Fascinating book that begins with some rather difficult lessons in endocrinology and neuroloscience, but after the author lays that foundation, the books blooms into a dense but highly entertaining tomb about how behavior is affected by genes, hormones, environmental factors (that of course affect hormones), and then the guy actually has the nerve to go into the topic of Free Will ... and does a great job all the way. Here I am compelled to add a lengthy quote from the author, in a footnote, of course:""And the one thing I'm not going anywhere near is this New Age-y notion, ""Of course we have free will. You can't say that our behavior is determined by a mechanistic universe, because the universe is indeterminate, because of quantum mechanics."" Argh. What anyone sensible who has thought about this will point out is that (a)the consequences of subatomic indeterminacy of quantum mechanics (about which I understand zero) don't ripple upward enough to influence behavior, and (b) if they did, the result wouldn't be the freedom to will your behavior. It would be the utter randomization of behavior. In the words of philosopher/neuroscientist Sam Harris, a free will trasher, if quantum mechanics actually played a role in any of this, 'Every thought and action would seem to merit the statement ""I don't know what just came over me."""" Except you wouldn't actually be able to make that statement, since you'd just makinggarly sounds because the muscles in your tongue would be doing all sorts of random things.""Well I guess he told THEM!There is a chapter toward the back of the book entitled ""Biology, the Criminal Justice System, and Free Will,"" which will get your frontal cortex neurons twitching if anything will.Conclusions aren't cut and dry, if that's what you were hoping, but certainly will give the reader a tremendous background, if one can manage to absorb even half of the book's contents. If you're not all that into biology and long scientific words, you can get away with skimming the tough parts. I plowed through it and found it very rewarding. There are 3 Appendices, all good that you can skip if you don't want to learn about Neuroscience, Endocrinology or Protein Basics.Dr. Sapolsky is sympathetic, maybe even empathetic (the books discusses these phenomena) toward the the reader who may find the material dense, and his humor more than redeems his asking us to familiarize ourselves with all this stuff. Anterior Something Cingulate. dmELvE. vm LLpe. I don't know. A whole bunch of acronyms. Half way through the book I accidentally found out that there is a glossary in the back that defines each acronym which certainly makes things tons easier. Anyway, the author is understanding. One passage, for example, reads ""This is a bold assertion that the heuristic of dialectical materialism not only extends beyond the economic world into the naturalistic one, but is ontologically rooted in the essential sameness of both worlds' dynamic resolution of irresolvable contradictions."" Before the you throw the book across the room, the author adds this footnote: ""I have no idea what it is that I just wrote..."" He bravely plows ahead with ""It is Marx and Engels as trilobite and snail,"" and immediately footnotes again: ""Ditto."" Truthfully my main complaint is that the footnotes, which are numerous and are at times the best parts of the text, and printed in such teeny print that even with my glasses I had trouble reading them after the sun went down with my 60 watt bulb. There are, of course, about a million end notes to, which I seldom bothered with.Sapolsky, in his final chapter, delves into War and Peace (the subject, not the novel) and reveals some very interesting behaviors on the battlefield versus way back behind the lines where men in fancy uniforms make strategics decisions. And the part about drone pilots, who shoot targets thousands of miles away, nevertheless get bad cases of PTSD in spite of the fact that they are never physically putting their own lives in danger. Remarkable findings.One of the most worthwhile books I've read this year, highly recommended for people who like to read and don't mind a little mental exercise."
299,1594205078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,4,"This brick of a book purports to be an interdisciplinary explanation of human behavior, drawing from biology, psychology, and sociology, and everything from primate studies to well-known works in various fields. It’s big, at 717 pages of actual text followed by references; it’s broad; and as such it’s a little bit simplistic. Even at this size, there’s not quite room to develop all of the material. The first half or so of the book is more focused on the “hard” science, beginning with how neurons communicate with each other, and working its way up through hormones, genes, brain development through childhood and adulthood and how this is affected by trauma, and the evolution of species. The second half is more focused on psychology: us vs. them dichotomies, moral decisionmaking, the causes of violence, and whether the criminal justice system really makes sense when all human behavior is ultimately driven by biology. (Sapolsky argues no, but I’m not so sure. Where would we be as a species, or as individuals, if we all just shrugged our shoulders and gave in to ideas of biological determinism?)I certainly learned a lot from this book, which contains a ton of information presented in a way that is understandable to a non-scientist – though I struggled a bit with some of the early chapters. It provides a strong synthesis and framework for understanding information from biology and social sciences. That said, on the subjects that I did know something about, it seemed a little simplified. Fair enough; entire books have been written on subjects that comprise a single chapter here. As other reviewers have suggested, Sapolsky perhaps accepts too many psychological studies uncritically, without discussing psychology’s replication crisis, in which dozens of famous studies, when run again using the exact same methods and parameters, failed to produce the same headline-worthy results. That said, in general Sapolsky seems to take a fair approach to his material, presenting and evaluating multiple viewpoints in areas that have generated controversy. His writing is readable given the subject matter, and there’s a goofy-professor personality behind it that occasionally shines through. I wouldn’t take everything here as gospel – and I suppose we never should, since new scientific discoveries regularly require us to reevaluate what we thought was true – but the book did leave me a little more educated than I was before."
