0,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/810847-anita,5,"Michael Pollan is a journalist, and an omnivore, curious about where the food he puts in his mouth comes from. In the book he follows four meals from the very beginning of the food chain to his plate. What he finds is that the food we put in our mouths turns out to be a big decision- a moral, political, and environmental one.Part One- CORNThe discussion begins with CORN. Part one of this book is shocking. I knew corn was the main crop grown in America and that farmers growing it are in big trouble, requiring government subsidies just to stay afloat, but Michael Pollan unravels how it got to that point. After leaving the farm, most of the corn finds its way to the Confined Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO) where it is fed to cows, pigs, chicken, turkey, and now even fish. This is problematic due to the fact that cows aren't built to eat corn. They eat grass. This unnatural diet leads to various health problems for the cow that must be countered with a cocktail of antibiotics and hormones, creating more health problems for us. He follows the corn from the field to the supermarket, where it now infiltrates virtually every processed food on the shelf. I had no idea that corn is broken down and recombined into hundreds of different forms, most notably oils, high fructose corn syrup, and xantham gum (never knew what the hell that was). Just take a look at the food label of any processed food and your probably eating some scientific form of that kernel of corn. He followed the corn all the way to his meal at McDonald's. Between Pollan, his wife, and his son they packed in 4,510 calories for lunch. The items that contained the highest proportion of corn turned out to be the soda (100%), milk shake (78%), salad dressing (65%), chicken nuggets (56%), cheeseburger (52%), and french fries (23%). And we thought we were eating such a varied diet. As Pollan points out, we are simply industrialized eaters surviving on corn. Part 2- GRASSPart two focuses on the organic movement. Everyone thinks they're making a wonderful decision to eat organic and in one sense they are, saving the soil from all of the synthetic fertilizers and pesticides (although some crazy stuff is still allowed under US organic laws). There are the obvious health benefits of not ingesting those things. The dark side is that the bag of Earthbound Farms baby lettuce mix you just bought traveled 3,000 miles in refrigerated trucks using untold amounts of energy. Organic started out as a local movement, but as demands increased, it was forced to industrialize. Supermarkets don't want to deal with several smaller local organic farmers. They want one large buyer to stock all their produce needs. Big Organic is now a 350 million dollar business.Meet Rosie, the organic free range chicken:The lesson taken away from Rosie is beware of food labels that state things like ""free range"" or ""cage-free."" These are really meaningless statements placed on packaging in an attempt to lessen the guilt of consumers that have informed themselves about the horrors of industrial factory farming. Michael Pollan tracked down Rosie and it turns out that she isn't out wandering in a field of grass. She's in a long indoor structure confined with twenty thousand birds for the first five weeks of her life. When they open the doors at either end after the first five weeks, the birds habits have been set in place, they feel no need to take a chance out in the unknown (which turns out to be a small fenced in patch of grass that could never support all of the birds inside). As Pollan puts it ""free range turns out to be not so much a lifestyle for these chickens as a two-week vacation option.""Pollan then visits Polyface Farm just outside of Charlottesville, VA where Joel Salatin raises cows, pigs, chickens, turkeys, and even rabbits in harmony with the animals natural instincts. It is the true definition of symbiosis, where each species depends on the others and all depend on the grass. Salatin manages all of this using rotational grazing techniques. The cows come through first, then the chickens. The animals are moved on a daily basis to prevent overgrazing and to allow the proper spreading of the animals' droppings which in turn nourish the soil and grasses. He slaughters the chickens on site, in the open air where any of his costumers can watch and see where their food really comes from. Compare this to the CAFOs where the killing stations are off limits to all observers. What's going on behind those walls? Polyface cows and pigs have to be sent off-site due to USDA regulations. People drive from all over to buy his ""clean food"" and restaurants in Charlottesville proudly read ""Polyface Farm chickens"" on their menus. They give a variety of reasons when asked why they come all the way to buy Salatin's food: ""I just don't trust the meat in the supermarket anymore.""""You're not going to find fresher chickens anywhere.""""I drive 150 miles one way in order to get clean meat for my family.""""It actually tastes like chicken.""""Oh those beautiful eggs! The difference is night and day- the color, the richness, the fat content.""It is the alliance between the producer and the consumer. The consumers can look the farmer in the eyes and see that the food is produced ""with care and without chemicals."" They are also keeping the moeny in the community by supporting local farmers.Part 3- The ForestHis final meal is from ingredients derived from Pollan's owe efforts through hunting and gathering. He realizes this is an unrealistic option in terms of our daily eating, but he wants to undergo this experiment to bring him closer to the food he eats. After hunting wild boar, gathering mushrooms from the forest, collecting cherries from a tree in the neighborhood, he discovers what is for him, ""the perfect meal."" Why perfect? His meal would not have been possible without the number of people that helped him in his hunting and gathering endeavours. It was an open food chain. He knew where all the ingredients came from and their were no hidden costs. ""A meal that is eaten in full consciousness of what it took to make it is worth preparing every now and again, if only as a way to remind us of the true costs of the things we take for granted.""The bottom line:What are we eating?Where did it come from?How did it make it to our table?What is the true cost? (politically, environmentally, ethically, and in terms of the public health) "
1,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan,3,"I was resistant to reading this book because I’m not an omnivore, and also I thought that Pollan’s book The Botany of Desire was brilliant and I suspected I would not feel as fond of this one, which is certainly true. He does write well, but I didn’t find that this book had the eloquence or elegance of the other.The sub-title of this book could read: It’s Really Ok To Eat Dead Animals, Really It Is. Which I realize for most people it is. But eating flesh foods and other foods made from animals such as dairy and eggs is simply what the vast majority of this book’s readers and the population as a whole do; it’s not an unique argument. But, I loved the fungi chapter and the corn section. The chapter on mushrooms I’m sure I enjoyed so much because a close friend of mine has told stories of her rural Indiana upbringing and of the very small morel patch they have on their property. So it was really fun for me to read about the foraging/hunting of the mushrooms, including local morels. (The author lives about 30 minutes drive from me and I recognized many of the locations in the book.) The corn section (about the deliberate infusion of corn products into just about every processed food) made me determined to cut way down on the processed foods that I often eat: the one real way this book changed me, not an insignificant one.A good part of this (apparently beloved) book seemed to me to be the author’s belabored argument that it’s perfectly fine to eat animals. His treatise looked like his attempt to avoid cognitive dissonance (his term although I was already thinking of it like that) so that he could continue to eat in peace as an omnivore, along with about 97% of the U.S. population; being omnivorous is the dominant paradigm. Anyway, his waxing poetic over the glories of killing and eating animals did not sway me. It’s interesting that Pollan continually rebuts his own arguments, but I wasn’t convinced his questioning was as honest as he wanted it to appear, as it seemed to me he already knew the answers he wanted to arrive at about being omnivorous. And I wouldn’t be surprised if he would agree with me about that.Some of his facts and figures were off. When he talks about tens of millions of animals killed for food in the U.S. for instance; actually, the latest figures I’ve read are 11 billion every year, not including fish. Even the call to eat locally, which I usually subscribe to, is not to be so simplified. One contradictory example I can think of (this issue is not addressed in the book) is the consuming of products (chocolate, coffee, dried fruit, nuts) from the distant rainforest, which, in my opinion, is much preferable to continuing to cut down rainforest trees, and which the natives will allow if they can’t make their living from the rainforest in other ways.I know my philosophy is shared by a relative few, but the fast food meals, the description which was intended to highlight the large amounts of corn products in all the foods, while I found that surprising and unfortunate, it was the cow and chicken parts of the meal that disturbed me the most. And, as far as the “idyllic” Polyface Farm, I truly wonder what they could do 100% plant products grown. "
2,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,5,"I liked Michael Pollan's The Omnivore's Dilemma so much that I searched goodreads reviews for reasons not to like it.Let me explain.Whenever a really influential book like this comes out, there's a pretty reliable pattern that follows. There's the newspaper ""toast of the town"" effect, followed by bland and ubiquitous morning TV interviews, and, if you're lucky, an innocuous appearance on Oprah, probably followed by a massive boost in sales. However, there is usually a fairly large group of people absolutely pissed off by the book (or film) because it simplifies or overlooks some crucial matter or matters.I'm aware that Pollan made it all the way to Oprah, and I didn't want to be what some call an ""Oprah sheep,"" but I just couldn't hate The Omnivore's Dilemma no matter how hard I tried.Pollan goes into quite a bit of detail throughout the book, but in a general way, we could say that he examines the American supermarket and notices that it seems to present food in a way that is detached from the production of food, particularly the natural processes on which food production relies. Pollan examines how food is produced and explores three ""food chains"" -- the industrial, the pastoral, and the personal. If food production was a spectrum, then the industrial (monoculture, feedlots, preservatives, processed foods, and international shipping) and the personal (hunter / gatherer) would be at opposing ends. Although Pollan acknowledges that a hunter/ gatherer model is an unrealistic way to feed a country, he points out that it has the benefit of connecting the eater to what we might call the ecology of food. So try to move closer to the personal, ""conscious"" method of eating by finding an alternative food chain.What does this spectrum mean for us? Organic food does not rely on pesticides or antibiotics, but it is closer to industrial than the personal because it's shipped around the world. Buying food from a local farmer moves us closer to personal since we have some idea of where our food comes from. Meat eaters that have actually seen the animal they're eating die -- or how it dies -- are closer to the personal end of the spectrum. Veggie eaters that eat from the supermarket are closer to the industrial. If nothing else, I can say that I never thought of food in quite this way until I'd read this book.In fact, there are a lot of ways that I've never thought about food until I read this book. Pollan clearly has a passion for discussing food and he also has the ability to turn what are often quite obviously contrived experiments into enjoyable reading.I said that I was struggling to find someone that hates The Omnivore's Dilemma, but I wasn't entirely unsuccessful. My wife is sick of hearing me talk about Michael Pollan. So if you hated the book and would like to convince me that it's awful, my wife will surely thank you for your kindness.In the meantime, I thought The Omnivore's Dilemma was fantastic."
3,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33887-imogen,2,"Wow, it seems like a lot of people didn't notice that this kinda sucked! Weird. It read to me like he wrote The Botany of Desire, decided that that framework- a loose structure in which he can just talk alternately interesting and totally self-serving shit for a whole book- and figured he'd give it another go, but this time as his MAGNUM OPUS. And I was pretty into it, for the most part, but in a lot of the parts where he thinks he's being super even-handed, he's actually often being a boring middle-aged white liberal dude with boring tenured college professor politics. I mean, have you read the part in this book where he decides that animals shouldn't be killed, declares himself a vegetarian, gets stressed out, decides that being a vegetarian is stepping on your friends' toes, then says a bunch of total fucking nothing for twenty minutes (I listened to the audiobook- which, by the way, makes this book sound super preachy even if it isn't, because of the narrator's tone of voice) and decides that vegetarianism isn't a viable way of life? Even though, I don't know, something like a million billion people have been living that way for pretty much forever? Just admit it, Mike: you like eating meat, don't want to make the effort to stop, convinced Peter Singer to concede that, sure, if you're going to eat meat, it's better to eat meat that's been ethically raised and slaughtered (aduh), and decided that that settles it: Pete Singer said you don't have to be a vegetarian, so let's just-OH MAN after the vegetarian part- we are about three quarters of the way in at this point- Mike decides that he's going to be a hunter, so he writes two hours (it is a trip for me to listen to a book because I do it so rarely, but I am driving across the country and it is a wide country) of the most florid, masturbatory prose I have ever had the privilege of consuming in any medium. ON and ON and ON and ON about the great natural dance, and how probably when you shoot an animal it releases THC (the active ingredient in marijuana; a cannabanoid, which is a science word!) into your brain, 'cause it sure feels like getting stoned. And the beauty of how time slows down when you look through a rifle sight, and how now he is better than people who hunt in their real lives. Thanks for that, Mike. Also thanks for your total lack of solutions for people who can't afford or don't have access to organically grown local fuckin cows that got to play dress-up whenever they wanted up until Temple Grandin killed them. Actually, thanks for your total lack of solutions to anything (besides 'get your friend to clean the pig you shoot,' SPOILER).It's just... The Botany of Desire was pretty fun! You do better when you tell me about Johnny Appleseed, Michael Pollan, than you do when you try to tell me how to eat. Also I know you did it first but Eating Animals does a better job of explaining about how animals are tortured in american corporate agriculture. The student has become the teacher! O-oh!"
4,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"I love food. I really love food. I believe it is one of the most fascinating cultural facts in our lives. I particularly love food that is taken as meals and then the words that gather about meals – not least that most beautiful word ‘sharing’. Because food is never better than when it is shared as ours. Recently I was delighted to learn the etymology of the word ‘companion’. That has become my favourite way to describe the people I’m fond of. The word comes from Latin and means ‘with bread’ – that is, someone you share bread with. Isn’t that the most beautiful of metaphors?Then again, there is food and then there is food – and this is a book about all of the various types of food available to us in this modern world of ours. It is a book that has made me think about what I eat, how I eat it and to question what can only be called the morality of food. And then it also made me think of the psychology of food and the sociology of food in ways I really didn’t expect.The book reminded me of many other books. It reminded me of Fast Food Nation, but I think I enjoyed this more (which is really saying something). It reminded me of Orion’s Legacy too, and not just because of the hunting stuff towards the end. This guy is so engaging and interesting. And like any good meal there are general themes and flavours but also many tasty asides. This book is structured around four meals. Before bringing us to the table for each of these meals he explains how the food got to the table too. The four meals are related to the various ways food is obtained in our modern world. Naturally, the first is industrial farming and the first meal is a McDonald’s hamburger eaten in a car that is being driven at 60 miles an hour. Did you know that one in five meals eaten in America are eaten in a car? Isn’t that the saddest statistic you have heard today?Recently I’ve been reading books about economics which have turned out to be very much in favour of free market economics. Essentially, they have told the story of how any interference in the operation of free markets is anathema and that the damnation thus brought about by this interference is found in the distortions that invariably cause harm to what they initially sought to protect. The story of corn farming in the USA is a horribly vivid illustration of the effects of the interference in the operation of market forces leading to grotesque distortions which achieve the opposite of this interference’s original intent. Industrial production of corn using fossil fuel fertilisers so that the corn can be either turned into sugar to create rivers of soft drinks or chaff to feed cows in ways nature never intended is more than just morally questionable. The lives of these cows are an unspeakable torture, made no less so by the fact we have short-circuited their lives to a mere 14 months. These animals don’t normally eat corn and the descriptions of their sufferings when they are forced to is both repulsive and infuriating. If you don’t come away from reading this section thinking, “Not in my name” I can only say you are totally lacking in compassion. This is an industry that could hardly make itself less sustainable. It is clear that it needs to be changed, in fact, it needs to be done away with.What I liked most about this book was that it didn’t then say: organic is best, buy organic – which is what I thought was coming. In fact, he spends a lot of time talking about how ‘organic’ food isn’t necessarily ‘environmentally friendly’ food. I am one of those dags (oh, Australian slang – it actually means the shit that gets caught in the wool around a sheep’s arse, but has come to mean someone who is a bit ‘naff’, for my English friends, and ‘dorky’ for my American ones) who buys free-range eggs, not because I think they taste any better (I’m sure they don’t) but because I can’t bring myself to eat eggs from chickens that have been treated so appallingly. When I didn’t think about it, everything was fine – but once I did think about it I would rather pay the extra dollar or two so as to be able to enjoy the eggs and not feel like a Nazi prison guard. Some of what he says here about ‘free range’ chickens is also disturbing and the phrase ‘false advertising’ comes to mind.However, his description of ‘pastoral food’ is a pure delight and possibly worth reading all on its own if you are in a hurry and don’t want to read the whole book. You know, if you are after the fast food version. Sustainable, thoughtful, inspiring – this really is the heart of the ‘lesson’ of this book and was nearly enough to make me want to go off and start a farm. It also contains what is, for me, the saddest line in the book – about the A grade students in the countryside being stolen from the farms and the D grade students being left behind to be exploited by the clever people from Wall Street and to donate lots of money to televangelists. The sad fact is that I found this sad mostly because it confirms so many of my prejudices about those who live in rural areas – it is not hard to see why Marx proposed the mass industrialisation of agriculture. It was the only way he could imagine of dragging these poor souls out of the horrendous world of ignorance and fear that clungs to them like the mud that sticks to their boots.I think many people may feel this book looses its way towards the end – particularly where he goes off to hunt and gather his own food to prepare his final meal. That is what I thought as this part started. At least, until he got into his stride (which, as always, did not take very long). The stuff he has to say about mushrooms, for instance. is utterly fascinating. I had no idea that we know so little about mushrooms. In fact, our ignorance of mushrooms seems quite staggering. Pollan handles those on the ‘lunar’ end of the fungus world (lunar in both the figurative and literal senses of the word) with a deftness and wit that is a pure joy. If you are thinking of picking the eyes out of this book then this section is another must read.There are very few pleasures in life that are more human than preparing a meal for the people you love. At least twice in this book he mentions Freud and sex and suggests that Freud could have better based his ideas on desire for food. I suspect that today we are not nearly as stuffed up about sex as we are about food. I learnt an awful lot from this book and had a really nice time with the author as he taught me these things – he is a very clever man and an engaging writer. If I had lots more time on my hands I would like to write an Australian version of this book, about where our food comes from and the costs of the inputs into producing it. I would also, if I had lots and lots more time, like to spend some time learning how to find field mushrooms and to learn more about what makes these remarkable creatures tick. Did you know that fungi are more closely related to animals than to plants?And the dilemma? Well, actually, there are many, many dilemmas – between industrial and sustainable food, between eating new things and eating what you ‘know’, between conscious eating and wilful blindness. This book didn’t make the writer a vegetarian, and it didn’t make me one either – but I did come away from this book wanting to be more aware of what I eat and what the choices I make when deciding what to eat mean.If you want to learn about the real eating disorder affecting the world – this really is a book for you."
5,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/542342-sara,5,"Man, this book is great. The best book I read last year, easily. Mushrooms, chicken slaughter, sustainability, french fries, soul-searching questions, it's all here. Just read it already. Okay, if that didn't sell you, here's more info, from the review I wrote for my farm community (Stearns Farm, Framingham, MA): The Omnivore’s Dilemma created a lot buzz since its publication in 2006, so you may have read it already. If you haven’t picked it up yet, consider checking it out. At 464 pages, it is definitely on the long side, but it’s an engaging, easy read, and it puts the question “where do we get our food?” front and center in a fascinating way. Its four different sections break up the book nicely (you could read one section a month, for example, if your reading time is limited), and it is also coming out in convenient paperback form next month.In the book, Michael Pollan traces the history and ingredients of four different meals: one from McDonald's, one from Whole Foods market, one from a small farm in Virginia, and one composed of ingredients that he gathered (and killed) on his own. The meal from McDonald’s (about 70% of which is derived from corn) allows him to take a trip down the rabbit-hole into the world of high fructose corn syrup and the massive, genetically-modified mono-farms that produce the majority of corn in this country. The Whole Foods meal is obviously a step up from this, although here Pollan explores the conundrum of eating organically if that means flying peaches in from Chile in December. This section of the book does a fine job explaining that “organic” does not necessarily mean sustainable. Next Pollan spends a week on a farm in Virginia that serves in many ways as an idyllic model for where to get your food. (Hello, Stearns!) Finally, in a section that is as much “adventure series” as it is agricultural critique, Pollan creates a gourmet meal for his friends using only items he gathered himself, including bread made with yeast collected from his backyard and sea salt procured from the Northern California coast on which he lives.Hunting and gathering all of your own food these days may seem unfeasible, especially to create the kind of elaborate feast Pollan does. (Although Stearns provides the opportunity to get much closer to that goal). However, even if you are unable to rustle around in the woods for wild boar or visit a fire-blackened forest to pick morel mushrooms, as Pollan does, you will come away from the book re-energized with the commitment to eat locally and sustainably. Pollan may not have deliberately set out to promote CSAs such as Stearns Farm, but that is a happy side benefit of the work. He also writes sensitively and without a sense of moral superiority—it can feel unusual to read a book on this subject that doesn't make you feel bad about yourself. And yet, the information Pollan presents simply and persuasively will compel you to both thought and action, making The Omnivore’s Dilemma an excellent read and great inspiration for the next time you are out in the pick-your-own beds, gathering food for your family’s dinner.www.outland-ish.comHonest Tales from Overseas"
6,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/535039-laura,2,"He makes some good points but in the end, it smacks of well-off white man over simplifying an incredibly complex issue. What the book has going for it is that it's a best seller, especially to the faux-liberal, over educated set and it's at least making them THINK about where their food is coming from. What I don't like though, is that it lets them off the hook as far as accountability if they just go about buying the RIGHT kind of meat. Well, all of that free range ""humane"" meat goes to the same creepy slaughterhouses that the factory farmed animals go to so really, from an ethical stand point, it's no better. Oh and the USDA Guidelines on what is considered free range are ridiculous, 5 minutes ACCESS to the outdoors a day earns you free range classification. Also, the idea of getting all of your meat from nearby sustainable family farms who do their own slaughter and processing is really great in theory but then won't it become a class issue when only rich people can afford it? Oh but I guess those are the same people reading this book so it's cool. Oh and lots of his numbers were way off...he said we kill millions of animals a year for food in this country, more like BILLIONS. I talked to a guy yesterday who worked in a chicken slaughtering line in a prison way back when and said that he was responsible for personally killing 8,000 birds a day. slicing their necks open. ugh. Oh another positive: I did learn a lot about corn from the book and have pretty much backed away from anything made with it. "
7,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu,5,"After reading books like these, I'm not sure what to eat anymore. Michael Pollan, a sort of food journalist, doesn't always give you the kind of clear-cut answers you'd like if you're reading books like this in order to learn what's healthy for your body and what's not. However, here are two important things I did learn:#1 - Eating only one thing is not good for you in the long run.#2 - Corn is in nearly everything we eat these days.America grows corn. The American government pays for its farmers to grow corn. Corn syrup goes into an alarmingly high percentage of our daily foods. Our farmed-fish and cows subsist on corn. Hell, some of our cars run on corn! CORN!Another issue is the nitrates used to grow all this corn. Because it's less physically demanding, farmers spread chemical nitrates over their fields. To ensure a good crop, they overcompensate. All this excess washes into our water system, contaminating our drinking water and destroying fish habitats. The Gulf of Mexico spreading outward from the Mississippi Delta is fucked. The Omnivore's Dilemma is one of those books I've been hearing about for years. In the past, I've read other Pollan books and they were good, but for some reason I held off on this one. Maybe it was like that character in Lost holding on to a copy of Our Mutual Friend, the only Dickens book he hasn't read. I knew this book would be special. I wanted to wait and savor it. I also knew it would be slightly depressing. I wanted to be ready for it.But it's not all doom and gloom. Pollan is hopeful and allows for the light at the end of the tunnel. He's also willing to try new things like hunting and vegetarianism. He gets his hands dirty and that's what I like to see in my journalists. Fantastic book! Recommended to all!"
8,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44652-patrick-gabridge,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed The Omnivore's Dilemma by Michael Pollan. He's been one of my favorite writers, ever since I read A Place of My Own, some years ago. And I stumble across stories by him in the New York Times Sunday Magazine, often quite by accident, and then look at the byline to see who this talented writer is, and there's Pollan again.The book has the distinct danger of making you annoying to your spouse/partner/children, because you'll be reading along and feel compelled to share a fact about how industrial corn production has wormed its way into nearly every aspect of the American diet. I know my 12-year-old daughter cringes when we go the store, and I inspect the ingredients, calling out, ""Yep, there's corn in this, too.""Pollan is an immensely fun writer, because he enjoys learning about this stuff, and he's skilled at taking the reader along on the journey, not just through the facts, but through feedlots, and chicken slaughtering, and mushroom hunting. He takes a close look at the industrialization of food production (which depends heavily and crazily on corn), large scale organic farming, and then at a sustainable farming operation, and then around a meal that he assembles using his hunting and gathering skills (relying heavily on the skills of others).For our family, this book seems perfectly timed, since we've been making huge dietary changes around here since Halloween, cutting out animal products and most refined and processed foods. We were doing it for health reasons, but this books adds an entirely new level of justification. Not that Pollan is saying you should become a vegan. Not at all. He's saying that we owe it to ourselves to become more conscious about what we actually put in our mouths, and the effects that its creation is having on us, our culture, and our planet.My only disappointment is that in the final wrap-up, he focuses on the extreme distance between the industrialized food he and his family consumes and the meal that he makes through hunting and gathering, without mentioning enough of the sustainable farm that he'd visited. (That section made me want to go out and buy some land and start farming. Tomorrow.) We spent so much time with Pollan through this book, I wanted a stronger sense of whether all this had actually managed to change his day-to-day buying and eating habits. But those are really minor points.(Also, don't miss a terrific essay Pollan wrote for the NY Times in January, Unhappy Meals, about what we really should eat. Really, it's the answer to what was bugging me about the end of his book. It should be included as an addendum to every copy of The Omnivore's Dilemma.)"
9,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6753400-gabrielle,5,"The “national eating disorder” (which, sadly, lumps Canada in with the US of A – because while Canadians don’t quite have the same issues than our neighbors to the south do, it would be preposterous to claim we are not also affected by food-related madness, if only by proximity) Michael Pollan wrote about in this book is something that has always fascinated me. I was raised in a Franco-Italian household, so food and cooking were always big deals; it was not unknown for my mother to laugh right in the face of people who’d even hint that pasta was bad for you. My grandfather once told me that there are two types of people in the world: those who eat to live, and those who live to eat, and that our family belonged in the second category. When I’d visit friends and family in Europe, it was impossible not to notice that they ate stuff that would have made a lot of people at home freak out (Foie gras! Gelato! Bread with everything – even pizza!!), and yet they were generally healthy and happy – as opposed to totally neurotic about calories, fat and exercise. Oh, and the base products they cooked with there tended to be vastly better than the stuff I found at home (it has honestly crossed my mind several times to relocate to France just for the food, and every time I come back from a trip, I grunt at what passes for goat’s cheese here for weeks). Something had definitely gone awry somewhere.I have long theorized that part of this is cultural: something about the Protestant mind frame of North America is simply averse to pleasurable activities for their own sake (eating being a highly pleasurable activity), so I often wonder if that doesn’t trigger a whole slew of neuroses when indulgent food becomes part of the conversation or appears on a table. But there’s obviously more to it than that.Pollan’s goal was to take a close look at the human food chain: where does our food come from, how is it grown, made and how does it end up on our table? He identifies three food chains: industrial, organic and hunter-gatherer, and investigates all three in great depth, from the very beginning of its cycle to the end in order to bring a better understanding and awareness of the long chain we are part of.The chapters on corn were disturbingly fascinating: I knew it was basically everywhere in processed food (in the form of corn syrup or as feed for a lot of animals that end up on butchers’ counters), but it is even more insidious than I had imagined, and I was stunned to learn how its agriculture was so crucial to American history (for better or worse…); it was the perfect prelude to explore American industrial farming – which was even more upsetting than I expected it to be… But it did help me make sense of a lot of things (shamefully, city slickers like myself know and understand very little about the decline of family-run farms). Like, the guy who helped create synthetic fertilizer was also the guy who developed Zyklon B? Lovely. The reason cows, pigs and chickens are given so many antibiotics and other meds is because we are totally fucking their health and life-cycles by feeding them stuff they wouldn’t naturally eat? Gross.It is frustrating to read the section about ""Big Organic"" and to see a demonstration of how products from say Whole Foods, while admittedly better, is not nearly as good an option as we’d like to think. The environmental cost of getting all those veggies to you is still quite brutal. On the other hand, I was very impressed and enthused by all the chapters detailing how Joel Salatin's Polyface Farm functions (though the explanation as to why it's remarkable that Polyface pigs still have their tales was a little traumatic): this eccentric man runs a self-sustaining farm in Virginia, and every detail about it stunned me, from the clever contraptions invented by his father to let the animals graze according to their natural feeding cycles, to the way they distribute their goods locally - all of which is done without fertilizers or weird pharmaceuticals. His agricultural philosophy is probably a bit fringe, as it doesn't fit the industrial model in any way shape or form (too complex and intricate for an industry that's always trying to make things as ""simple"" as possible), but if this book is to be believed, the resulting products speak for themselves in terms of quality.I expected the third part to be a bit boring, but I was surprised by how interesting his ideas about the importance of cuisine and food culture as part of human evolution were, and why the lack of strong culinary traditions in America makes people especially susceptible to weird fad diets (see rant in the first paragraph). Also, mushrooms are really fascinating little weird things, aren't they?It's no secret that Pollan is also pro-meat, which clearly ruffles some feathers. But he is careful to look at both sides of the medal, to make sure readers understand that there are plenty of morally ambiguous issues to wrestle with on both sides. I think with issues like this it is crucial to have a lucid and balanced view of the situation, and I really appreciate that he isn't trying to convert anyone to any specific way of thinking.A rare feat for a non-fiction book: “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” is engrossing! Once picked up, it is difficult to put down, and the information to be found in it is often fascinating (sometimes morbidly so, but what can you do). I also feel a well-researched and engaging book like this can potentially do more to inspire changes in one’s attitude towards their food choices than a bunch of vegans yelling at you about animal cruelty. Pollan is not trying to convince anyone to do anything, but he wants you to be lucid about the farm-to-table process so you can then take this info and make up your mind on your own, and I appreciate that approach a lot.The growing subculture of urban farming and gardening, local-vores and people being more mindful of the impacts of their dietary and purchasing choices is fantastic, but it seems a bit unrealistic to expect that it is enough to break the monopoly of corn and soybeans. Supermarkets can’t all deal with small and local growers if they want to stay in business, and not everyone can make the trek to the nearest sustainable farm every week (though after reading this, I am investigating options for getting weekly local farm baskets delivered to my home). There is clearly no quick fix to this clusterfuck at the moment. Perhaps the best thing to do is to change habits little bit by little bit: I’d like to think that voting with our wallets will eventually chip away at the system, but that might be my (inexplicably stubborn) optimistic streak speaking.(An economic angle that is not touched on at all is that some people simply can’t afford anything else than the corn-laden stuff that big food corps want to shove down their throats: while I’m sure some people could make more of an effort, others literally can’t, and as long as they can’t make ends meet, it might not be possible to convince them to renounce the 1$ burger deals… But that’s outside of Mr. Pollan’s scope, I’m afraid.)Obviously, I loved this book and it gave me a lot to think about - but to be honest, Pollan was preaching to the choir with me a little bit: I happen to love cooking, I make most of my meals from scratch (which has had the unfortunate side effect that I often get disappointed by restaurant food, which I feel I could have improved on had I made it at home) and I pay close attention to the ingredients I buy; this removes a lot of the worst processed stuff from my equation, but not everyone has the patience or inclination to do that – and big food corps know and exploit that as much as they can... If you care about what you eat, this is a very interesting, if somewhat depressing book that I recommend to everyone (if you aren’t going to read it, then at least try to buy free-range eggs when you have the option). I wish I had read it years ago."
10,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1711431-eric-w,4,"Update 5/23/2010 Terrific piece by Michael Pollan in the NYRB June 10, 2010, ""The Food Movement, Rising"" in which he reviews five books: Everything I Want to Do Is Illegal, Terra Madre: Forging a New Global Network of Sustainable Food Communities, All You Can Eat: How Hungry is America?, The Taste for Civilization: Food, Politics, and Civil Society, Eating AnimalsI am beginning to wallow and bask in the mire of food politics, subject of Pollan's piece. It's interesting to read the comments section after any article dealing with meat or vegetarianism. One can almost see the participants spitting on each other. It's like watching Mormon fundamentalists defend polygamy to the College of Cardinals. To quote Troy Duster (from Pollan's piece) ""No movement is as coherent and integrated as it seems from afar, and no movement is as incoherent and fractured as it seems from up close."" And as we learned from OD, food is all politics from the huge changes initiated by the Nixon administration to bring down the price of food to Michelle Obama's efforts to change the way kids eat. As long as there is government to promote the interests of one group or another, there will be these kinds of battles, but I doubt any of us would wish the total absence of regulation desired by Joel Salatin - except maybe Rand Paul.It's an interesting communitarian movement, perhaps a throwback to the sixties, but one that appeals to both right and left: the desire to localize and remove oneself from the larger society. That is largely what I meant when I referred elsewhere to Pollan's book as a Libertarian Manifesto. In his 2006 book Crunchy Cons: How Birkenstocked Burkeans, gun-loving organic gardeners, evangelical free-range farmers, hip homeschooling mamas, right-wing nature lovers, ... America, Rod Dreher identifies a strain of libertarian conservatism, often evangelical, that regards fast food as anathema to family values, and has seized on local food as a kind of culinary counterpart to home schooling.Major editing 5/23/2010 about half the content identical to my review of Foer's Eating Animals.minor editing 4/16/10Let's see, things we can't or shouldn't eat: butter, steak, meat, spinach because of the salmonella (or maybe it's only the organic spinach that gets contaminated), apples because of the alar, salt, sugar, fat, any food not bought at a farmer's market, any food bought at a non-union grocery, any food bought at a chain, any food that's not organic, any food that's labeled organic by the USDA because their standards aren't strict enough, kosher food, non-kosher, non-grass fed beef (and now we've learned that grass-fed beef is salmonella contaminated, too -http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12...,) pasteurized milk, raw milk, etc. etc), This issue seems to engender as much animosity as whether communion should be allowed to non-Catholics. Factions abound, each with a slightly different take on the issue: those who believe eating meat is immoral; those who believe eating meat from factory farms is immoral; those who believe eating meat is immoral because it's environmentally unsound; those who believe eating meat is bad for your health; those who believe eating meat is fine; those who believe eating some kinds of meat is fine; those who believe eating meat is immoral because animals are sentient beings; and those who think the issue is cultural rather than moral or environmental. How to reconcile these views and where does each of the authors take a stance. All of these views represent a moral position, i.e. a personal one in which the believer needs to persuade others of the necessity of adopting his view to the exclusion of the others and convince that not to do so will result in calamity. Up front we have to recognize that only people who have tons of food available, i.e., the rich, would even consider any of the positions. Let me state my biases up front. I am very skeptical of any argument that proposes calamity will result if a particular position is not adopted. I am skeptical of moral arguments (not ethical ones). I believe that the most difficult decisions require choosing between grays, not black and white; that sentience as we understand it requires some form of self-awareness and we have little way to judge that in beings that we don't understand (can't communicate with) and that sentience varies tremendously across species, indeed across individuals within that species; and that pain as we understand it may be very different across animals and plants with structures. (David Foster Wallace in ""Consider the Lobster"" discusses scientific evidence that lobsters, because of their structure, may in fact feel a state of euphoria when being boiled rather than pain as we understand it.)I worked on two dairy farms for several years, milking about 120 cows, both in stanchions and and parlors, dehorning calves, and shoveling shit. Contrary to Foer's claims, cows are not treated regularly with antibiotics. A test tube of milk coming out of the farmer's tank is pulled before loading on the truck, and this is tested at the plant before being mixed with the rest, and if any suspicion of antibiotic is found, the entire load is dumped and the farmer loses the value of the entire load. We were meticulous about dumping milk from any treated cow (usually for mastitis) for the required period before selling it. Those who think drinking raw milk is the answer are asking for trouble. We did, but that was probably stupid. Besides that I saw what was in the strainer sometimes. None of that milk is tested and come on folks, there's a good reason why we started pasteurizing milk. It saved a lot of lives. I don't have any experience with feedlots, but I do know that stress on animals is to be avoided at all costs as it slows the rate of growth, cuts profits, and leads to disease. It's impossible to discuss these books in a vacuum, and I need to start out by making clear several assumptions: 1. Humans are omnivores biologically and, in fact, only very recently (say about 10,000 years ago) began to farm grains for food. Before that we were hunter/gatherers relying primarily on meat and berries.2. Everything is interconnected. Just not eating meat will not even begin to address the issues of environmental degradation. Computers, roads, cars, pets, travel, ipods, plastics, toilet paper, etc., all have their downsides. If Foer and Pollan and Berry et all choose to emphasis one aspect of life and deliver broadsides against that particular activity that's fine as long as we understand that limiting that activity will have a minuscule effect on the environment. More effect would be had if all the hand-wringers stopped flying about the country wasting fuel and polluting the environment, just staying put. Problem is that apocalyptic thinking and lecturing is very profitable.3. Environmental activism is very much a white, rich, western game. People who have no money and who live a hand-to-mouth existence can't afford to choose. The best way to promote conscious environmental action is by raising living standards around the world. It also reduces the rate of population growth.4. My very strong bias is that the only practical solution to the myriad number of problems is technological. Some examples: algae oil is already being used successfully mixed with Jet-A by Continental Airlines and the results are a reduction in carbon-footprint of 60-80% and fuel efficiency of 1-2%; production of methane gas as an energy source (very clean burning) from large factory-farms, something not possible if the animals are parsed out in smaller farms where runoff occurs in large quantities, etc., etc. 5. We quite naturally tend to read and find books and data that support a preconceived opinion and avoid those that present an opposing view.6. My other bias is that I'm very sympathetic to vegetarianism, not veganism, for I love my bread and butter and cheese way too much. I milked cows for several years, churned my own butter and would gladly have turned several fresh heifers into instant hamburger had I been able to after wiping their manure off my face. (If you've ever milked cows you know exactly what I'm talking about.)NB: I have a problem with beliefs that are so strongly held that believers think they have to claim apocalypse will result if their beliefs aren't adopted by everyone. The Inuit diet consisted of meat alone and meat taken from what is clearly a sentient animal. To suggest they adopt a western, citified, cereal diet is wrong and ridiculous. This is why one of my heroes is Norman Borlaug who virtually single-handedly began the green revolution that increased wheat yields spectacularly (http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/pe...). He DID something, unlike the Paul Ehrlichs who just ran around making a fortune proclaiming the sky is falling. ALL of Ehrlich's predictions have been wrong because of people like Borlaug.  I find the definition of what constitutes sentience to be worse than muddled and mixing up moral issues with that and environmental concerns makes the issues even murkier. There are clearly differences in ""sentienceness"" from one species to another (no one would argue that a snail has the same level of consciousness as a dog) and whether that should play any part in deciding what to eat or not makes an interesting debate. Personally, I wish the discussion would leave the realm of ""morality"" with its concomitant religious overtones and focus on the more rational (IMHO) environmental concerns.I very much enjoyed Pollan, much to my surprise. (I actually listened to this and while Scott Brick is one of my favorite readers, he was all wrong for this book. Way too pedantic sounding.) A very interesting book with tons of detail (which I like) displaying the symbiotic relationship we have with corn and fossil fuels, a very destructive relationship, but one that nevertheless has allowed us to feed many, many more people than would have been possible otherwise. Ultimately, something will have to change, we cannot continue to use 1.5 calories of energy to produce 1 calorie of food. Pollan emphasizes the mono-culture of corn but the same problems exist with the banana and other crops. In order to ship food to where it's needed requires products that mature at the same time, don't bruise easily, etc. He also shows that virtually all the food we eat has been genetically modified, if not at the gene level, certainly through seed selection, chosen for productivity , disease resistance, and a variety of other qualities.I learned that in order to increase yields the nitrogen that was added was in the form of ammonium nitrate which existed as a surplus after world war two, no longer needed for explosives. That nitrogen leaches off the ground, into wells, (blue baby syndrome, too much nitrogen cause respiratory issues,) and into the water supply in other ways. (As an aside, no one around here uses much of that, preferring anhydrous ammonia injection directly into the soil with presumably much less runoff.)I do have some issues with his very limited perspective on industrial farming, which he never defines, by the way. My neighbors, family farms all, farm thousands of acres. At what point does the size become optimum? Families run feedlots, too. My veterinarian has 40 steers in a feedlot. Is that a factory farm? They have the same conditions, the same feed, etc., as the larger feedlot a few miles away. It's almost as if Pollan had decided that farming on a grand scale was apocalyptic and then pulled together data to support his view. His data with regard to corn prices are woefully out of date. Just check commodity prices over the last five years. His choice of George Naylor must have required considerable searching in order to find someone who thought just the way he did. The history of price supports and the switch under the Nixon administration from a ""loan"" program to direct payments was something I had completely forgotten and had no idea how much influence it would have on corn production. On the other hand, Butz's intent was to increase production to take the heat off Nixon following the huge increase in food prices as the price for corn had increased so dramatically. All that being said, there's a lot of useful information, particularly with regard to government policy, and lots of fuel to support the libertarian side of the equation. There is no question that our over reliance on fossil fuels will get us into serious trouble very soon.A final comment. All of the recent food books could only have been written by a society that doesn't have to worry about where its next meal is coming from.The problem we have is scale. Wrigley just changed their gum wrappers from the little foil wrap to paper and thereby saved the equivalent of 60 million cans of aluminum. There's the problem in a nutshellFun trivia: the corn plant has 32,000 genes, more than humans. Astonishing. (Knowledge Magazine Mr/Apr 2010)"
11,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22699228-matthew-quann,5,"The Omnivore's Dilemma is definitely worth your thyme!Have you ever thought about where that burger came from? How about the diet of your store-bought salmon? Are you just tired about hearing about the exhaustive origins of your food at every fancy restaurant?Do you wish your hipster friends would stop trying to get you to forage for mushrooms?Then I've got the book for you!I'd been taking down the audiobook of Pollan's The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals intermittently for months. It first started as a companion on a road trip, but gave way to the book I occasionally put on as I was doing some housework. At first, I found it a bit dull and slow-moving, due in no small part to Scott Brick's slow, laborious narration of the book. But as soon as I ticked up the narration speed to 1.5x, I couldn't stop finding excuses to put on my headphones and listen to this superb treatise on food. This book is about humankind's relationship to food, the environment, and our own personal health. Earlier this year, I reviewed  The Dorito Effect by Mark Shatzker, and while both books deal with food, Pollan's book is more concerned with ecology than taste and flavour. Though, it should be noted, that there are plenty of delicious sounding food descriptions littering the 16-hour listening experience. Four MealsThe premise of Pollan's book is based around four meals: fast-food, industrial farm, self-sustaining organic farm, and one meal hunted, foraged, and prepared by Pollan himself. Using this intuitive structure, Pollan is able to progress from least enjoyable and viable to the most rewarding and delicious of his meals. It also works because Pollan digs deep into the thoughts, historical events, and effects on the larger world that have shaped our industrial food chain. Though I like to think I know a lot about food and how the human body converts that food into energy, this book made me realize how little I know about the tumultuous transition between captured solar energy and the slab of meat on my plate. Even if, when Pollan really digs into the ubiquity of corn in North American foods, I couldn't help but thinking of  this clip. I won't attempt to condense Pollan's ideas into this simple review, but I will say that it helped me to think more fully about the meal from its origins to my plate. I'll admit that I've often been semi-interested to hear the stories and origins of my food in restaurants, but I now have a deep respect for what those restaurants are trying to accomplish. It makes more sense after listening to this book that you'd want to eat foods that are in season. Knowing where one's food comes from is an attempt to connect to that lost part of our evolutionary history, when eating meant that one had to discover, collect, and process a meal by their own hands. I don't mind saying that this book makes me want to convert my backyard into farmland and that I began actively looking for opportunities to fish, hunt, and forage locally. Pollan makes convincing arguments, but is also an infinitely likeable guy. Pollan rarely preaches and he admits to enjoying the convenience that industrial foods provide. That Pollan is more of an everyman makes the listening experience more enjoyable, relatable, and helped me feel as if I could make some changes to my diet that would be more sustainable. Books about food aren't for everyone, but this one makes a case for being one everyone should read or, as in my case, listen to. Indeed, though I love to read fiction, nonfiction seems to work best for me in audio format. Though the book is a tad older (originally published in 2006), it is highly relevant today when many of us have to decide between the slightly pricier local vegetables and the more affordable industrial greens. For the duration of my reading it made me a more conscious eater, and I have to say that I learned a lot more than expected! Be sure to check this one out!"
12,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52545435-elle-ellexamines,4,"remember when this book, written by a proud meat-eater, accidentally made me a vegetarian?Okay, but seriously, I'd recommend giving this a read. Give the teen version a read if you really can't take a 450-page nonfiction book. Either way, I think everyone needs to know exactly how the food industry works. And no, it's not advocating for you to become a vegetarian - it's simply showing truths. The lack of attempt to guilt readership is honestly what stands out about this book. By showing reality without pushing an opinion on what the proper solution is, Pollan manages to be especially convincing. I truly think this book is worth the read."
13,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1662632-richard,5,"Update: The Wilson Quarterly provides a very nice slideshow of Polyface Farm, in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, which plays a key role in Pollan's examination of sustainable agriculture.            •                 •                 •                 •                 •I thought when I started this book that a review would be superfluous—after all, it was published many years ago and has been reviewed thousands of times. But the material is provocative, and some reviews on this and similar books induce yet more thinking.There’s certainly a lot to talk about when it comes to food. I suppose that has always been the case, but two relatively new topics have shoved their way onto the bestsellers list. Well, perhaps “two” is too limited, but it's a good if arbitrary start.First, the health angle. There are quite a few books exploring how and why today’s food is so bad for us. Here the general idea is to examine how what-we-eat isn’t quite what-we-should-be-eating. This discussion goes in two directions: backwards, into our evolutionary development, to ask why is it we so enjoy food that isn’t good for us; and currently, looking at our consumer “preferences”: why is it our national (and, increasingly, global) diet is even less healthy than even our natural inclinations have historically made it?The other hot topic examines the many ways in which feeding the human race has become very bad for the planet and its inhabitants, especially those we eat. Again, this can be split many ways: how simply feeding so many billions of humans taxes the planet’s resources and health; how the diets of the developed world exaggerate that effect; and how the industrial food production system further exacerbates the problem.Threaded through both of these is the ethical problem: what should an enlightened human being be eating, anyway? And if that diet includes meat, how should we treat our meat?Michael Pollan’s The Omnivore’s Dilemma certainly fits within the scope of all of the above, but isn’t really central to any of them. In an important sense, Pollan has written a very different book, one that very gently deals with a deeper problem. One of his few failings is that he doesn’t make this distinction evident enough: most readers will notice the similarities to the avalanche of other food-reform books, and not the differences.After all, Pollan does investigate the factory farm system, and its horrors are quite evident. And he shows that even “organic” farming can be captured and compromised by the industrial paradigm.But the title of Pollan’s book hints at the difference: he isn’t delivering a polemic or jeremiad; he is troubled at how the original dilemma faced by everyone has changed and sharpened in our modern world. Carnivores and herbivores don’t have any options regarding what they eat. Our dilemma, in a nutshell, is that unlike many other creatures, we are forced to choose what to eat and what not to eat. We have the advantage over other omnivores that our decision can be informed by culture and education; but we also have the burden that our decision has ethical and cultural consequences.Pollan divides his book into three meals.The first is how the industrial “food system” gathers raw materials and manipulates them into “products”, such as a typical McDonald’s Value Meal, or a Weight Watcher’s frozen dinner. Corn, it turns out, plays an astonishingly larger role in this process than one might expect; so much that even a meal that notionally contains no corn might still actually draw the vast majority of its original caloric energy from that heavily domesticated tropical grass. He illuminates the effects of such a factory system on the welfare of cattle, for example, or political and economic distortions induced, or the amount of petroleum required, but he doesn’t come across as preaching — just informing.(My favorite tidbit from this section was a reminder of the astonishing way corn becomes the source of so many of those other ingredients in processed food: “Natural raspberry flavor” doesn’t mean the flavor came from a raspberry; it may well have been derived from corn, just not from something synthetic. Only a tiny number of additives are actually derived from petroleum—so far...)The second meal is derived from a small farm that depends, as far as can be managed, solely on solar energy via plants. Specifically, grass plays the central and foundational role in an integrated and carefully orchestrated ecosystem of farm animals. Every “output” is transformed into an “input” elsewhere; cow manure left in a field, for instance, becomes the growth medium for insect larvae (yeah, fly maggots) that are eaten by chickens, whose droppings then become fertilizer for yet more grass.The bucolic atmosphere and almost complete lack of industrial inputs makes us consider this form of pastoral farming pre-modern, but the ecological management is so information-intensive that it is also post-industrial. This is clearly an approach that is better for people, for animals, and for the environment... but had its own share of problems. This kind of farm is called a “Management-Intensive Grazing” operation, and the orchestration is almost overwhelming, and requires such a high degree of daily commitment that it is difficult to imagine this becoming more than a niche player in the globe’s food production. Furthermore, getting the food to consumers is another task that has found no easy solutions. Direct farm-to-consumer connections can be found in some areas, but not many. Farmers markets, CSA and the like are exciting developments, but don’t easily scale up to support large and widely distributed populations.The final meal described is definitely pre-modern; in fact it is an attempt to recapture a pre-industrial mode of eating. Pollan did his best to personal gather all of the ingredients for a meal, including gathering wild mushrooms, harvesting produce and fruit, and hunting wild boar. That last effort brought the omnivore’s dilemma back to the fore again, as he struggled to consciously reconcile his meat eating with his liberal culture and modern critiques of the ethical treatment of animals. He reluctantly abstained from eating meat while he dealt with this, even going so far as to discuss the issue via email with Peter Singer, the contemporary philosopher most associated with animal rights and veganism. In the end, he concluded “What’s wrong with eating animals is the practice, not the principle.”In examining the vegan choice, he points out that even there the practice can get in the way of the principle. Harvesting grain — even organic wheat — is typically done with a combine: a large machine that will frequently shred field mice and other small critters that get in the way. Modern agriculture is problematic for everyone, not just liberal omnivores.Pollan never solves the dilemma for us. None of these three approaches will solve the problems we face in our attempt to both feed billions of people and keep the planet and our consciences happy. What differentiates The Omnivore’s Dilemma is how Pollan personalizes the problem. We can eat better—we almost can not eat worse—and we must eat better. But our personal choices create our food culture, and none of these choices are simple. Unfortunately, almost all of us prefer to avert our gaze and let “the market” decide for us."
14,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14773738-julie,5,"I am a little late to the table with Michael Pollan's The Omnivore's Dilemma but it is just as relevant now, if not more so, than when it was first published in 2006. The work deserves a permanent place on everybody's bookshelf.Having been raised on a steady diet of good food as well as Diet For A Small Planet, (the original) Mother Earth News and Harrowsmith I felt confident that I was aware of the pitfalls of modern food production. But, as aware as I was, and as informed as I try to stay, my knowledge falls far short of the realities of the industrial food chain; my knowledge also benefited from an eye-wash when it came to the ""organic"" food industry -- industry being the operative word. If I had only sensed, before, that we were being ambushed by food producers, Pollan re-affirmed my belief that one has to go a step beyond due diligence in seeking out food that is both good for us, and for the planet.I had not quite understood how an innocuous little grain like corn might well be one of the largest contributing factors to the end of civilization. Pollan doesn't express it in those terms specifically, but there is enough fact and implication about the uses and abuses of corn, that one can only draw such an inauspicious end to us all. Corn has infiltrated 95% of our consumptive needs [irony implied]-- from the breakfast cereal that we sprinkle in our bowls in the morning to the gas tanks that we fill at night, just before heading back to the 'burbs. It is prolific in the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the bags into which we stuff our garbage, the shoes in which we walk away, in our smugness to think we're somehow ahead of the industrial food game when we make ""organic"" choices. ""Corn's triumph is the direct result of its overproduction, and that has been a disaster for the people who grow it. Growing corn and nothing but corn has also exacted a toll on the farmer's soil, the quality of the local water and the overall health of the community, the biodiversity of his landscape, and the health of all the creatures living on or downstream from it. And not only those creatures, for cheap corn has also changed, and much for the worse, the lives of several billion food animals, animals that would not be living on factory farms if not for the ocean of corn on which these animal cities float. ... It's a good thing this plant can't form an impression of us, for how risible that impression would be: The farmers going broke cultivating it; the countless other species routed or emiserated by it; the humans eating and drinking it as fast as they can, some of them -- like me and my family -- in automobiles engineered to drink it, too."" We have not domesticated corn; it has domesticated us. The Day of the Triffids comes to mind in a not-so-ironic farce.Pollan ploughs through the organic food industry just as deftly as he analyzes industrial farming. We are not as organic as we think when it costs more in energy and fuel to grow our contaminant-free lettuce. The lettuce itself may be relatively free from chemical additives, but everything else around it, sacrificed to its production, is a little worse for it, including ourselves because we bought into the lie in the first place.With all the doom and gloom hovering just above our dinner plates, it leaves one to wonder what could possibly be left to eat. Pollan's thesis on the sustainable farms is a brilliant dissertation on what can be -- and should be -- possible to reclaim the true title of ""sustainability"" within our food culture. Ironically, this new, sustainable farm bears a striking resemblance to the old family farm, where everything that was eaten was grown or raised on the premises, and the rest was carefully sourced out. The irony is not lost on Pollan who has brought us full circle in our quest for a pure, unadulterated lettuce salad. By no means does Pollan suggest we should all be gathering our pitchforks, hitching up our suspenders and heading out to the back 40 with a bale of hay to feed our ethically raised cattle; but he does give us the information on how to source out good food that is truly what it purports to be, and not just the over-processed pabulum pumped out by the giant food purveyors on either side of the ""organic question"".To add balance, restore a certain light-hearted equanimity, Pollan undertakes a hunting-and-gathering project in an effort to evaluate and assess what it means to be one-hundred-percent responsible for our meal, from the stalking, killing and preparation of an animal, to the gathering of fruits and nuts, a la paleo. Even this food-choice becomes its own dilemma.The brilliant synthesis of our omnivore's dilemma in this book is by no means reductive. It offers a choice, a balance, irony, humour -- and even a solution. What more could one ask for in our search to clean our plates, our consciousness, and our consciences."

He touts folk wisdom.I saw him at a book reading and asked him why he is critical of science. He said the science is too easy to abuse, so it should just be ignored.This is horrible advice. Ignorance doesn't solve anything.It leaves people vulnerable to those who would mislead and deceive them."
16,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,4,"(3.5) I made the mistake of reading this a decade after its publication, which means I already knew most of its facts about industrialized farming and the insidiousness of processed foods, especially high-fructose corn syrup. I found Part I to be overly detailed and one-note, constantly harping on about corn. The book gets better as it goes on, though, with Pollan doing field research at Joel Salatin’s Polyface Farm in Virginia to compare large-scale organic agriculture with more sustainable grassroots operations. As Salatin puts it, “You can buy honestly priced food or you can buy irresponsibly priced food.” A McDonald’s meal may be cheaper than an organic/local one, but that price tag doesn’t take into account the environmental toll of cheap beef and corn.Pollan’s assessment of the ethics of eating meat is not quite as thorough as Jonathan Safran Foer’s (in Eating Animals), but he does a good job of showing all sides of the issue, and is honest about his own difficulty in killing for food – a chicken at Polyface, and a wild pig he shot in the forests of California to produce a mostly foraged local feast. My favorite section of the book was about foraging for this final, “perfect” meal. He captures how I’ve always felt about foraging: “this felt more like something for nothing, a wondrous and unaccountable gift.”This would make an excellent, comprehensive introduction to where food comes from for people who have never given it much thought. But then again, the people who need it most would probably never pick up a dense 400+-page book by a liberal journalist."

In the book, Pollan asks the seemingly straightforward question of what we should have for dinner. As omnivores, the most unselective eaters, humans are faced with a wide variety of food choices, resulting in a dilemma. Pollan suggests that, prior to modern food preservation and transportation technologies, this particular dilemma was resolved primarily through cultural influences.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز سی و یکم ماه اکتبر سال 2017 میلادیعنوان: معضل جانور همه‌چیزخوار؛ نویسنده: مارک پولان‏‫ (پولن)؛ مترجم: آرش حسینیان؛ مشهد: نشر تلنگر، ‏‫1395؛ در یک جلد؛ ‬‬ شابک: 9786009660230؛ موضوع: اولویتهای غذایی از نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 21 مدر این کتاب، «پولان» سرراست به سراغِ این پرسش می‌روند، که ما چه چیزی باید بخوریم. انسان (همانند سایر همه‌ چیز خواران) به عنوان یک همه‌ چیز خوار، که عمدتاً گزینشی موادِ غذایی را مصرف نمی‌کند، با طیف گسترده‌ ای از گزینشهای غذایی روبروست، و همین امکان گزینش است، که تصمیم گیری را برای او تبدیل به یک معضل می‌کند. «پولان» نشان می‌دهد، که پیش از به میدان آمدنِ فناوری‌های امروزیِ نگهداری و تبدیل غذا، این مشکل تا حد بسیاری - عمدتاً از راه نفوذ فرهنگی - حل شده بود. اما فناوری‌های مدرن، از راه در دسترس قرار دادنِ غذاهایی که تا پیش از این، محدود به فصل یا منطقه ی معینی بود، رابطه ی بین مواد غذایی و جامعه، که زمانی توسط فرهنگ تنظیم می‌شد، اکنون دچار سردرگمی ست. برای یادگیریِ بیشتر در موردِ این گزینشها، «پولان» به پیگیری هر یک از زنجیره‌ های غذایی می‌پردازند، که ما را زنده نگاه داشته است: غذای صنعتی، غذای ارگانیگ، و غذایی که برای خود گردآوری می‌کنیم. «پولان» این داستان را از آغازِ فرآوری این مواد غذایی، تا محصولِ نهایی دنبال می‌کند، و در این بین نقدی نیز از شیوهٔ تغذیه ی آمریکایی به دست می‌دهد. نقل نمونه متن از کتاب: «همانند اکثر دیگر موجودات خون‌گرم، انسان طوری تکامل یافته تا مواد غذایی پر انرژی را ترجیح دهد، این موضوع در علاقه‌ ی ما به چیزهای شیرین قابل مشاهده است و اکثر پستانداران نیز در این ویژگی با ما مشترکند. ما تکامل یافته‌ ایم تا مزه‌ ی قند و چربی (هم از نظر بافت و هم از نظر مزه) را ترجیح دهیم زیرا قندها و چربی‌ها دارای بیشترین انرژی در ازای هر لقمه هستند. اما نکته اینجاست که در طبیعت- یعنی در مواد غذایی کامل- ما به ندرت با این حجم از قند و چربی که امروز در غذاهای فرآوری‌شده چپانده می‌شود رویارو می‌شویم: شما در هیچ‌ کجا میوه‌ ای پیدا نمی‌کنید که به اندازه‌ ی نوشابه فروکتوز داشته باشد، یا تکه‌ گوشتی از یک حیوان که به اندازه‌ ی یک ناگت مرغ چربی داشته باشد.» حالا می‌توان فهمید چرا مواد غذایی فرآوری‌ شده قادر است به این خوبی مردم را به خوردن مقدار هرچه بیشتر ترغیب کنند. «..تحقیقات انجام‌ شده بر روی جانوران این موضوع را به خوبی نشان داده است: وقتی به موش‌های صحرایی محلول‌هایی از ساکروز(شکر) خالص یا چربی خالصِ خوک ارائه می‌شد- یعنی چیزهایی که به ندرت در طبیعت به این شکل یافت می‌شوند – آن‌ها آنقدر به خوردن ادامه می‌دادند که بیمار می‌شدند…» حال انسان را در برابر فست‌ فودهای فراوان تصور کنید: «…شاید فکر کنید مردم به محض اینکه احساس سیری می‌کردند دست از خوردن و نوشیدن این وعده‌ های غذایی غول‌آسا می‌کشیدند. اما معلوم شد گرسنگی به این شکل عمل نمی‌کند. محققان نشان داده‌ اند آدم‌ها و حیوانات زمانی که با وعده‌ های بزرگ غذایی روبرو می‌شوند تا سی درصد بیشتر از مواقع دیگر غذا میخورند از قرار معلوم، اشتهای انسان به شکل تعجب‌ برانگیزی انعطاف پذیر است، و این موضوع از نظر تکاملی به خوبی قابل‌ فهم است: زیرا این برای نیاکان شکارچی-گردآورنده‌ ی ما واجب بوده تا هرجا که امکانش فراهم می‌آمده زیاد بخورند و به این شکل، برای مواجهه با قحطی‌های آینده مقداری انرژی در قالب چربی ذخیره کنند…»؛‬ پایان نقل. ا. شربیانی"
18,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188508-rashaan,3,"A wise man recently told me, ""Capitalism is here to stay."" With that in mind, Michael Pollan's The Omnivore's Dilemma is a feel good guide to consumerism at its most sustainable, organic, locally grown, and ultimately high-end. Yes, this is an eye-opening read that will, at first, make you want to stop eating all together then compel you to grab a sturdy pair of boots you can kick around in, throw on some clothes that will certainly get dirty, if not bloody, and step into the splendors of the natural world. Pollan leads us on an epicurean journey that most of us could take only through the guiles of his literary skills and a comfortable armchair. We dredge through the horrors of industrial farming, contemplate over the simplicity of small, sustainable growers, and track through the forests of Northern California hunting wild boar and foraging for chanterelles. What we discover on his trek for the ""Perfect Meal"" is no real surprise to anyone who pays attention to the news. Americans are squeezed tightly between the behemoth corporate Charybdis that's killing us with corn-fed livestock and wreaking havoc across the country, spilling into our oceans. Then there's Scylla to our left, the over-priced, just beyond our reach, pure and golden harvest of sustainable, organic, locally grown food. However, unless you live in Northern California--and Pollan does!-- or one of the few corners of the U.S. where you can easily access this food on a weekly basis without the guilt of carbon footprints, or have the property to grow for yourself--ahem! subprime mortgage crisis, you'll just have to imagine the good life and take Pollan's word for it. Pollan seems to willfully neglect the chasm between the haves (those who can waltz into Chez Panisse, meet with Alice Waters, and enjoy fresh goat cheese and endive) and the vast amount of have-nots, who demand and therefore fuel our fast food nation. In one chapter Pollan indulges in the quintessential American family experience of ordering 2 Big Macs, super-sized fries, and a Happy Meal. He queasily downs the over-processed, cholesterol clogging feed with his family in the comfort and convenience of his convertible car. What he fails to recognize is that people do this not necessarily because its fun, but if we're treated as ""Human Resources"" we will act like Human Resources. Just pull onto your nearby freeway, and you'll see for yourself. It's not hard to spot any nameless driver passing by, cheeseburger or breakfast burrito in one hand, steering wheel in the other. For most people, eating is not a ritual to be shared with the family and support local businesses. Eating is simply re-fueling; something workers or resources do on their way to or from work. Expressways as feedlots is by no means acceptable, but it is the state of our society, or at least a stratum and economic phenomenon that Pollan has decidedly left out. Pollan means well and we certainly can't go on eating the same food in the same way. Lest we keep pumping money into a health and food system, which in turn pumps our television with commercials that in one minute entice us with grease-laden, over-processed meat to clog our hearts and arteries. Then the next minute another commercial urges us to get hooked on Lipitor or Lopressor, which we probably wouldn't need if we hadn't eaten those cheeseburgers in the first place. We also can't ignore that the cost of our appetites is speedily deteriorating the Elysian fields that made us a First World Super power. Capitalism is here to stay, and consumers need to be informed--should be informed, about what we put in our bodies and how we feed our children. We need to start paying the real cost of food up front instead of getting hit with the hidden costs through doctor's bills and E Coli recalls. Still, Pollan's feast is difficult to swallow, much less nearly impossible to sit down to and really enjoy because he has an expense account and two years to scour the East and West Coasts for his meal. The Omnivore's Dilemma is perilous indeed. But I can't help wonder who exactly is this omnivore that Pollan's referring to? Poring over his book, I learn his omnivore has time to hunt for morels, knows how to make a souffle, and has two weeks to spare to arrange a dinner party for twelve guests among the bountiful gardens of Berkeley, California. Pollan's omnivore's dilemma comes down to what to eat and how to eat it when you have the time and means to contemplate. That's all very well and good, but the rest of us ""omnivores"" are still over-worked, under-nourished, and starving."
19,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1604742-dara,2,"I had an idea of where this book was headed before I even read it--eat organic, local produce, and choose grass-fed meat over factory farm meat. I knew from a quote in Eating Animals that Pollan eventually dismisses vegetarianism as a decision not grounded in reality. What I didn't expect was for him to reach that conclusion so quickly and without so much as visiting a slaughterhouse.Instead he visits Polyface farms, slaughters a few chickens in a manner far more humane than the fate met by the chickens sold in the supermarkets. He then hunts a wild pig, and feels good about eating meat again. His hunting expedition takes up far bigger chunk of the book than the measly slim chapter on the ethics of eating animals. The problem I have with this is that his two experiences do not represent meat consumption as the majority of Americans know it today: it does not come from farms as sustainable as Polyface farms--and even such a farm currently operates below its own ideals since it is not allowed to slaughter any of its own animals except chickens--nor is it a product of ""respectful"" hunting.* With the latter, Pollan admits that it is not feasible to hunt for our food anyway because there are too many of ""us"" and too few of ""them""--wild animals. This book should be titled Michael Pollan's Dilemma since it does little to address ""The Omnivore's Dilemma"" once he completely forgoes examining the main sources of American meat--factory farming--and instead focuses on two exceptions to the rule.Before starting this book, I knew I wasn't going to agree with Pollan's conclusion, but I did at least expect that its role of raising food awareness would still allow me to recommend it to others. It had a promising start. The chapters on corn and organics are interesting. I was already aware of the abundance of food in the American diet, but the information of how corn adapted was rather new to me. The chapters on organic and local produce leave me with more thinking and researching to do before I can decide how to best adapt my shopping habits. However, I fear that the idealization of hunting and ""happy meat"" overshadows any other message in the book. People look for justification to continue to eat meat--and Pollan provides them with this by accepting these exceptions, and not even seriously entertaining the alternative of abstaining from animal products altogether.If this book does empower people to make more informed decisions, then I'm glad for it, but personally, I had a more positive opinion of Pollan from his contribution to Food, Inc. and various interviews than I did after reading this book. * After his hunting expeditions, Pollan joins the rank of writers who try to make hiding in a bush and pulling a trigger seem poetic. Why anyone would feel pride over shooting a pig is beyond my understanding. It's not as if he's John Locke stranded on an island with only his knives and his instincts. He is more at risk gathering mushrooms. Pollan's account tries to convince the reader of a reverence the hunter feels for his prey, but growing up in a rural area, surrounded by hunters (and even being kin to them), I've yet to be convinced that American hunters feel much more than the thrill of killing and of course, having bragging rights and (of course) their stories to tell."
20,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/137467-stacie,5,"From the very beginning, Omnivore’s Dilemma, it had me thinking a lot about my childhood. I grew up on my grandparents’ farm in MN, where we had draft horses, cows, chickens, a garden filled with vegetables, apple trees and rows upon rows of corn. I learned how to take an ear off the stalk at a very young age – probably around the same time that I learned how to bale hay – because across the farm from the rows of corn, we also had a field of alfalfa and wheat. While my grandpa grew corn to sell to buyers like Blaney and Stauffer, we didn’t feed the corn to our animals – they received baled hay of alfalfa and wheat, or at the grass in the pasture they roamed every day. I always figured it was because my grandpa didn’t want our animals eating his potential profits, but after reading OD, I wonder. Unfortunately my grandparents are no longer around to ask.What I sometimes think is ironic, is that while there are over 60 of us, not one of us stayed on the farm, even though the farm never really left us.In my family, we are gardeners – whether we are tending a flower garden or a vegetable garden – we are growing some of the food that will be presented at our tables. Hunting was always a big thing in my family as well. My grandfather taught his children and grandchildren at an early age how to shoot a gun, but never expected anyone (I am not a hunter, but know how to shoot a gun) to hunt if they didn’t want to. What he did teach us was that you ate what you killed. Hunting and fishing (another thing we did a lot of) was not a sport, it was a way of life – it was a way to feed our family.While I liked this book for the memories of childhood lessons it conjured for me, it also helped to remind me of my ideals around food. Ideals that have become lax of late. One example: I made all of my daughter’s food when she was a baby. She did not partake in any pre-made food, and was a vegetarian until she was about two years old. I am not sure when my desire to feed her naturally ended, but now she eats processed food when I feel busy – processed food that I sometimes cannot pronounce the ingredients much less figure out where it came from. With many things (I am looking at your Twinkies) we have a rule that if you can’t pronounce it you don’t eat it, but this goes out the window when I am too busy to make a homemade meal.Pollan, without ever preaching, without ever scolding, reminds the reader that we owe it to ourselves and to our families to know where are food is coming from. I felt this was a very well written book – both in its content and writing. It is a book that will make you stop and think about what you are putting in your mouth.If you eat, you should read this book."
21,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32138-tracy-rhodes,5,"I'll never look at corn the same way again.This book provokes a lot of thought about the origins of our food and the biological, political, social and economic implications of those origins. I liked that Pollan approached the topic journalistically, with admirably little in the way of political agenda. To structure his book, he uses the format of following the path of four finished meals from origin to plate - one McDonald's meal, one comprised of supermarket organic products, one from a ""beyond-organic"" self-sustaining farm in Virgina, and one he forages almost entirely on his own. Pollan goes into food science labs and discovers how ubiquitous the use of corn has become in modern diets, and how corn-derived food systems are synthesized and refined into ever more variations to increase our usage and meet industrial demands for market growth. The McDonald's meal he and his family share, for example, ends up being comprised of over 70% corn or corn-fed product (from beef and milk cows fed corn silage and loaded with antibiotics when it sickens them, to corn starches used in buns and chicken nugget fillers, to the high-fructose corn syrup used to sweeten soda and milkshakes). Pollan makes a strong case for how corn and its refined offspring have contributed to the ever-expending girths of Americans in recent decades.Next he looks at the organic market, examining the compromises that many organic producers have had to make to support the demands of national chains like Whole Foods, and what ""organic"" does and does not necessarily mean. He contrasts corporate organic production with a week he spends working on a farm in Virginia run by a maverick Christian/libertarian farmer who carefully manages a ""beyond organic"" operation of interdependent, high-yielding crops and livestock on his land. The story of how this farmer guides his farm in a sustainable, symbiotic cycle is absolutely amazing.Lastly, Pollan goes off the grid completely in growing and foraging the means for an entire omnivorous meal - not only growing vegetables/herbs and learning how to scout for edible mushrooms, but actually learning how to hunt and shoot a wild pig in N. California (something my own husband recently did, much to our culinary benefit). The vast majority of people who eat meat will never even lay eyes on the living body of an animal they eat, let alone take responsibility for its demise; so I find a lot of honesty in Pollan's having taken that step in his exploration of the food chain. Overall, this book rocked my world in terms of understanding our modern food chain and its impact on all of us both individually and as a society. As a result, I've been doing a lot of thinking about how I can improve both my diet and my contribution to local/organic food sources. I'm determined to find more ways to eat locally and organically, and I feel lucky to live in one of the best places to do so."
22,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5858699-kavita,5,"Michael Pollan is a food activist, trying to get people to dump fast food and industrial food, and eat healthier. I first came across him in a documentary called Cooked, and I loved the way he talked about fresh food. Eating (and cooking, to some extent) is a passion with me, so I was hooked. I loved the documentary, and I expected to love this book. And I did!The main subject of the book is how maize (or corn) displaced all other crops in the US. Because it offers a better return for money for the big agrobusinesses, this plant is often preferred by farmers, who find out only too late that this choice has led them down the path of poverty. Industrial farming also leads to environmental disasters, ruining the land, as well as the surrounding water bodies, for future generations. Pollan also goes into the meat processing industry, and we get to see the sorry state of the cows. Their feed is unhealthy and unnatural, and does not allow them to grow organically. They are kept in overcrowded conditions, standing in their own shit for days on end. The animals are not even allowed a glimpse of the outside world, and even have to engage in forced cannibalism, something not natural for cows. All this is not only terrible for the animals, but their meat also ends up being very unhealthy for consumers. Pollan also talks about the chicken industry, which faces similar issues. Pollan even has issues with industrial organic products, because of the fact that the criteria for labelling anything organic is kept low to help big companies make money.As an alternative, Pollan describes family-run farm businesses, which incorporate a healthy and full life for the animals before they are slaughtered for meat. The vegetables and fruits are also fresh. The variety of crops and meat means that these farms are also better for the environment overall. The extra money spent would be well-worth the benefits. How accessible such food is for everyone in the US is however not explained.I think this is a pretty comprehensive look at the food industry in the US, and the impact it has on Americans and the rest of the world. But the best part of the book is when Pollen himself goes out to hunt, gather, and cook his own food! I don't think I will be doing that any time soon, though!"
23,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/606861-mandy-nelson,4,"Ok friends, I LOVED this book. It was a little long and it kind of meandered and changed tone in the last 1/3 but it was good all the way through. This book is about the industrial food chain and the author's adventures in trying to trace where his food comes from. He researches the 3 different processes that go into 3 types of meals: an industrially produced meal (McDonald's), an organic meal (Whole Foods) and a hunter/gatherer meal (he kills/collects everything he eats for this meal). If you don't have time to read it all, I recommend Parts I and II. It is truly thought provoking.I've always enjoyed driving through the midwest and checking out all the cornfields. They seem so pastoral and old-fashioned and wholesome. Turns out this is not so true. From what Michael Pollan writes, corn is actually a freak of nature. It probably started as a genetic mutation from grass somewhere in South America. Corn actually shouldn't be a prosperous species but it has been helped along immensely by human hands. The tassle at the top of the stalk is the male reproductive organ and the cob is the female reproductive part. Since the cob is sheated in so many layers there is little chance that the tassle's fruit can get into the cob to start the reproduction process. Somehow it worked out a long time ago and humans figured out how to grow corn. The maize of South America gave way to our current industrialized food system that relies tremendously on mass produced and genetically modified corn. When I hear this I think- ""Hmm, we eat a lot of corn-based products, what's the big deal?"". Here are the reasons why this is a big deal, 1. Corn is a cheap raw material that can be turned into lots of different ""foods"". Industrial farms feed cattle and chickens corn because it is cheaper to store a bunch of cattle or chickens in a confined animal feeding operation (CAFO) rather than letting them roam on a pasture and eat a natural diet of grass and insects (for the chickens). 2. Because chickens and cows have not evolved to eat corn, they get sick. In order to prevent them getting sick, they are given anti-biotics. 3. Corn is also used because it will fatten up the cows and chicken more quickly, which then allows the industry to kill and sell and profit sooner. 4. Industrial-sized farms use pesticides and fertilizer to grow their crops which pollute the land. The extra synthetic nitrogen that is not used up by the crop either evaporates and falls as acid rain (contributes to global warming), or it sinks down into the water table, or it gets washed away by rains into the rivers where human beings get their water. Other key points to note:1. Organic does not necessarily = sustainable.. You can have organic asparagus flown in from Argentina but that doesn't mean it is good for the planet. Local organic is best because it reduces our reliance on fossil fuels. In addition, just because chickens are ""free-range"" does not mean they actually live outside and have space to roam. They could be living in a CAFO with a little door that leads to a small patch of grass that is not sufficient for the thousands of chickens inside the CAFO. 2. The treatment of pigs is ESPECIALLY alarming to me! They are raised in CAFOs in cages suspended a little above the ground so that they can shit and it falls to the floor. The cages are stacked so the pigs are shitting on top of each other. Maybe this is fine because pigs seem to like to root around in shit however, the setup is still alarming because they do not have space to turn around in their cages. Because they are weaned from their mother in such a short amount of time (compared to a natural weaning) they have a propensity to suck and bite. They are lined up with each pig facing the next pigs rear so they chew the tail of the pig in frotn of them. The pig whose tail is being chewed oftentimes does not care because of its deplorable condition. The industry has now put into place a procedure called ""tail docking""- without anesthesia they cut each pig's tail to a nub. They leave the nub there because it is really sensitive so, when confined to the cage again and the tail is bitten, the pig will squirm and try not to have it's tail bitten. I think this is absolutely horrid. 3. I am still a meat eater but I am looking for ways to find meat that is not industrially produced. I don't mind eating animals but I do not support the living/dying conditions that industrial farms provide.READ THIS BOOK!Thanks for reading this especially long review!"

26,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,4,"A more accurate subtitle for this book would be “An Ecology of Four Meals.” The ecological perspective permits Pollan to focus on questions of sustainability, and social and environmental cost, as opposed to the point of purchase price visible to the consumer. His first meal is the ubiquitous fast food family meal consumed on the road with his family. It is no surprise that the meal represents a choice of convenience over nutrition. What is surprising is that the meal is based on corn, Number 2 hybrid to be precise. This USDA designated field corn feeds all industrial farm cattle and poultry. It is the epitome of successful mono-culture farming, bred to accommodate mechanized cultivation and, in its genetically engineered iteration, resistant to pesticide application. Corn is a juggernaut that affects the way livestock are raised and the way food is manufactured. Cattle receive supplements and antibiotics to tolerate the feedlot stage of their journey from farm to slaughterhouse. Some of the hidden costs? Feedlot waste cannot be recycled into fertilizer. It contains toxic levels of heavy metals, hormone residue, phosphorus and nitrogen. Public health crises of antibiotic resistance and E. coli outbreaks present new problems for the medical community. Corn by-products like high fructose sweetener, starches and oil are at the base of food technology. Consumption of fossil fuels increases as the supply chain moves from local to global. A vicious cycle of overproduction and price supports insures the economic supremacy of this commodity. Is there a sustainable alternative?Pollan shifts his examination to the organic food movement. On the one hand there is Big Business Organic. This is one of the most valuable sections of the book. He traces the tortured language of the USDA which purports to define “organic.” He visits Cascadia Foods, founded by Gene Kahn, and traces its trajectory from organic farming to a niche agribusiness. Kahn states flatly that the organic ideal simply was not sustainable as a business model without a link to a Big Organic distribution network. A pastoral marketing narrative has sprung from this distribution chain, hiding an inconvenient truth. Organic chickens do not live their entire lives in an open range. Organic cows eat organic grain — in the same overcrowded unbucolic feedlots. Pollan concludes:  “The big question is whether the logic of an industrial food chain can be reconciled to the logic of the natural systems on which organic agriculture has tried to model itself. Put another way, is industrial organic ultimately a contradiction in terms?” (p.161)As a counter example he visits Polyface Farms, a multi-culture organic farm nestled in the Shenandoah Valley. The cattle are grass-fed for their entire lives. Careful planning prevents overgrazing any single parcel of land. A meticulous choreography of chickens, turkeys, and pigs follow demonstrating a labor-intensive but successful example of sustainable, profitable organic farming. Pollan turns to the psychological context of eating for his final meal. The meat is a wild pig he hunted and killed. The vegetables were grown from his garden. The mushrooms were foraged under the tutelage of some veteran mushroom hunters. He even attempts to harvest his own salt from the sea with amusing results.  “This year the winter rains had persisted well into spring, making the ponds deeper and less saline than they would normally be in June. So instead of scraping snowy white crystals of sea salt off the rocks, as I'd anticipated, we ended up filling a couple of scavenged polyethaline soda bottles with the cloudy brown brine. That night I evaporated the liquid in a pan over a low flame; it filled the kitchen with a worrisome chemical steam, but after a few hours a promising layer of crystals the color of brown sugar formed in the bottom of the pan, and once it cooled I managed to scrape out a few tablespoons. Unfortunately this salt, which was a bit greasy to the touch, tasted so metallic and so much like chemicals that it actually made me gag, and required a chaser of mouthwash to clear from my tongue.” (p.193-194) Fortunately for his dinner guests, Pollan turns to the safety of the salt in his pantry. These chapters shed light on the cultural quandary we have created. Speed and convenience in both food acquisition and preparation have deprived us of the sense of anticipation. There is also the disproportionate valuation of quantity over quality. You don't have to buy at a Costco or Sam's Club to experience this. It is almost impossible to buy loose produce at the local grocery retailer. Food has been removed from an emotional context that included smells from the kitchen, a growing sensation of hunger, and an appreciation of the manual labor involved. He recaptures all of this in his elaborate banquet of foraged food. Early in the book Pollan laments the absence of a national food culture in America.  “As a relatively new nation drawn from many different immigrant populations each with its own culture of food, Americans have never had a single, strong, stable culinary tradition to guide us.” (p.5) Here, I think he errs. Mobility has desensitized us to the idea of local food as well as the continuous hands-on learning that gets passed on in an extended family. He points out the importance of direct experience in learning how to forage for mushrooms. Despite a stack of field guides, it is the authoritative certainty of his mentors that enables him to forage with both confidence and accuracy (no one died from the mushrooms he served!) When I began this book I was expecting a censorious examination of bad food habits. Instead, I discovered new dimensions for thinking about food. It's about sustainability and humane sourcing, nutrition and flavor, but it's also about awareness and understanding at both the microscopic and macroscopic levels. This book was the selection of our local book club."
27,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/892406-kristin,4,"This was an amazing book. Pollen takes the reader on a food adventure that is thought provoking, disturbing and quietly challenges they way we all look at the meal in front of us - all without being obnoxious or righteous.The book begins simply enough in an Iowa cornfield as Pollen breaks down the history of corn and the future of this simple grain. He deftly weaves this into how we eat this product and what it’s doing to us and agriculture. From Iowa we travel with him as he visits his steer (#534) in the Colorado fields and in the feedlot of Kansas (Nebraska?). The middle portion of the books moves into sustainable agriculture at its finest as he spends a week at Polyface farm. As a person familiar with farms, Polyface was amazing. Pollen starts the week on his stomach in a field examining the soil, he helps to move the cows from pasture to pasture, he assists in moving the chicken pens and describes they symbiotic relationship between the chickens and the cows. He talks about the rabbit and chicken house and the symbiotic relationship that exists there, he describes the cow barn in the spring and how the pigs turn 3 feet of cow muck, hay and fermented corn into black compost. And Pollen contrasts and compares “conventional farming” with this picture of “sustainable farming”. In the third segement, Pollen has moved to California and examines what it means morally and ethically to be a vegetarian (giving up meat for a month). He has also decided to make a meal completely from those items he has grown, foraged and hunted himself. This book is presented in such a down to earth matter that the reader can’t help but start to question how their food arrived on the table. Pollen doesn’t pontificate. He doesn’t raise his fist and pump it toward the sky and tell us we are all Bad People for Eating Meat. He doesn’t bombard us with anthropormophisism or silly sentiment. He took himself on a quest, shown us what he found, and I appreciated that more than anything. Has this changed how I view my eating habits? You bet it has. Even more surprising, it changed the husbands. "
28,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31383-tim,2,"Has served to overcome my general revulsion of journalists mascarading expose as scientific truth (e.g. Malcolm Gladwell or Thomas Friedman). Well worth reading, though a second, scientific perspective (read ""not Schlosser"") would be a good companion to fill out what this book offers. ---Finished: I take back what I said, what I thought was gearing up to be analytical and thought provoking really unwound over the course of the book. Pollan comes off a lot more like a homespun wisdom-spewing grandma than someone with an arguable thesis, at least as he presents it in this book. I'm not saying that his thesis is not credible, it's just that he doesn't package the book with tools to know one way or the other. He could have made the same case for making sure you get your daily dose of moon rocks each day, and if he were able to strike the same nerve he strikes with this book, have gotten the same effect. I thought the book would redeem itself when Pollan hunted his own meal. Instead he prepares it like a girly man. His pig kill is ambiguous, he allows himself to use whatever kitchen supplies he already had in the house, he ""forages"" for cherries in some stranger's tree, and he requires a friend to dress and prepare his pig for him, as well as bring much of the actual food to the final dinner. In the end, much was conjectured (some of which was interesting enough to earn the book two stars) but the only thing I learned was that we eat a lot of corn and that Michael Pollan is a nancy-man sham. Read this book! "
29,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1605591-christine,5,"Twice a week, there is a farmer's market at my local park. It is half a block away from my house. For the last several years, I've brought food there. I can no longer eat, for instance, apples from the supermarket. They taste waxy. Considering how much I like my local farmer's market, it's surprising that it took me so long to read this book.Seeing marked down to a dollar helped motivate me.It's a good book. It's a scary book. It makes me want to buy everything from the farmer's market (which is impossible because they don't have chocolate and I need chocolate). I also have to say something that I never thought I would say.Corn sex is fasinating. It really, truly is.In thoughtful, clear, and inticing prose (much like a fine wine), Pollan leds the reader down a menu of food. The first part of the book concerns America as the corn chip nature. It is frightening how much corn is in things; the second section looks at organic foods and farm foods (or post organic), and the third concerns Pollan hunting and gathering his own food. Of the three sections, I enjoyed the second the best. Pollan describes Polyface farm in great detail and no romance. He also raises and discusses important points about meat and slaughtering. The section where Pollan discusses his own hunting is interesting because Pollan himself is not ashamed or afarid to show the reader his exhilaraion and shame. Even the section on corn is an interesting and thought provoking reader. Better yet, Pollan doesn't preach!"
30,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82365956-veronica,4,"""Yet there are other images of animals on other kinds of farms that contradict the nightmare ones. I'm thinking of the hens I saw at Polyface Farm, fanning out over the cow pasture on a June morning, pecking at the cowpats and the grass...or the image of pig happiness I witnessed in that cattle barn in March, watching the hogs, all upturned pink hams and corkscrew tails, nosing their way through that deep cake of compost in search of alcoholic morsels of corn. It is true that farms like this are but a speck on the monolith of modern animal agriculture, yet their very existence, and the possibility that implies, throws the whole argument for animal rights into a different light."" Pollan knows that the so-called happiness at Polyface Farm could never be scaled to a magnitude sufficient to feed the many required. ""To many animal people even Polyface Farm is a 'death camp'—a way station for doomed creatures awaiting their date with the executioner. But to look at the lives of these animals is to see this holocaust analogy for the sentimental conceit it really is. In the same way we can probably recognize animal suffering when we see it, animal happiness is unmistakable, too, and during my week on the farm I saw it in abundance.""I will permit the possibility of brief animal happiness on a small farm right before the slaughter. Still, the inconvenient reality is that human agriculture contravenes the natural order of predation because we are the only creatures that bring animals into existence in order to slaughter them. The lion does not raise and propagate zebras in a nested enclosure indefinitely and delight in creating more and more efficient ways of slaughtering their offspring. This apparently small detail is conveniently left out in arguments from nature, as I will call them. ""To think of domestication as a form of slavery or even exploitation is to misconstrue that whole relationship—to project a human idea of power onto what is in fact an example of mutualism or symbiosis, rather than a political, development. The animals grew tame and lost their ability to fend for themselves in the wild and the humans traded hunter-gatherer ways for the settled lives of agriculturists. Humans changed biologically, too.""Don't equate the domestication of wolves to the slaughter of chicks. Red herring fallacy. ""[This] is where the animal rightists betray a deep ignorance about the workings of nature."" Again, there is nothing natural about industrial agriculture. ""The very existence of predation in nature, of animals eating animals, is the cause of much anguished hand-wringing in the animal rights literature. 'It must be admitted,' Peter Singer writes, 'that the existence of carnivorous animals does pose one problems for the ethics of Animal Liberation, and that is whether we should do anything about it.' (Talk about the need for peacekeeping forces!)""On the one hand, this made me laugh a bit because I've always been disturbed by the existence of predation in the wild. That many creatures rely on the pain and suffering of other animals in order to live is but a testament to the fallen state of the world, which is also why Jupiter is a purer and superior planet to Earth. But I digress. (My sister has christened this Jupiter propaganda🪐, which I readily admit.)In any event, I've already unravelled this false equivalency between natural predation and the very systematic multiplication of animals bred for the slaughter, season after season. From doom to dust.""Today, the organic food industry finds itself in a most unexpected, uncomfortable, and yes, unsustainable position: floating on a sinking sea of petroleum.""""U.S. agricultural policy, like the Declaration of Independence, is founded on the principle that all carrots are created equal, even though there's good reason to believe this isn't really true.""Birds can't get access to the outdoors until at least 5 weeks old and are slaughtered at 7, so ""free range turns out to be not so much a lifestyle for these chickens as a two-week vacation option.""""From the moment an organic lettuce plant is ready for harvest, the rest of its journey from field to produce aisle follows a swift and often ingenious industrial logic that is only nominally organic.""The fact that steer are given numbers as names makes Holocaust comparisons all too facile...""The farmers desperate to boost yield end up degrading their land, plowing and planting marginal land, applying more nitrogen—anything to squeeze a few more bushels from the soil.""""Nor would such a culture be shocked to discover that there are other countries, such as Italy and France, that decide their dinner questions on the basis of such quaint and unscientific criteria as pleasure and tradition, eat all manner of 'unhealthy' foods, and, lo and behold, wind up actually healthier and happier in their eating than we are. We show our surprise at this by speaking of something called the 'French paradox,' for how could a people who eat such demonstrably toxic substance as foie gras and triple crème cheese actually be slimmer and healthier than we are? Yet I wonder if it doesn't make more sense to speak in terms of an American paradox—that is, a notably unhealthy people obsessed by the idea of eating heathily."""
31,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73483095-cynnamon,0,"I bought this book, because I had thouroughly enjoyed Michael Pollans ""Cooking"".But here I give up.I have read around 100 pages about corn. I learned a lot I didn't know before, but unfortunately I didn't care about my newly acquired knowledge.Also the book is completely US-centric, which makes it for me as an European not quite so interesting.This book is outside of my scope of interest, therefore I refrain from assigning a rating."
32,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,5,"I really like Pollan’s writing style, he brings points home with simplicity, and he is able to cover a lot of ground without the writing feelings unnecessarily circuitous or blustery. More than that though, I like that he is willing to experience. I mean, that’s the very core of responsible journalism, Pollan goes and works on the farms, he helps slaughter chickens, he sits in tractors, he goes hunting and foraging, he throws himself bodily and emotionally into these experiences, and at each point I felt that he was incredibly honest with both himself and the reader about the impacts of his actions and his emotional state.All in all I thought it was refreshingly non-biased, fair appraising look at industrial agriculture/ranching, industrial/artisanal organic agriculture/ranching, and hunting/foraging. I say that as a person literally smack dab in the middle of row-crop country (my husband and his family farms), as a gardener, and as a hunter. I’ve long had a problem with the way we raise meat in this country, and the lack of connection between people and their food. Its one of the reasons that I do hunt and garden, and its also one of the reasons that I’ve mostly switched to plant proteins for all meals except supper. I am continuing to try and evolve how I eat, and it’s a learning experience and I don’t always get it right (I ate spaghettio’s twice in three days last week, no one’s perfect). But its hard to read this book without examining the role that we eaters have in the natural world. I am going to make a concerted effort to eat in-season vegetables except for those that I froze from my garden in the summer, and I’m going to try and rely on our game meats more. Despite reading much about early life on the prairie, somehow I had never considered that even meat was seasonal, or that foods grown out of season lack the nutrition that we think we are getting. They’re both very “duh” concepts, but its not something that I had really appreciated. Nor had I valued the waste of petroleum in shipping year round under-nourished produce from Argentina to the US just so that we could eat whatever fruit or veggie that we want, despite its lack of flavor.Perhaps the greatest thing that came from this was the conversations with my husband. He listened to the audiobook while in the tractor, and it was great to talk to him when he came home at night about the ways agriculture has changed since Pollan wrote (advances in technology have changed the level of precision for farmers, becoming more environmentally friendly for those that upgrade), but also the ways that it could continue to change. What could we do as eaters, hunters, buyers, and producers in our local community? Books that foster conversation and change always get a 5 out of 5.Absolutely recommend to everyone. Read those food labels. Speak out. We deserve, as buyers, connectivity and information about our food, and animals especially deserve better than what we manage for our convenience."
33,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/307041-ginny-messina,3,"A truly important book by gifted writer and journalist Michael Pollan. It's not without its flaws, however, and for all the promise of the first two-thirds of the book, it kind of leaves the reader hanging at the end. In the first part, Pollan exposes the damaging effects of industrial agriculture, and—-importantly—-this includes large-scale organic production which is not nearly as benign as most people would like to believe. Later in the book he addresses the inhumane aspect of industrial agriculture as well—-organic production included. He puts it succinctly: you look away, or you stop eating meat. In the second part of the book, we see farming as it should be, on Polyface Farm in the Shenandoah Valley. Here, farming practices are closely tied to nature including the natural behavior of farm animals. While the system doesn't adhere completely to organic regulations, it is far more sustainable and humane than industrial organic agriculture and certainly more so than conventional agriculture. Polyface Farm is not able to separate itself from industrial agriculture completely (by law, the steer are killed in conventional slaughterhouses) but it still seems like a very nice place. Unfortunately, the scale on which it operates means that this type of sustainable farming can never produce enough food for the U.S. population. Food from farms like Polyface is likely to be available to only a privileged few. The last part of the book struck me as downright nonsensical. Pollan explores the possibility of putting together the ultimate local meal—-one composed of food that he himself has hunted, gathered and grown. But don't try this at home, he says. It is not at all a realistic way to eat. Well—-no—-not if you do it by gathering chanterelle mushrooms with a bunch of chefs from Chez Panisse, hunting wild boar in the California woods, and diving for abalone along a rocky coast. Granted, most Americans would be hard-pressed to produce their own food, but Pollan doesn't even explore the option in any kind of realistic or meaningful fashion. In the end, it appears that the problems associated with food production are insurmountable. Industrial agriculture provides most of the food in this country and is a wasteful and unsustainable system. But more sustainable systems are not realistic for feeding the population. Pollan does not offer any clear cut answers, much to my surprise. (I didn't expect him to solve the problem; I did expect a little guidance!) But the thoughtful reader can still pull together a plan of action to minimize the environmental and ethical cost of a meal. Reduce intake of animal foods. Buy locally-produced food. Grow or produce as much as is realistic for you. Pollan makes his readers think about where their meals come from and how to measure the true cost of our ""inexpensive"" food. This is a must-read for anyone who expresses a desire to live and eat responsibly. "

"
37,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147289-jason-pettus,5,"Journalist Michael Pollan has a reputation for writing books that people don't just like, but whose very lives get permanently changed because of reading them; and I can attest that this exact thing has happened to me after reading my first book of his, the extraordinary 2006 guide to modern food practices known as The Omnivore's Dilemma. In it, Pollan imagines three typical meals a contemporary American might eat -- one of fast food, one of Whole Foods-type groceries, and one literally put together through foraging and hunting -- then over the course of 60,000 words shows us exactly, step by minute step, how the ingredients in each meal can be traced back and back until finally reaching a point of a living plant being grown in the ground somewhere, then building us back forward again by showing exactly what happens to that plant step by step as it makes its way from the farm to eventually our mouths.Along the way, then, Pollan gives us an astute history of the post-war industrial agricultural industry; explains why exactly corn is the overwhelming number-one crop now grown in America; gives us the horrifying reasons that most cattle and chicken have to be fed so many antibiotics in order to merely survive under such harsh industrial conditions; demonstrates why in a middle-class consumerist society these conditions have to happen in the first place (that is, because if cows were still grown in the humane way they were in an agricultural society, a McDonald's hamburger would cost $30, and the American people would riot); shows through personal field trips what exactly the difference is between ""cage-free,"" ""free range"" and ""pastured"" eggs, and why one of these options is infinitely better than the others; details why the term ""organic"" on a food label can mean vastly different things depending on the company and circumstances; and shows through illuminating first-hand experience why we are no longer a hunter-gatherer society (namely, because it's exhausting, inefficient, and makes people run the risk of sometimes going entire weeks at a time without finding anything edible to eat).Easily the most interesting book I've read in a decade, The Omnivore's Dilemma has permanently changed the way I now shop for groceries, knowing as I now do so many more details about what each label on a package means, and how different growing circumstances can often literally mean a difference in the resulting food's nutrition (just for one example, how Pollan scientifically proves here that eggs from chickens that are allowed to roam freely on farmland are literally better for you than eggs grown from chickens kept in cages); and although I haven't completely given up fast food, certainly every hamburger I now buy makes me ponder the indescribably monstrous and cruel circumstances by which that cow lived its life, which has already influenced just how many hamburgers I buy in general. (It also makes me understand a lot better why there will always be people around in any society who are more than happy to perform that society's most inhumane tasks, such as rounding up undocumented immigrants, ripping their children away from them, and throwing them into concentration camps while openly laughing in their faces...but that's neither here nor there, I suppose.) To tell the truth, the only reason I read this in the first place was because I was waiting for the day in early June that Pollan's newest book came out, a 600-page whopper called How to Change Your Mind that looks in exhaustive detail at all the latest 21st-century research into the connections between psychedelic drugs, mindfulness, meditation, mental health, what MRIs can teach us about what we've traditionally called the ""soul,"" and a lot more. That book is now finished too, and was just as fascinating as The Omnivore's Dilemma, so keep an eye out for my write-up of that in another couple of weeks.UPDATE 1: I find it utterly fascinating that the only negative reviews here of this book are from vegetarians, who are so upset at Pollan's conclusion that humans as omnivores are perfectly capable of eating meat, they're willing to dismiss every single other vegetarian-friendly thing he has to say. (Ultimately Pollan is pro-vegetable in this book, despite concluding that meat is indeed an edible substance that humans find edible.) A huge part of this book is all about how the politics of any given age has a huge influence over our opinions on the supposedly ""scientifically objective"" subjects of diet and nutrition, and the vitriolic negative reviews of the book by militant vegetarians here simply proves his point all over again.UPDATE 2: After reading other people's reviews, I agree with something I saw a lot of people mention; that a clear sign of how much I loved this book is that people at Twitter eventually got sick of me constantly tweeting about it while I was reading it. Be prepared to drive your friends and spouse crazy!"

Well, Actually, Eat Sh*t and Flourish. Each of these would have been a more classy title for the book ""Omnivore's Dilemma"". To paraphrase another reviewer 'The dude structures this book by following the path of four finished meals from origin to plate - one McDonald's meal, one comprised of supermarket organic products, one from a ""beyond-organic"" self-sustaining farm in Virginia, and one he forages almost entirely on his own. This book tries to provokes a lot of thought about the origins of our food and the biological, political, social and economic implications of those origins, and for the most part, it is successful.' So after reading this book I realize that maybe, just maybe, I don’t argue with people about food enough. Ever since I read  Fast Food Nation  and watched  Supersize Me  I have been pretty good about avoiding eating at Mc-stablishments and drinking soda. Knowing these efforts aren’t enough, but not having had the ...chutzpah ... to make the leap to full fledged, ""morally superior"" vegetarianism. I am way to lazy to manage an urban garden, -- preferring rather to watch one made on TV OD presents, as a moral alternative to growing, actually hunting and eating wild game. The parts of the book that describe this stuff, although not seemingly not feasible, reinforced these previously formed notions about foraging. Still, it is pretty interesting to see the details fleshed out.One thing discussed in the book that i hadn't internalized, and that makes sense when I think about it, is that going to whole foods and buying an organic Chilean artichoke in the winter can be a lot worse ethically than eating a fat juicy steak from a locally raised mature grass fed cow. I guess that the ethical answer culled from the book on how to shop food in the city is to buy at farmers markets or join one of these CSA’s. Take the extra step and get to know your farmer, know how they grow, know how they feed and treat the animals is the right thing to do. This seems like undue effort and cost but the ethical equivalent seems to be to hunt and dress bloody dead animals or forage for mushrooms in central park. In that perspective, the first options seems like less effort ."

These range from the nearby McDonald's and Burger Kind to the supermarket to the local farmer's stand. Michael Pollan takes a look at four ways to have a meal - one industrial meal at McDonald's, one organic meal from Whole Foods, one local meal from a farmer's field, and one completely ""homemade"" meal made from hunting and foraging.I must say, the first 300 pages are riveting, absolutely enthralling! I kept putting aside fiction to read this book, it was so good! However, when I hit the chapters on hunting and foraging, I found my interest severely waning. I really don't care at all about hunting animals and foraging for mushrooms, so keeping my attention was nearly impossible (this is why I took off a star). But the end picks up as Pollan returns to the final ""perfect"" meal.This book had so much really good information - information that once again cements my desire never to eat food at a fast food restaurant ever again. If one of your New Year's Resolutions is to eat healthier, read this book to bolster that desire!!"

The parts on farming, the evils of monoculture, the importance of grass, were especially enlightening. I don't normally eat beef and I would definitely reduce the intake even more. The most shocking part for me was the 'pastoral organic' revelation. I wonder if the organic products sold in Indonesia as are bad as the greenwashed examples in this book, which are all about the US market. The later parts of the book - hunting and cooking - were not as interesting for me as the earlier parts. Hence the four stars. Still, a fascinating read and highly recommended to everyone."

I support a small flock of happy chickens instead.Lengthy review to come. In the meantime, let me just say---I learned a lot from this book. I also enjoyed some segments very much. I would have done some extensive editing.The final chapter is sublime. OK, my real review:I am a convenience eater. Michael Pollan's work is transforming me into a conscious eater. Two concrete changes in my behavior: I will now pay the price of a fancy mocha coffee beverage for a dozen eggs gathered from happy chickens. I will also see commercially available breaded chicken with a side of corn as corn dressed with corn and a side of corn. I still may eat it, but at least I know what I'm getting!It is my hope that these wonderful books I have been reading indicate an American paradigm shift, and that the marketplace will allow people like me (who don't want to spend the time and effort tracking down purveyers of all sorts of specialty foods) more chances to make conscious choices in a convenient way. I will do my best to make choices that are more healthful for me and our planet regardless.This book was successful in changing my behavior. In large part, it was successful because I was already ripe for changing. Everything from Kingsolver's Animal Vegetable Miracle to Buford's Heat to Van Draanen's sweet young adult novel Flipped has been telling me to embrace these changes. This work built upon that foundation and presented a lot more detailed information supporting the choices that we should all be making. It was well structured, and it needed to be. So much information was packed into each section, it was necessary for me to take breaks. Some peeves---Too many declarative sentences. All declarative sentences put me on guard. (See what I did there?) I read something that says or implies ""all"" and I immediately start casting about defensively for the exceptions. I blame SAT prep. I was also put off by the way in which those declarations seemed designed to make me so defensive, mostly when he seemed dismissive of the travails of gardening, or scornful of the kind of hunter who does not agonize over the creatures' deaths. Second person. I hate second person. Here's a sentence that combined 2 peeves: ""You can forage in the garden, in the way Adam and Eve presumably did, but there isn't much to it: no dilemmas, no hunting stories."" And it's kind of a run on sentence too, now that I look at it, although that (obviously, having read any of my reviews!) isn't such a major irritation for me. (See what I did there?)Rampant anthropomorphism. Corn does not feel happy about taking over the world! Corn does not feel happy! Corn does not feel! This is a Truth. I believe that much of the anthropomorphism here was used as a bit of shorthand, implying all the Darwinian blah blah blah rather than spelling it out, and also trying to fix an image in the mind of the reader, but it is NOT TRUE. It bothers me. (Althoug I do like the image of an army of cornstalks marchng across the landscape, and it truly did stick with me.)LOVED---All descriptions of all meals.All the time spent at the idealized farm. (I forget what it's called and can't be bothered to look it up.)Everything to do with the mushrooms.

43,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1242165-schmacko,4,"So much has been written about this book, and so much will be defined by how you feel comfortable when discussing your eating habits. Here are, in short forms, my 10 observations:1)	If you’ve ever wondered how much the American government is responsible for your eating by subsidizing corporations who grow corn and make high fructose corn syrup, this is a book for you! SHORT VERSION: Corn is in EVERYTHING! We committed to growing corn when we could possibly switch to many varied crops. Corn is uniform, so it’s very corporate. If you hate political reading, if you don’t want to know this stuff, or you don’t frankly care, skip Pollan’s book. (Hope you enjoy your diabetes.)2)	Yes, we know organic food is better for us. But Pollan does a great job telling us that the US family’s annual food budget has actually dropped over the last 60 years, so Americans could conceivably spend more on food (and probably less on entertainment) and help out their diets.3)	I thought his section on Whole Foods founder John Mackey was interesting. Mackey completely concedes that he isn’t as radical as he started, that he has basically bought into the American corporate structure in order to take baby steps in supporting a business and helping people eat more healthfully.4)	At times, Pollan sounds a little Communist. At least, anti-Capitalist. I’m ok with that – to each his own – and I believe that American politics is all about constant discourse and adjustment.5)	Knowing the details of a slaughterhouse was a little much for me, but then again, I have no problem killing what I eat. Which makes me unlike 97% of Americans, who like to think their meat comes fully formed in plastic packages.6)	I love how Pollan describes the grey color of a McDonald’s burger. Funny! (I still crave Wendy’s once or twice a month.)7)	Mushroom foraging always sounded like something I wanted to do. Until I read his accounts. Mushroom foragers are crazy, obsessed people!8)	He’s lucky he had help at parts, or Pollan would’ve starved.9)	I like how he concedes that there is a better way to eat meat – that you don’t have to become a militant vegan.10)	I still wish we humans would accept that we are PART of the food chain!!! GRRR! We have canines; we have eaten meat for centuries. Our whole digestive system is built for meat! Lots of animals eat meat. We are not better than other animals that kill; the only thing that could possibly make us better is if we kill as quickly and painlessly as possible. We are the predators, and we should act as such – but with judiciousness and care. When we try to be ABOVE IT ALL – when we manipulate the environment – as Pollan excellently points out – we ruin it. “Dominion” humans create corporate slaughterhouses and run animals to extinction. Vegans treat animals as individuals to be coddled and encouraged to overproduce; soon, we’ll be overrun with deer and pumas and wild boar while we huddle eating berries from the sides of our abandoned roads (vehicles lead to road kill!) We need to accept that humans – like our predator cousins - do kill to survive, that we can be better at it, and that we are not ABOVE the food chain – as meat eaters or vegans – we are part of the system and should act accordingly. (Pollan mentions this, but doesn’t bring it home.)"
44,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260196-peter,5,"I started into this worried it was going to force me into vegetarianism, that I was going to read some passage about calves born into rancid waste, and a blue light somewhere in my brain would turn green and a gag reflex would accompany the thought of meat moving forward....Which speaks either to my penchant for pessimism, or the ominous relationship we have to our food chain, where we _don't_ really want to know how food got there, we just want to eat it.But read the book I did, fearful to encounter that meat-snatching passage within the book. Thankfully, Pollan is not an alarmist, but rather a quite methodical inquisitor about the roots of our food. It sounds kind of..esoteric, but he makes it fascinating, like a great humanities teacher he tells the larger story of food: of why we grow so much fricking corn in America, and how it's bad for almost everyone involved: ourselves, our diet, farmers in other countries.The good thing is that the book never descends into a polemic, unlike Michael Moore's work, Pollan's evenhandedness keeps the reader open to what he is saying. Nothing is extreme or revolutionary or incendiary.I feel like this book will, in the long term, shape the way I think about food by giving me a vocabulary for considering my personal and our cultural relationship to food. He discusses how America as a nation of immigrants never developed a stable national cuisine (unlike France or Italy), and the absence of that makes us vulnerable to an endless array of fad diets (coughAdkinscough) and an overall menu that is out of balance.There is a fascinating chapter on mushrooms and fungi, which details how they are utterly different from plants, and grow from this crazy underground symbiosis with decomposing nutrients and tree roots, taking a single drop of sugar from the tree root in exchange for processed minerals from the soil.There is an extended look at a farm outside Charlottesville--Polyface Farm--which models itself after natural ecosystems and creates this method of rotating cattle and chickens with grass growth cycles to create this wonderful whirlwind of spreadsheets, efficiency, and microdata on growth patterns of grass.To wit: it's better to have grass pasture surrounded by trees, because a blade of grass will burn X calories turning the face of it's blade toward the sun to receive solar energy. Planting forests around removes wind, allowing the grass to grow higher. Brilliant.In the end, it's about food, but it's also about systems in general. It begins to feel like a universal look at the interrelationship of history and commerce, and how everything is this big interconnected fabric, but that you can begin to see some of those connections, and kind of surf those links to great personal and collective gain.12/2007"

I use the word “threaten” very deliberately, because they are changes that I know I'm going to find challenging.Michael Pollan challenges his readers to examine their food a little closer, to consider where it comes from. And it's a logical request I think. We can spend days searching for the perfect doctor or mechanic, but how much time do we take to really think about our food? Do you know where your steak came from? Is your asparagus from a nearby farm, or far-flung Argentina? Are your peaches organic, and if so, what does that really mean? Most of us have no idea how to answer these questions.In most cases, the answers are simple. Most of our food likely comes from a massive industrial farm or feed-lot hundreds of miles away, fed by incredible amounts of fossil fuels -- the fertilizer, the machines used for harvesting, the trucks it took to transport the food to your local mega-mart, to name just a few uses of fossil fuel. Pollan's descriptions of these farms (and in particular, the feed lots) can be quite disturbing. However, Pollan does not outright condemn this ""industrial food chain."" He concedes that it would be difficult to feed billions of people inexpensively without it. Instead, he advocates having several different avenues for delivering food to our tables, and he describes several alternatives. It is up to the reader to determine how they want to eat. As for me, my eyes have been opened to the appeal of ""eating locally,"" where possible. (Emphasis on ""where possible."" There aren't too many oranges grown in Idaho.) By eating foods produced as close to my home as possible, I support the local economy, less fossil fuels are used, and the food should have fewer preservatives, hormones, and other chemical ingredients. Best of all, the food should be fresher and more flavorful. Yes, it will cost more, but I think it will be worth it. At least I'm willing to try it. Consider it an experiement. I've already found local sources of milk, eggs and meat that I'm going to try. I found Pollan's writing engaging and easy to read. (Disclaimer: I am a huge nerd, and the topic really spoke to me. If you don't like science, you may not find this book as fascinating.) A few words of warning: if evolution makes you uncomfortable, you may not like this book, as it often talks about the evolution of plants, animals and humans. Also, there were two or three instances where objectionable language was used. "
46,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4161947-m-l-rudolph,5,"2006. NY Times Book Review One of the 10 Best Books of the Year. We eat every day of our lives but we don't often give much thought to what we put in our bodies. If we are what we eat, then when it comes to meat, we are what the animal eats; and when it comes to produce, we are what the plant's grown in. There's a food chain that extends around the world and throughout evolutionary history from the beginning of man. Michael Pollan takes us on a tour of that chain and in the process gives any thinking, eating, person a new, often disturbing, view of what he/she consumes.Organized in three sections to illuminate industrial food (corn), pastoral food (grass), and personal food (the forest), Pollan's narrative builds toward meals made as nearly as possible with ingredients and methods from each of these categories.I double-dog-dare anyone to read this book and walk through a modern supermarket without viewing each item of food differently. And if you're like me, take your glasses, because the real information about what we buy and eat is in the small print, written in code, to disguise as much as possible what we truly consume. The central area of the supermarket is processed food. Good luck figuring that out. (When you can't determine the identity of fifteen out of eighteen ingredients on that package of processed whatever - chances are high what you're reading - and eating - are corn derivatives.) Around the walls, where we find the produce, meat, and fish, it would seem that the information describing the food would be more straight-forward. Good luck figuring that out, too. (Chances are every formerly living item was nourished or fertilized with corn or corn derivatives.)Unless you plan to follow a steer or a chicken through its life cycle to see how the animal lives, and dies, and becomes the food on your plate, you have to rely on someone like Pollan to take that trip for you, document his findings, and present it as he does here. I've read about food my entire life and tried to keep up on healthy eating without succumbing to fads, but I've never encountered such an intelligent, entertaining, and practical guide to the state of food in America today as The Omnivore's Dilemma. Read it and eat. "
47,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36341-c,5,"Pollan's book is not just a fascinating look at the modern state and evolution of our industrial food complex; it's not merely an anthropological investigation of the history of eating and cultural rituals; it's more than a scientific discourse of the biological nature of corn, small farm ecosystems, and fungi -- it's also, surprisingly, a page turner. When I was finished, I wanted the book to be twice as long.The book is also not (as many people seem to think) a political screed or manifesto -- Pollan isn't necessarily telling everyone to stop eating industrial food and switch to local, small farm food, as he acknowledges how impractical such a course of action actually is. Rather, he investigates our relationships with food, both personal and societal, scientific and ethical. He does find the industrial complex distasteful and disturbing and the small, sustainable farm he visits ideal but (and perhaps this is the choir appreciating the sermon) those conclusions seem inescapable.This book didn't change any of my ideas about eating, as I already try to eat locally and avoid processed food, but I learned a lot about the nature of food, from how terrifyingly omnipresent corn is to the amazingly complex ecosystem of a farm. It's one of those books that you constantly put down so you can turn to someone and say ""Oh my god, did you know that . . . """
48,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"This book has profoundly changed my view on my food, and subsequently, my world. I have read many nonfiction books, but nothing was so personal as this investigation on where our food comes from. Pollan sets put to investigate four markedly different food chains, and ends up having to revise his world view, and acquire new friends in search for a profound understanding of food, nature, and humanity.I have finished this on Feb 28, 2019. I will write a longer review when I collect my thoughts. There is plenty of food for thought (pardon the pun... did not intend it but hey, it fits.)"
49,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4123952-alasse,5,"I was so scared that this would turn out to be a foodie hipster's rant on what food should be like, instead of what it actually is. I'm relieved to admit that I was mistaken - in fact, it's one of the most thought-provoking books I've read this year. It's helped me to fully flesh out some apprehensions I had which I'd never actually put into words, such as 'Is organic really about chemical paranoia?' 'What's the environmental impact of mindlessly shipping food all over the continent?' 'How in the world does that even make sense economically?' Okay, that last one I had actually wondered about, more than once. I used to have a long commute.The Omnivore's Dilemma is also less location specific than Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal, which was a plus for me. I love reading about American lifestyles and behaviors (it's the whole deep-down-i-know-we're-next thing), but most of the industrial talk doesn't really apply to me. Pollan did a great job of giving a panoramic view of all the different approaches to eating in the first world, that's true. But mostly, it was his naturalist's view of things that made his discourse universal and relatable for me.Also, I've realized I have some very strong and mostly unfair prejudices against hunters. A book that manages to make me change my mind on a particular subject* is a book that deserves 5 stars. Shame on me.What else? Oh, apparently now I find ecology fascinating, which poses a new TBR list control challenge. F****ck.*while quoting a lot of Ortega y Gasset, I might add. Ortega FTW!! I went through an Ortega phase when I was like 17, so anyone who quotes Ortega to prove a point instantly gets bonus points with me."
50,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,3,"I grew up on a farm in Michigan where we grew corn and soybeans. The years when we rotated our crops to grow field corn, it was harvested to feed the chickens at the local egg farm. Thus I have some first hand experience with the first few chapters of the Omnivore’s Dilemma and the chapter on the farm rang especially true for me.This book is popular and enough time has passed that it probably qualifies as a classic and is certainly worth a read. It is a honest portrayal by a professor on the modern US food web highlighting many of the problems of our modern omnivore society spanning the spectrum from steroids to animal ethics. There were four chapters that I would consider as excellent: The Farm, The Feedlot, Grass and the Forager. The other twenty chapters were ok.I had no issue with the messaging of the book and wholly agree that it is important to understand where our modern food comes from. I will admit that I promptly ate organic vegetarian for my next meal after finishing the book as there are a few unpleasant facts associated with meat processing. I am sure I will become a carnivore again by tomorrow.I did have a few problems with the construction of the book however.1. At times it strayed from the science and empirical observations to become a little too professorial or perhaps too philosophical. This choice was understandable but gave me a meh kind of feeling.2. At times the book was a bit boring, although there were some intriguing chapters mixed throughout the book.3. I did not like most of the chapter titles such as Slaughter is a Glass Abattoir. Keep it simple like Cows, Corn, Chickens, Grass and the messaging of the chapter would resonate more.I rate the book at 3.5 stars."
51,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66672731-michael-jandrok,4,"I have always been interested in food culture, though I would have never considered myself to be a “foodie” in the strictest sense. That term always carried a bit of hipster baggage to my mind. I would tend to picture modern U.S. food culture as a sort of hummus-slathered menu dominated by low-fat recipes meant to reflect the popular diet trends of the day. Those attitudes began to change for me when I was diagnosed with cancer. Suddenly food became a big deal for me, first as something that I actively avoided as my appetite dwindled and my daily routine ran to getting as many calories in my body as I could, regardless of the delivery system. As someone living with colorectal cancer, food was a tough sell for me as the disease progressed. My tastes changed and most foods that I used to love became alien to me. But a funny thing happened as my treatment started to take hold and my appetite slowly began to return. I began to consciously embrace “foodie” culture with an eye towards expanding my palate and eating healthier. A big part of this ongoing effort has been educating myself on what would be the “right” things to eat given that I had a disease that directly affected my tastes and digestive functions. I didn’t want specific “diet” books, per se. What I wanted and needed was comprehensive information on what constitutes food itself, with an eye towards the science and sociology of developing better food habits and cooking techniques. Before my disease took hold, I was a 5’5”, 165 pound ball of muscle and muffin top, still trying to fit into size 34 jeans. At the peak of the cancer, when I was at my lowest point physically, I was 106 pounds and looked like a shell of my former self. After a year and a half of treatment, I am back up to 140 pounds, due in large part to eating better and making more informed choices as to the food that I put into my body. I can thank books like “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” for giving me a respectable knowledge base to make those wise culinary decisions. Author Michael Pollan has been writing about food for many years now. This book was originally published in 2006 and was one of his earlier efforts at culinary writing. The material has aged well. I do think that we have become a bit smarter as a food culture in the intervening years, but the basic information presented here is still valid and useful. I will take a moment here to caution prospective readers that Pollan’s visit to a large-scale feedlot and the rendering plant is graphic and somewhat disturbing. One can’t read these sections and not begin to question what it means to consume beef. The premise of the text is pretty simple and the nature of the ""omnivore's dilemma"" can be summed up quite nicely: as creatures that can eat virtually anything, the big question can be defined as ""what SHOULD we eat?” Pollan sets out to find the answer to this question by tracing 4 meals back to their sources. IN the course of the book he dissects a fast food meal, a store-bought organic entree, a ""beyond organic"" meal produced entirely at a polyculture farm, and a meal that he hunts and gathers (almost) entirely by himself. Along the way, he asks the reader to join him in his quest for a more thorough knowledge of the food that we eat and a better understanding of how the decisions that we make as food consumers help to shape our cultural and physical landscape.This is an intensely interesting book, and an important addition to the bookshelf for anyone interested in becoming more ""food-aware"". Pollan's journey is always engaging, sometimes spiritual (""we are what we eat…."" takes on a new dimension when one stops to look at it with this much depth), and occasionally frightening. He is always respectful of his cast of characters, and he is willing to challenge his own preconceptions and ideas as he gathers knowledge and experience. Note that there are no recipes to be found within these pages, nor any specific information on the art of cooking. This is a book that is fully invested in talking about food as a consumer product; what it is, where it comes from, and what the impacts and implications are when you decide to make a food consumption choice.Michael Pollan strikes me as a fairly engaging and nice guy. I’d like to sit down to a meal with him and talk shop. I learned a lot from this book that I can actively put into practice as I seek to modify my eating habits with an eye towards maximum health benefits. Along with that I gained some ways to make more responsible choices as a food consumer, and that’s just as important as the health angle for me. I’ll be seeking out more of Pollan’s food writing.Coda #1: After reading a number of reviews for this book, I can honestly say that this is a pretty polarizing piece of writing. A substantial number of vegetarians and vegans panned the book because of its acceptance of what Pollan would call “responsible” meat consumption. And there is no doubt that the author does indeed support the idea that eating meat can be done in an ethical fashion. I won’t rehash the arguments in the reviews here. Having a background in anthropology I can tell you that from a biological perspective humans have absolutely evolved as omnivores. Those canine teeth in your mouth didn’t appear because primates had an exclusively vegetarian diet, they are there specifically for the catching of prey and the tearing of meat. That said, we would do well as a species to eat a lot LESS meat, and there is no denying the environmental damage that is done by widespread meat consumption. Coda #2: That idea of responsible meat consumption is central to Pollan’s ideas. But it’s larger than just meat. The whole idea here is to gain a more thorough understanding of where our food comes from and from there develop better and more responsible food habits. Modern supermarket culture has taken away a lot of the basic knowledge of food...where it comes from, how it is grown or raised, etc. Pollan states outright that we would all be better off if we once again gained a real connection to our food, one that goes well beyond opening a can or a package and dropping something into a pot to warm it up. That concept alone makes “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” valuable and worthwhile.Coda #3: Another criticism of the book centered on Pollan himself, and the idea that the concepts in “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” can only be absorbed and put into action by an affluent audience. I’m not really sure I buy this argument. It’s true that “foodie” culture seems to have a footprint squarely in a sort of urban-hipster vibe, but the fact is that lower-income folks can put any of the ideas in this book into action just the same as any other demographic. In point, much has been made in the news lately of the current regime’s idea to hand out “food boxes” in place of letting assistance recipients make their own food choices. That would mean a direct impact on the farmer’s markets who accept assistance payments. That tells me that plenty of lower-income people have learned how to make healthy and ethical culinary choices that stretch their food dollars to the max. "

54,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/693262-huyen,5," If i could think of this book as a meal, then indeed Michael Pollan is a marvelous cook. He writes well, vividly and convincingly.As dense and informative as it is, the book doesn't make me feel bloated, but nourished :] I can't remember the last time I have discussed a book so many times, with so many different people. Chapter 17 on the ethics of eating animals is just mind-blowing and alone can make this book a worthwhile read.i can't resist talking about it before anything else. I've tried to become a vegetarian a couple of times and have always eventually lapsed back into eating meat. The main reason I would ever become a vegetarian is environmental, the huge amount of energy expended in producing and preserving meat. I've always found the ethics of eating meat hard to defend on the moral basis. And it's fascinating to see a person do it convincingly like Pollan. Pollan starst with Peter Singer's argument against eating meat. A wonderfully simple but powerful idea: ""if possessing a higher degree of intelligence does not entitle one human to use another for his or her own ends, how can it entitle humans to exploit non-humans for the same purpose?"". Leaving aside the problematic question of how we define animal ""intelligence"", there is no debate as to whether animals can suffer. And if we have extended equal rights to women, minorities, homosexuals, should we and why don't we extend these rights to other species? ouch. most people, like me, when faced with this question and thinking about it seriously, either look away or become vegetarians. it is difficult to reconcile our instincts to eat meat and the moral implications of it. but Pollan shows us that those are not the only two alternatives.He argues that while animals rightists have always stressed the suffering of animals due to our meat eating habits (although we have rather slim evidence of exactly what goes on in the brain of a pig about to go to heaven, (or hell?)), they have also failed to acknowledge that humans are capable of giving animals a decent and happy life. and ""happy"" in this case means the ability to do what they would naturally do, either pigs rooting around in the dirt, or cows wandering on pastures. ""to think of domestication as a form of slavery or even exploitation is to miscontrue that whole relationship-to project a human idea or power onto what is in fact an example of mutualism or symbiosis between species."" as he points out, domestication is an evolutionary development. domesticated animals have a much higher chance of surviving than in the wild, compare dogs and wolves for example. they therefore evolve to serve human benefits, winning our favor, in order to be provided with shelter and protection. they probably don't like being killed very much, but if that gives them a longer life and a much better chance to spread their genes to the next generation, they would much rather be with us than be in nature. ""predation is not a matter of morality or of politics, it, too, is a matter of symbiosis. from the point of view of the individual prey animal predation is a horror, but from the point of view of the group-and of its gene pool-it is indispensable."" That is exactly the point that most animals rightists miss. they concern only with individuals, but nature doesn't work that way, no matter how cruel that might sound. nature is about maximizing the survival of the whole species. our morals were developed to help us function as a healthy, cooperative society, but it is rather irrelevant to what should happen in nature.Pollan charges that this very embraced and apparently self-righteous ""ideology"" is a product of an urban society which has lost touch with nature. A friend of mine told me that he took his children to a slaughterhouse to see how pigs are killed because he believes that if we want to eat meat, we should be able to face the morality involved in it. that, i think, is a respectable viewpoint. the children were slightly disturbed but it didn't stop them eating meat. this father is probably an exception in our society. most of us probably have never raised a cow and seen a cow. our meat comes from nice little packages that never remind us of that it comes from something that used to have a brain and can suffer. when i asked my NZ friends why people no longer eat animal organs, like we do in Vietnam, they stared at me with disturbed looks. but really, when you think about it, offal is very nutritious, and there's little reason why we can accept eating meat, but not kidney, heart, or brain. i suspect the reason is the viscera brings home to us the fact that what we are eating used to be quite similar to us, which means, having eyes, lungs, heart. and we are so scared to face that reality that we get rid of it altogether. the second reason is that once the meat production process is out of sight, we have lost the traditional rituals justifying the act of killing and governing the slaughter of animals. the disappearance of these old practices gives way to the brutalization of animals to the extent that the animals become so sick that we have pretty much run out of anti-biotics.but that is not the same as to say that we can eat meat carefree without any moral consideration. given the fact that our food chain has become increasingly industrialized and heavily dependent on fossil fuels, we do have a moral obligation to care about the health of nature, i.e, the condition of the soil, the health of the animals we eat, the impact of animal farming on the environment. I can't agree more with him that while we don't need or arguably shouldn't give up our meat consumption, we should at least make sure that the way we eat is sustainable and the animals we eat are treated decently. the way that animals are treated in most farms is quite despicable. and i bet that if we had a chance to look at it, most would quite happily choose to be vegetarian. giving animals a humane treatment does not only give us a clear conscience but really serves our benefits as well. who would not want to eat a healthy chicken instead of a disease-ridden one? recently, when a documentary about the treatment of pigs in battery farms in NZ was broadcast on TV, the public displayed outrage at what they saw and have pushed quite vigorously for legislation prohibiting cruel treatment of farm animals  see here. i don't know of progress elsewhere. i like the idea that once the public know about what's happening to what they eat, they can make a difference.most of the rest of the book deals with corn and how our (meaning American) food chain has been reduced to a monoculture of soy and corn. they are present in something like 75% of the processed food products on the market. 40% of the calories a Mexican eats comes from food. if you think that's quite astonishing, then apparently American have overtaken Mexicans to be kings of walking corns. corn became the winner in the competition to be human's favorite crop because of its capacity to store a lot more calories than other species. the invention of fertilizers (interestingly made widely available by the surplus ammonium nitrate after the war) made growing corn so incredibly efficient that corn gradually replaced all other crops. and in the 1950s, feeding cattle on feedlots was cheaper than on grass, enabling the farmers to build massive chicken factories. livestock farmers went out of business because they couldn't compete with giant factories. fertilizer was a mixed blessing because the soil fertility shifted from reliance on the sun and a careful rotation of crops, to fossil fuels. we might like to think that fertilizers make agriculture a lot more efficient, but in fact, we expend twice as much energy to produce corn than when we relied on nature. and that's not to mention the huge cost of environmental pollution.when corn got cheaper and cheaper, the Nixon government stepped in to subsidize it, encouraging growing even more corn of lower nutritional quality and sparking the beginning of agribusiness. the excess corn finds its way into most processed energy-dense foods and feeding livestock. getting rid of this huge amount of excess energy contributes to obesity and an impoverished food culture. it makes good economic sense to dump excess corn on cattle, but biologically, they evolved to eat grass, and being forced to eat something they are not supposed to eat has caused grave problems. in a shit hole with piles of waste, polluted air and water and no space to even wiggle their tails, the only way these cows can survive is to swallow humongous amounts of anti-biotics. that sounds quite depressing, but the organic industry doesn't really hold a torch toward a moral utopia as we would hope. Pollan points out that the organic industry has diverged exponentially from its original ideals in the 1960s, and is now not so much better than the establishment. they consume a huge amount of energy to transport their products across the country, most ""free range"" farms mean that the chicken has a palm-sized window to look at the sun 5 minutes a day. real organic farmers have a hard time to get their products on the market because of government regulations. to me it seems like America's unsustainable food consumption is perpetuated by a cycle of ignorance and government intervention. so much for laissez-faire capitalism. growing so much corn might seem to make good economic sense. we must admit that it's quite remarkable that this is the first time in human history, we can produce food so cheaply and so abundantly. but this is the thing that has always not sat right with me about economics. that it hides all the expensive external costs involved in the process: environmental degradation, costs to the government in terms of subsidies, a huge consumption of fossil fuels, public health and malnourishment. so in fact, eating cheap corn is very expensive. so the key question is WHY is America doing all these things that defy logic? to summarize the whole story in one word, I'd say efficiency. feeding corn to livestock is so much cheaper and easier than grass (don't have to wait for grass to grow). and it supports a legion of other industries: the chemical and biotech industries, the food industry, the oil industry, pharma, agribusiness. If we keep in mind that hunter-gathers didn't become agriculturists out of choice, but because they depleted the animals they were hunting, it makes me worry what will happen to us when we deplete our soil and degrade our environment so the same disastrous extent. the food price riots in 2007/8 give us a glance at how depressing such a world would be.but this book isn't just depressing, it's enlightening and inspiring. it shows us that there ARE alternatives to the status quo: eat local, subscribe to a farm you know, and as he says in ""In defense of food"", then simply ""eat food, not too much, mostly plants"". I find Michael Pollan a remarkable writer, very humble and articulate. I can't recommend this book too highly."
55,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,5,"We are a notably unhealthy people obsessed by the idea of eating healthily (p. 3).Michael Pollan's Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals is a critique of industrial farms: they raise animals shoulder to shoulder standing in their own manure, feeding them foods that they are not designed for and which make them ill, and then use chemicals to compensate for these sins. Who knew that we are corn-eaters – not directly, like Mexicans, but through our cattle and chickens, and in processed foods.“When you look at the isotope ratios,.. we North Americans look like corn chips with legs.” Compared to us, Mexicans today consume a far more varied carbon diet: the animals they eat still eat grass (until recently, Mexicans regarded feeding corn to livestock as a sacrilege); much of their protein comes from legumes; and they still sweeten their beverages with cane sugar."" (p. 23)Pollan looks at industrial and pastoral farms, briefly flirts with being a vegetarian, then becomes a hunter/gatherer. He doesn't ""look"" the way I would, but goes out in the field, visiting and working farms, learning to hunt (and kill), and to gather wild mushrooms. Each major step on his journey is punctuated with a meal.Our typical, industrial farm, Pollan argues, is not healthy for us (making us obese), not healthy for the animals (making them ill), and not healthy for the soil and environment (using vast amounts of oil to raise food in a monoculture). He may something good about this kind of farming, but I've forgotten it. This farming is good for conglomerates – making them rich – but not farmers or consumers.His week on Joel Salatin's pastoral farm is fascinating – even for me, a vegetarian of more than 40 years. Salatin is a libertarian, deeply suspicious of government and governmental intervention. However, hw is a scientist's kind of farmer. He recognizes that everything is connected, so considers how to balance the activity and placement of cattle, chickens, pigs, and trees, each entering an environmental niche at a time that makes sense for the animals and farm, keeping all healthy while being largely chemical-free. As Salatin argues:""Society is not bearing the cost of water pollution, of antibiotic resistance, of food-borne illnesses, of crop subsidies, of subsidized oil and water—of all the hidden costs to the environment and the taxpayer that make cheap food seem cheap. No thinking person will tell you they don’t care about all that. I tell them the choice is simple: You can buy honestly priced food or you can buy irresponsibly priced food.” (p. 243)Finally, Omnivore's Dilemma is an ode to mindful, grounded eating, praising the food from Salatin's farm, but also that hunted and gathered in Sonoma and the Bay Area of California. He drools not just as be eats, but as he prepares to do so (although some of what he must do brings him close to losing his lunch), For Pollan, a meal that is eaten in full consciousness of what it took to make it is worth preparing every now and again, if only as a way to remind us of the true costs of the things we take for granted (pp. 409-410). He ends up in favor of locally-grown and harvested foods, foods with few chemicals, foods where we own the costs of eating.Pollan convinces me – not to eat cow, as some parts of Omnivore's Dilemma would be well-served with Sinclair Lewis's The Jungle. He does convince me to invest in local farms. I had been considering dropping my CSA membership in favor of the farmer's market, but decided against this so I support local farmers (mine is a cooperative of 12 Amish farms and includes a handwritten letter by one farmer each week). We have been decreasing our consumption of processed foods, but Omnivore's Dilemma will likely speed up this process. And, I will hesitate – I can't promise more – the next time I am looking at vegetables from half-way around the world.As Claude Lévi-Strauss argued, food must be “not only good to eat, but also good to think” (quoted on p. 289). Pollan's food-writing is thoughtful, and I enjoyed Omnivore's Dilemma as much for the writing as the content. And, he is dryly humorous.Pollan clears Lévi-Strauss's bar."
56,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/394959-susan,2,"While I read this book, I couldn't help but think about the muckrakers of the early 20th century. This book is pretty much nothing like The Jungle, starting with the fact that it is nonfiction, but its goal isn't that far away. It's telling a story about a part of our food industry that we don't normally think to ask about and painting a picture that should make us angry enough to do something about it.And don't get me wrong, Pollan rakes a lot of really good muck. Mostly it's his interpretation of his muck that doesn't work for me.I think the really important information comes in the first half of the book. Pollan gives us a crash course in agriculture subsidies. He compares our currently corn-focused subsidy structure to historic subsidies that were geared toward a broader spectrum of food. Then he goes into detail about what it means to live in a food chain that is designed to produce the most corn at the cheapest price. The answer? Corn is essentially in every processed food we eat. Meanwhile, corn farmers can barely keep their farms afloat because the price has been pushed down so far that they can barely produce enough product to cover their mortgages, and they dump so much fertilizer onto their fields to raise production that it ends up leeching into the water supply all the way to the ocean.Pollan then takes the corn story to the cattle industry and gives us a pretty ugly picture of what it means to raise corn-fed cattle. We thought that corn-fed cattle were a good thing, right? It's advertised on the stickers on our steaks. Except that cow biology rejects corn. The resulting situation not only makes the lives of the cows highly questionable at best, but it presents some very real health concerns for we the consumers.Buying organic fixes the problem, right? Wrong. Large-scale organic produce and livestock may not be what you think they are. Think your chickens are free-range? That just means they need to have access to the outdoors, which they are trained never to use. Corporate organic livestock is raised in environments little better than its non-organic counterpart, and they're probably fed corn too.OTOH, Pollock's story actually made me more positive about organic produce. One thing that organic regulations do accomplish is requiring a use of fertilizer that is not nearly so destructive to the environment.All of this stuff is good stuff to know. In fact, I'd like to look for some other sources of this information so I deepen my knowledge and cross-check Pollan. The place where he loses me is in his interpretation.This book got a lot of people justifiably riled up about the quality of their food and the state of their food production. And where does Pollan direct them? To back yard gardens and small family farming operations. In large part from this book, the bourgeois Localvore movement sprang up. So if you have enough money to pay twice the price for your food or the free time to produce it yourself, then you can have the satisfaction of opting out of the flawed food chain while leaving it essentially unimproved. A whole new luxury food industry has grown up to provide local food to the Localvores. Meanwhile, the corn subsidies and all their consequences continue unabated.The problem as I see it is that Pollan wraps up aesthetics with his practicality. Aesthetically, he is drawn to family farms where there are a lot more workers per square acre, a larger variety of produce and livestock are produced, and resources are used in a way he perceives as more efficient. The problem is that these qualities might make him feel good, but they don't actually address most of the problems he brought up in his muckraking. One of the sections that got my goat most was a several-page indictment of Value Added. You see, when companies make breakfast cereal, they take corn, puff it up, color it, put sugar on it, and (gasp) sell it for more than the price of the corn! The horrors of those corporate money grubbers!Look. Value Added is a core economic concept. I don't suppose Pollan expected people to pay the same amount for his book as the cost of the wood pulp used to make the paper. I suppose he wanted to be paid more for writing it than the cost of the computer he composed it on. And what's his solution to paying for overpriced processed corn? To pay more for food that comes from the right farm. So which Value Added is legitimate and which one isn't? It seems to me that food production needs four core traits. It needs to be: - Responsible: Producing it doesn't destroy the land, the water supply, or the consumers. - Plentiful: There's enough produced to feed everyone. - Reliable: Every weather fluctuation doesn't put us in danger of a shortage or a famine. - Cheap: Affordable to as many people as possible who need to eat.Pollan really only addresses the first of these four issues, and that in an incomplete manner. His solutions pretty much stomp on Plentiful and Cheap. Back yard gardens and family farms are not going to be able to produce enough food to feed a majority of Americans, no matter what they are willing to pay. It's really too bad that we couldn't have directed a lot more of this food production anger toward agricultural subsidy reform instead."
57,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/165589-gwen,3,"The first section of the book, in which Pollan follows the path of corn through the industrial food chain and discusses the effects of corn on our diets, supermarkets, and the environment, is fascinating. Despite being trained in the sociology of agriculture and specifically in the analysis of commodity chains, I learned a lot and found few details to quibble with (the main exception being his tendency to anthropomorphize corn, discussing it as though it intentionally chose to evolve in certain ways). If I were teaching a class on food, I would totally assign that section of the book.The second section of the book is also good, though not as great as the first. Probably this is because I already knew that ""organic"" and ""sustainable"" are not the same and that Horizon-brand organic dairy products come from huge dairies that, from the point of view of the cow, the quality of the milk, and the environment, are little better than regular non-organic ones.But the final section is really annoying me. Most of the things that are irritating me are much more clearly discussed at http://www.powells.com/review/2007_08..., but there were a few other things as well. Pollan keeps talking about how only omnivores have any trouble deciding what to eat, using koalas and cows as examples of animals that, being specialists, don't need to worry about whether something is an acceptable food source or not. Anyone who raises cows will tell you he's highly underestimating cows' experimentation with non-grass foods. They eat weeds and poisonous plants; they get nails and wire and bones stuck in their throats. It's a pain in the ass to have to try to remove a deer vertebra some cow has managed to lodge in her throat. I suppose this seems like a minor detail, except his entire argument is that humans (and other omnivores) are unique in facing problems deciding what is and isn't safe to eat.Connected to that is Pollan's reference to ""human nature"" from time to time, something that drives me nuts when my students do it and is even more exasperating from someone who at least ostensibly has the intellectual capacity and training to not fall back on such a simplistic explanation (that is, ""humans do it, therefore it's human nature""). He seems to buy in to the popular conception that there's a ""human nature"" that we've just smeared a little civilization and culture on top of (think of frosting on a cake).I don't think I can finish the book--I'm increasingly irritated by his tone and the problems with his argument. It's too bad, because the book really did start off well."
58,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20495277-anny,4,"Truly an eye-opener! I absolutely loved the first part of the book about the industrial agriculture. I would've never thought that our humble 'corn' is actually the tyrant of mono-culture farming. Farmers went broke, took a huge debt, taking side jobs driving trailers and depended on their wife salary for the sake of planting corn. Animals (cow, pig, chicken) got ousted from the farm and pasture and cramped into CAFO a.k.a. concentration camp for animals, where they live their short miserable life. First, they were fed food (corn or dubious meat-by-product or whatever cheapest feed available) that is making them sick and making us who eat them sick (mad cows anyone?). Second, they were cramped as much as physically possible, resulting in stressed, depressed, and psychotic animals (often resorting to self-mutilation or cannibalism). Third, they were doused with much antibiotics and medications (because their living conditions made them sick) and hormones and whatnot (to fatten them as much as possible) with who knows what side-effects that might cause for us (antibiotic-resistant bacteria for example).Taking the stand against industrial agriculture were small farms, like Polyface farm owned by Joel Salatin. If CAFO were hell for animals, then Polyface farm must be its heaven. There were so many good things about this farm, suffice to say, if I could buy from there (or any other place that practice sustainable agriculture), I would certainly do so. The last part of the book about hunting and gathering was the part that I liked the least. Too many pages rambling on and on about the ethics of killing animals. It's a weak finish, but the first two parts of the book was definitely worth reading!"
59,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/327527-missy-jean,5,"I can say without hesitation that this is a life-changing book. It's elegantly written and unflinching. Pollan is honest about his own cognitive dissonance about being an omnivore, which means he never sounds self-righteous (an impressive feat for the genre). And I love the widespread anthropomorphism of the book, the mysticism that Pollan is willing to embrace as he cites scientific sources.That said... Halfway through the book I was so depressed that I went home and ate graham crackers dipped in a can of chocolate frosting. All I could think was, so there's no choice! I am going to eat chemicals and toxins and animal byproducts unwittingly every day of my life, and they are going to kill me in the end! By the end of the book, though, I felt like I had a real sense of small measures that I can take to eat in a healthier and more environmentally responsible way. So I went to the farmstand and bought a big old pile of locally-grown buttercup squash, peaches, chard and zucchini. Better than synthetic frosting, right?I think there are a lot of different conclusions that people can draw from this book, and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who wants to be more mindful about what they eat. For me, it validated my penchant for vegetarianism (and my habitual eschewing of McDonalds), but you might get something slightly different from it. (Pollan is not a vegetarian.) Honestly, I don't think I'll ever look at my plate in quite the same way again, and I feel grateful for that."
60,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82365956-veronica,4,"""Yet there are other images of animals on other kinds of farms that contradict the nightmare ones. I'm thinking of the hens I saw at Polyface Farm, fanning out over the cow pasture on a June morning, pecking at the cowpats and the grass...or the image of pig happiness I witnessed in that cattle barn in March, watching the hogs, all upturned pink hams and corkscrew tails, nosing their way through that deep cake of compost in search of alcoholic morsels of corn. It is true that farms like this are but a speck on the monolith of modern animal agriculture, yet their very existence, and the possibility that implies, throws the whole argument for animal rights into a different light."" Pollan knows that the so-called happiness at Polyface Farm could never be scaled to a magnitude sufficient to feed the many required. ""To many animal people even Polyface Farm is a 'death camp'—a way station for doomed creatures awaiting their date with the executioner. But to look at the lives of these animals is to see this holocaust analogy for the sentimental conceit it really is. In the same way we can probably recognize animal suffering when we see it, animal happiness is unmistakable, too, and during my week on the farm I saw it in abundance.""I will permit the possibility of brief animal happiness on a small farm right before the slaughter. Still, the inconvenient reality is that human agriculture contravenes the natural order of predation because we are the only creatures that bring animals into existence in order to slaughter them. The lion does not raise and propagate zebras in a nested enclosure indefinitely and delight in creating more and more efficient ways of slaughtering their offspring. This apparently small detail is conveniently left out in arguments from nature, as I will call them. ""To think of domestication as a form of slavery or even exploitation is to misconstrue that whole relationship—to project a human idea of power onto what is in fact an example of mutualism or symbiosis, rather than a political, development. The animals grew tame and lost their ability to fend for themselves in the wild and the humans traded hunter-gatherer ways for the settled lives of agriculturists. Humans changed biologically, too.""Don't equate the domestication of wolves to the slaughter of chicks. Red herring fallacy. ""[This] is where the animal rightists betray a deep ignorance about the workings of nature."" Again, there is nothing natural about industrial agriculture. ""The very existence of predation in nature, of animals eating animals, is the cause of much anguished hand-wringing in the animal rights literature. 'It must be admitted,' Peter Singer writes, 'that the existence of carnivorous animals does pose one problems for the ethics of Animal Liberation, and that is whether we should do anything about it.' (Talk about the need for peacekeeping forces!)""On the one hand, this made me laugh a bit because I've always been disturbed by the existence of predation in the wild. That many creatures rely on the pain and suffering of other animals in order to live is but a testament to the fallen state of the world, which is also why Jupiter is a purer and superior planet to Earth. But I digress. (My sister has christened this Jupiter propaganda🪐, which I readily admit.)In any event, I've already unravelled this false equivalency between natural predation and the very systematic multiplication of animals bred for the slaughter, season after season. From doom to dust.""Today, the organic food industry finds itself in a most unexpected, uncomfortable, and yes, unsustainable position: floating on a sinking sea of petroleum.""""U.S. agricultural policy, like the Declaration of Independence, is founded on the principle that all carrots are created equal, even though there's good reason to believe this isn't really true.""Birds can't get access to the outdoors until at least 5 weeks old and are slaughtered at 7, so ""free range turns out to be not so much a lifestyle for these chickens as a two-week vacation option.""""From the moment an organic lettuce plant is ready for harvest, the rest of its journey from field to produce aisle follows a swift and often ingenious industrial logic that is only nominally organic.""The fact that steer are given numbers as names makes Holocaust comparisons all too facile...""The farmers desperate to boost yield end up degrading their land, plowing and planting marginal land, applying more nitrogen—anything to squeeze a few more bushels from the soil.""""Nor would such a culture be shocked to discover that there are other countries, such as Italy and France, that decide their dinner questions on the basis of such quaint and unscientific criteria as pleasure and tradition, eat all manner of 'unhealthy' foods, and, lo and behold, wind up actually healthier and happier in their eating than we are. We show our surprise at this by speaking of something called the 'French paradox,' for how could a people who eat such demonstrably toxic substance as foie gras and triple crème cheese actually be slimmer and healthier than we are? Yet I wonder if it doesn't make more sense to speak in terms of an American paradox—that is, a notably unhealthy people obsessed by the idea of eating heathily."""

I learned a lot I didn't know before, but unfortunately I didn't care about my newly acquired knowledge.Also the book is completely US-centric, which makes it for me as an European not quite so interesting.This book is outside of my scope of interest, therefore I refrain from assigning a rating."
62,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,5,"I really like Pollan’s writing style, he brings points home with simplicity, and he is able to cover a lot of ground without the writing feelings unnecessarily circuitous or blustery. More than that though, I like that he is willing to experience. I mean, that’s the very core of responsible journalism, Pollan goes and works on the farms, he helps slaughter chickens, he sits in tractors, he goes hunting and foraging, he throws himself bodily and emotionally into these experiences, and at each point I felt that he was incredibly honest with both himself and the reader about the impacts of his actions and his emotional state.All in all I thought it was refreshingly non-biased, fair appraising look at industrial agriculture/ranching, industrial/artisanal organic agriculture/ranching, and hunting/foraging. I say that as a person literally smack dab in the middle of row-crop country (my husband and his family farms), as a gardener, and as a hunter. I’ve long had a problem with the way we raise meat in this country, and the lack of connection between people and their food. Its one of the reasons that I do hunt and garden, and its also one of the reasons that I’ve mostly switched to plant proteins for all meals except supper. I am continuing to try and evolve how I eat, and it’s a learning experience and I don’t always get it right (I ate spaghettio’s twice in three days last week, no one’s perfect). But its hard to read this book without examining the role that we eaters have in the natural world. I am going to make a concerted effort to eat in-season vegetables except for those that I froze from my garden in the summer, and I’m going to try and rely on our game meats more. Despite reading much about early life on the prairie, somehow I had never considered that even meat was seasonal, or that foods grown out of season lack the nutrition that we think we are getting. They’re both very “duh” concepts, but its not something that I had really appreciated. Nor had I valued the waste of petroleum in shipping year round under-nourished produce from Argentina to the US just so that we could eat whatever fruit or veggie that we want, despite its lack of flavor.Perhaps the greatest thing that came from this was the conversations with my husband. He listened to the audiobook while in the tractor, and it was great to talk to him when he came home at night about the ways agriculture has changed since Pollan wrote (advances in technology have changed the level of precision for farmers, becoming more environmentally friendly for those that upgrade), but also the ways that it could continue to change. What could we do as eaters, hunters, buyers, and producers in our local community? Books that foster conversation and change always get a 5 out of 5.Absolutely recommend to everyone. Read those food labels. Speak out. We deserve, as buyers, connectivity and information about our food, and animals especially deserve better than what we manage for our convenience."
63,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/307041-ginny-messina,3,"A truly important book by gifted writer and journalist Michael Pollan. It's not without its flaws, however, and for all the promise of the first two-thirds of the book, it kind of leaves the reader hanging at the end. In the first part, Pollan exposes the damaging effects of industrial agriculture, and—-importantly—-this includes large-scale organic production which is not nearly as benign as most people would like to believe. Later in the book he addresses the inhumane aspect of industrial agriculture as well—-organic production included. He puts it succinctly: you look away, or you stop eating meat. In the second part of the book, we see farming as it should be, on Polyface Farm in the Shenandoah Valley. Here, farming practices are closely tied to nature including the natural behavior of farm animals. While the system doesn't adhere completely to organic regulations, it is far more sustainable and humane than industrial organic agriculture and certainly more so than conventional agriculture. Polyface Farm is not able to separate itself from industrial agriculture completely (by law, the steer are killed in conventional slaughterhouses) but it still seems like a very nice place. Unfortunately, the scale on which it operates means that this type of sustainable farming can never produce enough food for the U.S. population. Food from farms like Polyface is likely to be available to only a privileged few. The last part of the book struck me as downright nonsensical. Pollan explores the possibility of putting together the ultimate local meal—-one composed of food that he himself has hunted, gathered and grown. But don't try this at home, he says. It is not at all a realistic way to eat. Well—-no—-not if you do it by gathering chanterelle mushrooms with a bunch of chefs from Chez Panisse, hunting wild boar in the California woods, and diving for abalone along a rocky coast. Granted, most Americans would be hard-pressed to produce their own food, but Pollan doesn't even explore the option in any kind of realistic or meaningful fashion. In the end, it appears that the problems associated with food production are insurmountable. Industrial agriculture provides most of the food in this country and is a wasteful and unsustainable system. But more sustainable systems are not realistic for feeding the population. Pollan does not offer any clear cut answers, much to my surprise. (I didn't expect him to solve the problem; I did expect a little guidance!) But the thoughtful reader can still pull together a plan of action to minimize the environmental and ethical cost of a meal. Reduce intake of animal foods. Buy locally-produced food. Grow or produce as much as is realistic for you. Pollan makes his readers think about where their meals come from and how to measure the true cost of our ""inexpensive"" food. This is a must-read for anyone who expresses a desire to live and eat responsibly. "

In it, Pollan imagines three typical meals a contemporary American might eat -- one of fast food, one of Whole Foods-type groceries, and one literally put together through foraging and hunting -- then over the course of 60,000 words shows us exactly, step by minute step, how the ingredients in each meal can be traced back and back until finally reaching a point of a living plant being grown in the ground somewhere, then building us back forward again by showing exactly what happens to that plant step by step as it makes its way from the farm to eventually our mouths.Along the way, then, Pollan gives us an astute history of the post-war industrial agricultural industry; explains why exactly corn is the overwhelming number-one crop now grown in America; gives us the horrifying reasons that most cattle and chicken have to be fed so many antibiotics in order to merely survive under such harsh industrial conditions; demonstrates why in a middle-class consumerist society these conditions have to happen in the first place (that is, because if cows were still grown in the humane way they were in an agricultural society, a McDonald's hamburger would cost $30, and the American people would riot); shows through personal field trips what exactly the difference is between ""cage-free,"" ""free range"" and ""pastured"" eggs, and why one of these options is infinitely better than the others; details why the term ""organic"" on a food label can mean vastly different things depending on the company and circumstances; and shows through illuminating first-hand experience why we are no longer a hunter-gatherer society (namely, because it's exhausting, inefficient, and makes people run the risk of sometimes going entire weeks at a time without finding anything edible to eat).Easily the most interesting book I've read in a decade, The Omnivore's Dilemma has permanently changed the way I now shop for groceries, knowing as I now do so many more details about what each label on a package means, and how different growing circumstances can often literally mean a difference in the resulting food's nutrition (just for one example, how Pollan scientifically proves here that eggs from chickens that are allowed to roam freely on farmland are literally better for you than eggs grown from chickens kept in cages); and although I haven't completely given up fast food, certainly every hamburger I now buy makes me ponder the indescribably monstrous and cruel circumstances by which that cow lived its life, which has already influenced just how many hamburgers I buy in general. (It also makes me understand a lot better why there will always be people around in any society who are more than happy to perform that society's most inhumane tasks, such as rounding up undocumented immigrants, ripping their children away from them, and throwing them into concentration camps while openly laughing in their faces...but that's neither here nor there, I suppose.) To tell the truth, the only reason I read this in the first place was because I was waiting for the day in early June that Pollan's newest book came out, a 600-page whopper called How to Change Your Mind that looks in exhaustive detail at all the latest 21st-century research into the connections between psychedelic drugs, mindfulness, meditation, mental health, what MRIs can teach us about what we've traditionally called the ""soul,"" and a lot more. That book is now finished too, and was just as fascinating as The Omnivore's Dilemma, so keep an eye out for my write-up of that in another couple of weeks.UPDATE 1: I find it utterly fascinating that the only negative reviews here of this book are from vegetarians, who are so upset at Pollan's conclusion that humans as omnivores are perfectly capable of eating meat, they're willing to dismiss every single other vegetarian-friendly thing he has to say. (Ultimately Pollan is pro-vegetable in this book, despite concluding that meat is indeed an edible substance that humans find edible.) A huge part of this book is all about how the politics of any given age has a huge influence over our opinions on the supposedly ""scientifically objective"" subjects of diet and nutrition, and the vitriolic negative reviews of the book by militant vegetarians here simply proves his point all over again.UPDATE 2: After reading other people's reviews, I agree with something I saw a lot of people mention; that a clear sign of how much I loved this book is that people at Twitter eventually got sick of me constantly tweeting about it while I was reading it. Be prepared to drive your friends and spouse crazy!"

Well, Actually, Eat Sh*t and Flourish. Each of these would have been a more classy title for the book ""Omnivore's Dilemma"". To paraphrase another reviewer 'The dude structures this book by following the path of four finished meals from origin to plate - one McDonald's meal, one comprised of supermarket organic products, one from a ""beyond-organic"" self-sustaining farm in Virginia, and one he forages almost entirely on his own. This book tries to provokes a lot of thought about the origins of our food and the biological, political, social and economic implications of those origins, and for the most part, it is successful.' So after reading this book I realize that maybe, just maybe, I don’t argue with people about food enough. Ever since I read  Fast Food Nation  and watched  Supersize Me  I have been pretty good about avoiding eating at Mc-stablishments and drinking soda. Knowing these efforts aren’t enough, but not having had the ...chutzpah ... to make the leap to full fledged, ""morally superior"" vegetarianism. I am way to lazy to manage an urban garden, -- preferring rather to watch one made on TV OD presents, as a moral alternative to growing, actually hunting and eating wild game. The parts of the book that describe this stuff, although not seemingly not feasible, reinforced these previously formed notions about foraging. Still, it is pretty interesting to see the details fleshed out.One thing discussed in the book that i hadn't internalized, and that makes sense when I think about it, is that going to whole foods and buying an organic Chilean artichoke in the winter can be a lot worse ethically than eating a fat juicy steak from a locally raised mature grass fed cow. I guess that the ethical answer culled from the book on how to shop food in the city is to buy at farmers markets or join one of these CSA’s. Take the extra step and get to know your farmer, know how they grow, know how they feed and treat the animals is the right thing to do. This seems like undue effort and cost but the ethical equivalent seems to be to hunt and dress bloody dead animals or forage for mushrooms in central park. In that perspective, the first options seems like less effort ."

These range from the nearby McDonald's and Burger Kind to the supermarket to the local farmer's stand. Michael Pollan takes a look at four ways to have a meal - one industrial meal at McDonald's, one organic meal from Whole Foods, one local meal from a farmer's field, and one completely ""homemade"" meal made from hunting and foraging.I must say, the first 300 pages are riveting, absolutely enthralling! I kept putting aside fiction to read this book, it was so good! However, when I hit the chapters on hunting and foraging, I found my interest severely waning. I really don't care at all about hunting animals and foraging for mushrooms, so keeping my attention was nearly impossible (this is why I took off a star). But the end picks up as Pollan returns to the final ""perfect"" meal.This book had so much really good information - information that once again cements my desire never to eat food at a fast food restaurant ever again. If one of your New Year's Resolutions is to eat healthier, read this book to bolster that desire!!"
70,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666003-silvana,4,"A mind-opening journey through some parts of the so-called food system. The parts on farming, the evils of monoculture, the importance of grass, were especially enlightening. I don't normally eat beef and I would definitely reduce the intake even more. The most shocking part for me was the 'pastoral organic' revelation. I wonder if the organic products sold in Indonesia as are bad as the greenwashed examples in this book, which are all about the US market. The later parts of the book - hunting and cooking - were not as interesting for me as the earlier parts. Hence the four stars. Still, a fascinating read and highly recommended to everyone."
71,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/669573-kathrynn,1,"I am not enjoying this book and it is not what I thought. For me, the author needs to get to the point and stop rambling. I'm having to use all my brain cells to process THE POINT. Not a light read. Author's writing style doesn't mesh with my brain wiring. No go for me. Disappointing. Moving on."
72,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/375767-joanna,4,"April 2012 update to add- I no longer pay big bucks for a dozen eggs, because I haven't bought an egg in more than 2 years! I support a small flock of happy chickens instead.Lengthy review to come. In the meantime, let me just say---I learned a lot from this book. I also enjoyed some segments very much. I would have done some extensive editing.The final chapter is sublime. OK, my real review:I am a convenience eater. Michael Pollan's work is transforming me into a conscious eater. Two concrete changes in my behavior: I will now pay the price of a fancy mocha coffee beverage for a dozen eggs gathered from happy chickens. I will also see commercially available breaded chicken with a side of corn as corn dressed with corn and a side of corn. I still may eat it, but at least I know what I'm getting!It is my hope that these wonderful books I have been reading indicate an American paradigm shift, and that the marketplace will allow people like me (who don't want to spend the time and effort tracking down purveyers of all sorts of specialty foods) more chances to make conscious choices in a convenient way. I will do my best to make choices that are more healthful for me and our planet regardless.This book was successful in changing my behavior. In large part, it was successful because I was already ripe for changing. Everything from Kingsolver's Animal Vegetable Miracle to Buford's Heat to Van Draanen's sweet young adult novel Flipped has been telling me to embrace these changes. This work built upon that foundation and presented a lot more detailed information supporting the choices that we should all be making. It was well structured, and it needed to be. So much information was packed into each section, it was necessary for me to take breaks. Some peeves---Too many declarative sentences. All declarative sentences put me on guard. (See what I did there?) I read something that says or implies ""all"" and I immediately start casting about defensively for the exceptions. I blame SAT prep. I was also put off by the way in which those declarations seemed designed to make me so defensive, mostly when he seemed dismissive of the travails of gardening, or scornful of the kind of hunter who does not agonize over the creatures' deaths. Second person. I hate second person. Here's a sentence that combined 2 peeves: ""You can forage in the garden, in the way Adam and Eve presumably did, but there isn't much to it: no dilemmas, no hunting stories."" And it's kind of a run on sentence too, now that I look at it, although that (obviously, having read any of my reviews!) isn't such a major irritation for me. (See what I did there?)Rampant anthropomorphism. Corn does not feel happy about taking over the world! Corn does not feel happy! Corn does not feel! This is a Truth. I believe that much of the anthropomorphism here was used as a bit of shorthand, implying all the Darwinian blah blah blah rather than spelling it out, and also trying to fix an image in the mind of the reader, but it is NOT TRUE. It bothers me. (Althoug I do like the image of an army of cornstalks marchng across the landscape, and it truly did stick with me.)LOVED---All descriptions of all meals.All the time spent at the idealized farm. (I forget what it's called and can't be bothered to look it up.)Everything to do with the mushrooms. (I think I'm due to read a book about mushrooms next.)The desription of the first hunt----soooooo true to my one hunting experience, in which I spent every fiber of my being on NOT MAKING ANY NOISE. It was such an intense time, and he captured that beautiully.I feel like there's so much more to say. Suiffice---I enjoyed most of this book. I learned. A lot. "
73,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1242165-schmacko,4,"So much has been written about this book, and so much will be defined by how you feel comfortable when discussing your eating habits. Here are, in short forms, my 10 observations:1)	If you’ve ever wondered how much the American government is responsible for your eating by subsidizing corporations who grow corn and make high fructose corn syrup, this is a book for you! SHORT VERSION: Corn is in EVERYTHING! We committed to growing corn when we could possibly switch to many varied crops. Corn is uniform, so it’s very corporate. If you hate political reading, if you don’t want to know this stuff, or you don’t frankly care, skip Pollan’s book. (Hope you enjoy your diabetes.)2)	Yes, we know organic food is better for us. But Pollan does a great job telling us that the US family’s annual food budget has actually dropped over the last 60 years, so Americans could conceivably spend more on food (and probably less on entertainment) and help out their diets.3)	I thought his section on Whole Foods founder John Mackey was interesting. Mackey completely concedes that he isn’t as radical as he started, that he has basically bought into the American corporate structure in order to take baby steps in supporting a business and helping people eat more healthfully.4)	At times, Pollan sounds a little Communist. At least, anti-Capitalist. I’m ok with that – to each his own – and I believe that American politics is all about constant discourse and adjustment.5)	Knowing the details of a slaughterhouse was a little much for me, but then again, I have no problem killing what I eat. Which makes me unlike 97% of Americans, who like to think their meat comes fully formed in plastic packages.6)	I love how Pollan describes the grey color of a McDonald’s burger. Funny! (I still crave Wendy’s once or twice a month.)7)	Mushroom foraging always sounded like something I wanted to do. Until I read his accounts. Mushroom foragers are crazy, obsessed people!8)	He’s lucky he had help at parts, or Pollan would’ve starved.9)	I like how he concedes that there is a better way to eat meat – that you don’t have to become a militant vegan.10)	I still wish we humans would accept that we are PART of the food chain!!! GRRR! We have canines; we have eaten meat for centuries. Our whole digestive system is built for meat! Lots of animals eat meat. We are not better than other animals that kill; the only thing that could possibly make us better is if we kill as quickly and painlessly as possible. We are the predators, and we should act as such – but with judiciousness and care. When we try to be ABOVE IT ALL – when we manipulate the environment – as Pollan excellently points out – we ruin it. “Dominion” humans create corporate slaughterhouses and run animals to extinction. Vegans treat animals as individuals to be coddled and encouraged to overproduce; soon, we’ll be overrun with deer and pumas and wild boar while we huddle eating berries from the sides of our abandoned roads (vehicles lead to road kill!) We need to accept that humans – like our predator cousins - do kill to survive, that we can be better at it, and that we are not ABOVE the food chain – as meat eaters or vegans – we are part of the system and should act accordingly. (Pollan mentions this, but doesn’t bring it home.)"
74,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260196-peter,5,"I started into this worried it was going to force me into vegetarianism, that I was going to read some passage about calves born into rancid waste, and a blue light somewhere in my brain would turn green and a gag reflex would accompany the thought of meat moving forward....Which speaks either to my penchant for pessimism, or the ominous relationship we have to our food chain, where we _don't_ really want to know how food got there, we just want to eat it.But read the book I did, fearful to encounter that meat-snatching passage within the book. Thankfully, Pollan is not an alarmist, but rather a quite methodical inquisitor about the roots of our food. It sounds kind of..esoteric, but he makes it fascinating, like a great humanities teacher he tells the larger story of food: of why we grow so much fricking corn in America, and how it's bad for almost everyone involved: ourselves, our diet, farmers in other countries.The good thing is that the book never descends into a polemic, unlike Michael Moore's work, Pollan's evenhandedness keeps the reader open to what he is saying. Nothing is extreme or revolutionary or incendiary.I feel like this book will, in the long term, shape the way I think about food by giving me a vocabulary for considering my personal and our cultural relationship to food. He discusses how America as a nation of immigrants never developed a stable national cuisine (unlike France or Italy), and the absence of that makes us vulnerable to an endless array of fad diets (coughAdkinscough) and an overall menu that is out of balance.There is a fascinating chapter on mushrooms and fungi, which details how they are utterly different from plants, and grow from this crazy underground symbiosis with decomposing nutrients and tree roots, taking a single drop of sugar from the tree root in exchange for processed minerals from the soil.There is an extended look at a farm outside Charlottesville--Polyface Farm--which models itself after natural ecosystems and creates this method of rotating cattle and chickens with grass growth cycles to create this wonderful whirlwind of spreadsheets, efficiency, and microdata on growth patterns of grass.To wit: it's better to have grass pasture surrounded by trees, because a blade of grass will burn X calories turning the face of it's blade toward the sun to receive solar energy. Planting forests around removes wind, allowing the grass to grow higher. Brilliant.In the end, it's about food, but it's also about systems in general. It begins to feel like a universal look at the interrelationship of history and commerce, and how everything is this big interconnected fabric, but that you can begin to see some of those connections, and kind of surf those links to great personal and collective gain.12/2007"
75,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1940200-stephanie,4,"It’s not every day you read a book that threatens to change your life. I use the word “threaten” very deliberately, because they are changes that I know I'm going to find challenging.Michael Pollan challenges his readers to examine their food a little closer, to consider where it comes from. And it's a logical request I think. We can spend days searching for the perfect doctor or mechanic, but how much time do we take to really think about our food? Do you know where your steak came from? Is your asparagus from a nearby farm, or far-flung Argentina? Are your peaches organic, and if so, what does that really mean? Most of us have no idea how to answer these questions.In most cases, the answers are simple. Most of our food likely comes from a massive industrial farm or feed-lot hundreds of miles away, fed by incredible amounts of fossil fuels -- the fertilizer, the machines used for harvesting, the trucks it took to transport the food to your local mega-mart, to name just a few uses of fossil fuel. Pollan's descriptions of these farms (and in particular, the feed lots) can be quite disturbing. However, Pollan does not outright condemn this ""industrial food chain."" He concedes that it would be difficult to feed billions of people inexpensively without it. Instead, he advocates having several different avenues for delivering food to our tables, and he describes several alternatives. It is up to the reader to determine how they want to eat. As for me, my eyes have been opened to the appeal of ""eating locally,"" where possible. (Emphasis on ""where possible."" There aren't too many oranges grown in Idaho.) By eating foods produced as close to my home as possible, I support the local economy, less fossil fuels are used, and the food should have fewer preservatives, hormones, and other chemical ingredients. Best of all, the food should be fresher and more flavorful. Yes, it will cost more, but I think it will be worth it. At least I'm willing to try it. Consider it an experiement. I've already found local sources of milk, eggs and meat that I'm going to try. I found Pollan's writing engaging and easy to read. (Disclaimer: I am a huge nerd, and the topic really spoke to me. If you don't like science, you may not find this book as fascinating.) A few words of warning: if evolution makes you uncomfortable, you may not like this book, as it often talks about the evolution of plants, animals and humans. Also, there were two or three instances where objectionable language was used. "
76,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4161947-m-l-rudolph,5,"2006. NY Times Book Review One of the 10 Best Books of the Year. We eat every day of our lives but we don't often give much thought to what we put in our bodies. If we are what we eat, then when it comes to meat, we are what the animal eats; and when it comes to produce, we are what the plant's grown in. There's a food chain that extends around the world and throughout evolutionary history from the beginning of man. Michael Pollan takes us on a tour of that chain and in the process gives any thinking, eating, person a new, often disturbing, view of what he/she consumes.Organized in three sections to illuminate industrial food (corn), pastoral food (grass), and personal food (the forest), Pollan's narrative builds toward meals made as nearly as possible with ingredients and methods from each of these categories.I double-dog-dare anyone to read this book and walk through a modern supermarket without viewing each item of food differently. And if you're like me, take your glasses, because the real information about what we buy and eat is in the small print, written in code, to disguise as much as possible what we truly consume. The central area of the supermarket is processed food. Good luck figuring that out. (When you can't determine the identity of fifteen out of eighteen ingredients on that package of processed whatever - chances are high what you're reading - and eating - are corn derivatives.) Around the walls, where we find the produce, meat, and fish, it would seem that the information describing the food would be more straight-forward. Good luck figuring that out, too. (Chances are every formerly living item was nourished or fertilized with corn or corn derivatives.)Unless you plan to follow a steer or a chicken through its life cycle to see how the animal lives, and dies, and becomes the food on your plate, you have to rely on someone like Pollan to take that trip for you, document his findings, and present it as he does here. I've read about food my entire life and tried to keep up on healthy eating without succumbing to fads, but I've never encountered such an intelligent, entertaining, and practical guide to the state of food in America today as The Omnivore's Dilemma. Read it and eat. "
77,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36341-c,5,"Pollan's book is not just a fascinating look at the modern state and evolution of our industrial food complex; it's not merely an anthropological investigation of the history of eating and cultural rituals; it's more than a scientific discourse of the biological nature of corn, small farm ecosystems, and fungi -- it's also, surprisingly, a page turner. When I was finished, I wanted the book to be twice as long.The book is also not (as many people seem to think) a political screed or manifesto -- Pollan isn't necessarily telling everyone to stop eating industrial food and switch to local, small farm food, as he acknowledges how impractical such a course of action actually is. Rather, he investigates our relationships with food, both personal and societal, scientific and ethical. He does find the industrial complex distasteful and disturbing and the small, sustainable farm he visits ideal but (and perhaps this is the choir appreciating the sermon) those conclusions seem inescapable.This book didn't change any of my ideas about eating, as I already try to eat locally and avoid processed food, but I learned a lot about the nature of food, from how terrifyingly omnipresent corn is to the amazingly complex ecosystem of a farm. It's one of those books that you constantly put down so you can turn to someone and say ""Oh my god, did you know that . . . """
78,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"This book has profoundly changed my view on my food, and subsequently, my world. I have read many nonfiction books, but nothing was so personal as this investigation on where our food comes from. Pollan sets put to investigate four markedly different food chains, and ends up having to revise his world view, and acquire new friends in search for a profound understanding of food, nature, and humanity.I have finished this on Feb 28, 2019. I will write a longer review when I collect my thoughts. There is plenty of food for thought (pardon the pun... did not intend it but hey, it fits.)"
79,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4123952-alasse,5,"I was so scared that this would turn out to be a foodie hipster's rant on what food should be like, instead of what it actually is. I'm relieved to admit that I was mistaken - in fact, it's one of the most thought-provoking books I've read this year. It's helped me to fully flesh out some apprehensions I had which I'd never actually put into words, such as 'Is organic really about chemical paranoia?' 'What's the environmental impact of mindlessly shipping food all over the continent?' 'How in the world does that even make sense economically?' Okay, that last one I had actually wondered about, more than once. I used to have a long commute.The Omnivore's Dilemma is also less location specific than Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal, which was a plus for me. I love reading about American lifestyles and behaviors (it's the whole deep-down-i-know-we're-next thing), but most of the industrial talk doesn't really apply to me. Pollan did a great job of giving a panoramic view of all the different approaches to eating in the first world, that's true. But mostly, it was his naturalist's view of things that made his discourse universal and relatable for me.Also, I've realized I have some very strong and mostly unfair prejudices against hunters. A book that manages to make me change my mind on a particular subject* is a book that deserves 5 stars. Shame on me.What else? Oh, apparently now I find ecology fascinating, which poses a new TBR list control challenge. F****ck.*while quoting a lot of Ortega y Gasset, I might add. Ortega FTW!! I went through an Ortega phase when I was like 17, so anyone who quotes Ortega to prove a point instantly gets bonus points with me."
80,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,3,"I grew up on a farm in Michigan where we grew corn and soybeans. The years when we rotated our crops to grow field corn, it was harvested to feed the chickens at the local egg farm. Thus I have some first hand experience with the first few chapters of the Omnivore’s Dilemma and the chapter on the farm rang especially true for me.This book is popular and enough time has passed that it probably qualifies as a classic and is certainly worth a read. It is a honest portrayal by a professor on the modern US food web highlighting many of the problems of our modern omnivore society spanning the spectrum from steroids to animal ethics. There were four chapters that I would consider as excellent: The Farm, The Feedlot, Grass and the Forager. The other twenty chapters were ok.I had no issue with the messaging of the book and wholly agree that it is important to understand where our modern food comes from. I will admit that I promptly ate organic vegetarian for my next meal after finishing the book as there are a few unpleasant facts associated with meat processing. I am sure I will become a carnivore again by tomorrow.I did have a few problems with the construction of the book however.1. At times it strayed from the science and empirical observations to become a little too professorial or perhaps too philosophical. This choice was understandable but gave me a meh kind of feeling.2. At times the book was a bit boring, although there were some intriguing chapters mixed throughout the book.3. I did not like most of the chapter titles such as Slaughter is a Glass Abattoir. Keep it simple like Cows, Corn, Chickens, Grass and the messaging of the chapter would resonate more.I rate the book at 3.5 stars."
81,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66672731-michael-jandrok,4,"I have always been interested in food culture, though I would have never considered myself to be a “foodie” in the strictest sense. That term always carried a bit of hipster baggage to my mind. I would tend to picture modern U.S. food culture as a sort of hummus-slathered menu dominated by low-fat recipes meant to reflect the popular diet trends of the day. Those attitudes began to change for me when I was diagnosed with cancer. Suddenly food became a big deal for me, first as something that I actively avoided as my appetite dwindled and my daily routine ran to getting as many calories in my body as I could, regardless of the delivery system. As someone living with colorectal cancer, food was a tough sell for me as the disease progressed. My tastes changed and most foods that I used to love became alien to me. But a funny thing happened as my treatment started to take hold and my appetite slowly began to return. I began to consciously embrace “foodie” culture with an eye towards expanding my palate and eating healthier. A big part of this ongoing effort has been educating myself on what would be the “right” things to eat given that I had a disease that directly affected my tastes and digestive functions. I didn’t want specific “diet” books, per se. What I wanted and needed was comprehensive information on what constitutes food itself, with an eye towards the science and sociology of developing better food habits and cooking techniques. Before my disease took hold, I was a 5’5”, 165 pound ball of muscle and muffin top, still trying to fit into size 34 jeans. At the peak of the cancer, when I was at my lowest point physically, I was 106 pounds and looked like a shell of my former self. After a year and a half of treatment, I am back up to 140 pounds, due in large part to eating better and making more informed choices as to the food that I put into my body. I can thank books like “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” for giving me a respectable knowledge base to make those wise culinary decisions. Author Michael Pollan has been writing about food for many years now. This book was originally published in 2006 and was one of his earlier efforts at culinary writing. The material has aged well. I do think that we have become a bit smarter as a food culture in the intervening years, but the basic information presented here is still valid and useful. I will take a moment here to caution prospective readers that Pollan’s visit to a large-scale feedlot and the rendering plant is graphic and somewhat disturbing. One can’t read these sections and not begin to question what it means to consume beef. The premise of the text is pretty simple and the nature of the ""omnivore's dilemma"" can be summed up quite nicely: as creatures that can eat virtually anything, the big question can be defined as ""what SHOULD we eat?” Pollan sets out to find the answer to this question by tracing 4 meals back to their sources. IN the course of the book he dissects a fast food meal, a store-bought organic entree, a ""beyond organic"" meal produced entirely at a polyculture farm, and a meal that he hunts and gathers (almost) entirely by himself. Along the way, he asks the reader to join him in his quest for a more thorough knowledge of the food that we eat and a better understanding of how the decisions that we make as food consumers help to shape our cultural and physical landscape.This is an intensely interesting book, and an important addition to the bookshelf for anyone interested in becoming more ""food-aware"". Pollan's journey is always engaging, sometimes spiritual (""we are what we eat…."" takes on a new dimension when one stops to look at it with this much depth), and occasionally frightening. He is always respectful of his cast of characters, and he is willing to challenge his own preconceptions and ideas as he gathers knowledge and experience. Note that there are no recipes to be found within these pages, nor any specific information on the art of cooking. This is a book that is fully invested in talking about food as a consumer product; what it is, where it comes from, and what the impacts and implications are when you decide to make a food consumption choice.Michael Pollan strikes me as a fairly engaging and nice guy. I’d like to sit down to a meal with him and talk shop. I learned a lot from this book that I can actively put into practice as I seek to modify my eating habits with an eye towards maximum health benefits. Along with that I gained some ways to make more responsible choices as a food consumer, and that’s just as important as the health angle for me. I’ll be seeking out more of Pollan’s food writing.Coda #1: After reading a number of reviews for this book, I can honestly say that this is a pretty polarizing piece of writing. A substantial number of vegetarians and vegans panned the book because of its acceptance of what Pollan would call “responsible” meat consumption. And there is no doubt that the author does indeed support the idea that eating meat can be done in an ethical fashion. I won’t rehash the arguments in the reviews here. Having a background in anthropology I can tell you that from a biological perspective humans have absolutely evolved as omnivores. Those canine teeth in your mouth didn’t appear because primates had an exclusively vegetarian diet, they are there specifically for the catching of prey and the tearing of meat. That said, we would do well as a species to eat a lot LESS meat, and there is no denying the environmental damage that is done by widespread meat consumption. Coda #2: That idea of responsible meat consumption is central to Pollan’s ideas. But it’s larger than just meat. The whole idea here is to gain a more thorough understanding of where our food comes from and from there develop better and more responsible food habits. Modern supermarket culture has taken away a lot of the basic knowledge of food...where it comes from, how it is grown or raised, etc. Pollan states outright that we would all be better off if we once again gained a real connection to our food, one that goes well beyond opening a can or a package and dropping something into a pot to warm it up. That concept alone makes “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” valuable and worthwhile.Coda #3: Another criticism of the book centered on Pollan himself, and the idea that the concepts in “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” can only be absorbed and put into action by an affluent audience. I’m not really sure I buy this argument. It’s true that “foodie” culture seems to have a footprint squarely in a sort of urban-hipster vibe, but the fact is that lower-income folks can put any of the ideas in this book into action just the same as any other demographic. In point, much has been made in the news lately of the current regime’s idea to hand out “food boxes” in place of letting assistance recipients make their own food choices. That would mean a direct impact on the farmer’s markets who accept assistance payments. That tells me that plenty of lower-income people have learned how to make healthy and ethical culinary choices that stretch their food dollars to the max. "

84,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/693262-huyen,5," If i could think of this book as a meal, then indeed Michael Pollan is a marvelous cook. He writes well, vividly and convincingly.As dense and informative as it is, the book doesn't make me feel bloated, but nourished :] I can't remember the last time I have discussed a book so many times, with so many different people. Chapter 17 on the ethics of eating animals is just mind-blowing and alone can make this book a worthwhile read.i can't resist talking about it before anything else. I've tried to become a vegetarian a couple of times and have always eventually lapsed back into eating meat. The main reason I would ever become a vegetarian is environmental, the huge amount of energy expended in producing and preserving meat. I've always found the ethics of eating meat hard to defend on the moral basis. And it's fascinating to see a person do it convincingly like Pollan. Pollan starst with Peter Singer's argument against eating meat. A wonderfully simple but powerful idea: ""if possessing a higher degree of intelligence does not entitle one human to use another for his or her own ends, how can it entitle humans to exploit non-humans for the same purpose?"". Leaving aside the problematic question of how we define animal ""intelligence"", there is no debate as to whether animals can suffer. And if we have extended equal rights to women, minorities, homosexuals, should we and why don't we extend these rights to other species? ouch. most people, like me, when faced with this question and thinking about it seriously, either look away or become vegetarians. it is difficult to reconcile our instincts to eat meat and the moral implications of it. but Pollan shows us that those are not the only two alternatives.He argues that while animals rightists have always stressed the suffering of animals due to our meat eating habits (although we have rather slim evidence of exactly what goes on in the brain of a pig about to go to heaven, (or hell?)), they have also failed to acknowledge that humans are capable of giving animals a decent and happy life. and ""happy"" in this case means the ability to do what they would naturally do, either pigs rooting around in the dirt, or cows wandering on pastures. ""to think of domestication as a form of slavery or even exploitation is to miscontrue that whole relationship-to project a human idea or power onto what is in fact an example of mutualism or symbiosis between species."" as he points out, domestication is an evolutionary development. domesticated animals have a much higher chance of surviving than in the wild, compare dogs and wolves for example. they therefore evolve to serve human benefits, winning our favor, in order to be provided with shelter and protection. they probably don't like being killed very much, but if that gives them a longer life and a much better chance to spread their genes to the next generation, they would much rather be with us than be in nature. ""predation is not a matter of morality or of politics, it, too, is a matter of symbiosis. from the point of view of the individual prey animal predation is a horror, but from the point of view of the group-and of its gene pool-it is indispensable."" That is exactly the point that most animals rightists miss. they concern only with individuals, but nature doesn't work that way, no matter how cruel that might sound. nature is about maximizing the survival of the whole species. our morals were developed to help us function as a healthy, cooperative society, but it is rather irrelevant to what should happen in nature.Pollan charges that this very embraced and apparently self-righteous ""ideology"" is a product of an urban society which has lost touch with nature. A friend of mine told me that he took his children to a slaughterhouse to see how pigs are killed because he believes that if we want to eat meat, we should be able to face the morality involved in it. that, i think, is a respectable viewpoint. the children were slightly disturbed but it didn't stop them eating meat. this father is probably an exception in our society. most of us probably have never raised a cow and seen a cow. our meat comes from nice little packages that never remind us of that it comes from something that used to have a brain and can suffer. when i asked my NZ friends why people no longer eat animal organs, like we do in Vietnam, they stared at me with disturbed looks. but really, when you think about it, offal is very nutritious, and there's little reason why we can accept eating meat, but not kidney, heart, or brain. i suspect the reason is the viscera brings home to us the fact that what we are eating used to be quite similar to us, which means, having eyes, lungs, heart. and we are so scared to face that reality that we get rid of it altogether. the second reason is that once the meat production process is out of sight, we have lost the traditional rituals justifying the act of killing and governing the slaughter of animals. the disappearance of these old practices gives way to the brutalization of animals to the extent that the animals become so sick that we have pretty much run out of anti-biotics.but that is not the same as to say that we can eat meat carefree without any moral consideration. given the fact that our food chain has become increasingly industrialized and heavily dependent on fossil fuels, we do have a moral obligation to care about the health of nature, i.e, the condition of the soil, the health of the animals we eat, the impact of animal farming on the environment. I can't agree more with him that while we don't need or arguably shouldn't give up our meat consumption, we should at least make sure that the way we eat is sustainable and the animals we eat are treated decently. the way that animals are treated in most farms is quite despicable. and i bet that if we had a chance to look at it, most would quite happily choose to be vegetarian. giving animals a humane treatment does not only give us a clear conscience but really serves our benefits as well. who would not want to eat a healthy chicken instead of a disease-ridden one? recently, when a documentary about the treatment of pigs in battery farms in NZ was broadcast on TV, the public displayed outrage at what they saw and have pushed quite vigorously for legislation prohibiting cruel treatment of farm animals  see here. i don't know of progress elsewhere. i like the idea that once the public know about what's happening to what they eat, they can make a difference.most of the rest of the book deals with corn and how our (meaning American) food chain has been reduced to a monoculture of soy and corn. they are present in something like 75% of the processed food products on the market. 40% of the calories a Mexican eats comes from food. if you think that's quite astonishing, then apparently American have overtaken Mexicans to be kings of walking corns. corn became the winner in the competition to be human's favorite crop because of its capacity to store a lot more calories than other species. the invention of fertilizers (interestingly made widely available by the surplus ammonium nitrate after the war) made growing corn so incredibly efficient that corn gradually replaced all other crops. and in the 1950s, feeding cattle on feedlots was cheaper than on grass, enabling the farmers to build massive chicken factories. livestock farmers went out of business because they couldn't compete with giant factories. fertilizer was a mixed blessing because the soil fertility shifted from reliance on the sun and a careful rotation of crops, to fossil fuels. we might like to think that fertilizers make agriculture a lot more efficient, but in fact, we expend twice as much energy to produce corn than when we relied on nature. and that's not to mention the huge cost of environmental pollution.when corn got cheaper and cheaper, the Nixon government stepped in to subsidize it, encouraging growing even more corn of lower nutritional quality and sparking the beginning of agribusiness. the excess corn finds its way into most processed energy-dense foods and feeding livestock. getting rid of this huge amount of excess energy contributes to obesity and an impoverished food culture. it makes good economic sense to dump excess corn on cattle, but biologically, they evolved to eat grass, and being forced to eat something they are not supposed to eat has caused grave problems. in a shit hole with piles of waste, polluted air and water and no space to even wiggle their tails, the only way these cows can survive is to swallow humongous amounts of anti-biotics. that sounds quite depressing, but the organic industry doesn't really hold a torch toward a moral utopia as we would hope. Pollan points out that the organic industry has diverged exponentially from its original ideals in the 1960s, and is now not so much better than the establishment. they consume a huge amount of energy to transport their products across the country, most ""free range"" farms mean that the chicken has a palm-sized window to look at the sun 5 minutes a day. real organic farmers have a hard time to get their products on the market because of government regulations. to me it seems like America's unsustainable food consumption is perpetuated by a cycle of ignorance and government intervention. so much for laissez-faire capitalism. growing so much corn might seem to make good economic sense. we must admit that it's quite remarkable that this is the first time in human history, we can produce food so cheaply and so abundantly. but this is the thing that has always not sat right with me about economics. that it hides all the expensive external costs involved in the process: environmental degradation, costs to the government in terms of subsidies, a huge consumption of fossil fuels, public health and malnourishment. so in fact, eating cheap corn is very expensive. so the key question is WHY is America doing all these things that defy logic? to summarize the whole story in one word, I'd say efficiency. feeding corn to livestock is so much cheaper and easier than grass (don't have to wait for grass to grow). and it supports a legion of other industries: the chemical and biotech industries, the food industry, the oil industry, pharma, agribusiness. If we keep in mind that hunter-gathers didn't become agriculturists out of choice, but because they depleted the animals they were hunting, it makes me worry what will happen to us when we deplete our soil and degrade our environment so the same disastrous extent. the food price riots in 2007/8 give us a glance at how depressing such a world would be.but this book isn't just depressing, it's enlightening and inspiring. it shows us that there ARE alternatives to the status quo: eat local, subscribe to a farm you know, and as he says in ""In defense of food"", then simply ""eat food, not too much, mostly plants"". I find Michael Pollan a remarkable writer, very humble and articulate. I can't recommend this book too highly."
85,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,5,"We are a notably unhealthy people obsessed by the idea of eating healthily (p. 3).Michael Pollan's Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals is a critique of industrial farms: they raise animals shoulder to shoulder standing in their own manure, feeding them foods that they are not designed for and which make them ill, and then use chemicals to compensate for these sins. Who knew that we are corn-eaters – not directly, like Mexicans, but through our cattle and chickens, and in processed foods.“When you look at the isotope ratios,.. we North Americans look like corn chips with legs.” Compared to us, Mexicans today consume a far more varied carbon diet: the animals they eat still eat grass (until recently, Mexicans regarded feeding corn to livestock as a sacrilege); much of their protein comes from legumes; and they still sweeten their beverages with cane sugar."" (p. 23)Pollan looks at industrial and pastoral farms, briefly flirts with being a vegetarian, then becomes a hunter/gatherer. He doesn't ""look"" the way I would, but goes out in the field, visiting and working farms, learning to hunt (and kill), and to gather wild mushrooms. Each major step on his journey is punctuated with a meal.Our typical, industrial farm, Pollan argues, is not healthy for us (making us obese), not healthy for the animals (making them ill), and not healthy for the soil and environment (using vast amounts of oil to raise food in a monoculture). He may something good about this kind of farming, but I've forgotten it. This farming is good for conglomerates – making them rich – but not farmers or consumers.His week on Joel Salatin's pastoral farm is fascinating – even for me, a vegetarian of more than 40 years. Salatin is a libertarian, deeply suspicious of government and governmental intervention. However, hw is a scientist's kind of farmer. He recognizes that everything is connected, so considers how to balance the activity and placement of cattle, chickens, pigs, and trees, each entering an environmental niche at a time that makes sense for the animals and farm, keeping all healthy while being largely chemical-free. As Salatin argues:""Society is not bearing the cost of water pollution, of antibiotic resistance, of food-borne illnesses, of crop subsidies, of subsidized oil and water—of all the hidden costs to the environment and the taxpayer that make cheap food seem cheap. No thinking person will tell you they don’t care about all that. I tell them the choice is simple: You can buy honestly priced food or you can buy irresponsibly priced food.” (p. 243)Finally, Omnivore's Dilemma is an ode to mindful, grounded eating, praising the food from Salatin's farm, but also that hunted and gathered in Sonoma and the Bay Area of California. He drools not just as be eats, but as he prepares to do so (although some of what he must do brings him close to losing his lunch), For Pollan, a meal that is eaten in full consciousness of what it took to make it is worth preparing every now and again, if only as a way to remind us of the true costs of the things we take for granted (pp. 409-410). He ends up in favor of locally-grown and harvested foods, foods with few chemicals, foods where we own the costs of eating.Pollan convinces me – not to eat cow, as some parts of Omnivore's Dilemma would be well-served with Sinclair Lewis's The Jungle. He does convince me to invest in local farms. I had been considering dropping my CSA membership in favor of the farmer's market, but decided against this so I support local farmers (mine is a cooperative of 12 Amish farms and includes a handwritten letter by one farmer each week). We have been decreasing our consumption of processed foods, but Omnivore's Dilemma will likely speed up this process. And, I will hesitate – I can't promise more – the next time I am looking at vegetables from half-way around the world.As Claude Lévi-Strauss argued, food must be “not only good to eat, but also good to think” (quoted on p. 289). Pollan's food-writing is thoughtful, and I enjoyed Omnivore's Dilemma as much for the writing as the content. And, he is dryly humorous.Pollan clears Lévi-Strauss's bar."
86,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/394959-susan,2,"While I read this book, I couldn't help but think about the muckrakers of the early 20th century. This book is pretty much nothing like The Jungle, starting with the fact that it is nonfiction, but its goal isn't that far away. It's telling a story about a part of our food industry that we don't normally think to ask about and painting a picture that should make us angry enough to do something about it.And don't get me wrong, Pollan rakes a lot of really good muck. Mostly it's his interpretation of his muck that doesn't work for me.I think the really important information comes in the first half of the book. Pollan gives us a crash course in agriculture subsidies. He compares our currently corn-focused subsidy structure to historic subsidies that were geared toward a broader spectrum of food. Then he goes into detail about what it means to live in a food chain that is designed to produce the most corn at the cheapest price. The answer? Corn is essentially in every processed food we eat. Meanwhile, corn farmers can barely keep their farms afloat because the price has been pushed down so far that they can barely produce enough product to cover their mortgages, and they dump so much fertilizer onto their fields to raise production that it ends up leeching into the water supply all the way to the ocean.Pollan then takes the corn story to the cattle industry and gives us a pretty ugly picture of what it means to raise corn-fed cattle. We thought that corn-fed cattle were a good thing, right? It's advertised on the stickers on our steaks. Except that cow biology rejects corn. The resulting situation not only makes the lives of the cows highly questionable at best, but it presents some very real health concerns for we the consumers.Buying organic fixes the problem, right? Wrong. Large-scale organic produce and livestock may not be what you think they are. Think your chickens are free-range? That just means they need to have access to the outdoors, which they are trained never to use. Corporate organic livestock is raised in environments little better than its non-organic counterpart, and they're probably fed corn too.OTOH, Pollock's story actually made me more positive about organic produce. One thing that organic regulations do accomplish is requiring a use of fertilizer that is not nearly so destructive to the environment.All of this stuff is good stuff to know. In fact, I'd like to look for some other sources of this information so I deepen my knowledge and cross-check Pollan. The place where he loses me is in his interpretation.This book got a lot of people justifiably riled up about the quality of their food and the state of their food production. And where does Pollan direct them? To back yard gardens and small family farming operations. In large part from this book, the bourgeois Localvore movement sprang up. So if you have enough money to pay twice the price for your food or the free time to produce it yourself, then you can have the satisfaction of opting out of the flawed food chain while leaving it essentially unimproved. A whole new luxury food industry has grown up to provide local food to the Localvores. Meanwhile, the corn subsidies and all their consequences continue unabated.The problem as I see it is that Pollan wraps up aesthetics with his practicality. Aesthetically, he is drawn to family farms where there are a lot more workers per square acre, a larger variety of produce and livestock are produced, and resources are used in a way he perceives as more efficient. The problem is that these qualities might make him feel good, but they don't actually address most of the problems he brought up in his muckraking. One of the sections that got my goat most was a several-page indictment of Value Added. You see, when companies make breakfast cereal, they take corn, puff it up, color it, put sugar on it, and (gasp) sell it for more than the price of the corn! The horrors of those corporate money grubbers!Look. Value Added is a core economic concept. I don't suppose Pollan expected people to pay the same amount for his book as the cost of the wood pulp used to make the paper. I suppose he wanted to be paid more for writing it than the cost of the computer he composed it on. And what's his solution to paying for overpriced processed corn? To pay more for food that comes from the right farm. So which Value Added is legitimate and which one isn't? It seems to me that food production needs four core traits. It needs to be: - Responsible: Producing it doesn't destroy the land, the water supply, or the consumers. - Plentiful: There's enough produced to feed everyone. - Reliable: Every weather fluctuation doesn't put us in danger of a shortage or a famine. - Cheap: Affordable to as many people as possible who need to eat.Pollan really only addresses the first of these four issues, and that in an incomplete manner. His solutions pretty much stomp on Plentiful and Cheap. Back yard gardens and family farms are not going to be able to produce enough food to feed a majority of Americans, no matter what they are willing to pay. It's really too bad that we couldn't have directed a lot more of this food production anger toward agricultural subsidy reform instead."
87,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/165589-gwen,3,"The first section of the book, in which Pollan follows the path of corn through the industrial food chain and discusses the effects of corn on our diets, supermarkets, and the environment, is fascinating. Despite being trained in the sociology of agriculture and specifically in the analysis of commodity chains, I learned a lot and found few details to quibble with (the main exception being his tendency to anthropomorphize corn, discussing it as though it intentionally chose to evolve in certain ways). If I were teaching a class on food, I would totally assign that section of the book.The second section of the book is also good, though not as great as the first. Probably this is because I already knew that ""organic"" and ""sustainable"" are not the same and that Horizon-brand organic dairy products come from huge dairies that, from the point of view of the cow, the quality of the milk, and the environment, are little better than regular non-organic ones.But the final section is really annoying me. Most of the things that are irritating me are much more clearly discussed at http://www.powells.com/review/2007_08..., but there were a few other things as well. Pollan keeps talking about how only omnivores have any trouble deciding what to eat, using koalas and cows as examples of animals that, being specialists, don't need to worry about whether something is an acceptable food source or not. Anyone who raises cows will tell you he's highly underestimating cows' experimentation with non-grass foods. They eat weeds and poisonous plants; they get nails and wire and bones stuck in their throats. It's a pain in the ass to have to try to remove a deer vertebra some cow has managed to lodge in her throat. I suppose this seems like a minor detail, except his entire argument is that humans (and other omnivores) are unique in facing problems deciding what is and isn't safe to eat.Connected to that is Pollan's reference to ""human nature"" from time to time, something that drives me nuts when my students do it and is even more exasperating from someone who at least ostensibly has the intellectual capacity and training to not fall back on such a simplistic explanation (that is, ""humans do it, therefore it's human nature""). He seems to buy in to the popular conception that there's a ""human nature"" that we've just smeared a little civilization and culture on top of (think of frosting on a cake).I don't think I can finish the book--I'm increasingly irritated by his tone and the problems with his argument. It's too bad, because the book really did start off well."
88,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20495277-anny,4,"Truly an eye-opener! I absolutely loved the first part of the book about the industrial agriculture. I would've never thought that our humble 'corn' is actually the tyrant of mono-culture farming. Farmers went broke, took a huge debt, taking side jobs driving trailers and depended on their wife salary for the sake of planting corn. Animals (cow, pig, chicken) got ousted from the farm and pasture and cramped into CAFO a.k.a. concentration camp for animals, where they live their short miserable life. First, they were fed food (corn or dubious meat-by-product or whatever cheapest feed available) that is making them sick and making us who eat them sick (mad cows anyone?). Second, they were cramped as much as physically possible, resulting in stressed, depressed, and psychotic animals (often resorting to self-mutilation or cannibalism). Third, they were doused with much antibiotics and medications (because their living conditions made them sick) and hormones and whatnot (to fatten them as much as possible) with who knows what side-effects that might cause for us (antibiotic-resistant bacteria for example).Taking the stand against industrial agriculture were small farms, like Polyface farm owned by Joel Salatin. If CAFO were hell for animals, then Polyface farm must be its heaven. There were so many good things about this farm, suffice to say, if I could buy from there (or any other place that practice sustainable agriculture), I would certainly do so. The last part of the book about hunting and gathering was the part that I liked the least. Too many pages rambling on and on about the ethics of killing animals. It's a weak finish, but the first two parts of the book was definitely worth reading!"
89,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/327527-missy-jean,5,"I can say without hesitation that this is a life-changing book. It's elegantly written and unflinching. Pollan is honest about his own cognitive dissonance about being an omnivore, which means he never sounds self-righteous (an impressive feat for the genre). And I love the widespread anthropomorphism of the book, the mysticism that Pollan is willing to embrace as he cites scientific sources.That said... Halfway through the book I was so depressed that I went home and ate graham crackers dipped in a can of chocolate frosting. All I could think was, so there's no choice! I am going to eat chemicals and toxins and animal byproducts unwittingly every day of my life, and they are going to kill me in the end! By the end of the book, though, I felt like I had a real sense of small measures that I can take to eat in a healthier and more environmentally responsible way. So I went to the farmstand and bought a big old pile of locally-grown buttercup squash, peaches, chard and zucchini. Better than synthetic frosting, right?I think there are a lot of different conclusions that people can draw from this book, and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who wants to be more mindful about what they eat. For me, it validated my penchant for vegetarianism (and my habitual eschewing of McDonalds), but you might get something slightly different from it. (Pollan is not a vegetarian.) Honestly, I don't think I'll ever look at my plate in quite the same way again, and I feel grateful for that."
90,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82365956-veronica,4,"""Yet there are other images of animals on other kinds of farms that contradict the nightmare ones. I'm thinking of the hens I saw at Polyface Farm, fanning out over the cow pasture on a June morning, pecking at the cowpats and the grass...or the image of pig happiness I witnessed in that cattle barn in March, watching the hogs, all upturned pink hams and corkscrew tails, nosing their way through that deep cake of compost in search of alcoholic morsels of corn. It is true that farms like this are but a speck on the monolith of modern animal agriculture, yet their very existence, and the possibility that implies, throws the whole argument for animal rights into a different light."" Pollan knows that the so-called happiness at Polyface Farm could never be scaled to a magnitude sufficient to feed the many required. ""To many animal people even Polyface Farm is a 'death camp'—a way station for doomed creatures awaiting their date with the executioner. But to look at the lives of these animals is to see this holocaust analogy for the sentimental conceit it really is. In the same way we can probably recognize animal suffering when we see it, animal happiness is unmistakable, too, and during my week on the farm I saw it in abundance.""I will permit the possibility of brief animal happiness on a small farm right before the slaughter. Still, the inconvenient reality is that human agriculture contravenes the natural order of predation because we are the only creatures that bring animals into existence in order to slaughter them. The lion does not raise and propagate zebras in a nested enclosure indefinitely and delight in creating more and more efficient ways of slaughtering their offspring. This apparently small detail is conveniently left out in arguments from nature, as I will call them. ""To think of domestication as a form of slavery or even exploitation is to misconstrue that whole relationship—to project a human idea of power onto what is in fact an example of mutualism or symbiosis, rather than a political, development. The animals grew tame and lost their ability to fend for themselves in the wild and the humans traded hunter-gatherer ways for the settled lives of agriculturists. Humans changed biologically, too.""Don't equate the domestication of wolves to the slaughter of chicks. Red herring fallacy. ""[This] is where the animal rightists betray a deep ignorance about the workings of nature."" Again, there is nothing natural about industrial agriculture. ""The very existence of predation in nature, of animals eating animals, is the cause of much anguished hand-wringing in the animal rights literature. 'It must be admitted,' Peter Singer writes, 'that the existence of carnivorous animals does pose one problems for the ethics of Animal Liberation, and that is whether we should do anything about it.' (Talk about the need for peacekeeping forces!)""On the one hand, this made me laugh a bit because I've always been disturbed by the existence of predation in the wild. That many creatures rely on the pain and suffering of other animals in order to live is but a testament to the fallen state of the world, which is also why Jupiter is a purer and superior planet to Earth. But I digress. (My sister has christened this Jupiter propaganda🪐, which I readily admit.)In any event, I've already unravelled this false equivalency between natural predation and the very systematic multiplication of animals bred for the slaughter, season after season. From doom to dust.""Today, the organic food industry finds itself in a most unexpected, uncomfortable, and yes, unsustainable position: floating on a sinking sea of petroleum.""""U.S. agricultural policy, like the Declaration of Independence, is founded on the principle that all carrots are created equal, even though there's good reason to believe this isn't really true.""Birds can't get access to the outdoors until at least 5 weeks old and are slaughtered at 7, so ""free range turns out to be not so much a lifestyle for these chickens as a two-week vacation option.""""From the moment an organic lettuce plant is ready for harvest, the rest of its journey from field to produce aisle follows a swift and often ingenious industrial logic that is only nominally organic.""The fact that steer are given numbers as names makes Holocaust comparisons all too facile...""The farmers desperate to boost yield end up degrading their land, plowing and planting marginal land, applying more nitrogen—anything to squeeze a few more bushels from the soil.""""Nor would such a culture be shocked to discover that there are other countries, such as Italy and France, that decide their dinner questions on the basis of such quaint and unscientific criteria as pleasure and tradition, eat all manner of 'unhealthy' foods, and, lo and behold, wind up actually healthier and happier in their eating than we are. We show our surprise at this by speaking of something called the 'French paradox,' for how could a people who eat such demonstrably toxic substance as foie gras and triple crème cheese actually be slimmer and healthier than we are? Yet I wonder if it doesn't make more sense to speak in terms of an American paradox—that is, a notably unhealthy people obsessed by the idea of eating heathily."""

92,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,5,"I really like Pollan’s writing style, he brings points home with simplicity, and he is able to cover a lot of ground without the writing feelings unnecessarily circuitous or blustery. More than that though, I like that he is willing to experience. I mean, that’s the very core of responsible journalism, Pollan goes and works on the farms, he helps slaughter chickens, he sits in tractors, he goes hunting and foraging, he throws himself bodily and emotionally into these experiences, and at each point I felt that he was incredibly honest with both himself and the reader about the impacts of his actions and his emotional state.All in all I thought it was refreshingly non-biased, fair appraising look at industrial agriculture/ranching, industrial/artisanal organic agriculture/ranching, and hunting/foraging. I say that as a person literally smack dab in the middle of row-crop country (my husband and his family farms), as a gardener, and as a hunter. I’ve long had a problem with the way we raise meat in this country, and the lack of connection between people and their food. Its one of the reasons that I do hunt and garden, and its also one of the reasons that I’ve mostly switched to plant proteins for all meals except supper. I am continuing to try and evolve how I eat, and it’s a learning experience and I don’t always get it right (I ate spaghettio’s twice in three days last week, no one’s perfect). But its hard to read this book without examining the role that we eaters have in the natural world. I am going to make a concerted effort to eat in-season vegetables except for those that I froze from my garden in the summer, and I’m going to try and rely on our game meats more. Despite reading much about early life on the prairie, somehow I had never considered that even meat was seasonal, or that foods grown out of season lack the nutrition that we think we are getting. They’re both very “duh” concepts, but its not something that I had really appreciated. Nor had I valued the waste of petroleum in shipping year round under-nourished produce from Argentina to the US just so that we could eat whatever fruit or veggie that we want, despite its lack of flavor.Perhaps the greatest thing that came from this was the conversations with my husband. He listened to the audiobook while in the tractor, and it was great to talk to him when he came home at night about the ways agriculture has changed since Pollan wrote (advances in technology have changed the level of precision for farmers, becoming more environmentally friendly for those that upgrade), but also the ways that it could continue to change. What could we do as eaters, hunters, buyers, and producers in our local community? Books that foster conversation and change always get a 5 out of 5.Absolutely recommend to everyone. Read those food labels. Speak out. We deserve, as buyers, connectivity and information about our food, and animals especially deserve better than what we manage for our convenience."
93,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/307041-ginny-messina,3,"A truly important book by gifted writer and journalist Michael Pollan. It's not without its flaws, however, and for all the promise of the first two-thirds of the book, it kind of leaves the reader hanging at the end. In the first part, Pollan exposes the damaging effects of industrial agriculture, and—-importantly—-this includes large-scale organic production which is not nearly as benign as most people would like to believe. Later in the book he addresses the inhumane aspect of industrial agriculture as well—-organic production included. He puts it succinctly: you look away, or you stop eating meat. In the second part of the book, we see farming as it should be, on Polyface Farm in the Shenandoah Valley. Here, farming practices are closely tied to nature including the natural behavior of farm animals. While the system doesn't adhere completely to organic regulations, it is far more sustainable and humane than industrial organic agriculture and certainly more so than conventional agriculture. Polyface Farm is not able to separate itself from industrial agriculture completely (by law, the steer are killed in conventional slaughterhouses) but it still seems like a very nice place. Unfortunately, the scale on which it operates means that this type of sustainable farming can never produce enough food for the U.S. population. Food from farms like Polyface is likely to be available to only a privileged few. The last part of the book struck me as downright nonsensical. Pollan explores the possibility of putting together the ultimate local meal—-one composed of food that he himself has hunted, gathered and grown. But don't try this at home, he says. It is not at all a realistic way to eat. Well—-no—-not if you do it by gathering chanterelle mushrooms with a bunch of chefs from Chez Panisse, hunting wild boar in the California woods, and diving for abalone along a rocky coast. Granted, most Americans would be hard-pressed to produce their own food, but Pollan doesn't even explore the option in any kind of realistic or meaningful fashion. In the end, it appears that the problems associated with food production are insurmountable. Industrial agriculture provides most of the food in this country and is a wasteful and unsustainable system. But more sustainable systems are not realistic for feeding the population. Pollan does not offer any clear cut answers, much to my surprise. (I didn't expect him to solve the problem; I did expect a little guidance!) But the thoughtful reader can still pull together a plan of action to minimize the environmental and ethical cost of a meal. Reduce intake of animal foods. Buy locally-produced food. Grow or produce as much as is realistic for you. Pollan makes his readers think about where their meals come from and how to measure the true cost of our ""inexpensive"" food. This is a must-read for anyone who expresses a desire to live and eat responsibly. "

"
97,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147289-jason-pettus,5,"Journalist Michael Pollan has a reputation for writing books that people don't just like, but whose very lives get permanently changed because of reading them; and I can attest that this exact thing has happened to me after reading my first book of his, the extraordinary 2006 guide to modern food practices known as The Omnivore's Dilemma. In it, Pollan imagines three typical meals a contemporary American might eat -- one of fast food, one of Whole Foods-type groceries, and one literally put together through foraging and hunting -- then over the course of 60,000 words shows us exactly, step by minute step, how the ingredients in each meal can be traced back and back until finally reaching a point of a living plant being grown in the ground somewhere, then building us back forward again by showing exactly what happens to that plant step by step as it makes its way from the farm to eventually our mouths.Along the way, then, Pollan gives us an astute history of the post-war industrial agricultural industry; explains why exactly corn is the overwhelming number-one crop now grown in America; gives us the horrifying reasons that most cattle and chicken have to be fed so many antibiotics in order to merely survive under such harsh industrial conditions; demonstrates why in a middle-class consumerist society these conditions have to happen in the first place (that is, because if cows were still grown in the humane way they were in an agricultural society, a McDonald's hamburger would cost $30, and the American people would riot); shows through personal field trips what exactly the difference is between ""cage-free,"" ""free range"" and ""pastured"" eggs, and why one of these options is infinitely better than the others; details why the term ""organic"" on a food label can mean vastly different things depending on the company and circumstances; and shows through illuminating first-hand experience why we are no longer a hunter-gatherer society (namely, because it's exhausting, inefficient, and makes people run the risk of sometimes going entire weeks at a time without finding anything edible to eat).Easily the most interesting book I've read in a decade, The Omnivore's Dilemma has permanently changed the way I now shop for groceries, knowing as I now do so many more details about what each label on a package means, and how different growing circumstances can often literally mean a difference in the resulting food's nutrition (just for one example, how Pollan scientifically proves here that eggs from chickens that are allowed to roam freely on farmland are literally better for you than eggs grown from chickens kept in cages); and although I haven't completely given up fast food, certainly every hamburger I now buy makes me ponder the indescribably monstrous and cruel circumstances by which that cow lived its life, which has already influenced just how many hamburgers I buy in general. (It also makes me understand a lot better why there will always be people around in any society who are more than happy to perform that society's most inhumane tasks, such as rounding up undocumented immigrants, ripping their children away from them, and throwing them into concentration camps while openly laughing in their faces...but that's neither here nor there, I suppose.) To tell the truth, the only reason I read this in the first place was because I was waiting for the day in early June that Pollan's newest book came out, a 600-page whopper called How to Change Your Mind that looks in exhaustive detail at all the latest 21st-century research into the connections between psychedelic drugs, mindfulness, meditation, mental health, what MRIs can teach us about what we've traditionally called the ""soul,"" and a lot more. That book is now finished too, and was just as fascinating as The Omnivore's Dilemma, so keep an eye out for my write-up of that in another couple of weeks.UPDATE 1: I find it utterly fascinating that the only negative reviews here of this book are from vegetarians, who are so upset at Pollan's conclusion that humans as omnivores are perfectly capable of eating meat, they're willing to dismiss every single other vegetarian-friendly thing he has to say. (Ultimately Pollan is pro-vegetable in this book, despite concluding that meat is indeed an edible substance that humans find edible.) A huge part of this book is all about how the politics of any given age has a huge influence over our opinions on the supposedly ""scientifically objective"" subjects of diet and nutrition, and the vitriolic negative reviews of the book by militant vegetarians here simply proves his point all over again.UPDATE 2: After reading other people's reviews, I agree with something I saw a lot of people mention; that a clear sign of how much I loved this book is that people at Twitter eventually got sick of me constantly tweeting about it while I was reading it. Be prepared to drive your friends and spouse crazy!"

Well, Actually, Eat Sh*t and Flourish. Each of these would have been a more classy title for the book ""Omnivore's Dilemma"". To paraphrase another reviewer 'The dude structures this book by following the path of four finished meals from origin to plate - one McDonald's meal, one comprised of supermarket organic products, one from a ""beyond-organic"" self-sustaining farm in Virginia, and one he forages almost entirely on his own. This book tries to provokes a lot of thought about the origins of our food and the biological, political, social and economic implications of those origins, and for the most part, it is successful.' So after reading this book I realize that maybe, just maybe, I don’t argue with people about food enough. Ever since I read  Fast Food Nation  and watched  Supersize Me  I have been pretty good about avoiding eating at Mc-stablishments and drinking soda. Knowing these efforts aren’t enough, but not having had the ...chutzpah ... to make the leap to full fledged, ""morally superior"" vegetarianism. I am way to lazy to manage an urban garden, -- preferring rather to watch one made on TV OD presents, as a moral alternative to growing, actually hunting and eating wild game. The parts of the book that describe this stuff, although not seemingly not feasible, reinforced these previously formed notions about foraging. Still, it is pretty interesting to see the details fleshed out.One thing discussed in the book that i hadn't internalized, and that makes sense when I think about it, is that going to whole foods and buying an organic Chilean artichoke in the winter can be a lot worse ethically than eating a fat juicy steak from a locally raised mature grass fed cow. I guess that the ethical answer culled from the book on how to shop food in the city is to buy at farmers markets or join one of these CSA’s. Take the extra step and get to know your farmer, know how they grow, know how they feed and treat the animals is the right thing to do. This seems like undue effort and cost but the ethical equivalent seems to be to hunt and dress bloody dead animals or forage for mushrooms in central park. In that perspective, the first options seems like less effort ."

These range from the nearby McDonald's and Burger Kind to the supermarket to the local farmer's stand. Michael Pollan takes a look at four ways to have a meal - one industrial meal at McDonald's, one organic meal from Whole Foods, one local meal from a farmer's field, and one completely ""homemade"" meal made from hunting and foraging.I must say, the first 300 pages are riveting, absolutely enthralling! I kept putting aside fiction to read this book, it was so good! However, when I hit the chapters on hunting and foraging, I found my interest severely waning. I really don't care at all about hunting animals and foraging for mushrooms, so keeping my attention was nearly impossible (this is why I took off a star). But the end picks up as Pollan returns to the final ""perfect"" meal.This book had so much really good information - information that once again cements my desire never to eat food at a fast food restaurant ever again. If one of your New Year's Resolutions is to eat healthier, read this book to bolster that desire!!"

The parts on farming, the evils of monoculture, the importance of grass, were especially enlightening. I don't normally eat beef and I would definitely reduce the intake even more. The most shocking part for me was the 'pastoral organic' revelation. I wonder if the organic products sold in Indonesia as are bad as the greenwashed examples in this book, which are all about the US market. The later parts of the book - hunting and cooking - were not as interesting for me as the earlier parts. Hence the four stars. Still, a fascinating read and highly recommended to everyone."

I support a small flock of happy chickens instead.Lengthy review to come. In the meantime, let me just say---I learned a lot from this book. I also enjoyed some segments very much. I would have done some extensive editing.The final chapter is sublime. OK, my real review:I am a convenience eater. Michael Pollan's work is transforming me into a conscious eater. Two concrete changes in my behavior: I will now pay the price of a fancy mocha coffee beverage for a dozen eggs gathered from happy chickens. I will also see commercially available breaded chicken with a side of corn as corn dressed with corn and a side of corn. I still may eat it, but at least I know what I'm getting!It is my hope that these wonderful books I have been reading indicate an American paradigm shift, and that the marketplace will allow people like me (who don't want to spend the time and effort tracking down purveyers of all sorts of specialty foods) more chances to make conscious choices in a convenient way. I will do my best to make choices that are more healthful for me and our planet regardless.This book was successful in changing my behavior. In large part, it was successful because I was already ripe for changing. Everything from Kingsolver's Animal Vegetable Miracle to Buford's Heat to Van Draanen's sweet young adult novel Flipped has been telling me to embrace these changes. This work built upon that foundation and presented a lot more detailed information supporting the choices that we should all be making. It was well structured, and it needed to be. So much information was packed into each section, it was necessary for me to take breaks. Some peeves---Too many declarative sentences. All declarative sentences put me on guard. (See what I did there?) I read something that says or implies ""all"" and I immediately start casting about defensively for the exceptions. I blame SAT prep. I was also put off by the way in which those declarations seemed designed to make me so defensive, mostly when he seemed dismissive of the travails of gardening, or scornful of the kind of hunter who does not agonize over the creatures' deaths. Second person. I hate second person. Here's a sentence that combined 2 peeves: ""You can forage in the garden, in the way Adam and Eve presumably did, but there isn't much to it: no dilemmas, no hunting stories."" And it's kind of a run on sentence too, now that I look at it, although that (obviously, having read any of my reviews!) isn't such a major irritation for me. (See what I did there?)Rampant anthropomorphism. Corn does not feel happy about taking over the world! Corn does not feel happy! Corn does not feel! This is a Truth. I believe that much of the anthropomorphism here was used as a bit of shorthand, implying all the Darwinian blah blah blah rather than spelling it out, and also trying to fix an image in the mind of the reader, but it is NOT TRUE. It bothers me. (Althoug I do like the image of an army of cornstalks marchng across the landscape, and it truly did stick with me.)LOVED---All descriptions of all meals.All the time spent at the idealized farm. (I forget what it's called and can't be bothered to look it up.)Everything to do with the mushrooms. (I think I'm due to read a book about mushrooms next.)The desription of the first hunt----soooooo true to my one hunting experience, in which I spent every fiber of my being on NOT MAKING ANY NOISE. It was such an intense time, and he captured that beautiully.I feel like there's so much more to say. Suiffice---I enjoyed most of this book. I learned. A lot. "
103,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1242165-schmacko,4,"So much has been written about this book, and so much will be defined by how you feel comfortable when discussing your eating habits. Here are, in short forms, my 10 observations:1)	If you’ve ever wondered how much the American government is responsible for your eating by subsidizing corporations who grow corn and make high fructose corn syrup, this is a book for you! SHORT VERSION: Corn is in EVERYTHING! We committed to growing corn when we could possibly switch to many varied crops. Corn is uniform, so it’s very corporate. If you hate political reading, if you don’t want to know this stuff, or you don’t frankly care, skip Pollan’s book. (Hope you enjoy your diabetes.)2)	Yes, we know organic food is better for us. But Pollan does a great job telling us that the US family’s annual food budget has actually dropped over the last 60 years, so Americans could conceivably spend more on food (and probably less on entertainment) and help out their diets.3)	I thought his section on Whole Foods founder John Mackey was interesting. Mackey completely concedes that he isn’t as radical as he started, that he has basically bought into the American corporate structure in order to take baby steps in supporting a business and helping people eat more healthfully.4)	At times, Pollan sounds a little Communist. At least, anti-Capitalist. I’m ok with that – to each his own – and I believe that American politics is all about constant discourse and adjustment.5)	Knowing the details of a slaughterhouse was a little much for me, but then again, I have no problem killing what I eat. Which makes me unlike 97% of Americans, who like to think their meat comes fully formed in plastic packages.6)	I love how Pollan describes the grey color of a McDonald’s burger. Funny! (I still crave Wendy’s once or twice a month.)7)	Mushroom foraging always sounded like something I wanted to do. Until I read his accounts. Mushroom foragers are crazy, obsessed people!8)	He’s lucky he had help at parts, or Pollan would’ve starved.9)	I like how he concedes that there is a better way to eat meat – that you don’t have to become a militant vegan.10)	I still wish we humans would accept that we are PART of the food chain!!! GRRR! We have canines; we have eaten meat for centuries. Our whole digestive system is built for meat! Lots of animals eat meat. We are not better than other animals that kill; the only thing that could possibly make us better is if we kill as quickly and painlessly as possible. We are the predators, and we should act as such – but with judiciousness and care. When we try to be ABOVE IT ALL – when we manipulate the environment – as Pollan excellently points out – we ruin it. “Dominion” humans create corporate slaughterhouses and run animals to extinction. Vegans treat animals as individuals to be coddled and encouraged to overproduce; soon, we’ll be overrun with deer and pumas and wild boar while we huddle eating berries from the sides of our abandoned roads (vehicles lead to road kill!) We need to accept that humans – like our predator cousins - do kill to survive, that we can be better at it, and that we are not ABOVE the food chain – as meat eaters or vegans – we are part of the system and should act accordingly. (Pollan mentions this, but doesn’t bring it home.)"
104,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260196-peter,5,"I started into this worried it was going to force me into vegetarianism, that I was going to read some passage about calves born into rancid waste, and a blue light somewhere in my brain would turn green and a gag reflex would accompany the thought of meat moving forward....Which speaks either to my penchant for pessimism, or the ominous relationship we have to our food chain, where we _don't_ really want to know how food got there, we just want to eat it.But read the book I did, fearful to encounter that meat-snatching passage within the book. Thankfully, Pollan is not an alarmist, but rather a quite methodical inquisitor about the roots of our food. It sounds kind of..esoteric, but he makes it fascinating, like a great humanities teacher he tells the larger story of food: of why we grow so much fricking corn in America, and how it's bad for almost everyone involved: ourselves, our diet, farmers in other countries.The good thing is that the book never descends into a polemic, unlike Michael Moore's work, Pollan's evenhandedness keeps the reader open to what he is saying. Nothing is extreme or revolutionary or incendiary.I feel like this book will, in the long term, shape the way I think about food by giving me a vocabulary for considering my personal and our cultural relationship to food. He discusses how America as a nation of immigrants never developed a stable national cuisine (unlike France or Italy), and the absence of that makes us vulnerable to an endless array of fad diets (coughAdkinscough) and an overall menu that is out of balance.There is a fascinating chapter on mushrooms and fungi, which details how they are utterly different from plants, and grow from this crazy underground symbiosis with decomposing nutrients and tree roots, taking a single drop of sugar from the tree root in exchange for processed minerals from the soil.There is an extended look at a farm outside Charlottesville--Polyface Farm--which models itself after natural ecosystems and creates this method of rotating cattle and chickens with grass growth cycles to create this wonderful whirlwind of spreadsheets, efficiency, and microdata on growth patterns of grass.To wit: it's better to have grass pasture surrounded by trees, because a blade of grass will burn X calories turning the face of it's blade toward the sun to receive solar energy. Planting forests around removes wind, allowing the grass to grow higher. Brilliant.In the end, it's about food, but it's also about systems in general. It begins to feel like a universal look at the interrelationship of history and commerce, and how everything is this big interconnected fabric, but that you can begin to see some of those connections, and kind of surf those links to great personal and collective gain.12/2007"

I use the word “threaten” very deliberately, because they are changes that I know I'm going to find challenging.Michael Pollan challenges his readers to examine their food a little closer, to consider where it comes from. And it's a logical request I think. We can spend days searching for the perfect doctor or mechanic, but how much time do we take to really think about our food? Do you know where your steak came from? Is your asparagus from a nearby farm, or far-flung Argentina? Are your peaches organic, and if so, what does that really mean? Most of us have no idea how to answer these questions.In most cases, the answers are simple. Most of our food likely comes from a massive industrial farm or feed-lot hundreds of miles away, fed by incredible amounts of fossil fuels -- the fertilizer, the machines used for harvesting, the trucks it took to transport the food to your local mega-mart, to name just a few uses of fossil fuel. Pollan's descriptions of these farms (and in particular, the feed lots) can be quite disturbing. However, Pollan does not outright condemn this ""industrial food chain."" He concedes that it would be difficult to feed billions of people inexpensively without it. Instead, he advocates having several different avenues for delivering food to our tables, and he describes several alternatives. It is up to the reader to determine how they want to eat. As for me, my eyes have been opened to the appeal of ""eating locally,"" where possible. (Emphasis on ""where possible."" There aren't too many oranges grown in Idaho.) By eating foods produced as close to my home as possible, I support the local economy, less fossil fuels are used, and the food should have fewer preservatives, hormones, and other chemical ingredients. Best of all, the food should be fresher and more flavorful. Yes, it will cost more, but I think it will be worth it. At least I'm willing to try it. Consider it an experiement. I've already found local sources of milk, eggs and meat that I'm going to try. I found Pollan's writing engaging and easy to read. (Disclaimer: I am a huge nerd, and the topic really spoke to me. If you don't like science, you may not find this book as fascinating.) A few words of warning: if evolution makes you uncomfortable, you may not like this book, as it often talks about the evolution of plants, animals and humans. Also, there were two or three instances where objectionable language was used. "
106,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4161947-m-l-rudolph,5,"2006. NY Times Book Review One of the 10 Best Books of the Year. We eat every day of our lives but we don't often give much thought to what we put in our bodies. If we are what we eat, then when it comes to meat, we are what the animal eats; and when it comes to produce, we are what the plant's grown in. There's a food chain that extends around the world and throughout evolutionary history from the beginning of man. Michael Pollan takes us on a tour of that chain and in the process gives any thinking, eating, person a new, often disturbing, view of what he/she consumes.Organized in three sections to illuminate industrial food (corn), pastoral food (grass), and personal food (the forest), Pollan's narrative builds toward meals made as nearly as possible with ingredients and methods from each of these categories.I double-dog-dare anyone to read this book and walk through a modern supermarket without viewing each item of food differently. And if you're like me, take your glasses, because the real information about what we buy and eat is in the small print, written in code, to disguise as much as possible what we truly consume. The central area of the supermarket is processed food. Good luck figuring that out. (When you can't determine the identity of fifteen out of eighteen ingredients on that package of processed whatever - chances are high what you're reading - and eating - are corn derivatives.) Around the walls, where we find the produce, meat, and fish, it would seem that the information describing the food would be more straight-forward. Good luck figuring that out, too. (Chances are every formerly living item was nourished or fertilized with corn or corn derivatives.)Unless you plan to follow a steer or a chicken through its life cycle to see how the animal lives, and dies, and becomes the food on your plate, you have to rely on someone like Pollan to take that trip for you, document his findings, and present it as he does here. I've read about food my entire life and tried to keep up on healthy eating without succumbing to fads, but I've never encountered such an intelligent, entertaining, and practical guide to the state of food in America today as The Omnivore's Dilemma. Read it and eat. "
107,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36341-c,5,"Pollan's book is not just a fascinating look at the modern state and evolution of our industrial food complex; it's not merely an anthropological investigation of the history of eating and cultural rituals; it's more than a scientific discourse of the biological nature of corn, small farm ecosystems, and fungi -- it's also, surprisingly, a page turner. When I was finished, I wanted the book to be twice as long.The book is also not (as many people seem to think) a political screed or manifesto -- Pollan isn't necessarily telling everyone to stop eating industrial food and switch to local, small farm food, as he acknowledges how impractical such a course of action actually is. Rather, he investigates our relationships with food, both personal and societal, scientific and ethical. He does find the industrial complex distasteful and disturbing and the small, sustainable farm he visits ideal but (and perhaps this is the choir appreciating the sermon) those conclusions seem inescapable.This book didn't change any of my ideas about eating, as I already try to eat locally and avoid processed food, but I learned a lot about the nature of food, from how terrifyingly omnipresent corn is to the amazingly complex ecosystem of a farm. It's one of those books that you constantly put down so you can turn to someone and say ""Oh my god, did you know that . . . """

Pollan sets put to investigate four markedly different food chains, and ends up having to revise his world view, and acquire new friends in search for a profound understanding of food, nature, and humanity.I have finished this on Feb 28, 2019. I will write a longer review when I collect my thoughts. There is plenty of food for thought (pardon the pun... did not intend it but hey, it fits.)"
109,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4123952-alasse,5,"I was so scared that this would turn out to be a foodie hipster's rant on what food should be like, instead of what it actually is. I'm relieved to admit that I was mistaken - in fact, it's one of the most thought-provoking books I've read this year. It's helped me to fully flesh out some apprehensions I had which I'd never actually put into words, such as 'Is organic really about chemical paranoia?' 'What's the environmental impact of mindlessly shipping food all over the continent?' 'How in the world does that even make sense economically?' Okay, that last one I had actually wondered about, more than once. I used to have a long commute.The Omnivore's Dilemma is also less location specific than Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal, which was a plus for me. I love reading about American lifestyles and behaviors (it's the whole deep-down-i-know-we're-next thing), but most of the industrial talk doesn't really apply to me. Pollan did a great job of giving a panoramic view of all the different approaches to eating in the first world, that's true. But mostly, it was his naturalist's view of things that made his discourse universal and relatable for me.Also, I've realized I have some very strong and mostly unfair prejudices against hunters. A book that manages to make me change my mind on a particular subject* is a book that deserves 5 stars. Shame on me.What else? Oh, apparently now I find ecology fascinating, which poses a new TBR list control challenge. F****ck.*while quoting a lot of Ortega y Gasset, I might add. Ortega FTW!! I went through an Ortega phase when I was like 17, so anyone who quotes Ortega to prove a point instantly gets bonus points with me."
110,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,3,"I grew up on a farm in Michigan where we grew corn and soybeans. The years when we rotated our crops to grow field corn, it was harvested to feed the chickens at the local egg farm. Thus I have some first hand experience with the first few chapters of the Omnivore’s Dilemma and the chapter on the farm rang especially true for me.This book is popular and enough time has passed that it probably qualifies as a classic and is certainly worth a read. It is a honest portrayal by a professor on the modern US food web highlighting many of the problems of our modern omnivore society spanning the spectrum from steroids to animal ethics. There were four chapters that I would consider as excellent: The Farm, The Feedlot, Grass and the Forager. The other twenty chapters were ok.I had no issue with the messaging of the book and wholly agree that it is important to understand where our modern food comes from. I will admit that I promptly ate organic vegetarian for my next meal after finishing the book as there are a few unpleasant facts associated with meat processing. I am sure I will become a carnivore again by tomorrow.I did have a few problems with the construction of the book however.1. At times it strayed from the science and empirical observations to become a little too professorial or perhaps too philosophical. This choice was understandable but gave me a meh kind of feeling.2. At times the book was a bit boring, although there were some intriguing chapters mixed throughout the book.3. I did not like most of the chapter titles such as Slaughter is a Glass Abattoir. Keep it simple like Cows, Corn, Chickens, Grass and the messaging of the chapter would resonate more.I rate the book at 3.5 stars."
111,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66672731-michael-jandrok,4,"I have always been interested in food culture, though I would have never considered myself to be a “foodie” in the strictest sense. That term always carried a bit of hipster baggage to my mind. I would tend to picture modern U.S. food culture as a sort of hummus-slathered menu dominated by low-fat recipes meant to reflect the popular diet trends of the day. Those attitudes began to change for me when I was diagnosed with cancer. Suddenly food became a big deal for me, first as something that I actively avoided as my appetite dwindled and my daily routine ran to getting as many calories in my body as I could, regardless of the delivery system. As someone living with colorectal cancer, food was a tough sell for me as the disease progressed. My tastes changed and most foods that I used to love became alien to me. But a funny thing happened as my treatment started to take hold and my appetite slowly began to return. I began to consciously embrace “foodie” culture with an eye towards expanding my palate and eating healthier. A big part of this ongoing effort has been educating myself on what would be the “right” things to eat given that I had a disease that directly affected my tastes and digestive functions. I didn’t want specific “diet” books, per se. What I wanted and needed was comprehensive information on what constitutes food itself, with an eye towards the science and sociology of developing better food habits and cooking techniques. Before my disease took hold, I was a 5’5”, 165 pound ball of muscle and muffin top, still trying to fit into size 34 jeans. At the peak of the cancer, when I was at my lowest point physically, I was 106 pounds and looked like a shell of my former self. After a year and a half of treatment, I am back up to 140 pounds, due in large part to eating better and making more informed choices as to the food that I put into my body. I can thank books like “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” for giving me a respectable knowledge base to make those wise culinary decisions. Author Michael Pollan has been writing about food for many years now. This book was originally published in 2006 and was one of his earlier efforts at culinary writing. The material has aged well. I do think that we have become a bit smarter as a food culture in the intervening years, but the basic information presented here is still valid and useful. I will take a moment here to caution prospective readers that Pollan’s visit to a large-scale feedlot and the rendering plant is graphic and somewhat disturbing. One can’t read these sections and not begin to question what it means to consume beef. The premise of the text is pretty simple and the nature of the ""omnivore's dilemma"" can be summed up quite nicely: as creatures that can eat virtually anything, the big question can be defined as ""what SHOULD we eat?” Pollan sets out to find the answer to this question by tracing 4 meals back to their sources. IN the course of the book he dissects a fast food meal, a store-bought organic entree, a ""beyond organic"" meal produced entirely at a polyculture farm, and a meal that he hunts and gathers (almost) entirely by himself. Along the way, he asks the reader to join him in his quest for a more thorough knowledge of the food that we eat and a better understanding of how the decisions that we make as food consumers help to shape our cultural and physical landscape.This is an intensely interesting book, and an important addition to the bookshelf for anyone interested in becoming more ""food-aware"". Pollan's journey is always engaging, sometimes spiritual (""we are what we eat…."" takes on a new dimension when one stops to look at it with this much depth), and occasionally frightening. He is always respectful of his cast of characters, and he is willing to challenge his own preconceptions and ideas as he gathers knowledge and experience. Note that there are no recipes to be found within these pages, nor any specific information on the art of cooking. This is a book that is fully invested in talking about food as a consumer product; what it is, where it comes from, and what the impacts and implications are when you decide to make a food consumption choice.Michael Pollan strikes me as a fairly engaging and nice guy. I’d like to sit down to a meal with him and talk shop. I learned a lot from this book that I can actively put into practice as I seek to modify my eating habits with an eye towards maximum health benefits. Along with that I gained some ways to make more responsible choices as a food consumer, and that’s just as important as the health angle for me. I’ll be seeking out more of Pollan’s food writing.Coda #1: After reading a number of reviews for this book, I can honestly say that this is a pretty polarizing piece of writing. A substantial number of vegetarians and vegans panned the book because of its acceptance of what Pollan would call “responsible” meat consumption. And there is no doubt that the author does indeed support the idea that eating meat can be done in an ethical fashion. I won’t rehash the arguments in the reviews here. Having a background in anthropology I can tell you that from a biological perspective humans have absolutely evolved as omnivores. Those canine teeth in your mouth didn’t appear because primates had an exclusively vegetarian diet, they are there specifically for the catching of prey and the tearing of meat. That said, we would do well as a species to eat a lot LESS meat, and there is no denying the environmental damage that is done by widespread meat consumption. Coda #2: That idea of responsible meat consumption is central to Pollan’s ideas. But it’s larger than just meat. The whole idea here is to gain a more thorough understanding of where our food comes from and from there develop better and more responsible food habits. Modern supermarket culture has taken away a lot of the basic knowledge of food...where it comes from, how it is grown or raised, etc. Pollan states outright that we would all be better off if we once again gained a real connection to our food, one that goes well beyond opening a can or a package and dropping something into a pot to warm it up. That concept alone makes “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” valuable and worthwhile.Coda #3: Another criticism of the book centered on Pollan himself, and the idea that the concepts in “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” can only be absorbed and put into action by an affluent audience. I’m not really sure I buy this argument. It’s true that “foodie” culture seems to have a footprint squarely in a sort of urban-hipster vibe, but the fact is that lower-income folks can put any of the ideas in this book into action just the same as any other demographic. In point, much has been made in the news lately of the current regime’s idea to hand out “food boxes” in place of letting assistance recipients make their own food choices. That would mean a direct impact on the farmer’s markets who accept assistance payments. That tells me that plenty of lower-income people have learned how to make healthy and ethical culinary choices that stretch their food dollars to the max. "

114,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/693262-huyen,5," If i could think of this book as a meal, then indeed Michael Pollan is a marvelous cook. He writes well, vividly and convincingly.As dense and informative as it is, the book doesn't make me feel bloated, but nourished :] I can't remember the last time I have discussed a book so many times, with so many different people. Chapter 17 on the ethics of eating animals is just mind-blowing and alone can make this book a worthwhile read.i can't resist talking about it before anything else. I've tried to become a vegetarian a couple of times and have always eventually lapsed back into eating meat. The main reason I would ever become a vegetarian is environmental, the huge amount of energy expended in producing and preserving meat. I've always found the ethics of eating meat hard to defend on the moral basis. And it's fascinating to see a person do it convincingly like Pollan. Pollan starst with Peter Singer's argument against eating meat. A wonderfully simple but powerful idea: ""if possessing a higher degree of intelligence does not entitle one human to use another for his or her own ends, how can it entitle humans to exploit non-humans for the same purpose?"". Leaving aside the problematic question of how we define animal ""intelligence"", there is no debate as to whether animals can suffer. And if we have extended equal rights to women, minorities, homosexuals, should we and why don't we extend these rights to other species? ouch. most people, like me, when faced with this question and thinking about it seriously, either look away or become vegetarians. it is difficult to reconcile our instincts to eat meat and the moral implications of it. but Pollan shows us that those are not the only two alternatives.He argues that while animals rightists have always stressed the suffering of animals due to our meat eating habits (although we have rather slim evidence of exactly what goes on in the brain of a pig about to go to heaven, (or hell?)), they have also failed to acknowledge that humans are capable of giving animals a decent and happy life. and ""happy"" in this case means the ability to do what they would naturally do, either pigs rooting around in the dirt, or cows wandering on pastures. ""to think of domestication as a form of slavery or even exploitation is to miscontrue that whole relationship-to project a human idea or power onto what is in fact an example of mutualism or symbiosis between species."" as he points out, domestication is an evolutionary development. domesticated animals have a much higher chance of surviving than in the wild, compare dogs and wolves for example. they therefore evolve to serve human benefits, winning our favor, in order to be provided with shelter and protection. they probably don't like being killed very much, but if that gives them a longer life and a much better chance to spread their genes to the next generation, they would much rather be with us than be in nature. ""predation is not a matter of morality or of politics, it, too, is a matter of symbiosis. from the point of view of the individual prey animal predation is a horror, but from the point of view of the group-and of its gene pool-it is indispensable."" That is exactly the point that most animals rightists miss. they concern only with individuals, but nature doesn't work that way, no matter how cruel that might sound. nature is about maximizing the survival of the whole species. our morals were developed to help us function as a healthy, cooperative society, but it is rather irrelevant to what should happen in nature.Pollan charges that this very embraced and apparently self-righteous ""ideology"" is a product of an urban society which has lost touch with nature. A friend of mine told me that he took his children to a slaughterhouse to see how pigs are killed because he believes that if we want to eat meat, we should be able to face the morality involved in it. that, i think, is a respectable viewpoint. the children were slightly disturbed but it didn't stop them eating meat. this father is probably an exception in our society. most of us probably have never raised a cow and seen a cow. our meat comes from nice little packages that never remind us of that it comes from something that used to have a brain and can suffer. when i asked my NZ friends why people no longer eat animal organs, like we do in Vietnam, they stared at me with disturbed looks. but really, when you think about it, offal is very nutritious, and there's little reason why we can accept eating meat, but not kidney, heart, or brain. i suspect the reason is the viscera brings home to us the fact that what we are eating used to be quite similar to us, which means, having eyes, lungs, heart. and we are so scared to face that reality that we get rid of it altogether. the second reason is that once the meat production process is out of sight, we have lost the traditional rituals justifying the act of killing and governing the slaughter of animals. the disappearance of these old practices gives way to the brutalization of animals to the extent that the animals become so sick that we have pretty much run out of anti-biotics.but that is not the same as to say that we can eat meat carefree without any moral consideration. given the fact that our food chain has become increasingly industrialized and heavily dependent on fossil fuels, we do have a moral obligation to care about the health of nature, i.e, the condition of the soil, the health of the animals we eat, the impact of animal farming on the environment. I can't agree more with him that while we don't need or arguably shouldn't give up our meat consumption, we should at least make sure that the way we eat is sustainable and the animals we eat are treated decently. the way that animals are treated in most farms is quite despicable. and i bet that if we had a chance to look at it, most would quite happily choose to be vegetarian. giving animals a humane treatment does not only give us a clear conscience but really serves our benefits as well. who would not want to eat a healthy chicken instead of a disease-ridden one? recently, when a documentary about the treatment of pigs in battery farms in NZ was broadcast on TV, the public displayed outrage at what they saw and have pushed quite vigorously for legislation prohibiting cruel treatment of farm animals  see here. i don't know of progress elsewhere. i like the idea that once the public know about what's happening to what they eat, they can make a difference.most of the rest of the book deals with corn and how our (meaning American) food chain has been reduced to a monoculture of soy and corn. they are present in something like 75% of the processed food products on the market. 40% of the calories a Mexican eats comes from food. if you think that's quite astonishing, then apparently American have overtaken Mexicans to be kings of walking corns. corn became the winner in the competition to be human's favorite crop because of its capacity to store a lot more calories than other species. the invention of fertilizers (interestingly made widely available by the surplus ammonium nitrate after the war) made growing corn so incredibly efficient that corn gradually replaced all other crops. and in the 1950s, feeding cattle on feedlots was cheaper than on grass, enabling the farmers to build massive chicken factories. livestock farmers went out of business because they couldn't compete with giant factories. fertilizer was a mixed blessing because the soil fertility shifted from reliance on the sun and a careful rotation of crops, to fossil fuels. we might like to think that fertilizers make agriculture a lot more efficient, but in fact, we expend twice as much energy to produce corn than when we relied on nature. and that's not to mention the huge cost of environmental pollution.when corn got cheaper and cheaper, the Nixon government stepped in to subsidize it, encouraging growing even more corn of lower nutritional quality and sparking the beginning of agribusiness. the excess corn finds its way into most processed energy-dense foods and feeding livestock. getting rid of this huge amount of excess energy contributes to obesity and an impoverished food culture. it makes good economic sense to dump excess corn on cattle, but biologically, they evolved to eat grass, and being forced to eat something they are not supposed to eat has caused grave problems. in a shit hole with piles of waste, polluted air and water and no space to even wiggle their tails, the only way these cows can survive is to swallow humongous amounts of anti-biotics. that sounds quite depressing, but the organic industry doesn't really hold a torch toward a moral utopia as we would hope. Pollan points out that the organic industry has diverged exponentially from its original ideals in the 1960s, and is now not so much better than the establishment. they consume a huge amount of energy to transport their products across the country, most ""free range"" farms mean that the chicken has a palm-sized window to look at the sun 5 minutes a day. real organic farmers have a hard time to get their products on the market because of government regulations. to me it seems like America's unsustainable food consumption is perpetuated by a cycle of ignorance and government intervention. so much for laissez-faire capitalism. growing so much corn might seem to make good economic sense. we must admit that it's quite remarkable that this is the first time in human history, we can produce food so cheaply and so abundantly. but this is the thing that has always not sat right with me about economics. that it hides all the expensive external costs involved in the process: environmental degradation, costs to the government in terms of subsidies, a huge consumption of fossil fuels, public health and malnourishment. so in fact, eating cheap corn is very expensive. so the key question is WHY is America doing all these things that defy logic? to summarize the whole story in one word, I'd say efficiency. feeding corn to livestock is so much cheaper and easier than grass (don't have to wait for grass to grow). and it supports a legion of other industries: the chemical and biotech industries, the food industry, the oil industry, pharma, agribusiness. If we keep in mind that hunter-gathers didn't become agriculturists out of choice, but because they depleted the animals they were hunting, it makes me worry what will happen to us when we deplete our soil and degrade our environment so the same disastrous extent. the food price riots in 2007/8 give us a glance at how depressing such a world would be.but this book isn't just depressing, it's enlightening and inspiring. it shows us that there ARE alternatives to the status quo: eat local, subscribe to a farm you know, and as he says in ""In defense of food"", then simply ""eat food, not too much, mostly plants"". I find Michael Pollan a remarkable writer, very humble and articulate. I can't recommend this book too highly."
115,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,5,"We are a notably unhealthy people obsessed by the idea of eating healthily (p. 3).Michael Pollan's Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals is a critique of industrial farms: they raise animals shoulder to shoulder standing in their own manure, feeding them foods that they are not designed for and which make them ill, and then use chemicals to compensate for these sins. Who knew that we are corn-eaters – not directly, like Mexicans, but through our cattle and chickens, and in processed foods.“When you look at the isotope ratios,.. we North Americans look like corn chips with legs.” Compared to us, Mexicans today consume a far more varied carbon diet: the animals they eat still eat grass (until recently, Mexicans regarded feeding corn to livestock as a sacrilege); much of their protein comes from legumes; and they still sweeten their beverages with cane sugar."" (p. 23)Pollan looks at industrial and pastoral farms, briefly flirts with being a vegetarian, then becomes a hunter/gatherer. He doesn't ""look"" the way I would, but goes out in the field, visiting and working farms, learning to hunt (and kill), and to gather wild mushrooms. Each major step on his journey is punctuated with a meal.Our typical, industrial farm, Pollan argues, is not healthy for us (making us obese), not healthy for the animals (making them ill), and not healthy for the soil and environment (using vast amounts of oil to raise food in a monoculture). He may something good about this kind of farming, but I've forgotten it. This farming is good for conglomerates – making them rich – but not farmers or consumers.His week on Joel Salatin's pastoral farm is fascinating – even for me, a vegetarian of more than 40 years. Salatin is a libertarian, deeply suspicious of government and governmental intervention. However, hw is a scientist's kind of farmer. He recognizes that everything is connected, so considers how to balance the activity and placement of cattle, chickens, pigs, and trees, each entering an environmental niche at a time that makes sense for the animals and farm, keeping all healthy while being largely chemical-free. As Salatin argues:""Society is not bearing the cost of water pollution, of antibiotic resistance, of food-borne illnesses, of crop subsidies, of subsidized oil and water—of all the hidden costs to the environment and the taxpayer that make cheap food seem cheap. No thinking person will tell you they don’t care about all that. I tell them the choice is simple: You can buy honestly priced food or you can buy irresponsibly priced food.” (p. 243)Finally, Omnivore's Dilemma is an ode to mindful, grounded eating, praising the food from Salatin's farm, but also that hunted and gathered in Sonoma and the Bay Area of California. He drools not just as be eats, but as he prepares to do so (although some of what he must do brings him close to losing his lunch), For Pollan, a meal that is eaten in full consciousness of what it took to make it is worth preparing every now and again, if only as a way to remind us of the true costs of the things we take for granted (pp. 409-410). He ends up in favor of locally-grown and harvested foods, foods with few chemicals, foods where we own the costs of eating.Pollan convinces me – not to eat cow, as some parts of Omnivore's Dilemma would be well-served with Sinclair Lewis's The Jungle. He does convince me to invest in local farms. I had been considering dropping my CSA membership in favor of the farmer's market, but decided against this so I support local farmers (mine is a cooperative of 12 Amish farms and includes a handwritten letter by one farmer each week). We have been decreasing our consumption of processed foods, but Omnivore's Dilemma will likely speed up this process. And, I will hesitate – I can't promise more – the next time I am looking at vegetables from half-way around the world.As Claude Lévi-Strauss argued, food must be “not only good to eat, but also good to think” (quoted on p. 289). Pollan's food-writing is thoughtful, and I enjoyed Omnivore's Dilemma as much for the writing as the content. And, he is dryly humorous.Pollan clears Lévi-Strauss's bar."
116,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/394959-susan,2,"While I read this book, I couldn't help but think about the muckrakers of the early 20th century. This book is pretty much nothing like The Jungle, starting with the fact that it is nonfiction, but its goal isn't that far away. It's telling a story about a part of our food industry that we don't normally think to ask about and painting a picture that should make us angry enough to do something about it.And don't get me wrong, Pollan rakes a lot of really good muck. Mostly it's his interpretation of his muck that doesn't work for me.I think the really important information comes in the first half of the book. Pollan gives us a crash course in agriculture subsidies. He compares our currently corn-focused subsidy structure to historic subsidies that were geared toward a broader spectrum of food. Then he goes into detail about what it means to live in a food chain that is designed to produce the most corn at the cheapest price. The answer? Corn is essentially in every processed food we eat. Meanwhile, corn farmers can barely keep their farms afloat because the price has been pushed down so far that they can barely produce enough product to cover their mortgages, and they dump so much fertilizer onto their fields to raise production that it ends up leeching into the water supply all the way to the ocean.Pollan then takes the corn story to the cattle industry and gives us a pretty ugly picture of what it means to raise corn-fed cattle. We thought that corn-fed cattle were a good thing, right? It's advertised on the stickers on our steaks. Except that cow biology rejects corn. The resulting situation not only makes the lives of the cows highly questionable at best, but it presents some very real health concerns for we the consumers.Buying organic fixes the problem, right? Wrong. Large-scale organic produce and livestock may not be what you think they are. Think your chickens are free-range? That just means they need to have access to the outdoors, which they are trained never to use. Corporate organic livestock is raised in environments little better than its non-organic counterpart, and they're probably fed corn too.OTOH, Pollock's story actually made me more positive about organic produce. One thing that organic regulations do accomplish is requiring a use of fertilizer that is not nearly so destructive to the environment.All of this stuff is good stuff to know. In fact, I'd like to look for some other sources of this information so I deepen my knowledge and cross-check Pollan. The place where he loses me is in his interpretation.This book got a lot of people justifiably riled up about the quality of their food and the state of their food production. And where does Pollan direct them? To back yard gardens and small family farming operations. In large part from this book, the bourgeois Localvore movement sprang up. So if you have enough money to pay twice the price for your food or the free time to produce it yourself, then you can have the satisfaction of opting out of the flawed food chain while leaving it essentially unimproved. A whole new luxury food industry has grown up to provide local food to the Localvores. Meanwhile, the corn subsidies and all their consequences continue unabated.The problem as I see it is that Pollan wraps up aesthetics with his practicality. Aesthetically, he is drawn to family farms where there are a lot more workers per square acre, a larger variety of produce and livestock are produced, and resources are used in a way he perceives as more efficient. The problem is that these qualities might make him feel good, but they don't actually address most of the problems he brought up in his muckraking. One of the sections that got my goat most was a several-page indictment of Value Added. You see, when companies make breakfast cereal, they take corn, puff it up, color it, put sugar on it, and (gasp) sell it for more than the price of the corn! The horrors of those corporate money grubbers!Look. Value Added is a core economic concept. I don't suppose Pollan expected people to pay the same amount for his book as the cost of the wood pulp used to make the paper. I suppose he wanted to be paid more for writing it than the cost of the computer he composed it on. And what's his solution to paying for overpriced processed corn? To pay more for food that comes from the right farm. So which Value Added is legitimate and which one isn't? It seems to me that food production needs four core traits. It needs to be: - Responsible: Producing it doesn't destroy the land, the water supply, or the consumers. - Plentiful: There's enough produced to feed everyone. - Reliable: Every weather fluctuation doesn't put us in danger of a shortage or a famine. - Cheap: Affordable to as many people as possible who need to eat.Pollan really only addresses the first of these four issues, and that in an incomplete manner. His solutions pretty much stomp on Plentiful and Cheap. Back yard gardens and family farms are not going to be able to produce enough food to feed a majority of Americans, no matter what they are willing to pay. It's really too bad that we couldn't have directed a lot more of this food production anger toward agricultural subsidy reform instead."
117,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/165589-gwen,3,"The first section of the book, in which Pollan follows the path of corn through the industrial food chain and discusses the effects of corn on our diets, supermarkets, and the environment, is fascinating. Despite being trained in the sociology of agriculture and specifically in the analysis of commodity chains, I learned a lot and found few details to quibble with (the main exception being his tendency to anthropomorphize corn, discussing it as though it intentionally chose to evolve in certain ways). If I were teaching a class on food, I would totally assign that section of the book.The second section of the book is also good, though not as great as the first. Probably this is because I already knew that ""organic"" and ""sustainable"" are not the same and that Horizon-brand organic dairy products come from huge dairies that, from the point of view of the cow, the quality of the milk, and the environment, are little better than regular non-organic ones.But the final section is really annoying me. Most of the things that are irritating me are much more clearly discussed at http://www.powells.com/review/2007_08..., but there were a few other things as well. Pollan keeps talking about how only omnivores have any trouble deciding what to eat, using koalas and cows as examples of animals that, being specialists, don't need to worry about whether something is an acceptable food source or not. Anyone who raises cows will tell you he's highly underestimating cows' experimentation with non-grass foods. They eat weeds and poisonous plants; they get nails and wire and bones stuck in their throats. It's a pain in the ass to have to try to remove a deer vertebra some cow has managed to lodge in her throat. I suppose this seems like a minor detail, except his entire argument is that humans (and other omnivores) are unique in facing problems deciding what is and isn't safe to eat.Connected to that is Pollan's reference to ""human nature"" from time to time, something that drives me nuts when my students do it and is even more exasperating from someone who at least ostensibly has the intellectual capacity and training to not fall back on such a simplistic explanation (that is, ""humans do it, therefore it's human nature""). He seems to buy in to the popular conception that there's a ""human nature"" that we've just smeared a little civilization and culture on top of (think of frosting on a cake).I don't think I can finish the book--I'm increasingly irritated by his tone and the problems with his argument. It's too bad, because the book really did start off well."
118,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20495277-anny,4,"Truly an eye-opener! I absolutely loved the first part of the book about the industrial agriculture. I would've never thought that our humble 'corn' is actually the tyrant of mono-culture farming. Farmers went broke, took a huge debt, taking side jobs driving trailers and depended on their wife salary for the sake of planting corn. Animals (cow, pig, chicken) got ousted from the farm and pasture and cramped into CAFO a.k.a. concentration camp for animals, where they live their short miserable life. First, they were fed food (corn or dubious meat-by-product or whatever cheapest feed available) that is making them sick and making us who eat them sick (mad cows anyone?). Second, they were cramped as much as physically possible, resulting in stressed, depressed, and psychotic animals (often resorting to self-mutilation or cannibalism). Third, they were doused with much antibiotics and medications (because their living conditions made them sick) and hormones and whatnot (to fatten them as much as possible) with who knows what side-effects that might cause for us (antibiotic-resistant bacteria for example).Taking the stand against industrial agriculture were small farms, like Polyface farm owned by Joel Salatin. If CAFO were hell for animals, then Polyface farm must be its heaven. There were so many good things about this farm, suffice to say, if I could buy from there (or any other place that practice sustainable agriculture), I would certainly do so. The last part of the book about hunting and gathering was the part that I liked the least. Too many pages rambling on and on about the ethics of killing animals. It's a weak finish, but the first two parts of the book was definitely worth reading!"
119,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/327527-missy-jean,5,"I can say without hesitation that this is a life-changing book. It's elegantly written and unflinching. Pollan is honest about his own cognitive dissonance about being an omnivore, which means he never sounds self-righteous (an impressive feat for the genre). And I love the widespread anthropomorphism of the book, the mysticism that Pollan is willing to embrace as he cites scientific sources.That said... Halfway through the book I was so depressed that I went home and ate graham crackers dipped in a can of chocolate frosting. All I could think was, so there's no choice! I am going to eat chemicals and toxins and animal byproducts unwittingly every day of my life, and they are going to kill me in the end! By the end of the book, though, I felt like I had a real sense of small measures that I can take to eat in a healthier and more environmentally responsible way. So I went to the farmstand and bought a big old pile of locally-grown buttercup squash, peaches, chard and zucchini. Better than synthetic frosting, right?I think there are a lot of different conclusions that people can draw from this book, and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who wants to be more mindful about what they eat. For me, it validated my penchant for vegetarianism (and my habitual eschewing of McDonalds), but you might get something slightly different from it. (Pollan is not a vegetarian.) Honestly, I don't think I'll ever look at my plate in quite the same way again, and I feel grateful for that."
120,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82365956-veronica,4,"""Yet there are other images of animals on other kinds of farms that contradict the nightmare ones. I'm thinking of the hens I saw at Polyface Farm, fanning out over the cow pasture on a June morning, pecking at the cowpats and the grass...or the image of pig happiness I witnessed in that cattle barn in March, watching the hogs, all upturned pink hams and corkscrew tails, nosing their way through that deep cake of compost in search of alcoholic morsels of corn. It is true that farms like this are but a speck on the monolith of modern animal agriculture, yet their very existence, and the possibility that implies, throws the whole argument for animal rights into a different light."" Pollan knows that the so-called happiness at Polyface Farm could never be scaled to a magnitude sufficient to feed the many required. ""To many animal people even Polyface Farm is a 'death camp'—a way station for doomed creatures awaiting their date with the executioner. But to look at the lives of these animals is to see this holocaust analogy for the sentimental conceit it really is. In the same way we can probably recognize animal suffering when we see it, animal happiness is unmistakable, too, and during my week on the farm I saw it in abundance.""I will permit the possibility of brief animal happiness on a small farm right before the slaughter. Still, the inconvenient reality is that human agriculture contravenes the natural order of predation because we are the only creatures that bring animals into existence in order to slaughter them. The lion does not raise and propagate zebras in a nested enclosure indefinitely and delight in creating more and more efficient ways of slaughtering their offspring. This apparently small detail is conveniently left out in arguments from nature, as I will call them. ""To think of domestication as a form of slavery or even exploitation is to misconstrue that whole relationship—to project a human idea of power onto what is in fact an example of mutualism or symbiosis, rather than a political, development. The animals grew tame and lost their ability to fend for themselves in the wild and the humans traded hunter-gatherer ways for the settled lives of agriculturists. Humans changed biologically, too.""Don't equate the domestication of wolves to the slaughter of chicks. Red herring fallacy. ""[This] is where the animal rightists betray a deep ignorance about the workings of nature."" Again, there is nothing natural about industrial agriculture. ""The very existence of predation in nature, of animals eating animals, is the cause of much anguished hand-wringing in the animal rights literature. 'It must be admitted,' Peter Singer writes, 'that the existence of carnivorous animals does pose one problems for the ethics of Animal Liberation, and that is whether we should do anything about it.' (Talk about the need for peacekeeping forces!)""On the one hand, this made me laugh a bit because I've always been disturbed by the existence of predation in the wild. That many creatures rely on the pain and suffering of other animals in order to live is but a testament to the fallen state of the world, which is also why Jupiter is a purer and superior planet to Earth. But I digress. (My sister has christened this Jupiter propaganda🪐, which I readily admit.)In any event, I've already unravelled this false equivalency between natural predation and the very systematic multiplication of animals bred for the slaughter, season after season. From doom to dust.""Today, the organic food industry finds itself in a most unexpected, uncomfortable, and yes, unsustainable position: floating on a sinking sea of petroleum.""""U.S. agricultural policy, like the Declaration of Independence, is founded on the principle that all carrots are created equal, even though there's good reason to believe this isn't really true.""Birds can't get access to the outdoors until at least 5 weeks old and are slaughtered at 7, so ""free range turns out to be not so much a lifestyle for these chickens as a two-week vacation option.""""From the moment an organic lettuce plant is ready for harvest, the rest of its journey from field to produce aisle follows a swift and often ingenious industrial logic that is only nominally organic.""The fact that steer are given numbers as names makes Holocaust comparisons all too facile...""The farmers desperate to boost yield end up degrading their land, plowing and planting marginal land, applying more nitrogen—anything to squeeze a few more bushels from the soil.""""Nor would such a culture be shocked to discover that there are other countries, such as Italy and France, that decide their dinner questions on the basis of such quaint and unscientific criteria as pleasure and tradition, eat all manner of 'unhealthy' foods, and, lo and behold, wind up actually healthier and happier in their eating than we are. We show our surprise at this by speaking of something called the 'French paradox,' for how could a people who eat such demonstrably toxic substance as foie gras and triple crème cheese actually be slimmer and healthier than we are? Yet I wonder if it doesn't make more sense to speak in terms of an American paradox—that is, a notably unhealthy people obsessed by the idea of eating heathily."""
121,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73483095-cynnamon,0,"I bought this book, because I had thouroughly enjoyed Michael Pollans ""Cooking"".But here I give up.I have read around 100 pages about corn. I learned a lot I didn't know before, but unfortunately I didn't care about my newly acquired knowledge.Also the book is completely US-centric, which makes it for me as an European not quite so interesting.This book is outside of my scope of interest, therefore I refrain from assigning a rating."
122,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,5,"I really like Pollan’s writing style, he brings points home with simplicity, and he is able to cover a lot of ground without the writing feelings unnecessarily circuitous or blustery. More than that though, I like that he is willing to experience. I mean, that’s the very core of responsible journalism, Pollan goes and works on the farms, he helps slaughter chickens, he sits in tractors, he goes hunting and foraging, he throws himself bodily and emotionally into these experiences, and at each point I felt that he was incredibly honest with both himself and the reader about the impacts of his actions and his emotional state.All in all I thought it was refreshingly non-biased, fair appraising look at industrial agriculture/ranching, industrial/artisanal organic agriculture/ranching, and hunting/foraging. I say that as a person literally smack dab in the middle of row-crop country (my husband and his family farms), as a gardener, and as a hunter. I’ve long had a problem with the way we raise meat in this country, and the lack of connection between people and their food. Its one of the reasons that I do hunt and garden, and its also one of the reasons that I’ve mostly switched to plant proteins for all meals except supper. I am continuing to try and evolve how I eat, and it’s a learning experience and I don’t always get it right (I ate spaghettio’s twice in three days last week, no one’s perfect). But its hard to read this book without examining the role that we eaters have in the natural world. I am going to make a concerted effort to eat in-season vegetables except for those that I froze from my garden in the summer, and I’m going to try and rely on our game meats more. Despite reading much about early life on the prairie, somehow I had never considered that even meat was seasonal, or that foods grown out of season lack the nutrition that we think we are getting. They’re both very “duh” concepts, but its not something that I had really appreciated. Nor had I valued the waste of petroleum in shipping year round under-nourished produce from Argentina to the US just so that we could eat whatever fruit or veggie that we want, despite its lack of flavor.Perhaps the greatest thing that came from this was the conversations with my husband. He listened to the audiobook while in the tractor, and it was great to talk to him when he came home at night about the ways agriculture has changed since Pollan wrote (advances in technology have changed the level of precision for farmers, becoming more environmentally friendly for those that upgrade), but also the ways that it could continue to change. What could we do as eaters, hunters, buyers, and producers in our local community? Books that foster conversation and change always get a 5 out of 5.Absolutely recommend to everyone. Read those food labels. Speak out. We deserve, as buyers, connectivity and information about our food, and animals especially deserve better than what we manage for our convenience."
123,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/307041-ginny-messina,3,"A truly important book by gifted writer and journalist Michael Pollan. It's not without its flaws, however, and for all the promise of the first two-thirds of the book, it kind of leaves the reader hanging at the end. In the first part, Pollan exposes the damaging effects of industrial agriculture, and—-importantly—-this includes large-scale organic production which is not nearly as benign as most people would like to believe. Later in the book he addresses the inhumane aspect of industrial agriculture as well—-organic production included. He puts it succinctly: you look away, or you stop eating meat. In the second part of the book, we see farming as it should be, on Polyface Farm in the Shenandoah Valley. Here, farming practices are closely tied to nature including the natural behavior of farm animals. While the system doesn't adhere completely to organic regulations, it is far more sustainable and humane than industrial organic agriculture and certainly more so than conventional agriculture. Polyface Farm is not able to separate itself from industrial agriculture completely (by law, the steer are killed in conventional slaughterhouses) but it still seems like a very nice place. Unfortunately, the scale on which it operates means that this type of sustainable farming can never produce enough food for the U.S. population. Food from farms like Polyface is likely to be available to only a privileged few. The last part of the book struck me as downright nonsensical. Pollan explores the possibility of putting together the ultimate local meal—-one composed of food that he himself has hunted, gathered and grown. But don't try this at home, he says. It is not at all a realistic way to eat. Well—-no—-not if you do it by gathering chanterelle mushrooms with a bunch of chefs from Chez Panisse, hunting wild boar in the California woods, and diving for abalone along a rocky coast. Granted, most Americans would be hard-pressed to produce their own food, but Pollan doesn't even explore the option in any kind of realistic or meaningful fashion. In the end, it appears that the problems associated with food production are insurmountable. Industrial agriculture provides most of the food in this country and is a wasteful and unsustainable system. But more sustainable systems are not realistic for feeding the population. Pollan does not offer any clear cut answers, much to my surprise. (I didn't expect him to solve the problem; I did expect a little guidance!) But the thoughtful reader can still pull together a plan of action to minimize the environmental and ethical cost of a meal. Reduce intake of animal foods. Buy locally-produced food. Grow or produce as much as is realistic for you. Pollan makes his readers think about where their meals come from and how to measure the true cost of our ""inexpensive"" food. This is a must-read for anyone who expresses a desire to live and eat responsibly. "

I can't really say this book was a waste of my time though because i gained some useful knowledge from it and some parts equally annoyed me but what more can i expect from a book riddled with self righteous prose from an author who writes in a way that sets him up on the ""right"" moral pedestal? This may not have been his intention but i do not care either way. I am just glad i finished it and i hope to never be subjected to the torture of reading a book i have no interest in, for class again. So long and good riddance!"

"
127,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147289-jason-pettus,5,"Journalist Michael Pollan has a reputation for writing books that people don't just like, but whose very lives get permanently changed because of reading them; and I can attest that this exact thing has happened to me after reading my first book of his, the extraordinary 2006 guide to modern food practices known as The Omnivore's Dilemma. In it, Pollan imagines three typical meals a contemporary American might eat -- one of fast food, one of Whole Foods-type groceries, and one literally put together through foraging and hunting -- then over the course of 60,000 words shows us exactly, step by minute step, how the ingredients in each meal can be traced back and back until finally reaching a point of a living plant being grown in the ground somewhere, then building us back forward again by showing exactly what happens to that plant step by step as it makes its way from the farm to eventually our mouths.Along the way, then, Pollan gives us an astute history of the post-war industrial agricultural industry; explains why exactly corn is the overwhelming number-one crop now grown in America; gives us the horrifying reasons that most cattle and chicken have to be fed so many antibiotics in order to merely survive under such harsh industrial conditions; demonstrates why in a middle-class consumerist society these conditions have to happen in the first place (that is, because if cows were still grown in the humane way they were in an agricultural society, a McDonald's hamburger would cost $30, and the American people would riot); shows through personal field trips what exactly the difference is between ""cage-free,"" ""free range"" and ""pastured"" eggs, and why one of these options is infinitely better than the others; details why the term ""organic"" on a food label can mean vastly different things depending on the company and circumstances; and shows through illuminating first-hand experience why we are no longer a hunter-gatherer society (namely, because it's exhausting, inefficient, and makes people run the risk of sometimes going entire weeks at a time without finding anything edible to eat).Easily the most interesting book I've read in a decade, The Omnivore's Dilemma has permanently changed the way I now shop for groceries, knowing as I now do so many more details about what each label on a package means, and how different growing circumstances can often literally mean a difference in the resulting food's nutrition (just for one example, how Pollan scientifically proves here that eggs from chickens that are allowed to roam freely on farmland are literally better for you than eggs grown from chickens kept in cages); and although I haven't completely given up fast food, certainly every hamburger I now buy makes me ponder the indescribably monstrous and cruel circumstances by which that cow lived its life, which has already influenced just how many hamburgers I buy in general. (It also makes me understand a lot better why there will always be people around in any society who are more than happy to perform that society's most inhumane tasks, such as rounding up undocumented immigrants, ripping their children away from them, and throwing them into concentration camps while openly laughing in their faces...but that's neither here nor there, I suppose.) To tell the truth, the only reason I read this in the first place was because I was waiting for the day in early June that Pollan's newest book came out, a 600-page whopper called How to Change Your Mind that looks in exhaustive detail at all the latest 21st-century research into the connections between psychedelic drugs, mindfulness, meditation, mental health, what MRIs can teach us about what we've traditionally called the ""soul,"" and a lot more. That book is now finished too, and was just as fascinating as The Omnivore's Dilemma, so keep an eye out for my write-up of that in another couple of weeks.UPDATE 1: I find it utterly fascinating that the only negative reviews here of this book are from vegetarians, who are so upset at Pollan's conclusion that humans as omnivores are perfectly capable of eating meat, they're willing to dismiss every single other vegetarian-friendly thing he has to say. (Ultimately Pollan is pro-vegetable in this book, despite concluding that meat is indeed an edible substance that humans find edible.) A huge part of this book is all about how the politics of any given age has a huge influence over our opinions on the supposedly ""scientifically objective"" subjects of diet and nutrition, and the vitriolic negative reviews of the book by militant vegetarians here simply proves his point all over again.UPDATE 2: After reading other people's reviews, I agree with something I saw a lot of people mention; that a clear sign of how much I loved this book is that people at Twitter eventually got sick of me constantly tweeting about it while I was reading it. Be prepared to drive your friends and spouse crazy!"
128,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85296-jake,4,"1)Corn is Bad, Grass is Good 2)Eat Seasonally, Eat Locally, Eat Humanely, & Eat Organically 3)Eat Sh*t and Die. Well, Actually, Eat Sh*t and Flourish. Each of these would have been a more classy title for the book ""Omnivore's Dilemma"". To paraphrase another reviewer 'The dude structures this book by following the path of four finished meals from origin to plate - one McDonald's meal, one comprised of supermarket organic products, one from a ""beyond-organic"" self-sustaining farm in Virginia, and one he forages almost entirely on his own. This book tries to provokes a lot of thought about the origins of our food and the biological, political, social and economic implications of those origins, and for the most part, it is successful.' So after reading this book I realize that maybe, just maybe, I don’t argue with people about food enough. Ever since I read  Fast Food Nation  and watched  Supersize Me  I have been pretty good about avoiding eating at Mc-stablishments and drinking soda. Knowing these efforts aren’t enough, but not having had the ...chutzpah ... to make the leap to full fledged, ""morally superior"" vegetarianism. I am way to lazy to manage an urban garden, -- preferring rather to watch one made on TV OD presents, as a moral alternative to growing, actually hunting and eating wild game. The parts of the book that describe this stuff, although not seemingly not feasible, reinforced these previously formed notions about foraging. Still, it is pretty interesting to see the details fleshed out.One thing discussed in the book that i hadn't internalized, and that makes sense when I think about it, is that going to whole foods and buying an organic Chilean artichoke in the winter can be a lot worse ethically than eating a fat juicy steak from a locally raised mature grass fed cow. I guess that the ethical answer culled from the book on how to shop food in the city is to buy at farmers markets or join one of these CSA’s. Take the extra step and get to know your farmer, know how they grow, know how they feed and treat the animals is the right thing to do. This seems like undue effort and cost but the ethical equivalent seems to be to hunt and dress bloody dead animals or forage for mushrooms in central park. In that perspective, the first options seems like less effort ."

These range from the nearby McDonald's and Burger Kind to the supermarket to the local farmer's stand. Michael Pollan takes a look at four ways to have a meal - one industrial meal at McDonald's, one organic meal from Whole Foods, one local meal from a farmer's field, and one completely ""homemade"" meal made from hunting and foraging.I must say, the first 300 pages are riveting, absolutely enthralling! I kept putting aside fiction to read this book, it was so good! However, when I hit the chapters on hunting and foraging, I found my interest severely waning. I really don't care at all about hunting animals and foraging for mushrooms, so keeping my attention was nearly impossible (this is why I took off a star). But the end picks up as Pollan returns to the final ""perfect"" meal.This book had so much really good information - information that once again cements my desire never to eat food at a fast food restaurant ever again. If one of your New Year's Resolutions is to eat healthier, read this book to bolster that desire!!"

The parts on farming, the evils of monoculture, the importance of grass, were especially enlightening. I don't normally eat beef and I would definitely reduce the intake even more. The most shocking part for me was the 'pastoral organic' revelation. I wonder if the organic products sold in Indonesia as are bad as the greenwashed examples in this book, which are all about the US market. The later parts of the book - hunting and cooking - were not as interesting for me as the earlier parts. Hence the four stars. Still, a fascinating read and highly recommended to everyone."

I support a small flock of happy chickens instead.Lengthy review to come. In the meantime, let me just say---I learned a lot from this book. I also enjoyed some segments very much. I would have done some extensive editing.The final chapter is sublime. OK, my real review:I am a convenience eater. Michael Pollan's work is transforming me into a conscious eater. Two concrete changes in my behavior: I will now pay the price of a fancy mocha coffee beverage for a dozen eggs gathered from happy chickens. I will also see commercially available breaded chicken with a side of corn as corn dressed with corn and a side of corn. I still may eat it, but at least I know what I'm getting!It is my hope that these wonderful books I have been reading indicate an American paradigm shift, and that the marketplace will allow people like me (who don't want to spend the time and effort tracking down purveyers of all sorts of specialty foods) more chances to make conscious choices in a convenient way. I will do my best to make choices that are more healthful for me and our planet regardless.This book was successful in changing my behavior. In large part, it was successful because I was already ripe for changing. Everything from Kingsolver's Animal Vegetable Miracle to Buford's Heat to Van Draanen's sweet young adult novel Flipped has been telling me to embrace these changes. This work built upon that foundation and presented a lot more detailed information supporting the choices that we should all be making. It was well structured, and it needed to be. So much information was packed into each section, it was necessary for me to take breaks. Some peeves---Too many declarative sentences. All declarative sentences put me on guard. (See what I did there?) I read something that says or implies ""all"" and I immediately start casting about defensively for the exceptions. I blame SAT prep. I was also put off by the way in which those declarations seemed designed to make me so defensive, mostly when he seemed dismissive of the travails of gardening, or scornful of the kind of hunter who does not agonize over the creatures' deaths. Second person. I hate second person. Here's a sentence that combined 2 peeves: ""You can forage in the garden, in the way Adam and Eve presumably did, but there isn't much to it: no dilemmas, no hunting stories."" And it's kind of a run on sentence too, now that I look at it, although that (obviously, having read any of my reviews!) isn't such a major irritation for me. (See what I did there?)Rampant anthropomorphism. Corn does not feel happy about taking over the world! Corn does not feel happy! Corn does not feel! This is a Truth. I believe that much of the anthropomorphism here was used as a bit of shorthand, implying all the Darwinian blah blah blah rather than spelling it out, and also trying to fix an image in the mind of the reader, but it is NOT TRUE. It bothers me. (Althoug I do like the image of an army of cornstalks marchng across the landscape, and it truly did stick with me.)LOVED---All descriptions of all meals.All the time spent at the idealized farm. (I forget what it's called and can't be bothered to look it up.)Everything to do with the mushrooms. (I think I'm due to read a book about mushrooms next.)The desription of the first hunt----soooooo true to my one hunting experience, in which I spent every fiber of my being on NOT MAKING ANY NOISE. It was such an intense time, and he captured that beautiully.I feel like there's so much more to say. Suiffice---I enjoyed most of this book. I learned. A lot. "
133,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1242165-schmacko,4,"So much has been written about this book, and so much will be defined by how you feel comfortable when discussing your eating habits. Here are, in short forms, my 10 observations:1)	If you’ve ever wondered how much the American government is responsible for your eating by subsidizing corporations who grow corn and make high fructose corn syrup, this is a book for you! SHORT VERSION: Corn is in EVERYTHING! We committed to growing corn when we could possibly switch to many varied crops. Corn is uniform, so it’s very corporate. If you hate political reading, if you don’t want to know this stuff, or you don’t frankly care, skip Pollan’s book. (Hope you enjoy your diabetes.)2)	Yes, we know organic food is better for us. But Pollan does a great job telling us that the US family’s annual food budget has actually dropped over the last 60 years, so Americans could conceivably spend more on food (and probably less on entertainment) and help out their diets.3)	I thought his section on Whole Foods founder John Mackey was interesting. Mackey completely concedes that he isn’t as radical as he started, that he has basically bought into the American corporate structure in order to take baby steps in supporting a business and helping people eat more healthfully.4)	At times, Pollan sounds a little Communist. At least, anti-Capitalist. I’m ok with that – to each his own – and I believe that American politics is all about constant discourse and adjustment.5)	Knowing the details of a slaughterhouse was a little much for me, but then again, I have no problem killing what I eat. Which makes me unlike 97% of Americans, who like to think their meat comes fully formed in plastic packages.6)	I love how Pollan describes the grey color of a McDonald’s burger. Funny! (I still crave Wendy’s once or twice a month.)7)	Mushroom foraging always sounded like something I wanted to do. Until I read his accounts. Mushroom foragers are crazy, obsessed people!8)	He’s lucky he had help at parts, or Pollan would’ve starved.9)	I like how he concedes that there is a better way to eat meat – that you don’t have to become a militant vegan.10)	I still wish we humans would accept that we are PART of the food chain!!! GRRR! We have canines; we have eaten meat for centuries. Our whole digestive system is built for meat! Lots of animals eat meat. We are not better than other animals that kill; the only thing that could possibly make us better is if we kill as quickly and painlessly as possible. We are the predators, and we should act as such – but with judiciousness and care. When we try to be ABOVE IT ALL – when we manipulate the environment – as Pollan excellently points out – we ruin it. “Dominion” humans create corporate slaughterhouses and run animals to extinction. Vegans treat animals as individuals to be coddled and encouraged to overproduce; soon, we’ll be overrun with deer and pumas and wild boar while we huddle eating berries from the sides of our abandoned roads (vehicles lead to road kill!) We need to accept that humans – like our predator cousins - do kill to survive, that we can be better at it, and that we are not ABOVE the food chain – as meat eaters or vegans – we are part of the system and should act accordingly. (Pollan mentions this, but doesn’t bring it home.)"
134,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260196-peter,5,"I started into this worried it was going to force me into vegetarianism, that I was going to read some passage about calves born into rancid waste, and a blue light somewhere in my brain would turn green and a gag reflex would accompany the thought of meat moving forward....Which speaks either to my penchant for pessimism, or the ominous relationship we have to our food chain, where we _don't_ really want to know how food got there, we just want to eat it.But read the book I did, fearful to encounter that meat-snatching passage within the book. Thankfully, Pollan is not an alarmist, but rather a quite methodical inquisitor about the roots of our food. It sounds kind of..esoteric, but he makes it fascinating, like a great humanities teacher he tells the larger story of food: of why we grow so much fricking corn in America, and how it's bad for almost everyone involved: ourselves, our diet, farmers in other countries.The good thing is that the book never descends into a polemic, unlike Michael Moore's work, Pollan's evenhandedness keeps the reader open to what he is saying. Nothing is extreme or revolutionary or incendiary.I feel like this book will, in the long term, shape the way I think about food by giving me a vocabulary for considering my personal and our cultural relationship to food. He discusses how America as a nation of immigrants never developed a stable national cuisine (unlike France or Italy), and the absence of that makes us vulnerable to an endless array of fad diets (coughAdkinscough) and an overall menu that is out of balance.There is a fascinating chapter on mushrooms and fungi, which details how they are utterly different from plants, and grow from this crazy underground symbiosis with decomposing nutrients and tree roots, taking a single drop of sugar from the tree root in exchange for processed minerals from the soil.There is an extended look at a farm outside Charlottesville--Polyface Farm--which models itself after natural ecosystems and creates this method of rotating cattle and chickens with grass growth cycles to create this wonderful whirlwind of spreadsheets, efficiency, and microdata on growth patterns of grass.To wit: it's better to have grass pasture surrounded by trees, because a blade of grass will burn X calories turning the face of it's blade toward the sun to receive solar energy. Planting forests around removes wind, allowing the grass to grow higher. Brilliant.In the end, it's about food, but it's also about systems in general. It begins to feel like a universal look at the interrelationship of history and commerce, and how everything is this big interconnected fabric, but that you can begin to see some of those connections, and kind of surf those links to great personal and collective gain.12/2007"

I use the word “threaten” very deliberately, because they are changes that I know I'm going to find challenging.Michael Pollan challenges his readers to examine their food a little closer, to consider where it comes from. And it's a logical request I think. We can spend days searching for the perfect doctor or mechanic, but how much time do we take to really think about our food? Do you know where your steak came from? Is your asparagus from a nearby farm, or far-flung Argentina? Are your peaches organic, and if so, what does that really mean? Most of us have no idea how to answer these questions.In most cases, the answers are simple. Most of our food likely comes from a massive industrial farm or feed-lot hundreds of miles away, fed by incredible amounts of fossil fuels -- the fertilizer, the machines used for harvesting, the trucks it took to transport the food to your local mega-mart, to name just a few uses of fossil fuel. Pollan's descriptions of these farms (and in particular, the feed lots) can be quite disturbing. However, Pollan does not outright condemn this ""industrial food chain."" He concedes that it would be difficult to feed billions of people inexpensively without it. Instead, he advocates having several different avenues for delivering food to our tables, and he describes several alternatives. It is up to the reader to determine how they want to eat. As for me, my eyes have been opened to the appeal of ""eating locally,"" where possible. (Emphasis on ""where possible."" There aren't too many oranges grown in Idaho.) By eating foods produced as close to my home as possible, I support the local economy, less fossil fuels are used, and the food should have fewer preservatives, hormones, and other chemical ingredients. Best of all, the food should be fresher and more flavorful. Yes, it will cost more, but I think it will be worth it. At least I'm willing to try it. Consider it an experiement. I've already found local sources of milk, eggs and meat that I'm going to try. I found Pollan's writing engaging and easy to read. (Disclaimer: I am a huge nerd, and the topic really spoke to me. If you don't like science, you may not find this book as fascinating.) A few words of warning: if evolution makes you uncomfortable, you may not like this book, as it often talks about the evolution of plants, animals and humans. Also, there were two or three instances where objectionable language was used. "
136,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4161947-m-l-rudolph,5,"2006. NY Times Book Review One of the 10 Best Books of the Year. We eat every day of our lives but we don't often give much thought to what we put in our bodies. If we are what we eat, then when it comes to meat, we are what the animal eats; and when it comes to produce, we are what the plant's grown in. There's a food chain that extends around the world and throughout evolutionary history from the beginning of man. Michael Pollan takes us on a tour of that chain and in the process gives any thinking, eating, person a new, often disturbing, view of what he/she consumes.Organized in three sections to illuminate industrial food (corn), pastoral food (grass), and personal food (the forest), Pollan's narrative builds toward meals made as nearly as possible with ingredients and methods from each of these categories.I double-dog-dare anyone to read this book and walk through a modern supermarket without viewing each item of food differently. And if you're like me, take your glasses, because the real information about what we buy and eat is in the small print, written in code, to disguise as much as possible what we truly consume. The central area of the supermarket is processed food. Good luck figuring that out. (When you can't determine the identity of fifteen out of eighteen ingredients on that package of processed whatever - chances are high what you're reading - and eating - are corn derivatives.) Around the walls, where we find the produce, meat, and fish, it would seem that the information describing the food would be more straight-forward. Good luck figuring that out, too. (Chances are every formerly living item was nourished or fertilized with corn or corn derivatives.)Unless you plan to follow a steer or a chicken through its life cycle to see how the animal lives, and dies, and becomes the food on your plate, you have to rely on someone like Pollan to take that trip for you, document his findings, and present it as he does here. I've read about food my entire life and tried to keep up on healthy eating without succumbing to fads, but I've never encountered such an intelligent, entertaining, and practical guide to the state of food in America today as The Omnivore's Dilemma. Read it and eat. "
137,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36341-c,5,"Pollan's book is not just a fascinating look at the modern state and evolution of our industrial food complex; it's not merely an anthropological investigation of the history of eating and cultural rituals; it's more than a scientific discourse of the biological nature of corn, small farm ecosystems, and fungi -- it's also, surprisingly, a page turner. When I was finished, I wanted the book to be twice as long.The book is also not (as many people seem to think) a political screed or manifesto -- Pollan isn't necessarily telling everyone to stop eating industrial food and switch to local, small farm food, as he acknowledges how impractical such a course of action actually is. Rather, he investigates our relationships with food, both personal and societal, scientific and ethical. He does find the industrial complex distasteful and disturbing and the small, sustainable farm he visits ideal but (and perhaps this is the choir appreciating the sermon) those conclusions seem inescapable.This book didn't change any of my ideas about eating, as I already try to eat locally and avoid processed food, but I learned a lot about the nature of food, from how terrifyingly omnipresent corn is to the amazingly complex ecosystem of a farm. It's one of those books that you constantly put down so you can turn to someone and say ""Oh my god, did you know that . . . """
138,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"This book has profoundly changed my view on my food, and subsequently, my world. I have read many nonfiction books, but nothing was so personal as this investigation on where our food comes from. Pollan sets put to investigate four markedly different food chains, and ends up having to revise his world view, and acquire new friends in search for a profound understanding of food, nature, and humanity.I have finished this on Feb 28, 2019. I will write a longer review when I collect my thoughts. There is plenty of food for thought (pardon the pun... did not intend it but hey, it fits.)"
139,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4123952-alasse,5,"I was so scared that this would turn out to be a foodie hipster's rant on what food should be like, instead of what it actually is. I'm relieved to admit that I was mistaken - in fact, it's one of the most thought-provoking books I've read this year. It's helped me to fully flesh out some apprehensions I had which I'd never actually put into words, such as 'Is organic really about chemical paranoia?' 'What's the environmental impact of mindlessly shipping food all over the continent?' 'How in the world does that even make sense economically?' Okay, that last one I had actually wondered about, more than once. I used to have a long commute.The Omnivore's Dilemma is also less location specific than Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal, which was a plus for me. I love reading about American lifestyles and behaviors (it's the whole deep-down-i-know-we're-next thing), but most of the industrial talk doesn't really apply to me. Pollan did a great job of giving a panoramic view of all the different approaches to eating in the first world, that's true. But mostly, it was his naturalist's view of things that made his discourse universal and relatable for me.Also, I've realized I have some very strong and mostly unfair prejudices against hunters. A book that manages to make me change my mind on a particular subject* is a book that deserves 5 stars. Shame on me.What else? Oh, apparently now I find ecology fascinating, which poses a new TBR list control challenge. F****ck.*while quoting a lot of Ortega y Gasset, I might add. Ortega FTW!! I went through an Ortega phase when I was like 17, so anyone who quotes Ortega to prove a point instantly gets bonus points with me."
140,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,3,"I grew up on a farm in Michigan where we grew corn and soybeans. The years when we rotated our crops to grow field corn, it was harvested to feed the chickens at the local egg farm. Thus I have some first hand experience with the first few chapters of the Omnivore’s Dilemma and the chapter on the farm rang especially true for me.This book is popular and enough time has passed that it probably qualifies as a classic and is certainly worth a read. It is a honest portrayal by a professor on the modern US food web highlighting many of the problems of our modern omnivore society spanning the spectrum from steroids to animal ethics. There were four chapters that I would consider as excellent: The Farm, The Feedlot, Grass and the Forager. The other twenty chapters were ok.I had no issue with the messaging of the book and wholly agree that it is important to understand where our modern food comes from. I will admit that I promptly ate organic vegetarian for my next meal after finishing the book as there are a few unpleasant facts associated with meat processing. I am sure I will become a carnivore again by tomorrow.I did have a few problems with the construction of the book however.1. At times it strayed from the science and empirical observations to become a little too professorial or perhaps too philosophical. This choice was understandable but gave me a meh kind of feeling.2. At times the book was a bit boring, although there were some intriguing chapters mixed throughout the book.3. I did not like most of the chapter titles such as Slaughter is a Glass Abattoir. Keep it simple like Cows, Corn, Chickens, Grass and the messaging of the chapter would resonate more.I rate the book at 3.5 stars."
141,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66672731-michael-jandrok,4,"I have always been interested in food culture, though I would have never considered myself to be a “foodie” in the strictest sense. That term always carried a bit of hipster baggage to my mind. I would tend to picture modern U.S. food culture as a sort of hummus-slathered menu dominated by low-fat recipes meant to reflect the popular diet trends of the day. Those attitudes began to change for me when I was diagnosed with cancer. Suddenly food became a big deal for me, first as something that I actively avoided as my appetite dwindled and my daily routine ran to getting as many calories in my body as I could, regardless of the delivery system. As someone living with colorectal cancer, food was a tough sell for me as the disease progressed. My tastes changed and most foods that I used to love became alien to me. But a funny thing happened as my treatment started to take hold and my appetite slowly began to return. I began to consciously embrace “foodie” culture with an eye towards expanding my palate and eating healthier. A big part of this ongoing effort has been educating myself on what would be the “right” things to eat given that I had a disease that directly affected my tastes and digestive functions. I didn’t want specific “diet” books, per se. What I wanted and needed was comprehensive information on what constitutes food itself, with an eye towards the science and sociology of developing better food habits and cooking techniques. Before my disease took hold, I was a 5’5”, 165 pound ball of muscle and muffin top, still trying to fit into size 34 jeans. At the peak of the cancer, when I was at my lowest point physically, I was 106 pounds and looked like a shell of my former self. After a year and a half of treatment, I am back up to 140 pounds, due in large part to eating better and making more informed choices as to the food that I put into my body. I can thank books like “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” for giving me a respectable knowledge base to make those wise culinary decisions. Author Michael Pollan has been writing about food for many years now. This book was originally published in 2006 and was one of his earlier efforts at culinary writing. The material has aged well. I do think that we have become a bit smarter as a food culture in the intervening years, but the basic information presented here is still valid and useful. I will take a moment here to caution prospective readers that Pollan’s visit to a large-scale feedlot and the rendering plant is graphic and somewhat disturbing. One can’t read these sections and not begin to question what it means to consume beef. The premise of the text is pretty simple and the nature of the ""omnivore's dilemma"" can be summed up quite nicely: as creatures that can eat virtually anything, the big question can be defined as ""what SHOULD we eat?” Pollan sets out to find the answer to this question by tracing 4 meals back to their sources. IN the course of the book he dissects a fast food meal, a store-bought organic entree, a ""beyond organic"" meal produced entirely at a polyculture farm, and a meal that he hunts and gathers (almost) entirely by himself. Along the way, he asks the reader to join him in his quest for a more thorough knowledge of the food that we eat and a better understanding of how the decisions that we make as food consumers help to shape our cultural and physical landscape.This is an intensely interesting book, and an important addition to the bookshelf for anyone interested in becoming more ""food-aware"". Pollan's journey is always engaging, sometimes spiritual (""we are what we eat…."" takes on a new dimension when one stops to look at it with this much depth), and occasionally frightening. He is always respectful of his cast of characters, and he is willing to challenge his own preconceptions and ideas as he gathers knowledge and experience. Note that there are no recipes to be found within these pages, nor any specific information on the art of cooking. This is a book that is fully invested in talking about food as a consumer product; what it is, where it comes from, and what the impacts and implications are when you decide to make a food consumption choice.Michael Pollan strikes me as a fairly engaging and nice guy. I’d like to sit down to a meal with him and talk shop. I learned a lot from this book that I can actively put into practice as I seek to modify my eating habits with an eye towards maximum health benefits. Along with that I gained some ways to make more responsible choices as a food consumer, and that’s just as important as the health angle for me. I’ll be seeking out more of Pollan’s food writing.Coda #1: After reading a number of reviews for this book, I can honestly say that this is a pretty polarizing piece of writing. A substantial number of vegetarians and vegans panned the book because of its acceptance of what Pollan would call “responsible” meat consumption. And there is no doubt that the author does indeed support the idea that eating meat can be done in an ethical fashion. I won’t rehash the arguments in the reviews here. Having a background in anthropology I can tell you that from a biological perspective humans have absolutely evolved as omnivores. Those canine teeth in your mouth didn’t appear because primates had an exclusively vegetarian diet, they are there specifically for the catching of prey and the tearing of meat. That said, we would do well as a species to eat a lot LESS meat, and there is no denying the environmental damage that is done by widespread meat consumption. Coda #2: That idea of responsible meat consumption is central to Pollan’s ideas. But it’s larger than just meat. The whole idea here is to gain a more thorough understanding of where our food comes from and from there develop better and more responsible food habits. Modern supermarket culture has taken away a lot of the basic knowledge of food...where it comes from, how it is grown or raised, etc. Pollan states outright that we would all be better off if we once again gained a real connection to our food, one that goes well beyond opening a can or a package and dropping something into a pot to warm it up. That concept alone makes “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” valuable and worthwhile.Coda #3: Another criticism of the book centered on Pollan himself, and the idea that the concepts in “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” can only be absorbed and put into action by an affluent audience. I’m not really sure I buy this argument. It’s true that “foodie” culture seems to have a footprint squarely in a sort of urban-hipster vibe, but the fact is that lower-income folks can put any of the ideas in this book into action just the same as any other demographic. In point, much has been made in the news lately of the current regime’s idea to hand out “food boxes” in place of letting assistance recipients make their own food choices. That would mean a direct impact on the farmer’s markets who accept assistance payments. That tells me that plenty of lower-income people have learned how to make healthy and ethical culinary choices that stretch their food dollars to the max. "

144,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/693262-huyen,5," If i could think of this book as a meal, then indeed Michael Pollan is a marvelous cook. He writes well, vividly and convincingly.As dense and informative as it is, the book doesn't make me feel bloated, but nourished :] I can't remember the last time I have discussed a book so many times, with so many different people. Chapter 17 on the ethics of eating animals is just mind-blowing and alone can make this book a worthwhile read.i can't resist talking about it before anything else. I've tried to become a vegetarian a couple of times and have always eventually lapsed back into eating meat. The main reason I would ever become a vegetarian is environmental, the huge amount of energy expended in producing and preserving meat. I've always found the ethics of eating meat hard to defend on the moral basis. And it's fascinating to see a person do it convincingly like Pollan. Pollan starst with Peter Singer's argument against eating meat. A wonderfully simple but powerful idea: ""if possessing a higher degree of intelligence does not entitle one human to use another for his or her own ends, how can it entitle humans to exploit non-humans for the same purpose?"". Leaving aside the problematic question of how we define animal ""intelligence"", there is no debate as to whether animals can suffer. And if we have extended equal rights to women, minorities, homosexuals, should we and why don't we extend these rights to other species? ouch. most people, like me, when faced with this question and thinking about it seriously, either look away or become vegetarians. it is difficult to reconcile our instincts to eat meat and the moral implications of it. but Pollan shows us that those are not the only two alternatives.He argues that while animals rightists have always stressed the suffering of animals due to our meat eating habits (although we have rather slim evidence of exactly what goes on in the brain of a pig about to go to heaven, (or hell?)), they have also failed to acknowledge that humans are capable of giving animals a decent and happy life. and ""happy"" in this case means the ability to do what they would naturally do, either pigs rooting around in the dirt, or cows wandering on pastures. ""to think of domestication as a form of slavery or even exploitation is to miscontrue that whole relationship-to project a human idea or power onto what is in fact an example of mutualism or symbiosis between species."" as he points out, domestication is an evolutionary development. domesticated animals have a much higher chance of surviving than in the wild, compare dogs and wolves for example. they therefore evolve to serve human benefits, winning our favor, in order to be provided with shelter and protection. they probably don't like being killed very much, but if that gives them a longer life and a much better chance to spread their genes to the next generation, they would much rather be with us than be in nature. ""predation is not a matter of morality or of politics, it, too, is a matter of symbiosis. from the point of view of the individual prey animal predation is a horror, but from the point of view of the group-and of its gene pool-it is indispensable."" That is exactly the point that most animals rightists miss. they concern only with individuals, but nature doesn't work that way, no matter how cruel that might sound. nature is about maximizing the survival of the whole species. our morals were developed to help us function as a healthy, cooperative society, but it is rather irrelevant to what should happen in nature.Pollan charges that this very embraced and apparently self-righteous ""ideology"" is a product of an urban society which has lost touch with nature. A friend of mine told me that he took his children to a slaughterhouse to see how pigs are killed because he believes that if we want to eat meat, we should be able to face the morality involved in it. that, i think, is a respectable viewpoint. the children were slightly disturbed but it didn't stop them eating meat. this father is probably an exception in our society. most of us probably have never raised a cow and seen a cow. our meat comes from nice little packages that never remind us of that it comes from something that used to have a brain and can suffer. when i asked my NZ friends why people no longer eat animal organs, like we do in Vietnam, they stared at me with disturbed looks. but really, when you think about it, offal is very nutritious, and there's little reason why we can accept eating meat, but not kidney, heart, or brain. i suspect the reason is the viscera brings home to us the fact that what we are eating used to be quite similar to us, which means, having eyes, lungs, heart. and we are so scared to face that reality that we get rid of it altogether. the second reason is that once the meat production process is out of sight, we have lost the traditional rituals justifying the act of killing and governing the slaughter of animals. the disappearance of these old practices gives way to the brutalization of animals to the extent that the animals become so sick that we have pretty much run out of anti-biotics.but that is not the same as to say that we can eat meat carefree without any moral consideration. given the fact that our food chain has become increasingly industrialized and heavily dependent on fossil fuels, we do have a moral obligation to care about the health of nature, i.e, the condition of the soil, the health of the animals we eat, the impact of animal farming on the environment. I can't agree more with him that while we don't need or arguably shouldn't give up our meat consumption, we should at least make sure that the way we eat is sustainable and the animals we eat are treated decently. the way that animals are treated in most farms is quite despicable. and i bet that if we had a chance to look at it, most would quite happily choose to be vegetarian. giving animals a humane treatment does not only give us a clear conscience but really serves our benefits as well. who would not want to eat a healthy chicken instead of a disease-ridden one? recently, when a documentary about the treatment of pigs in battery farms in NZ was broadcast on TV, the public displayed outrage at what they saw and have pushed quite vigorously for legislation prohibiting cruel treatment of farm animals  see here. i don't know of progress elsewhere. i like the idea that once the public know about what's happening to what they eat, they can make a difference.most of the rest of the book deals with corn and how our (meaning American) food chain has been reduced to a monoculture of soy and corn. they are present in something like 75% of the processed food products on the market. 40% of the calories a Mexican eats comes from food. if you think that's quite astonishing, then apparently American have overtaken Mexicans to be kings of walking corns. corn became the winner in the competition to be human's favorite crop because of its capacity to store a lot more calories than other species. the invention of fertilizers (interestingly made widely available by the surplus ammonium nitrate after the war) made growing corn so incredibly efficient that corn gradually replaced all other crops. and in the 1950s, feeding cattle on feedlots was cheaper than on grass, enabling the farmers to build massive chicken factories. livestock farmers went out of business because they couldn't compete with giant factories. fertilizer was a mixed blessing because the soil fertility shifted from reliance on the sun and a careful rotation of crops, to fossil fuels. we might like to think that fertilizers make agriculture a lot more efficient, but in fact, we expend twice as much energy to produce corn than when we relied on nature. and that's not to mention the huge cost of environmental pollution.when corn got cheaper and cheaper, the Nixon government stepped in to subsidize it, encouraging growing even more corn of lower nutritional quality and sparking the beginning of agribusiness. the excess corn finds its way into most processed energy-dense foods and feeding livestock. getting rid of this huge amount of excess energy contributes to obesity and an impoverished food culture. it makes good economic sense to dump excess corn on cattle, but biologically, they evolved to eat grass, and being forced to eat something they are not supposed to eat has caused grave problems. in a shit hole with piles of waste, polluted air and water and no space to even wiggle their tails, the only way these cows can survive is to swallow humongous amounts of anti-biotics. that sounds quite depressing, but the organic industry doesn't really hold a torch toward a moral utopia as we would hope. Pollan points out that the organic industry has diverged exponentially from its original ideals in the 1960s, and is now not so much better than the establishment. they consume a huge amount of energy to transport their products across the country, most ""free range"" farms mean that the chicken has a palm-sized window to look at the sun 5 minutes a day. real organic farmers have a hard time to get their products on the market because of government regulations. to me it seems like America's unsustainable food consumption is perpetuated by a cycle of ignorance and government intervention. so much for laissez-faire capitalism. growing so much corn might seem to make good economic sense. we must admit that it's quite remarkable that this is the first time in human history, we can produce food so cheaply and so abundantly. but this is the thing that has always not sat right with me about economics. that it hides all the expensive external costs involved in the process: environmental degradation, costs to the government in terms of subsidies, a huge consumption of fossil fuels, public health and malnourishment. so in fact, eating cheap corn is very expensive. so the key question is WHY is America doing all these things that defy logic? to summarize the whole story in one word, I'd say efficiency. feeding corn to livestock is so much cheaper and easier than grass (don't have to wait for grass to grow). and it supports a legion of other industries: the chemical and biotech industries, the food industry, the oil industry, pharma, agribusiness. If we keep in mind that hunter-gathers didn't become agriculturists out of choice, but because they depleted the animals they were hunting, it makes me worry what will happen to us when we deplete our soil and degrade our environment so the same disastrous extent. the food price riots in 2007/8 give us a glance at how depressing such a world would be.but this book isn't just depressing, it's enlightening and inspiring. it shows us that there ARE alternatives to the status quo: eat local, subscribe to a farm you know, and as he says in ""In defense of food"", then simply ""eat food, not too much, mostly plants"". I find Michael Pollan a remarkable writer, very humble and articulate. I can't recommend this book too highly."
145,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,5,"We are a notably unhealthy people obsessed by the idea of eating healthily (p. 3).Michael Pollan's Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals is a critique of industrial farms: they raise animals shoulder to shoulder standing in their own manure, feeding them foods that they are not designed for and which make them ill, and then use chemicals to compensate for these sins. Who knew that we are corn-eaters – not directly, like Mexicans, but through our cattle and chickens, and in processed foods.“When you look at the isotope ratios,.. we North Americans look like corn chips with legs.” Compared to us, Mexicans today consume a far more varied carbon diet: the animals they eat still eat grass (until recently, Mexicans regarded feeding corn to livestock as a sacrilege); much of their protein comes from legumes; and they still sweeten their beverages with cane sugar."" (p. 23)Pollan looks at industrial and pastoral farms, briefly flirts with being a vegetarian, then becomes a hunter/gatherer. He doesn't ""look"" the way I would, but goes out in the field, visiting and working farms, learning to hunt (and kill), and to gather wild mushrooms. Each major step on his journey is punctuated with a meal.Our typical, industrial farm, Pollan argues, is not healthy for us (making us obese), not healthy for the animals (making them ill), and not healthy for the soil and environment (using vast amounts of oil to raise food in a monoculture). He may something good about this kind of farming, but I've forgotten it. This farming is good for conglomerates – making them rich – but not farmers or consumers.His week on Joel Salatin's pastoral farm is fascinating – even for me, a vegetarian of more than 40 years. Salatin is a libertarian, deeply suspicious of government and governmental intervention. However, hw is a scientist's kind of farmer. He recognizes that everything is connected, so considers how to balance the activity and placement of cattle, chickens, pigs, and trees, each entering an environmental niche at a time that makes sense for the animals and farm, keeping all healthy while being largely chemical-free. As Salatin argues:""Society is not bearing the cost of water pollution, of antibiotic resistance, of food-borne illnesses, of crop subsidies, of subsidized oil and water—of all the hidden costs to the environment and the taxpayer that make cheap food seem cheap. No thinking person will tell you they don’t care about all that. I tell them the choice is simple: You can buy honestly priced food or you can buy irresponsibly priced food.” (p. 243)Finally, Omnivore's Dilemma is an ode to mindful, grounded eating, praising the food from Salatin's farm, but also that hunted and gathered in Sonoma and the Bay Area of California. He drools not just as be eats, but as he prepares to do so (although some of what he must do brings him close to losing his lunch), For Pollan, a meal that is eaten in full consciousness of what it took to make it is worth preparing every now and again, if only as a way to remind us of the true costs of the things we take for granted (pp. 409-410). He ends up in favor of locally-grown and harvested foods, foods with few chemicals, foods where we own the costs of eating.Pollan convinces me – not to eat cow, as some parts of Omnivore's Dilemma would be well-served with Sinclair Lewis's The Jungle. He does convince me to invest in local farms. I had been considering dropping my CSA membership in favor of the farmer's market, but decided against this so I support local farmers (mine is a cooperative of 12 Amish farms and includes a handwritten letter by one farmer each week). We have been decreasing our consumption of processed foods, but Omnivore's Dilemma will likely speed up this process. And, I will hesitate – I can't promise more – the next time I am looking at vegetables from half-way around the world.As Claude Lévi-Strauss argued, food must be “not only good to eat, but also good to think” (quoted on p. 289). Pollan's food-writing is thoughtful, and I enjoyed Omnivore's Dilemma as much for the writing as the content. And, he is dryly humorous.Pollan clears Lévi-Strauss's bar."
146,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/394959-susan,2,"While I read this book, I couldn't help but think about the muckrakers of the early 20th century. This book is pretty much nothing like The Jungle, starting with the fact that it is nonfiction, but its goal isn't that far away. It's telling a story about a part of our food industry that we don't normally think to ask about and painting a picture that should make us angry enough to do something about it.And don't get me wrong, Pollan rakes a lot of really good muck. Mostly it's his interpretation of his muck that doesn't work for me.I think the really important information comes in the first half of the book. Pollan gives us a crash course in agriculture subsidies. He compares our currently corn-focused subsidy structure to historic subsidies that were geared toward a broader spectrum of food. Then he goes into detail about what it means to live in a food chain that is designed to produce the most corn at the cheapest price. The answer? Corn is essentially in every processed food we eat. Meanwhile, corn farmers can barely keep their farms afloat because the price has been pushed down so far that they can barely produce enough product to cover their mortgages, and they dump so much fertilizer onto their fields to raise production that it ends up leeching into the water supply all the way to the ocean.Pollan then takes the corn story to the cattle industry and gives us a pretty ugly picture of what it means to raise corn-fed cattle. We thought that corn-fed cattle were a good thing, right? It's advertised on the stickers on our steaks. Except that cow biology rejects corn. The resulting situation not only makes the lives of the cows highly questionable at best, but it presents some very real health concerns for we the consumers.Buying organic fixes the problem, right? Wrong. Large-scale organic produce and livestock may not be what you think they are. Think your chickens are free-range? That just means they need to have access to the outdoors, which they are trained never to use. Corporate organic livestock is raised in environments little better than its non-organic counterpart, and they're probably fed corn too.OTOH, Pollock's story actually made me more positive about organic produce. One thing that organic regulations do accomplish is requiring a use of fertilizer that is not nearly so destructive to the environment.All of this stuff is good stuff to know. In fact, I'd like to look for some other sources of this information so I deepen my knowledge and cross-check Pollan. The place where he loses me is in his interpretation.This book got a lot of people justifiably riled up about the quality of their food and the state of their food production. And where does Pollan direct them? To back yard gardens and small family farming operations. In large part from this book, the bourgeois Localvore movement sprang up. So if you have enough money to pay twice the price for your food or the free time to produce it yourself, then you can have the satisfaction of opting out of the flawed food chain while leaving it essentially unimproved. A whole new luxury food industry has grown up to provide local food to the Localvores. Meanwhile, the corn subsidies and all their consequences continue unabated.The problem as I see it is that Pollan wraps up aesthetics with his practicality. Aesthetically, he is drawn to family farms where there are a lot more workers per square acre, a larger variety of produce and livestock are produced, and resources are used in a way he perceives as more efficient. The problem is that these qualities might make him feel good, but they don't actually address most of the problems he brought up in his muckraking. One of the sections that got my goat most was a several-page indictment of Value Added. You see, when companies make breakfast cereal, they take corn, puff it up, color it, put sugar on it, and (gasp) sell it for more than the price of the corn! The horrors of those corporate money grubbers!Look. Value Added is a core economic concept. I don't suppose Pollan expected people to pay the same amount for his book as the cost of the wood pulp used to make the paper. I suppose he wanted to be paid more for writing it than the cost of the computer he composed it on. And what's his solution to paying for overpriced processed corn? To pay more for food that comes from the right farm. So which Value Added is legitimate and which one isn't? It seems to me that food production needs four core traits. It needs to be: - Responsible: Producing it doesn't destroy the land, the water supply, or the consumers. - Plentiful: There's enough produced to feed everyone. - Reliable: Every weather fluctuation doesn't put us in danger of a shortage or a famine. - Cheap: Affordable to as many people as possible who need to eat.Pollan really only addresses the first of these four issues, and that in an incomplete manner. His solutions pretty much stomp on Plentiful and Cheap. Back yard gardens and family farms are not going to be able to produce enough food to feed a majority of Americans, no matter what they are willing to pay. It's really too bad that we couldn't have directed a lot more of this food production anger toward agricultural subsidy reform instead."
147,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/165589-gwen,3,"The first section of the book, in which Pollan follows the path of corn through the industrial food chain and discusses the effects of corn on our diets, supermarkets, and the environment, is fascinating. Despite being trained in the sociology of agriculture and specifically in the analysis of commodity chains, I learned a lot and found few details to quibble with (the main exception being his tendency to anthropomorphize corn, discussing it as though it intentionally chose to evolve in certain ways). If I were teaching a class on food, I would totally assign that section of the book.The second section of the book is also good, though not as great as the first. Probably this is because I already knew that ""organic"" and ""sustainable"" are not the same and that Horizon-brand organic dairy products come from huge dairies that, from the point of view of the cow, the quality of the milk, and the environment, are little better than regular non-organic ones.But the final section is really annoying me. Most of the things that are irritating me are much more clearly discussed at http://www.powells.com/review/2007_08..., but there were a few other things as well. Pollan keeps talking about how only omnivores have any trouble deciding what to eat, using koalas and cows as examples of animals that, being specialists, don't need to worry about whether something is an acceptable food source or not. Anyone who raises cows will tell you he's highly underestimating cows' experimentation with non-grass foods. They eat weeds and poisonous plants; they get nails and wire and bones stuck in their throats. It's a pain in the ass to have to try to remove a deer vertebra some cow has managed to lodge in her throat. I suppose this seems like a minor detail, except his entire argument is that humans (and other omnivores) are unique in facing problems deciding what is and isn't safe to eat.Connected to that is Pollan's reference to ""human nature"" from time to time, something that drives me nuts when my students do it and is even more exasperating from someone who at least ostensibly has the intellectual capacity and training to not fall back on such a simplistic explanation (that is, ""humans do it, therefore it's human nature""). He seems to buy in to the popular conception that there's a ""human nature"" that we've just smeared a little civilization and culture on top of (think of frosting on a cake).I don't think I can finish the book--I'm increasingly irritated by his tone and the problems with his argument. It's too bad, because the book really did start off well."
148,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20495277-anny,4,"Truly an eye-opener! I absolutely loved the first part of the book about the industrial agriculture. I would've never thought that our humble 'corn' is actually the tyrant of mono-culture farming. Farmers went broke, took a huge debt, taking side jobs driving trailers and depended on their wife salary for the sake of planting corn. Animals (cow, pig, chicken) got ousted from the farm and pasture and cramped into CAFO a.k.a. concentration camp for animals, where they live their short miserable life. First, they were fed food (corn or dubious meat-by-product or whatever cheapest feed available) that is making them sick and making us who eat them sick (mad cows anyone?). Second, they were cramped as much as physically possible, resulting in stressed, depressed, and psychotic animals (often resorting to self-mutilation or cannibalism). Third, they were doused with much antibiotics and medications (because their living conditions made them sick) and hormones and whatnot (to fatten them as much as possible) with who knows what side-effects that might cause for us (antibiotic-resistant bacteria for example).Taking the stand against industrial agriculture were small farms, like Polyface farm owned by Joel Salatin. If CAFO were hell for animals, then Polyface farm must be its heaven. There were so many good things about this farm, suffice to say, if I could buy from there (or any other place that practice sustainable agriculture), I would certainly do so. The last part of the book about hunting and gathering was the part that I liked the least. Too many pages rambling on and on about the ethics of killing animals. It's a weak finish, but the first two parts of the book was definitely worth reading!"
149,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/327527-missy-jean,5,"I can say without hesitation that this is a life-changing book. It's elegantly written and unflinching. Pollan is honest about his own cognitive dissonance about being an omnivore, which means he never sounds self-righteous (an impressive feat for the genre). And I love the widespread anthropomorphism of the book, the mysticism that Pollan is willing to embrace as he cites scientific sources.That said... Halfway through the book I was so depressed that I went home and ate graham crackers dipped in a can of chocolate frosting. All I could think was, so there's no choice! I am going to eat chemicals and toxins and animal byproducts unwittingly every day of my life, and they are going to kill me in the end! By the end of the book, though, I felt like I had a real sense of small measures that I can take to eat in a healthier and more environmentally responsible way. So I went to the farmstand and bought a big old pile of locally-grown buttercup squash, peaches, chard and zucchini. Better than synthetic frosting, right?I think there are a lot of different conclusions that people can draw from this book, and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who wants to be more mindful about what they eat. For me, it validated my penchant for vegetarianism (and my habitual eschewing of McDonalds), but you might get something slightly different from it. (Pollan is not a vegetarian.) Honestly, I don't think I'll ever look at my plate in quite the same way again, and I feel grateful for that."
150,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82365956-veronica,4,"""Yet there are other images of animals on other kinds of farms that contradict the nightmare ones. I'm thinking of the hens I saw at Polyface Farm, fanning out over the cow pasture on a June morning, pecking at the cowpats and the grass...or the image of pig happiness I witnessed in that cattle barn in March, watching the hogs, all upturned pink hams and corkscrew tails, nosing their way through that deep cake of compost in search of alcoholic morsels of corn. It is true that farms like this are but a speck on the monolith of modern animal agriculture, yet their very existence, and the possibility that implies, throws the whole argument for animal rights into a different light."" Pollan knows that the so-called happiness at Polyface Farm could never be scaled to a magnitude sufficient to feed the many required. ""To many animal people even Polyface Farm is a 'death camp'—a way station for doomed creatures awaiting their date with the executioner. But to look at the lives of these animals is to see this holocaust analogy for the sentimental conceit it really is. In the same way we can probably recognize animal suffering when we see it, animal happiness is unmistakable, too, and during my week on the farm I saw it in abundance.""I will permit the possibility of brief animal happiness on a small farm right before the slaughter. Still, the inconvenient reality is that human agriculture contravenes the natural order of predation because we are the only creatures that bring animals into existence in order to slaughter them. The lion does not raise and propagate zebras in a nested enclosure indefinitely and delight in creating more and more efficient ways of slaughtering their offspring. This apparently small detail is conveniently left out in arguments from nature, as I will call them. ""To think of domestication as a form of slavery or even exploitation is to misconstrue that whole relationship—to project a human idea of power onto what is in fact an example of mutualism or symbiosis, rather than a political, development. The animals grew tame and lost their ability to fend for themselves in the wild and the humans traded hunter-gatherer ways for the settled lives of agriculturists. Humans changed biologically, too.""Don't equate the domestication of wolves to the slaughter of chicks. Red herring fallacy. ""[This] is where the animal rightists betray a deep ignorance about the workings of nature."" Again, there is nothing natural about industrial agriculture. ""The very existence of predation in nature, of animals eating animals, is the cause of much anguished hand-wringing in the animal rights literature. 'It must be admitted,' Peter Singer writes, 'that the existence of carnivorous animals does pose one problems for the ethics of Animal Liberation, and that is whether we should do anything about it.' (Talk about the need for peacekeeping forces!)""On the one hand, this made me laugh a bit because I've always been disturbed by the existence of predation in the wild. That many creatures rely on the pain and suffering of other animals in order to live is but a testament to the fallen state of the world, which is also why Jupiter is a purer and superior planet to Earth. But I digress. (My sister has christened this Jupiter propaganda🪐, which I readily admit.)In any event, I've already unravelled this false equivalency between natural predation and the very systematic multiplication of animals bred for the slaughter, season after season. From doom to dust.""Today, the organic food industry finds itself in a most unexpected, uncomfortable, and yes, unsustainable position: floating on a sinking sea of petroleum.""""U.S. agricultural policy, like the Declaration of Independence, is founded on the principle that all carrots are created equal, even though there's good reason to believe this isn't really true.""Birds can't get access to the outdoors until at least 5 weeks old and are slaughtered at 7, so ""free range turns out to be not so much a lifestyle for these chickens as a two-week vacation option.""""From the moment an organic lettuce plant is ready for harvest, the rest of its journey from field to produce aisle follows a swift and often ingenious industrial logic that is only nominally organic.""The fact that steer are given numbers as names makes Holocaust comparisons all too facile...""The farmers desperate to boost yield end up degrading their land, plowing and planting marginal land, applying more nitrogen—anything to squeeze a few more bushels from the soil.""""Nor would such a culture be shocked to discover that there are other countries, such as Italy and France, that decide their dinner questions on the basis of such quaint and unscientific criteria as pleasure and tradition, eat all manner of 'unhealthy' foods, and, lo and behold, wind up actually healthier and happier in their eating than we are. We show our surprise at this by speaking of something called the 'French paradox,' for how could a people who eat such demonstrably toxic substance as foie gras and triple crème cheese actually be slimmer and healthier than we are? Yet I wonder if it doesn't make more sense to speak in terms of an American paradox—that is, a notably unhealthy people obsessed by the idea of eating heathily."""
151,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73483095-cynnamon,0,"I bought this book, because I had thouroughly enjoyed Michael Pollans ""Cooking"".But here I give up.I have read around 100 pages about corn. I learned a lot I didn't know before, but unfortunately I didn't care about my newly acquired knowledge.Also the book is completely US-centric, which makes it for me as an European not quite so interesting.This book is outside of my scope of interest, therefore I refrain from assigning a rating."
152,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,5,"I really like Pollan’s writing style, he brings points home with simplicity, and he is able to cover a lot of ground without the writing feelings unnecessarily circuitous or blustery. More than that though, I like that he is willing to experience. I mean, that’s the very core of responsible journalism, Pollan goes and works on the farms, he helps slaughter chickens, he sits in tractors, he goes hunting and foraging, he throws himself bodily and emotionally into these experiences, and at each point I felt that he was incredibly honest with both himself and the reader about the impacts of his actions and his emotional state.All in all I thought it was refreshingly non-biased, fair appraising look at industrial agriculture/ranching, industrial/artisanal organic agriculture/ranching, and hunting/foraging. I say that as a person literally smack dab in the middle of row-crop country (my husband and his family farms), as a gardener, and as a hunter. I’ve long had a problem with the way we raise meat in this country, and the lack of connection between people and their food. Its one of the reasons that I do hunt and garden, and its also one of the reasons that I’ve mostly switched to plant proteins for all meals except supper. I am continuing to try and evolve how I eat, and it’s a learning experience and I don’t always get it right (I ate spaghettio’s twice in three days last week, no one’s perfect). But its hard to read this book without examining the role that we eaters have in the natural world. I am going to make a concerted effort to eat in-season vegetables except for those that I froze from my garden in the summer, and I’m going to try and rely on our game meats more. Despite reading much about early life on the prairie, somehow I had never considered that even meat was seasonal, or that foods grown out of season lack the nutrition that we think we are getting. They’re both very “duh” concepts, but its not something that I had really appreciated. Nor had I valued the waste of petroleum in shipping year round under-nourished produce from Argentina to the US just so that we could eat whatever fruit or veggie that we want, despite its lack of flavor.Perhaps the greatest thing that came from this was the conversations with my husband. He listened to the audiobook while in the tractor, and it was great to talk to him when he came home at night about the ways agriculture has changed since Pollan wrote (advances in technology have changed the level of precision for farmers, becoming more environmentally friendly for those that upgrade), but also the ways that it could continue to change. What could we do as eaters, hunters, buyers, and producers in our local community? Books that foster conversation and change always get a 5 out of 5.Absolutely recommend to everyone. Read those food labels. Speak out. We deserve, as buyers, connectivity and information about our food, and animals especially deserve better than what we manage for our convenience."
153,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/307041-ginny-messina,3,"A truly important book by gifted writer and journalist Michael Pollan. It's not without its flaws, however, and for all the promise of the first two-thirds of the book, it kind of leaves the reader hanging at the end. In the first part, Pollan exposes the damaging effects of industrial agriculture, and—-importantly—-this includes large-scale organic production which is not nearly as benign as most people would like to believe. Later in the book he addresses the inhumane aspect of industrial agriculture as well—-organic production included. He puts it succinctly: you look away, or you stop eating meat. In the second part of the book, we see farming as it should be, on Polyface Farm in the Shenandoah Valley. Here, farming practices are closely tied to nature including the natural behavior of farm animals. While the system doesn't adhere completely to organic regulations, it is far more sustainable and humane than industrial organic agriculture and certainly more so than conventional agriculture. Polyface Farm is not able to separate itself from industrial agriculture completely (by law, the steer are killed in conventional slaughterhouses) but it still seems like a very nice place. Unfortunately, the scale on which it operates means that this type of sustainable farming can never produce enough food for the U.S. population. Food from farms like Polyface is likely to be available to only a privileged few. The last part of the book struck me as downright nonsensical. Pollan explores the possibility of putting together the ultimate local meal—-one composed of food that he himself has hunted, gathered and grown. But don't try this at home, he says. It is not at all a realistic way to eat. Well—-no—-not if you do it by gathering chanterelle mushrooms with a bunch of chefs from Chez Panisse, hunting wild boar in the California woods, and diving for abalone along a rocky coast. Granted, most Americans would be hard-pressed to produce their own food, but Pollan doesn't even explore the option in any kind of realistic or meaningful fashion. In the end, it appears that the problems associated with food production are insurmountable. Industrial agriculture provides most of the food in this country and is a wasteful and unsustainable system. But more sustainable systems are not realistic for feeding the population. Pollan does not offer any clear cut answers, much to my surprise. (I didn't expect him to solve the problem; I did expect a little guidance!) But the thoughtful reader can still pull together a plan of action to minimize the environmental and ethical cost of a meal. Reduce intake of animal foods. Buy locally-produced food. Grow or produce as much as is realistic for you. Pollan makes his readers think about where their meals come from and how to measure the true cost of our ""inexpensive"" food. This is a must-read for anyone who expresses a desire to live and eat responsibly. "

"
157,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147289-jason-pettus,5,"Journalist Michael Pollan has a reputation for writing books that people don't just like, but whose very lives get permanently changed because of reading them; and I can attest that this exact thing has happened to me after reading my first book of his, the extraordinary 2006 guide to modern food practices known as The Omnivore's Dilemma. In it, Pollan imagines three typical meals a contemporary American might eat -- one of fast food, one of Whole Foods-type groceries, and one literally put together through foraging and hunting -- then over the course of 60,000 words shows us exactly, step by minute step, how the ingredients in each meal can be traced back and back until finally reaching a point of a living plant being grown in the ground somewhere, then building us back forward again by showing exactly what happens to that plant step by step as it makes its way from the farm to eventually our mouths.Along the way, then, Pollan gives us an astute history of the post-war industrial agricultural industry; explains why exactly corn is the overwhelming number-one crop now grown in America; gives us the horrifying reasons that most cattle and chicken have to be fed so many antibiotics in order to merely survive under such harsh industrial conditions; demonstrates why in a middle-class consumerist society these conditions have to happen in the first place (that is, because if cows were still grown in the humane way they were in an agricultural society, a McDonald's hamburger would cost $30, and the American people would riot); shows through personal field trips what exactly the difference is between ""cage-free,"" ""free range"" and ""pastured"" eggs, and why one of these options is infinitely better than the others; details why the term ""organic"" on a food label can mean vastly different things depending on the company and circumstances; and shows through illuminating first-hand experience why we are no longer a hunter-gatherer society (namely, because it's exhausting, inefficient, and makes people run the risk of sometimes going entire weeks at a time without finding anything edible to eat).Easily the most interesting book I've read in a decade, The Omnivore's Dilemma has permanently changed the way I now shop for groceries, knowing as I now do so many more details about what each label on a package means, and how different growing circumstances can often literally mean a difference in the resulting food's nutrition (just for one example, how Pollan scientifically proves here that eggs from chickens that are allowed to roam freely on farmland are literally better for you than eggs grown from chickens kept in cages); and although I haven't completely given up fast food, certainly every hamburger I now buy makes me ponder the indescribably monstrous and cruel circumstances by which that cow lived its life, which has already influenced just how many hamburgers I buy in general. (It also makes me understand a lot better why there will always be people around in any society who are more than happy to perform that society's most inhumane tasks, such as rounding up undocumented immigrants, ripping their children away from them, and throwing them into concentration camps while openly laughing in their faces...but that's neither here nor there, I suppose.) To tell the truth, the only reason I read this in the first place was because I was waiting for the day in early June that Pollan's newest book came out, a 600-page whopper called How to Change Your Mind that looks in exhaustive detail at all the latest 21st-century research into the connections between psychedelic drugs, mindfulness, meditation, mental health, what MRIs can teach us about what we've traditionally called the ""soul,"" and a lot more. That book is now finished too, and was just as fascinating as The Omnivore's Dilemma, so keep an eye out for my write-up of that in another couple of weeks.UPDATE 1: I find it utterly fascinating that the only negative reviews here of this book are from vegetarians, who are so upset at Pollan's conclusion that humans as omnivores are perfectly capable of eating meat, they're willing to dismiss every single other vegetarian-friendly thing he has to say. (Ultimately Pollan is pro-vegetable in this book, despite concluding that meat is indeed an edible substance that humans find edible.) A huge part of this book is all about how the politics of any given age has a huge influence over our opinions on the supposedly ""scientifically objective"" subjects of diet and nutrition, and the vitriolic negative reviews of the book by militant vegetarians here simply proves his point all over again.UPDATE 2: After reading other people's reviews, I agree with something I saw a lot of people mention; that a clear sign of how much I loved this book is that people at Twitter eventually got sick of me constantly tweeting about it while I was reading it. Be prepared to drive your friends and spouse crazy!"

Well, Actually, Eat Sh*t and Flourish. Each of these would have been a more classy title for the book ""Omnivore's Dilemma"". To paraphrase another reviewer 'The dude structures this book by following the path of four finished meals from origin to plate - one McDonald's meal, one comprised of supermarket organic products, one from a ""beyond-organic"" self-sustaining farm in Virginia, and one he forages almost entirely on his own. This book tries to provokes a lot of thought about the origins of our food and the biological, political, social and economic implications of those origins, and for the most part, it is successful.' So after reading this book I realize that maybe, just maybe, I don’t argue with people about food enough. Ever since I read  Fast Food Nation  and watched  Supersize Me  I have been pretty good about avoiding eating at Mc-stablishments and drinking soda. Knowing these efforts aren’t enough, but not having had the ...chutzpah ... to make the leap to full fledged, ""morally superior"" vegetarianism. I am way to lazy to manage an urban garden, -- preferring rather to watch one made on TV OD presents, as a moral alternative to growing, actually hunting and eating wild game. The parts of the book that describe this stuff, although not seemingly not feasible, reinforced these previously formed notions about foraging. Still, it is pretty interesting to see the details fleshed out.One thing discussed in the book that i hadn't internalized, and that makes sense when I think about it, is that going to whole foods and buying an organic Chilean artichoke in the winter can be a lot worse ethically than eating a fat juicy steak from a locally raised mature grass fed cow. I guess that the ethical answer culled from the book on how to shop food in the city is to buy at farmers markets or join one of these CSA’s. Take the extra step and get to know your farmer, know how they grow, know how they feed and treat the animals is the right thing to do. This seems like undue effort and cost but the ethical equivalent seems to be to hunt and dress bloody dead animals or forage for mushrooms in central park. In that perspective, the first options seems like less effort ."

Michael Pollan takes a look at four ways to have a meal - one industrial meal at McDonald's, one organic meal from Whole Foods, one local meal from a farmer's field, and one completely ""homemade"" meal made from hunting and foraging.I must say, the first 300 pages are riveting, absolutely enthralling! I kept putting aside fiction to read this book, it was so good! However, when I hit the chapters on hunting and foraging, I found my interest severely waning. I really don't care at all about hunting animals and foraging for mushrooms, so keeping my attention was nearly impossible (this is why I took off a star). But the end picks up as Pollan returns to the final ""perfect"" meal.This book had so much really good information - information that once again cements my desire never to eat food at a fast food restaurant ever again.

I wonder if the organic products sold in Indonesia as are bad as the greenwashed examples in this book, which are all about the US market.

162,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/375767-joanna,4,"April 2012 update to add- I no longer pay big bucks for a dozen eggs, because I haven't bought an egg in more than 2 years! I support a small flock of happy chickens instead.Lengthy review to come. In the meantime, let me just say---I learned a lot from this book. I also enjoyed some segments very much. I would have done some extensive editing.The final chapter is sublime. OK, my real review:I am a convenience eater. Michael Pollan's work is transforming me into a conscious eater. Two concrete changes in my behavior: I will now pay the price of a fancy mocha coffee beverage for a dozen eggs gathered from happy chickens. I will also see commercially available breaded chicken with a side of corn as corn dressed with corn and a side of corn. I still may eat it, but at least I know what I'm getting!It is my hope that these wonderful books I have been reading indicate an American paradigm shift, and that the marketplace will allow people like me (who don't want to spend the time and effort tracking down purveyers of all sorts of specialty foods) more chances to make conscious choices in a convenient way. I will do my best to make choices that are more healthful for me and our planet regardless.This book was successful in changing my behavior. In large part, it was successful because I was already ripe for changing. Everything from Kingsolver's Animal Vegetable Miracle to Buford's Heat to Van Draanen's sweet young adult novel Flipped has been telling me to embrace these changes. This work built upon that foundation and presented a lot more detailed information supporting the choices that we should all be making. It was well structured, and it needed to be. So much information was packed into each section, it was necessary for me to take breaks. Some peeves---Too many declarative sentences. All declarative sentences put me on guard. (See what I did there?) I read something that says or implies ""all"" and I immediately start casting about defensively for the exceptions. I blame SAT prep. I was also put off by the way in which those declarations seemed designed to make me so defensive, mostly when he seemed dismissive of the travails of gardening, or scornful of the kind of hunter who does not agonize over the creatures' deaths. Second person. I hate second person. Here's a sentence that combined 2 peeves: ""You can forage in the garden, in the way Adam and Eve presumably did, but there isn't much to it: no dilemmas, no hunting stories."" And it's kind of a run on sentence too, now that I look at it, although that (obviously, having read any of my reviews!) isn't such a major irritation for me. (See what I did there?)Rampant anthropomorphism. Corn does not feel happy about taking over the world! Corn does not feel happy! Corn does not feel! This is a Truth. I believe that much of the anthropomorphism here was used as a bit of shorthand, implying all the Darwinian blah blah blah rather than spelling it out, and also trying to fix an image in the mind of the reader, but it is NOT TRUE. It bothers me. (Althoug I do like the image of an army of cornstalks marchng across the landscape, and it truly did stick with me.)LOVED---All descriptions of all meals.All the time spent at the idealized farm. (I forget what it's called and can't be bothered to look it up.)Everything to do with the mushrooms. (I think I'm due to read a book about mushrooms next.)The desription of the first hunt----soooooo true to my one hunting experience, in which I spent every fiber of my being on NOT MAKING ANY NOISE. It was such an intense time, and he captured that beautiully.I feel like there's so much more to say. Suiffice---I enjoyed most of this book. I learned. A lot. "
163,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1242165-schmacko,4,"So much has been written about this book, and so much will be defined by how you feel comfortable when discussing your eating habits. Here are, in short forms, my 10 observations:1)	If you’ve ever wondered how much the American government is responsible for your eating by subsidizing corporations who grow corn and make high fructose corn syrup, this is a book for you! SHORT VERSION: Corn is in EVERYTHING! We committed to growing corn when we could possibly switch to many varied crops. Corn is uniform, so it’s very corporate. If you hate political reading, if you don’t want to know this stuff, or you don’t frankly care, skip Pollan’s book. (Hope you enjoy your diabetes.)2)	Yes, we know organic food is better for us. But Pollan does a great job telling us that the US family’s annual food budget has actually dropped over the last 60 years, so Americans could conceivably spend more on food (and probably less on entertainment) and help out their diets.3)	I thought his section on Whole Foods founder John Mackey was interesting. Mackey completely concedes that he isn’t as radical as he started, that he has basically bought into the American corporate structure in order to take baby steps in supporting a business and helping people eat more healthfully.4)	At times, Pollan sounds a little Communist. At least, anti-Capitalist. I’m ok with that – to each his own – and I believe that American politics is all about constant discourse and adjustment.5)	Knowing the details of a slaughterhouse was a little much for me, but then again, I have no problem killing what I eat. Which makes me unlike 97% of Americans, who like to think their meat comes fully formed in plastic packages.6)	I love how Pollan describes the grey color of a McDonald’s burger. Funny! (I still crave Wendy’s once or twice a month.)7)	Mushroom foraging always sounded like something I wanted to do. Until I read his accounts. Mushroom foragers are crazy, obsessed people!8)	He’s lucky he had help at parts, or Pollan would’ve starved.9)	I like how he concedes that there is a better way to eat meat – that you don’t have to become a militant vegan.10)	I still wish we humans would accept that we are PART of the food chain!!! GRRR! We have canines; we have eaten meat for centuries. Our whole digestive system is built for meat! Lots of animals eat meat. We are not better than other animals that kill; the only thing that could possibly make us better is if we kill as quickly and painlessly as possible. We are the predators, and we should act as such – but with judiciousness and care. When we try to be ABOVE IT ALL – when we manipulate the environment – as Pollan excellently points out – we ruin it. “Dominion” humans create corporate slaughterhouses and run animals to extinction. Vegans treat animals as individuals to be coddled and encouraged to overproduce; soon, we’ll be overrun with deer and pumas and wild boar while we huddle eating berries from the sides of our abandoned roads (vehicles lead to road kill!) We need to accept that humans – like our predator cousins - do kill to survive, that we can be better at it, and that we are not ABOVE the food chain – as meat eaters or vegans – we are part of the system and should act accordingly. (Pollan mentions this, but doesn’t bring it home.)"
164,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260196-peter,5,"I started into this worried it was going to force me into vegetarianism, that I was going to read some passage about calves born into rancid waste, and a blue light somewhere in my brain would turn green and a gag reflex would accompany the thought of meat moving forward....Which speaks either to my penchant for pessimism, or the ominous relationship we have to our food chain, where we _don't_ really want to know how food got there, we just want to eat it.But read the book I did, fearful to encounter that meat-snatching passage within the book. Thankfully, Pollan is not an alarmist, but rather a quite methodical inquisitor about the roots of our food. It sounds kind of..esoteric, but he makes it fascinating, like a great humanities teacher he tells the larger story of food: of why we grow so much fricking corn in America, and how it's bad for almost everyone involved: ourselves, our diet, farmers in other countries.The good thing is that the book never descends into a polemic, unlike Michael Moore's work, Pollan's evenhandedness keeps the reader open to what he is saying. Nothing is extreme or revolutionary or incendiary.I feel like this book will, in the long term, shape the way I think about food by giving me a vocabulary for considering my personal and our cultural relationship to food. He discusses how America as a nation of immigrants never developed a stable national cuisine (unlike France or Italy), and the absence of that makes us vulnerable to an endless array of fad diets (coughAdkinscough) and an overall menu that is out of balance.There is a fascinating chapter on mushrooms and fungi, which details how they are utterly different from plants, and grow from this crazy underground symbiosis with decomposing nutrients and tree roots, taking a single drop of sugar from the tree root in exchange for processed minerals from the soil.There is an extended look at a farm outside Charlottesville--Polyface Farm--which models itself after natural ecosystems and creates this method of rotating cattle and chickens with grass growth cycles to create this wonderful whirlwind of spreadsheets, efficiency, and microdata on growth patterns of grass.To wit: it's better to have grass pasture surrounded by trees, because a blade of grass will burn X calories turning the face of it's blade toward the sun to receive solar energy. Planting forests around removes wind, allowing the grass to grow higher. Brilliant.In the end, it's about food, but it's also about systems in general. It begins to feel like a universal look at the interrelationship of history and commerce, and how everything is this big interconnected fabric, but that you can begin to see some of those connections, and kind of surf those links to great personal and collective gain.12/2007"

I use the word “threaten” very deliberately, because they are changes that I know I'm going to find challenging.Michael Pollan challenges his readers to examine their food a little closer, to consider where it comes from. And it's a logical request I think. We can spend days searching for the perfect doctor or mechanic, but how much time do we take to really think about our food? Do you know where your steak came from? Is your asparagus from a nearby farm, or far-flung Argentina? Are your peaches organic, and if so, what does that really mean? Most of us have no idea how to answer these questions.In most cases, the answers are simple. Most of our food likely comes from a massive industrial farm or feed-lot hundreds of miles away, fed by incredible amounts of fossil fuels -- the fertilizer, the machines used for harvesting, the trucks it took to transport the food to your local mega-mart, to name just a few uses of fossil fuel. Pollan's descriptions of these farms (and in particular, the feed lots) can be quite disturbing. However, Pollan does not outright condemn this ""industrial food chain."" He concedes that it would be difficult to feed billions of people inexpensively without it. Instead, he advocates having several different avenues for delivering food to our tables, and he describes several alternatives. It is up to the reader to determine how they want to eat. As for me, my eyes have been opened to the appeal of ""eating locally,"" where possible. (Emphasis on ""where possible."" There aren't too many oranges grown in Idaho.) By eating foods produced as close to my home as possible, I support the local economy, less fossil fuels are used, and the food should have fewer preservatives, hormones, and other chemical ingredients. Best of all, the food should be fresher and more flavorful. Yes, it will cost more, but I think it will be worth it. At least I'm willing to try it. Consider it an experiement. I've already found local sources of milk, eggs and meat that I'm going to try. I found Pollan's writing engaging and easy to read. (Disclaimer: I am a huge nerd, and the topic really spoke to me. If you don't like science, you may not find this book as fascinating.) A few words of warning: if evolution makes you uncomfortable, you may not like this book, as it often talks about the evolution of plants, animals and humans. Also, there were two or three instances where objectionable language was used. "
166,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4161947-m-l-rudolph,5,"2006. NY Times Book Review One of the 10 Best Books of the Year. We eat every day of our lives but we don't often give much thought to what we put in our bodies. If we are what we eat, then when it comes to meat, we are what the animal eats; and when it comes to produce, we are what the plant's grown in. There's a food chain that extends around the world and throughout evolutionary history from the beginning of man. Michael Pollan takes us on a tour of that chain and in the process gives any thinking, eating, person a new, often disturbing, view of what he/she consumes.Organized in three sections to illuminate industrial food (corn), pastoral food (grass), and personal food (the forest), Pollan's narrative builds toward meals made as nearly as possible with ingredients and methods from each of these categories.I double-dog-dare anyone to read this book and walk through a modern supermarket without viewing each item of food differently. And if you're like me, take your glasses, because the real information about what we buy and eat is in the small print, written in code, to disguise as much as possible what we truly consume. The central area of the supermarket is processed food. Good luck figuring that out. (When you can't determine the identity of fifteen out of eighteen ingredients on that package of processed whatever - chances are high what you're reading - and eating - are corn derivatives.) Around the walls, where we find the produce, meat, and fish, it would seem that the information describing the food would be more straight-forward. Good luck figuring that out, too. (Chances are every formerly living item was nourished or fertilized with corn or corn derivatives.)Unless you plan to follow a steer or a chicken through its life cycle to see how the animal lives, and dies, and becomes the food on your plate, you have to rely on someone like Pollan to take that trip for you, document his findings, and present it as he does here. I've read about food my entire life and tried to keep up on healthy eating without succumbing to fads, but I've never encountered such an intelligent, entertaining, and practical guide to the state of food in America today as The Omnivore's Dilemma. Read it and eat. "
167,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36341-c,5,"Pollan's book is not just a fascinating look at the modern state and evolution of our industrial food complex; it's not merely an anthropological investigation of the history of eating and cultural rituals; it's more than a scientific discourse of the biological nature of corn, small farm ecosystems, and fungi -- it's also, surprisingly, a page turner. When I was finished, I wanted the book to be twice as long.The book is also not (as many people seem to think) a political screed or manifesto -- Pollan isn't necessarily telling everyone to stop eating industrial food and switch to local, small farm food, as he acknowledges how impractical such a course of action actually is. Rather, he investigates our relationships with food, both personal and societal, scientific and ethical. He does find the industrial complex distasteful and disturbing and the small, sustainable farm he visits ideal but (and perhaps this is the choir appreciating the sermon) those conclusions seem inescapable.This book didn't change any of my ideas about eating, as I already try to eat locally and avoid processed food, but I learned a lot about the nature of food, from how terrifyingly omnipresent corn is to the amazingly complex ecosystem of a farm. It's one of those books that you constantly put down so you can turn to someone and say ""Oh my god, did you know that . . . """
168,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"This book has profoundly changed my view on my food, and subsequently, my world. I have read many nonfiction books, but nothing was so personal as this investigation on where our food comes from. Pollan sets put to investigate four markedly different food chains, and ends up having to revise his world view, and acquire new friends in search for a profound understanding of food, nature, and humanity.I have finished this on Feb 28, 2019. I will write a longer review when I collect my thoughts. There is plenty of food for thought (pardon the pun... did not intend it but hey, it fits.)"
169,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4123952-alasse,5,"I was so scared that this would turn out to be a foodie hipster's rant on what food should be like, instead of what it actually is. I'm relieved to admit that I was mistaken - in fact, it's one of the most thought-provoking books I've read this year. It's helped me to fully flesh out some apprehensions I had which I'd never actually put into words, such as 'Is organic really about chemical paranoia?' 'What's the environmental impact of mindlessly shipping food all over the continent?' 'How in the world does that even make sense economically?' Okay, that last one I had actually wondered about, more than once. I used to have a long commute.The Omnivore's Dilemma is also less location specific than Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal, which was a plus for me. I love reading about American lifestyles and behaviors (it's the whole deep-down-i-know-we're-next thing), but most of the industrial talk doesn't really apply to me. Pollan did a great job of giving a panoramic view of all the different approaches to eating in the first world, that's true. But mostly, it was his naturalist's view of things that made his discourse universal and relatable for me.Also, I've realized I have some very strong and mostly unfair prejudices against hunters. A book that manages to make me change my mind on a particular subject* is a book that deserves 5 stars. Shame on me.What else? Oh, apparently now I find ecology fascinating, which poses a new TBR list control challenge. F****ck.*while quoting a lot of Ortega y Gasset, I might add. Ortega FTW!! I went through an Ortega phase when I was like 17, so anyone who quotes Ortega to prove a point instantly gets bonus points with me."
170,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,3,"I grew up on a farm in Michigan where we grew corn and soybeans. The years when we rotated our crops to grow field corn, it was harvested to feed the chickens at the local egg farm. Thus I have some first hand experience with the first few chapters of the Omnivore’s Dilemma and the chapter on the farm rang especially true for me.This book is popular and enough time has passed that it probably qualifies as a classic and is certainly worth a read. It is a honest portrayal by a professor on the modern US food web highlighting many of the problems of our modern omnivore society spanning the spectrum from steroids to animal ethics. There were four chapters that I would consider as excellent: The Farm, The Feedlot, Grass and the Forager. The other twenty chapters were ok.I had no issue with the messaging of the book and wholly agree that it is important to understand where our modern food comes from. I will admit that I promptly ate organic vegetarian for my next meal after finishing the book as there are a few unpleasant facts associated with meat processing. I am sure I will become a carnivore again by tomorrow.I did have a few problems with the construction of the book however.1. At times it strayed from the science and empirical observations to become a little too professorial or perhaps too philosophical. This choice was understandable but gave me a meh kind of feeling.2. At times the book was a bit boring, although there were some intriguing chapters mixed throughout the book.3. I did not like most of the chapter titles such as Slaughter is a Glass Abattoir. Keep it simple like Cows, Corn, Chickens, Grass and the messaging of the chapter would resonate more.I rate the book at 3.5 stars."
171,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66672731-michael-jandrok,4,"I have always been interested in food culture, though I would have never considered myself to be a “foodie” in the strictest sense. That term always carried a bit of hipster baggage to my mind. I would tend to picture modern U.S. food culture as a sort of hummus-slathered menu dominated by low-fat recipes meant to reflect the popular diet trends of the day. Those attitudes began to change for me when I was diagnosed with cancer. Suddenly food became a big deal for me, first as something that I actively avoided as my appetite dwindled and my daily routine ran to getting as many calories in my body as I could, regardless of the delivery system. As someone living with colorectal cancer, food was a tough sell for me as the disease progressed. My tastes changed and most foods that I used to love became alien to me. But a funny thing happened as my treatment started to take hold and my appetite slowly began to return. I began to consciously embrace “foodie” culture with an eye towards expanding my palate and eating healthier. A big part of this ongoing effort has been educating myself on what would be the “right” things to eat given that I had a disease that directly affected my tastes and digestive functions. I didn’t want specific “diet” books, per se. What I wanted and needed was comprehensive information on what constitutes food itself, with an eye towards the science and sociology of developing better food habits and cooking techniques. Before my disease took hold, I was a 5’5”, 165 pound ball of muscle and muffin top, still trying to fit into size 34 jeans. At the peak of the cancer, when I was at my lowest point physically, I was 106 pounds and looked like a shell of my former self. After a year and a half of treatment, I am back up to 140 pounds, due in large part to eating better and making more informed choices as to the food that I put into my body. I can thank books like “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” for giving me a respectable knowledge base to make those wise culinary decisions. Author Michael Pollan has been writing about food for many years now. This book was originally published in 2006 and was one of his earlier efforts at culinary writing. The material has aged well. I do think that we have become a bit smarter as a food culture in the intervening years, but the basic information presented here is still valid and useful. I will take a moment here to caution prospective readers that Pollan’s visit to a large-scale feedlot and the rendering plant is graphic and somewhat disturbing. One can’t read these sections and not begin to question what it means to consume beef. The premise of the text is pretty simple and the nature of the ""omnivore's dilemma"" can be summed up quite nicely: as creatures that can eat virtually anything, the big question can be defined as ""what SHOULD we eat?” Pollan sets out to find the answer to this question by tracing 4 meals back to their sources. IN the course of the book he dissects a fast food meal, a store-bought organic entree, a ""beyond organic"" meal produced entirely at a polyculture farm, and a meal that he hunts and gathers (almost) entirely by himself. Along the way, he asks the reader to join him in his quest for a more thorough knowledge of the food that we eat and a better understanding of how the decisions that we make as food consumers help to shape our cultural and physical landscape.This is an intensely interesting book, and an important addition to the bookshelf for anyone interested in becoming more ""food-aware"". Pollan's journey is always engaging, sometimes spiritual (""we are what we eat…."" takes on a new dimension when one stops to look at it with this much depth), and occasionally frightening. He is always respectful of his cast of characters, and he is willing to challenge his own preconceptions and ideas as he gathers knowledge and experience. Note that there are no recipes to be found within these pages, nor any specific information on the art of cooking. This is a book that is fully invested in talking about food as a consumer product; what it is, where it comes from, and what the impacts and implications are when you decide to make a food consumption choice.Michael Pollan strikes me as a fairly engaging and nice guy. I’d like to sit down to a meal with him and talk shop. I learned a lot from this book that I can actively put into practice as I seek to modify my eating habits with an eye towards maximum health benefits. Along with that I gained some ways to make more responsible choices as a food consumer, and that’s just as important as the health angle for me. I’ll be seeking out more of Pollan’s food writing.Coda #1: After reading a number of reviews for this book, I can honestly say that this is a pretty polarizing piece of writing. A substantial number of vegetarians and vegans panned the book because of its acceptance of what Pollan would call “responsible” meat consumption. And there is no doubt that the author does indeed support the idea that eating meat can be done in an ethical fashion. I won’t rehash the arguments in the reviews here. Having a background in anthropology I can tell you that from a biological perspective humans have absolutely evolved as omnivores. Those canine teeth in your mouth didn’t appear because primates had an exclusively vegetarian diet, they are there specifically for the catching of prey and the tearing of meat. That said, we would do well as a species to eat a lot LESS meat, and there is no denying the environmental damage that is done by widespread meat consumption. Coda #2: That idea of responsible meat consumption is central to Pollan’s ideas. But it’s larger than just meat. The whole idea here is to gain a more thorough understanding of where our food comes from and from there develop better and more responsible food habits. Modern supermarket culture has taken away a lot of the basic knowledge of food...where it comes from, how it is grown or raised, etc. Pollan states outright that we would all be better off if we once again gained a real connection to our food, one that goes well beyond opening a can or a package and dropping something into a pot to warm it up. That concept alone makes “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” valuable and worthwhile.Coda #3: Another criticism of the book centered on Pollan himself, and the idea that the concepts in “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” can only be absorbed and put into action by an affluent audience. I’m not really sure I buy this argument. It’s true that “foodie” culture seems to have a footprint squarely in a sort of urban-hipster vibe, but the fact is that lower-income folks can put any of the ideas in this book into action just the same as any other demographic. In point, much has been made in the news lately of the current regime’s idea to hand out “food boxes” in place of letting assistance recipients make their own food choices. That would mean a direct impact on the farmer’s markets who accept assistance payments. That tells me that plenty of lower-income people have learned how to make healthy and ethical culinary choices that stretch their food dollars to the max. "

174,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/693262-huyen,5," If i could think of this book as a meal, then indeed Michael Pollan is a marvelous cook. He writes well, vividly and convincingly.As dense and informative as it is, the book doesn't make me feel bloated, but nourished :] I can't remember the last time I have discussed a book so many times, with so many different people. Chapter 17 on the ethics of eating animals is just mind-blowing and alone can make this book a worthwhile read.i can't resist talking about it before anything else. I've tried to become a vegetarian a couple of times and have always eventually lapsed back into eating meat. The main reason I would ever become a vegetarian is environmental, the huge amount of energy expended in producing and preserving meat. I've always found the ethics of eating meat hard to defend on the moral basis. And it's fascinating to see a person do it convincingly like Pollan. Pollan starst with Peter Singer's argument against eating meat. A wonderfully simple but powerful idea: ""if possessing a higher degree of intelligence does not entitle one human to use another for his or her own ends, how can it entitle humans to exploit non-humans for the same purpose?"". Leaving aside the problematic question of how we define animal ""intelligence"", there is no debate as to whether animals can suffer. And if we have extended equal rights to women, minorities, homosexuals, should we and why don't we extend these rights to other species? ouch. most people, like me, when faced with this question and thinking about it seriously, either look away or become vegetarians. it is difficult to reconcile our instincts to eat meat and the moral implications of it. but Pollan shows us that those are not the only two alternatives.He argues that while animals rightists have always stressed the suffering of animals due to our meat eating habits (although we have rather slim evidence of exactly what goes on in the brain of a pig about to go to heaven, (or hell?)), they have also failed to acknowledge that humans are capable of giving animals a decent and happy life. and ""happy"" in this case means the ability to do what they would naturally do, either pigs rooting around in the dirt, or cows wandering on pastures. ""to think of domestication as a form of slavery or even exploitation is to miscontrue that whole relationship-to project a human idea or power onto what is in fact an example of mutualism or symbiosis between species."" as he points out, domestication is an evolutionary development. domesticated animals have a much higher chance of surviving than in the wild, compare dogs and wolves for example. they therefore evolve to serve human benefits, winning our favor, in order to be provided with shelter and protection. they probably don't like being killed very much, but if that gives them a longer life and a much better chance to spread their genes to the next generation, they would much rather be with us than be in nature. ""predation is not a matter of morality or of politics, it, too, is a matter of symbiosis. from the point of view of the individual prey animal predation is a horror, but from the point of view of the group-and of its gene pool-it is indispensable."" That is exactly the point that most animals rightists miss. they concern only with individuals, but nature doesn't work that way, no matter how cruel that might sound. nature is about maximizing the survival of the whole species. our morals were developed to help us function as a healthy, cooperative society, but it is rather irrelevant to what should happen in nature.Pollan charges that this very embraced and apparently self-righteous ""ideology"" is a product of an urban society which has lost touch with nature. A friend of mine told me that he took his children to a slaughterhouse to see how pigs are killed because he believes that if we want to eat meat, we should be able to face the morality involved in it. that, i think, is a respectable viewpoint. the children were slightly disturbed but it didn't stop them eating meat. this father is probably an exception in our society. most of us probably have never raised a cow and seen a cow. our meat comes from nice little packages that never remind us of that it comes from something that used to have a brain and can suffer. when i asked my NZ friends why people no longer eat animal organs, like we do in Vietnam, they stared at me with disturbed looks. but really, when you think about it, offal is very nutritious, and there's little reason why we can accept eating meat, but not kidney, heart, or brain. i suspect the reason is the viscera brings home to us the fact that what we are eating used to be quite similar to us, which means, having eyes, lungs, heart. and we are so scared to face that reality that we get rid of it altogether. the second reason is that once the meat production process is out of sight, we have lost the traditional rituals justifying the act of killing and governing the slaughter of animals. the disappearance of these old practices gives way to the brutalization of animals to the extent that the animals become so sick that we have pretty much run out of anti-biotics.but that is not the same as to say that we can eat meat carefree without any moral consideration. given the fact that our food chain has become increasingly industrialized and heavily dependent on fossil fuels, we do have a moral obligation to care about the health of nature, i.e, the condition of the soil, the health of the animals we eat, the impact of animal farming on the environment. I can't agree more with him that while we don't need or arguably shouldn't give up our meat consumption, we should at least make sure that the way we eat is sustainable and the animals we eat are treated decently. the way that animals are treated in most farms is quite despicable. and i bet that if we had a chance to look at it, most would quite happily choose to be vegetarian. giving animals a humane treatment does not only give us a clear conscience but really serves our benefits as well. who would not want to eat a healthy chicken instead of a disease-ridden one? recently, when a documentary about the treatment of pigs in battery farms in NZ was broadcast on TV, the public displayed outrage at what they saw and have pushed quite vigorously for legislation prohibiting cruel treatment of farm animals  see here. i don't know of progress elsewhere. i like the idea that once the public know about what's happening to what they eat, they can make a difference.most of the rest of the book deals with corn and how our (meaning American) food chain has been reduced to a monoculture of soy and corn. they are present in something like 75% of the processed food products on the market. 40% of the calories a Mexican eats comes from food. if you think that's quite astonishing, then apparently American have overtaken Mexicans to be kings of walking corns. corn became the winner in the competition to be human's favorite crop because of its capacity to store a lot more calories than other species. the invention of fertilizers (interestingly made widely available by the surplus ammonium nitrate after the war) made growing corn so incredibly efficient that corn gradually replaced all other crops. and in the 1950s, feeding cattle on feedlots was cheaper than on grass, enabling the farmers to build massive chicken factories. livestock farmers went out of business because they couldn't compete with giant factories. fertilizer was a mixed blessing because the soil fertility shifted from reliance on the sun and a careful rotation of crops, to fossil fuels. we might like to think that fertilizers make agriculture a lot more efficient, but in fact, we expend twice as much energy to produce corn than when we relied on nature. and that's not to mention the huge cost of environmental pollution.when corn got cheaper and cheaper, the Nixon government stepped in to subsidize it, encouraging growing even more corn of lower nutritional quality and sparking the beginning of agribusiness. the excess corn finds its way into most processed energy-dense foods and feeding livestock. getting rid of this huge amount of excess energy contributes to obesity and an impoverished food culture. it makes good economic sense to dump excess corn on cattle, but biologically, they evolved to eat grass, and being forced to eat something they are not supposed to eat has caused grave problems. in a shit hole with piles of waste, polluted air and water and no space to even wiggle their tails, the only way these cows can survive is to swallow humongous amounts of anti-biotics. that sounds quite depressing, but the organic industry doesn't really hold a torch toward a moral utopia as we would hope. Pollan points out that the organic industry has diverged exponentially from its original ideals in the 1960s, and is now not so much better than the establishment. they consume a huge amount of energy to transport their products across the country, most ""free range"" farms mean that the chicken has a palm-sized window to look at the sun 5 minutes a day. real organic farmers have a hard time to get their products on the market because of government regulations. to me it seems like America's unsustainable food consumption is perpetuated by a cycle of ignorance and government intervention. so much for laissez-faire capitalism. growing so much corn might seem to make good economic sense. we must admit that it's quite remarkable that this is the first time in human history, we can produce food so cheaply and so abundantly. but this is the thing that has always not sat right with me about economics. that it hides all the expensive external costs involved in the process: environmental degradation, costs to the government in terms of subsidies, a huge consumption of fossil fuels, public health and malnourishment. so in fact, eating cheap corn is very expensive. so the key question is WHY is America doing all these things that defy logic? to summarize the whole story in one word, I'd say efficiency. feeding corn to livestock is so much cheaper and easier than grass (don't have to wait for grass to grow). and it supports a legion of other industries: the chemical and biotech industries, the food industry, the oil industry, pharma, agribusiness. If we keep in mind that hunter-gathers didn't become agriculturists out of choice, but because they depleted the animals they were hunting, it makes me worry what will happen to us when we deplete our soil and degrade our environment so the same disastrous extent. the food price riots in 2007/8 give us a glance at how depressing such a world would be.but this book isn't just depressing, it's enlightening and inspiring. it shows us that there ARE alternatives to the status quo: eat local, subscribe to a farm you know, and as he says in ""In defense of food"", then simply ""eat food, not too much, mostly plants"". I find Michael Pollan a remarkable writer, very humble and articulate. I can't recommend this book too highly."
175,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,5,"We are a notably unhealthy people obsessed by the idea of eating healthily (p. 3).Michael Pollan's Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals is a critique of industrial farms: they raise animals shoulder to shoulder standing in their own manure, feeding them foods that they are not designed for and which make them ill, and then use chemicals to compensate for these sins. Who knew that we are corn-eaters – not directly, like Mexicans, but through our cattle and chickens, and in processed foods.“When you look at the isotope ratios,.. we North Americans look like corn chips with legs.” Compared to us, Mexicans today consume a far more varied carbon diet: the animals they eat still eat grass (until recently, Mexicans regarded feeding corn to livestock as a sacrilege); much of their protein comes from legumes; and they still sweeten their beverages with cane sugar."" (p. 23)Pollan looks at industrial and pastoral farms, briefly flirts with being a vegetarian, then becomes a hunter/gatherer. He doesn't ""look"" the way I would, but goes out in the field, visiting and working farms, learning to hunt (and kill), and to gather wild mushrooms. Each major step on his journey is punctuated with a meal.Our typical, industrial farm, Pollan argues, is not healthy for us (making us obese), not healthy for the animals (making them ill), and not healthy for the soil and environment (using vast amounts of oil to raise food in a monoculture). He may something good about this kind of farming, but I've forgotten it. This farming is good for conglomerates – making them rich – but not farmers or consumers.His week on Joel Salatin's pastoral farm is fascinating – even for me, a vegetarian of more than 40 years. Salatin is a libertarian, deeply suspicious of government and governmental intervention. However, hw is a scientist's kind of farmer. He recognizes that everything is connected, so considers how to balance the activity and placement of cattle, chickens, pigs, and trees, each entering an environmental niche at a time that makes sense for the animals and farm, keeping all healthy while being largely chemical-free. As Salatin argues:""Society is not bearing the cost of water pollution, of antibiotic resistance, of food-borne illnesses, of crop subsidies, of subsidized oil and water—of all the hidden costs to the environment and the taxpayer that make cheap food seem cheap. No thinking person will tell you they don’t care about all that. I tell them the choice is simple: You can buy honestly priced food or you can buy irresponsibly priced food.” (p. 243)Finally, Omnivore's Dilemma is an ode to mindful, grounded eating, praising the food from Salatin's farm, but also that hunted and gathered in Sonoma and the Bay Area of California. He drools not just as be eats, but as he prepares to do so (although some of what he must do brings him close to losing his lunch), For Pollan, a meal that is eaten in full consciousness of what it took to make it is worth preparing every now and again, if only as a way to remind us of the true costs of the things we take for granted (pp. 409-410). He ends up in favor of locally-grown and harvested foods, foods with few chemicals, foods where we own the costs of eating.Pollan convinces me – not to eat cow, as some parts of Omnivore's Dilemma would be well-served with Sinclair Lewis's The Jungle. He does convince me to invest in local farms. I had been considering dropping my CSA membership in favor of the farmer's market, but decided against this so I support local farmers (mine is a cooperative of 12 Amish farms and includes a handwritten letter by one farmer each week). We have been decreasing our consumption of processed foods, but Omnivore's Dilemma will likely speed up this process. And, I will hesitate – I can't promise more – the next time I am looking at vegetables from half-way around the world.As Claude Lévi-Strauss argued, food must be “not only good to eat, but also good to think” (quoted on p. 289). Pollan's food-writing is thoughtful, and I enjoyed Omnivore's Dilemma as much for the writing as the content. And, he is dryly humorous.Pollan clears Lévi-Strauss's bar."
176,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/394959-susan,2,"While I read this book, I couldn't help but think about the muckrakers of the early 20th century. This book is pretty much nothing like The Jungle, starting with the fact that it is nonfiction, but its goal isn't that far away. It's telling a story about a part of our food industry that we don't normally think to ask about and painting a picture that should make us angry enough to do something about it.And don't get me wrong, Pollan rakes a lot of really good muck. Mostly it's his interpretation of his muck that doesn't work for me.I think the really important information comes in the first half of the book. Pollan gives us a crash course in agriculture subsidies. He compares our currently corn-focused subsidy structure to historic subsidies that were geared toward a broader spectrum of food. Then he goes into detail about what it means to live in a food chain that is designed to produce the most corn at the cheapest price. The answer? Corn is essentially in every processed food we eat. Meanwhile, corn farmers can barely keep their farms afloat because the price has been pushed down so far that they can barely produce enough product to cover their mortgages, and they dump so much fertilizer onto their fields to raise production that it ends up leeching into the water supply all the way to the ocean.Pollan then takes the corn story to the cattle industry and gives us a pretty ugly picture of what it means to raise corn-fed cattle. We thought that corn-fed cattle were a good thing, right? It's advertised on the stickers on our steaks. Except that cow biology rejects corn. The resulting situation not only makes the lives of the cows highly questionable at best, but it presents some very real health concerns for we the consumers.Buying organic fixes the problem, right? Wrong. Large-scale organic produce and livestock may not be what you think they are. Think your chickens are free-range? That just means they need to have access to the outdoors, which they are trained never to use. Corporate organic livestock is raised in environments little better than its non-organic counterpart, and they're probably fed corn too.OTOH, Pollock's story actually made me more positive about organic produce. One thing that organic regulations do accomplish is requiring a use of fertilizer that is not nearly so destructive to the environment.All of this stuff is good stuff to know. In fact, I'd like to look for some other sources of this information so I deepen my knowledge and cross-check Pollan. The place where he loses me is in his interpretation.This book got a lot of people justifiably riled up about the quality of their food and the state of their food production. And where does Pollan direct them? To back yard gardens and small family farming operations. In large part from this book, the bourgeois Localvore movement sprang up. So if you have enough money to pay twice the price for your food or the free time to produce it yourself, then you can have the satisfaction of opting out of the flawed food chain while leaving it essentially unimproved. A whole new luxury food industry has grown up to provide local food to the Localvores. Meanwhile, the corn subsidies and all their consequences continue unabated.The problem as I see it is that Pollan wraps up aesthetics with his practicality. Aesthetically, he is drawn to family farms where there are a lot more workers per square acre, a larger variety of produce and livestock are produced, and resources are used in a way he perceives as more efficient. The problem is that these qualities might make him feel good, but they don't actually address most of the problems he brought up in his muckraking. One of the sections that got my goat most was a several-page indictment of Value Added. You see, when companies make breakfast cereal, they take corn, puff it up, color it, put sugar on it, and (gasp) sell it for more than the price of the corn! The horrors of those corporate money grubbers!Look. Value Added is a core economic concept. I don't suppose Pollan expected people to pay the same amount for his book as the cost of the wood pulp used to make the paper. I suppose he wanted to be paid more for writing it than the cost of the computer he composed it on. And what's his solution to paying for overpriced processed corn? To pay more for food that comes from the right farm. So which Value Added is legitimate and which one isn't? It seems to me that food production needs four core traits. It needs to be: - Responsible: Producing it doesn't destroy the land, the water supply, or the consumers. - Plentiful: There's enough produced to feed everyone. - Reliable: Every weather fluctuation doesn't put us in danger of a shortage or a famine. - Cheap: Affordable to as many people as possible who need to eat.Pollan really only addresses the first of these four issues, and that in an incomplete manner. His solutions pretty much stomp on Plentiful and Cheap. Back yard gardens and family farms are not going to be able to produce enough food to feed a majority of Americans, no matter what they are willing to pay. It's really too bad that we couldn't have directed a lot more of this food production anger toward agricultural subsidy reform instead."
177,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/165589-gwen,3,"The first section of the book, in which Pollan follows the path of corn through the industrial food chain and discusses the effects of corn on our diets, supermarkets, and the environment, is fascinating. Despite being trained in the sociology of agriculture and specifically in the analysis of commodity chains, I learned a lot and found few details to quibble with (the main exception being his tendency to anthropomorphize corn, discussing it as though it intentionally chose to evolve in certain ways). If I were teaching a class on food, I would totally assign that section of the book.The second section of the book is also good, though not as great as the first. Probably this is because I already knew that ""organic"" and ""sustainable"" are not the same and that Horizon-brand organic dairy products come from huge dairies that, from the point of view of the cow, the quality of the milk, and the environment, are little better than regular non-organic ones.But the final section is really annoying me. Most of the things that are irritating me are much more clearly discussed at http://www.powells.com/review/2007_08..., but there were a few other things as well. Pollan keeps talking about how only omnivores have any trouble deciding what to eat, using koalas and cows as examples of animals that, being specialists, don't need to worry about whether something is an acceptable food source or not. Anyone who raises cows will tell you he's highly underestimating cows' experimentation with non-grass foods. They eat weeds and poisonous plants; they get nails and wire and bones stuck in their throats. It's a pain in the ass to have to try to remove a deer vertebra some cow has managed to lodge in her throat. I suppose this seems like a minor detail, except his entire argument is that humans (and other omnivores) are unique in facing problems deciding what is and isn't safe to eat.Connected to that is Pollan's reference to ""human nature"" from time to time, something that drives me nuts when my students do it and is even more exasperating from someone who at least ostensibly has the intellectual capacity and training to not fall back on such a simplistic explanation (that is, ""humans do it, therefore it's human nature""). He seems to buy in to the popular conception that there's a ""human nature"" that we've just smeared a little civilization and culture on top of (think of frosting on a cake).I don't think I can finish the book--I'm increasingly irritated by his tone and the problems with his argument. It's too bad, because the book really did start off well."
178,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20495277-anny,4,"Truly an eye-opener! I absolutely loved the first part of the book about the industrial agriculture. I would've never thought that our humble 'corn' is actually the tyrant of mono-culture farming. Farmers went broke, took a huge debt, taking side jobs driving trailers and depended on their wife salary for the sake of planting corn. Animals (cow, pig, chicken) got ousted from the farm and pasture and cramped into CAFO a.k.a. concentration camp for animals, where they live their short miserable life. First, they were fed food (corn or dubious meat-by-product or whatever cheapest feed available) that is making them sick and making us who eat them sick (mad cows anyone?). Second, they were cramped as much as physically possible, resulting in stressed, depressed, and psychotic animals (often resorting to self-mutilation or cannibalism). Third, they were doused with much antibiotics and medications (because their living conditions made them sick) and hormones and whatnot (to fatten them as much as possible) with who knows what side-effects that might cause for us (antibiotic-resistant bacteria for example).Taking the stand against industrial agriculture were small farms, like Polyface farm owned by Joel Salatin. If CAFO were hell for animals, then Polyface farm must be its heaven. There were so many good things about this farm, suffice to say, if I could buy from there (or any other place that practice sustainable agriculture), I would certainly do so. The last part of the book about hunting and gathering was the part that I liked the least. Too many pages rambling on and on about the ethics of killing animals. It's a weak finish, but the first two parts of the book was definitely worth reading!"
179,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/327527-missy-jean,5,"I can say without hesitation that this is a life-changing book. It's elegantly written and unflinching. Pollan is honest about his own cognitive dissonance about being an omnivore, which means he never sounds self-righteous (an impressive feat for the genre). And I love the widespread anthropomorphism of the book, the mysticism that Pollan is willing to embrace as he cites scientific sources.That said... Halfway through the book I was so depressed that I went home and ate graham crackers dipped in a can of chocolate frosting. All I could think was, so there's no choice! I am going to eat chemicals and toxins and animal byproducts unwittingly every day of my life, and they are going to kill me in the end! By the end of the book, though, I felt like I had a real sense of small measures that I can take to eat in a healthier and more environmentally responsible way. So I went to the farmstand and bought a big old pile of locally-grown buttercup squash, peaches, chard and zucchini. Better than synthetic frosting, right?I think there are a lot of different conclusions that people can draw from this book, and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who wants to be more mindful about what they eat. For me, it validated my penchant for vegetarianism (and my habitual eschewing of McDonalds), but you might get something slightly different from it. (Pollan is not a vegetarian.) Honestly, I don't think I'll ever look at my plate in quite the same way again, and I feel grateful for that."
180,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82365956-veronica,4,"""Yet there are other images of animals on other kinds of farms that contradict the nightmare ones. I'm thinking of the hens I saw at Polyface Farm, fanning out over the cow pasture on a June morning, pecking at the cowpats and the grass...or the image of pig happiness I witnessed in that cattle barn in March, watching the hogs, all upturned pink hams and corkscrew tails, nosing their way through that deep cake of compost in search of alcoholic morsels of corn. It is true that farms like this are but a speck on the monolith of modern animal agriculture, yet their very existence, and the possibility that implies, throws the whole argument for animal rights into a different light."" Pollan knows that the so-called happiness at Polyface Farm could never be scaled to a magnitude sufficient to feed the many required. ""To many animal people even Polyface Farm is a 'death camp'—a way station for doomed creatures awaiting their date with the executioner. But to look at the lives of these animals is to see this holocaust analogy for the sentimental conceit it really is. In the same way we can probably recognize animal suffering when we see it, animal happiness is unmistakable, too, and during my week on the farm I saw it in abundance.""I will permit the possibility of brief animal happiness on a small farm right before the slaughter. Still, the inconvenient reality is that human agriculture contravenes the natural order of predation because we are the only creatures that bring animals into existence in order to slaughter them. The lion does not raise and propagate zebras in a nested enclosure indefinitely and delight in creating more and more efficient ways of slaughtering their offspring. This apparently small detail is conveniently left out in arguments from nature, as I will call them. ""To think of domestication as a form of slavery or even exploitation is to misconstrue that whole relationship—to project a human idea of power onto what is in fact an example of mutualism or symbiosis, rather than a political, development. The animals grew tame and lost their ability to fend for themselves in the wild and the humans traded hunter-gatherer ways for the settled lives of agriculturists. Humans changed biologically, too.""Don't equate the domestication of wolves to the slaughter of chicks. Red herring fallacy. ""[This] is where the animal rightists betray a deep ignorance about the workings of nature."" Again, there is nothing natural about industrial agriculture. ""The very existence of predation in nature, of animals eating animals, is the cause of much anguished hand-wringing in the animal rights literature. 'It must be admitted,' Peter Singer writes, 'that the existence of carnivorous animals does pose one problems for the ethics of Animal Liberation, and that is whether we should do anything about it.' (Talk about the need for peacekeeping forces!)""On the one hand, this made me laugh a bit because I've always been disturbed by the existence of predation in the wild. That many creatures rely on the pain and suffering of other animals in order to live is but a testament to the fallen state of the world, which is also why Jupiter is a purer and superior planet to Earth. But I digress. (My sister has christened this Jupiter propaganda🪐, which I readily admit.)In any event, I've already unravelled this false equivalency between natural predation and the very systematic multiplication of animals bred for the slaughter, season after season. From doom to dust.""Today, the organic food industry finds itself in a most unexpected, uncomfortable, and yes, unsustainable position: floating on a sinking sea of petroleum.""""U.S. agricultural policy, like the Declaration of Independence, is founded on the principle that all carrots are created equal, even though there's good reason to believe this isn't really true.""Birds can't get access to the outdoors until at least 5 weeks old and are slaughtered at 7, so ""free range turns out to be not so much a lifestyle for these chickens as a two-week vacation option.""""From the moment an organic lettuce plant is ready for harvest, the rest of its journey from field to produce aisle follows a swift and often ingenious industrial logic that is only nominally organic.""The fact that steer are given numbers as names makes Holocaust comparisons all too facile...""The farmers desperate to boost yield end up degrading their land, plowing and planting marginal land, applying more nitrogen—anything to squeeze a few more bushels from the soil.""""Nor would such a culture be shocked to discover that there are other countries, such as Italy and France, that decide their dinner questions on the basis of such quaint and unscientific criteria as pleasure and tradition, eat all manner of 'unhealthy' foods, and, lo and behold, wind up actually healthier and happier in their eating than we are. We show our surprise at this by speaking of something called the 'French paradox,' for how could a people who eat such demonstrably toxic substance as foie gras and triple crème cheese actually be slimmer and healthier than we are? Yet I wonder if it doesn't make more sense to speak in terms of an American paradox—that is, a notably unhealthy people obsessed by the idea of eating heathily."""
181,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73483095-cynnamon,0,"I bought this book, because I had thouroughly enjoyed Michael Pollans ""Cooking"".But here I give up.I have read around 100 pages about corn. I learned a lot I didn't know before, but unfortunately I didn't care about my newly acquired knowledge.Also the book is completely US-centric, which makes it for me as an European not quite so interesting.This book is outside of my scope of interest, therefore I refrain from assigning a rating."
182,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,5,"I really like Pollan’s writing style, he brings points home with simplicity, and he is able to cover a lot of ground without the writing feelings unnecessarily circuitous or blustery. More than that though, I like that he is willing to experience. I mean, that’s the very core of responsible journalism, Pollan goes and works on the farms, he helps slaughter chickens, he sits in tractors, he goes hunting and foraging, he throws himself bodily and emotionally into these experiences, and at each point I felt that he was incredibly honest with both himself and the reader about the impacts of his actions and his emotional state.All in all I thought it was refreshingly non-biased, fair appraising look at industrial agriculture/ranching, industrial/artisanal organic agriculture/ranching, and hunting/foraging. I say that as a person literally smack dab in the middle of row-crop country (my husband and his family farms), as a gardener, and as a hunter. I’ve long had a problem with the way we raise meat in this country, and the lack of connection between people and their food. Its one of the reasons that I do hunt and garden, and its also one of the reasons that I’ve mostly switched to plant proteins for all meals except supper. I am continuing to try and evolve how I eat, and it’s a learning experience and I don’t always get it right (I ate spaghettio’s twice in three days last week, no one’s perfect). But its hard to read this book without examining the role that we eaters have in the natural world. I am going to make a concerted effort to eat in-season vegetables except for those that I froze from my garden in the summer, and I’m going to try and rely on our game meats more. Despite reading much about early life on the prairie, somehow I had never considered that even meat was seasonal, or that foods grown out of season lack the nutrition that we think we are getting. They’re both very “duh” concepts, but its not something that I had really appreciated. Nor had I valued the waste of petroleum in shipping year round under-nourished produce from Argentina to the US just so that we could eat whatever fruit or veggie that we want, despite its lack of flavor.Perhaps the greatest thing that came from this was the conversations with my husband. He listened to the audiobook while in the tractor, and it was great to talk to him when he came home at night about the ways agriculture has changed since Pollan wrote (advances in technology have changed the level of precision for farmers, becoming more environmentally friendly for those that upgrade), but also the ways that it could continue to change. What could we do as eaters, hunters, buyers, and producers in our local community? Books that foster conversation and change always get a 5 out of 5.Absolutely recommend to everyone. Read those food labels. Speak out. We deserve, as buyers, connectivity and information about our food, and animals especially deserve better than what we manage for our convenience."
183,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/307041-ginny-messina,3,"A truly important book by gifted writer and journalist Michael Pollan. It's not without its flaws, however, and for all the promise of the first two-thirds of the book, it kind of leaves the reader hanging at the end. In the first part, Pollan exposes the damaging effects of industrial agriculture, and—-importantly—-this includes large-scale organic production which is not nearly as benign as most people would like to believe. Later in the book he addresses the inhumane aspect of industrial agriculture as well—-organic production included. He puts it succinctly: you look away, or you stop eating meat. In the second part of the book, we see farming as it should be, on Polyface Farm in the Shenandoah Valley. Here, farming practices are closely tied to nature including the natural behavior of farm animals. While the system doesn't adhere completely to organic regulations, it is far more sustainable and humane than industrial organic agriculture and certainly more so than conventional agriculture. Polyface Farm is not able to separate itself from industrial agriculture completely (by law, the steer are killed in conventional slaughterhouses) but it still seems like a very nice place. Unfortunately, the scale on which it operates means that this type of sustainable farming can never produce enough food for the U.S. population. Food from farms like Polyface is likely to be available to only a privileged few. The last part of the book struck me as downright nonsensical. Pollan explores the possibility of putting together the ultimate local meal—-one composed of food that he himself has hunted, gathered and grown. But don't try this at home, he says. It is not at all a realistic way to eat. Well—-no—-not if you do it by gathering chanterelle mushrooms with a bunch of chefs from Chez Panisse, hunting wild boar in the California woods, and diving for abalone along a rocky coast. Granted, most Americans would be hard-pressed to produce their own food, but Pollan doesn't even explore the option in any kind of realistic or meaningful fashion. In the end, it appears that the problems associated with food production are insurmountable. Industrial agriculture provides most of the food in this country and is a wasteful and unsustainable system. But more sustainable systems are not realistic for feeding the population. Pollan does not offer any clear cut answers, much to my surprise. (I didn't expect him to solve the problem; I did expect a little guidance!) But the thoughtful reader can still pull together a plan of action to minimize the environmental and ethical cost of a meal. Reduce intake of animal foods. Buy locally-produced food. Grow or produce as much as is realistic for you. Pollan makes his readers think about where their meals come from and how to measure the true cost of our ""inexpensive"" food. This is a must-read for anyone who expresses a desire to live and eat responsibly. "

I don't necessarily agree with some of his conclusions, but I admire the way he went out there and immersed himself in the topics he was studying.Books like this always make me feel good about the changes I've made in my eating habits over the last few years as well as motivating me to remain vigilant when I start to get lazy.I look forward to trying more of this author's books."

"
187,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147289-jason-pettus,5,"Journalist Michael Pollan has a reputation for writing books that people don't just like, but whose very lives get permanently changed because of reading them; and I can attest that this exact thing has happened to me after reading my first book of his, the extraordinary 2006 guide to modern food practices known as The Omnivore's Dilemma. In it, Pollan imagines three typical meals a contemporary American might eat -- one of fast food, one of Whole Foods-type groceries, and one literally put together through foraging and hunting -- then over the course of 60,000 words shows us exactly, step by minute step, how the ingredients in each meal can be traced back and back until finally reaching a point of a living plant being grown in the ground somewhere, then building us back forward again by showing exactly what happens to that plant step by step as it makes its way from the farm to eventually our mouths.Along the way, then, Pollan gives us an astute history of the post-war industrial agricultural industry; explains why exactly corn is the overwhelming number-one crop now grown in America; gives us the horrifying reasons that most cattle and chicken have to be fed so many antibiotics in order to merely survive under such harsh industrial conditions; demonstrates why in a middle-class consumerist society these conditions have to happen in the first place (that is, because if cows were still grown in the humane way they were in an agricultural society, a McDonald's hamburger would cost $30, and the American people would riot); shows through personal field trips what exactly the difference is between ""cage-free,"" ""free range"" and ""pastured"" eggs, and why one of these options is infinitely better than the others; details why the term ""organic"" on a food label can mean vastly different things depending on the company and circumstances; and shows through illuminating first-hand experience why we are no longer a hunter-gatherer society (namely, because it's exhausting, inefficient, and makes people run the risk of sometimes going entire weeks at a time without finding anything edible to eat).Easily the most interesting book I've read in a decade, The Omnivore's Dilemma has permanently changed the way I now shop for groceries, knowing as I now do so many more details about what each label on a package means, and how different growing circumstances can often literally mean a difference in the resulting food's nutrition (just for one example, how Pollan scientifically proves here that eggs from chickens that are allowed to roam freely on farmland are literally better for you than eggs grown from chickens kept in cages); and although I haven't completely given up fast food, certainly every hamburger I now buy makes me ponder the indescribably monstrous and cruel circumstances by which that cow lived its life, which has already influenced just how many hamburgers I buy in general. (It also makes me understand a lot better why there will always be people around in any society who are more than happy to perform that society's most inhumane tasks, such as rounding up undocumented immigrants, ripping their children away from them, and throwing them into concentration camps while openly laughing in their faces...but that's neither here nor there, I suppose.) To tell the truth, the only reason I read this in the first place was because I was waiting for the day in early June that Pollan's newest book came out, a 600-page whopper called How to Change Your Mind that looks in exhaustive detail at all the latest 21st-century research into the connections between psychedelic drugs, mindfulness, meditation, mental health, what MRIs can teach us about what we've traditionally called the ""soul,"" and a lot more. That book is now finished too, and was just as fascinating as The Omnivore's Dilemma, so keep an eye out for my write-up of that in another couple of weeks.UPDATE 1: I find it utterly fascinating that the only negative reviews here of this book are from vegetarians, who are so upset at Pollan's conclusion that humans as omnivores are perfectly capable of eating meat, they're willing to dismiss every single other vegetarian-friendly thing he has to say. (Ultimately Pollan is pro-vegetable in this book, despite concluding that meat is indeed an edible substance that humans find edible.) A huge part of this book is all about how the politics of any given age has a huge influence over our opinions on the supposedly ""scientifically objective"" subjects of diet and nutrition, and the vitriolic negative reviews of the book by militant vegetarians here simply proves his point all over again.UPDATE 2: After reading other people's reviews, I agree with something I saw a lot of people mention; that a clear sign of how much I loved this book is that people at Twitter eventually got sick of me constantly tweeting about it while I was reading it. Be prepared to drive your friends and spouse crazy!"

Well, Actually, Eat Sh*t and Flourish. Each of these would have been a more classy title for the book ""Omnivore's Dilemma"". To paraphrase another reviewer 'The dude structures this book by following the path of four finished meals from origin to plate - one McDonald's meal, one comprised of supermarket organic products, one from a ""beyond-organic"" self-sustaining farm in Virginia, and one he forages almost entirely on his own. This book tries to provokes a lot of thought about the origins of our food and the biological, political, social and economic implications of those origins, and for the most part, it is successful.' So after reading this book I realize that maybe, just maybe, I don’t argue with people about food enough. Ever since I read  Fast Food Nation  and watched  Supersize Me  I have been pretty good about avoiding eating at Mc-stablishments and drinking soda. Knowing these efforts aren’t enough, but not having had the ...chutzpah ... to make the leap to full fledged, ""morally superior"" vegetarianism. I am way to lazy to manage an urban garden, -- preferring rather to watch one made on TV OD presents, as a moral alternative to growing, actually hunting and eating wild game. The parts of the book that describe this stuff, although not seemingly not feasible, reinforced these previously formed notions about foraging. Still, it is pretty interesting to see the details fleshed out.One thing discussed in the book that i hadn't internalized, and that makes sense when I think about it, is that going to whole foods and buying an organic Chilean artichoke in the winter can be a lot worse ethically than eating a fat juicy steak from a locally raised mature grass fed cow. I guess that the ethical answer culled from the book on how to shop food in the city is to buy at farmers markets or join one of these CSA’s. Take the extra step and get to know your farmer, know how they grow, know how they feed and treat the animals is the right thing to do. This seems like undue effort and cost but the ethical equivalent seems to be to hunt and dress bloody dead animals or forage for mushrooms in central park. In that perspective, the first options seems like less effort ."

These range from the nearby McDonald's and Burger Kind to the supermarket to the local farmer's stand. Michael Pollan takes a look at four ways to have a meal - one industrial meal at McDonald's, one organic meal from Whole Foods, one local meal from a farmer's field, and one completely ""homemade"" meal made from hunting and foraging.I must say, the first 300 pages are riveting, absolutely enthralling! I kept putting aside fiction to read this book, it was so good! However, when I hit the chapters on hunting and foraging, I found my interest severely waning. I really don't care at all about hunting animals and foraging for mushrooms, so keeping my attention was nearly impossible (this is why I took off a star). But the end picks up as Pollan returns to the final ""perfect"" meal.This book had so much really good information - information that once again cements my desire never to eat food at a fast food restaurant ever again. If one of your New Year's Resolutions is to eat healthier, read this book to bolster that desire!!"

The parts on farming, the evils of monoculture, the importance of grass, were especially enlightening. I don't normally eat beef and I would definitely reduce the intake even more. The most shocking part for me was the 'pastoral organic' revelation. I wonder if the organic products sold in Indonesia as are bad as the greenwashed examples in this book, which are all about the US market. The later parts of the book - hunting and cooking - were not as interesting for me as the earlier parts. Hence the four stars. Still, a fascinating read and highly recommended to everyone."

I support a small flock of happy chickens instead.Lengthy review to come. In the meantime, let me just say---I learned a lot from this book. I also enjoyed some segments very much. I would have done some extensive editing.The final chapter is sublime. OK, my real review:I am a convenience eater. Michael Pollan's work is transforming me into a conscious eater. Two concrete changes in my behavior: I will now pay the price of a fancy mocha coffee beverage for a dozen eggs gathered from happy chickens. I will also see commercially available breaded chicken with a side of corn as corn dressed with corn and a side of corn. I still may eat it, but at least I know what I'm getting!It is my hope that these wonderful books I have been reading indicate an American paradigm shift, and that the marketplace will allow people like me (who don't want to spend the time and effort tracking down purveyers of all sorts of specialty foods) more chances to make conscious choices in a convenient way. I will do my best to make choices that are more healthful for me and our planet regardless.This book was successful in changing my behavior. In large part, it was successful because I was already ripe for changing. Everything from Kingsolver's Animal Vegetable Miracle to Buford's Heat to Van Draanen's sweet young adult novel Flipped has been telling me to embrace these changes. This work built upon that foundation and presented a lot more detailed information supporting the choices that we should all be making. It was well structured, and it needed to be. So much information was packed into each section, it was necessary for me to take breaks. Some peeves---Too many declarative sentences. All declarative sentences put me on guard. (See what I did there?) I read something that says or implies ""all"" and I immediately start casting about defensively for the exceptions. I blame SAT prep. I was also put off by the way in which those declarations seemed designed to make me so defensive, mostly when he seemed dismissive of the travails of gardening, or scornful of the kind of hunter who does not agonize over the creatures' deaths. Second person. I hate second person. Here's a sentence that combined 2 peeves: ""You can forage in the garden, in the way Adam and Eve presumably did, but there isn't much to it: no dilemmas, no hunting stories."" And it's kind of a run on sentence too, now that I look at it, although that (obviously, having read any of my reviews!) isn't such a major irritation for me. (See what I did there?)Rampant anthropomorphism. Corn does not feel happy about taking over the world! Corn does not feel happy! Corn does not feel! This is a Truth. I believe that much of the anthropomorphism here was used as a bit of shorthand, implying all the Darwinian blah blah blah rather than spelling it out, and also trying to fix an image in the mind of the reader, but it is NOT TRUE. It bothers me. (Althoug I do like the image of an army of cornstalks marchng across the landscape, and it truly did stick with me.)LOVED---All descriptions of all meals.All the time spent at the idealized farm. (I forget what it's called and can't be bothered to look it up.)Everything to do with the mushrooms. (I think I'm due to read a book about mushrooms next.)The desription of the first hunt----soooooo true to my one hunting experience, in which I spent every fiber of my being on NOT MAKING ANY NOISE. It was such an intense time, and he captured that beautiully.I feel like there's so much more to say. Suiffice---I enjoyed most of this book. I learned. A lot. "
193,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1242165-schmacko,4,"So much has been written about this book, and so much will be defined by how you feel comfortable when discussing your eating habits. Here are, in short forms, my 10 observations:1)	If you’ve ever wondered how much the American government is responsible for your eating by subsidizing corporations who grow corn and make high fructose corn syrup, this is a book for you! SHORT VERSION: Corn is in EVERYTHING! We committed to growing corn when we could possibly switch to many varied crops. Corn is uniform, so it’s very corporate. If you hate political reading, if you don’t want to know this stuff, or you don’t frankly care, skip Pollan’s book. (Hope you enjoy your diabetes.)2)	Yes, we know organic food is better for us. But Pollan does a great job telling us that the US family’s annual food budget has actually dropped over the last 60 years, so Americans could conceivably spend more on food (and probably less on entertainment) and help out their diets.3)	I thought his section on Whole Foods founder John Mackey was interesting. Mackey completely concedes that he isn’t as radical as he started, that he has basically bought into the American corporate structure in order to take baby steps in supporting a business and helping people eat more healthfully.4)	At times, Pollan sounds a little Communist. At least, anti-Capitalist. I’m ok with that – to each his own – and I believe that American politics is all about constant discourse and adjustment.5)	Knowing the details of a slaughterhouse was a little much for me, but then again, I have no problem killing what I eat. Which makes me unlike 97% of Americans, who like to think their meat comes fully formed in plastic packages.6)	I love how Pollan describes the grey color of a McDonald’s burger. Funny! (I still crave Wendy’s once or twice a month.)7)	Mushroom foraging always sounded like something I wanted to do. Until I read his accounts. Mushroom foragers are crazy, obsessed people!8)	He’s lucky he had help at parts, or Pollan would’ve starved.9)	I like how he concedes that there is a better way to eat meat – that you don’t have to become a militant vegan.10)	I still wish we humans would accept that we are PART of the food chain!!! GRRR! We have canines; we have eaten meat for centuries. Our whole digestive system is built for meat! Lots of animals eat meat. We are not better than other animals that kill; the only thing that could possibly make us better is if we kill as quickly and painlessly as possible. We are the predators, and we should act as such – but with judiciousness and care. When we try to be ABOVE IT ALL – when we manipulate the environment – as Pollan excellently points out – we ruin it. “Dominion” humans create corporate slaughterhouses and run animals to extinction. Vegans treat animals as individuals to be coddled and encouraged to overproduce; soon, we’ll be overrun with deer and pumas and wild boar while we huddle eating berries from the sides of our abandoned roads (vehicles lead to road kill!) We need to accept that humans – like our predator cousins - do kill to survive, that we can be better at it, and that we are not ABOVE the food chain – as meat eaters or vegans – we are part of the system and should act accordingly. (Pollan mentions this, but doesn’t bring it home.)"
194,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260196-peter,5,"I started into this worried it was going to force me into vegetarianism, that I was going to read some passage about calves born into rancid waste, and a blue light somewhere in my brain would turn green and a gag reflex would accompany the thought of meat moving forward....Which speaks either to my penchant for pessimism, or the ominous relationship we have to our food chain, where we _don't_ really want to know how food got there, we just want to eat it.But read the book I did, fearful to encounter that meat-snatching passage within the book. Thankfully, Pollan is not an alarmist, but rather a quite methodical inquisitor about the roots of our food. It sounds kind of..esoteric, but he makes it fascinating, like a great humanities teacher he tells the larger story of food: of why we grow so much fricking corn in America, and how it's bad for almost everyone involved: ourselves, our diet, farmers in other countries.The good thing is that the book never descends into a polemic, unlike Michael Moore's work, Pollan's evenhandedness keeps the reader open to what he is saying. Nothing is extreme or revolutionary or incendiary.I feel like this book will, in the long term, shape the way I think about food by giving me a vocabulary for considering my personal and our cultural relationship to food. He discusses how America as a nation of immigrants never developed a stable national cuisine (unlike France or Italy), and the absence of that makes us vulnerable to an endless array of fad diets (coughAdkinscough) and an overall menu that is out of balance.There is a fascinating chapter on mushrooms and fungi, which details how they are utterly different from plants, and grow from this crazy underground symbiosis with decomposing nutrients and tree roots, taking a single drop of sugar from the tree root in exchange for processed minerals from the soil.There is an extended look at a farm outside Charlottesville--Polyface Farm--which models itself after natural ecosystems and creates this method of rotating cattle and chickens with grass growth cycles to create this wonderful whirlwind of spreadsheets, efficiency, and microdata on growth patterns of grass.To wit: it's better to have grass pasture surrounded by trees, because a blade of grass will burn X calories turning the face of it's blade toward the sun to receive solar energy. Planting forests around removes wind, allowing the grass to grow higher. Brilliant.In the end, it's about food, but it's also about systems in general. It begins to feel like a universal look at the interrelationship of history and commerce, and how everything is this big interconnected fabric, but that you can begin to see some of those connections, and kind of surf those links to great personal and collective gain.12/2007"

I use the word “threaten” very deliberately, because they are changes that I know I'm going to find challenging.Michael Pollan challenges his readers to examine their food a little closer, to consider where it comes from. And it's a logical request I think. We can spend days searching for the perfect doctor or mechanic, but how much time do we take to really think about our food? Do you know where your steak came from? Is your asparagus from a nearby farm, or far-flung Argentina? Are your peaches organic, and if so, what does that really mean? Most of us have no idea how to answer these questions.In most cases, the answers are simple. Most of our food likely comes from a massive industrial farm or feed-lot hundreds of miles away, fed by incredible amounts of fossil fuels -- the fertilizer, the machines used for harvesting, the trucks it took to transport the food to your local mega-mart, to name just a few uses of fossil fuel. Pollan's descriptions of these farms (and in particular, the feed lots) can be quite disturbing. However, Pollan does not outright condemn this ""industrial food chain."" He concedes that it would be difficult to feed billions of people inexpensively without it. Instead, he advocates having several different avenues for delivering food to our tables, and he describes several alternatives. It is up to the reader to determine how they want to eat. As for me, my eyes have been opened to the appeal of ""eating locally,"" where possible. (Emphasis on ""where possible."" There aren't too many oranges grown in Idaho.) By eating foods produced as close to my home as possible, I support the local economy, less fossil fuels are used, and the food should have fewer preservatives, hormones, and other chemical ingredients. Best of all, the food should be fresher and more flavorful. Yes, it will cost more, but I think it will be worth it. At least I'm willing to try it. Consider it an experiement. I've already found local sources of milk, eggs and meat that I'm going to try. I found Pollan's writing engaging and easy to read. (Disclaimer: I am a huge nerd, and the topic really spoke to me. If you don't like science, you may not find this book as fascinating.) A few words of warning: if evolution makes you uncomfortable, you may not like this book, as it often talks about the evolution of plants, animals and humans. Also, there were two or three instances where objectionable language was used. "
196,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4161947-m-l-rudolph,5,"2006. NY Times Book Review One of the 10 Best Books of the Year. We eat every day of our lives but we don't often give much thought to what we put in our bodies. If we are what we eat, then when it comes to meat, we are what the animal eats; and when it comes to produce, we are what the plant's grown in. There's a food chain that extends around the world and throughout evolutionary history from the beginning of man. Michael Pollan takes us on a tour of that chain and in the process gives any thinking, eating, person a new, often disturbing, view of what he/she consumes.Organized in three sections to illuminate industrial food (corn), pastoral food (grass), and personal food (the forest), Pollan's narrative builds toward meals made as nearly as possible with ingredients and methods from each of these categories.I double-dog-dare anyone to read this book and walk through a modern supermarket without viewing each item of food differently. And if you're like me, take your glasses, because the real information about what we buy and eat is in the small print, written in code, to disguise as much as possible what we truly consume. The central area of the supermarket is processed food. Good luck figuring that out. (When you can't determine the identity of fifteen out of eighteen ingredients on that package of processed whatever - chances are high what you're reading - and eating - are corn derivatives.) Around the walls, where we find the produce, meat, and fish, it would seem that the information describing the food would be more straight-forward. Good luck figuring that out, too. (Chances are every formerly living item was nourished or fertilized with corn or corn derivatives.)Unless you plan to follow a steer or a chicken through its life cycle to see how the animal lives, and dies, and becomes the food on your plate, you have to rely on someone like Pollan to take that trip for you, document his findings, and present it as he does here. I've read about food my entire life and tried to keep up on healthy eating without succumbing to fads, but I've never encountered such an intelligent, entertaining, and practical guide to the state of food in America today as The Omnivore's Dilemma. Read it and eat. "
197,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36341-c,5,"Pollan's book is not just a fascinating look at the modern state and evolution of our industrial food complex; it's not merely an anthropological investigation of the history of eating and cultural rituals; it's more than a scientific discourse of the biological nature of corn, small farm ecosystems, and fungi -- it's also, surprisingly, a page turner. When I was finished, I wanted the book to be twice as long.The book is also not (as many people seem to think) a political screed or manifesto -- Pollan isn't necessarily telling everyone to stop eating industrial food and switch to local, small farm food, as he acknowledges how impractical such a course of action actually is. Rather, he investigates our relationships with food, both personal and societal, scientific and ethical. He does find the industrial complex distasteful and disturbing and the small, sustainable farm he visits ideal but (and perhaps this is the choir appreciating the sermon) those conclusions seem inescapable.This book didn't change any of my ideas about eating, as I already try to eat locally and avoid processed food, but I learned a lot about the nature of food, from how terrifyingly omnipresent corn is to the amazingly complex ecosystem of a farm. It's one of those books that you constantly put down so you can turn to someone and say ""Oh my god, did you know that . . . """

I have read many nonfiction books, but nothing was so personal as this investigation on where our food comes from. Pollan sets put to investigate four markedly different food chains, and ends up having to revise his world view, and acquire new friends in search for a profound understanding of food, nature, and humanity.I have finished this on Feb 28, 2019. I will write a longer review when I collect my thoughts. There is plenty of food for thought (pardon the pun... did not intend it but hey, it fits.)"

I'm relieved to admit that I was mistaken - in fact, it's one of the most thought-provoking books I've read this year. It's helped me to fully flesh out some apprehensions I had which I'd never actually put into words, such as 'Is organic really about chemical paranoia?' 'What's the environmental impact of mindlessly shipping food all over the continent?' 'How in the world does that even make sense economically?' Okay, that last one I had actually wondered about, more than once. I used to have a long commute.The Omnivore's Dilemma is also less location specific than Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal, which was a plus for me. I love reading about American lifestyles and behaviors (it's the whole deep-down-i-know-we're-next thing), but most of the industrial talk doesn't really apply to me. Pollan did a great job of giving a panoramic view of all the different approaches to eating in the first world, that's true. But mostly, it was his naturalist's view of things that made his discourse universal and relatable for me.Also, I've realized I have some very strong and mostly unfair prejudices against hunters. A book that manages to make me change my mind on a particular subject* is a book that deserves 5 stars. Shame on me.What else? Oh, apparently now I find ecology fascinating, which poses a new TBR list control challenge. F****ck.*while quoting a lot of Ortega y Gasset, I might add. Ortega FTW!! I went through an Ortega phase when I was like 17, so anyone who quotes Ortega to prove a point instantly gets bonus points with me."
200,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,3,"I grew up on a farm in Michigan where we grew corn and soybeans. The years when we rotated our crops to grow field corn, it was harvested to feed the chickens at the local egg farm. Thus I have some first hand experience with the first few chapters of the Omnivore’s Dilemma and the chapter on the farm rang especially true for me.This book is popular and enough time has passed that it probably qualifies as a classic and is certainly worth a read. It is a honest portrayal by a professor on the modern US food web highlighting many of the problems of our modern omnivore society spanning the spectrum from steroids to animal ethics. There were four chapters that I would consider as excellent: The Farm, The Feedlot, Grass and the Forager. The other twenty chapters were ok.I had no issue with the messaging of the book and wholly agree that it is important to understand where our modern food comes from. I will admit that I promptly ate organic vegetarian for my next meal after finishing the book as there are a few unpleasant facts associated with meat processing. I am sure I will become a carnivore again by tomorrow.I did have a few problems with the construction of the book however.1. At times it strayed from the science and empirical observations to become a little too professorial or perhaps too philosophical. This choice was understandable but gave me a meh kind of feeling.2. At times the book was a bit boring, although there were some intriguing chapters mixed throughout the book.3. I did not like most of the chapter titles such as Slaughter is a Glass Abattoir. Keep it simple like Cows, Corn, Chickens, Grass and the messaging of the chapter would resonate more.I rate the book at 3.5 stars."
201,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66672731-michael-jandrok,4,"I have always been interested in food culture, though I would have never considered myself to be a “foodie” in the strictest sense. That term always carried a bit of hipster baggage to my mind. I would tend to picture modern U.S. food culture as a sort of hummus-slathered menu dominated by low-fat recipes meant to reflect the popular diet trends of the day. Those attitudes began to change for me when I was diagnosed with cancer. Suddenly food became a big deal for me, first as something that I actively avoided as my appetite dwindled and my daily routine ran to getting as many calories in my body as I could, regardless of the delivery system. As someone living with colorectal cancer, food was a tough sell for me as the disease progressed. My tastes changed and most foods that I used to love became alien to me. But a funny thing happened as my treatment started to take hold and my appetite slowly began to return. I began to consciously embrace “foodie” culture with an eye towards expanding my palate and eating healthier. A big part of this ongoing effort has been educating myself on what would be the “right” things to eat given that I had a disease that directly affected my tastes and digestive functions. I didn’t want specific “diet” books, per se. What I wanted and needed was comprehensive information on what constitutes food itself, with an eye towards the science and sociology of developing better food habits and cooking techniques. Before my disease took hold, I was a 5’5”, 165 pound ball of muscle and muffin top, still trying to fit into size 34 jeans. At the peak of the cancer, when I was at my lowest point physically, I was 106 pounds and looked like a shell of my former self. After a year and a half of treatment, I am back up to 140 pounds, due in large part to eating better and making more informed choices as to the food that I put into my body. I can thank books like “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” for giving me a respectable knowledge base to make those wise culinary decisions. Author Michael Pollan has been writing about food for many years now. This book was originally published in 2006 and was one of his earlier efforts at culinary writing. The material has aged well. I do think that we have become a bit smarter as a food culture in the intervening years, but the basic information presented here is still valid and useful. I will take a moment here to caution prospective readers that Pollan’s visit to a large-scale feedlot and the rendering plant is graphic and somewhat disturbing. One can’t read these sections and not begin to question what it means to consume beef. The premise of the text is pretty simple and the nature of the ""omnivore's dilemma"" can be summed up quite nicely: as creatures that can eat virtually anything, the big question can be defined as ""what SHOULD we eat?” Pollan sets out to find the answer to this question by tracing 4 meals back to their sources. IN the course of the book he dissects a fast food meal, a store-bought organic entree, a ""beyond organic"" meal produced entirely at a polyculture farm, and a meal that he hunts and gathers (almost) entirely by himself. Along the way, he asks the reader to join him in his quest for a more thorough knowledge of the food that we eat and a better understanding of how the decisions that we make as food consumers help to shape our cultural and physical landscape.This is an intensely interesting book, and an important addition to the bookshelf for anyone interested in becoming more ""food-aware"". Pollan's journey is always engaging, sometimes spiritual (""we are what we eat…."" takes on a new dimension when one stops to look at it with this much depth), and occasionally frightening. He is always respectful of his cast of characters, and he is willing to challenge his own preconceptions and ideas as he gathers knowledge and experience. Note that there are no recipes to be found within these pages, nor any specific information on the art of cooking. This is a book that is fully invested in talking about food as a consumer product; what it is, where it comes from, and what the impacts and implications are when you decide to make a food consumption choice.Michael Pollan strikes me as a fairly engaging and nice guy. I’d like to sit down to a meal with him and talk shop. I learned a lot from this book that I can actively put into practice as I seek to modify my eating habits with an eye towards maximum health benefits. Along with that I gained some ways to make more responsible choices as a food consumer, and that’s just as important as the health angle for me. I’ll be seeking out more of Pollan’s food writing.Coda #1: After reading a number of reviews for this book, I can honestly say that this is a pretty polarizing piece of writing. A substantial number of vegetarians and vegans panned the book because of its acceptance of what Pollan would call “responsible” meat consumption. And there is no doubt that the author does indeed support the idea that eating meat can be done in an ethical fashion. I won’t rehash the arguments in the reviews here. Having a background in anthropology I can tell you that from a biological perspective humans have absolutely evolved as omnivores. Those canine teeth in your mouth didn’t appear because primates had an exclusively vegetarian diet, they are there specifically for the catching of prey and the tearing of meat. That said, we would do well as a species to eat a lot LESS meat, and there is no denying the environmental damage that is done by widespread meat consumption. Coda #2: That idea of responsible meat consumption is central to Pollan’s ideas. But it’s larger than just meat. The whole idea here is to gain a more thorough understanding of where our food comes from and from there develop better and more responsible food habits. Modern supermarket culture has taken away a lot of the basic knowledge of food...where it comes from, how it is grown or raised, etc. Pollan states outright that we would all be better off if we once again gained a real connection to our food, one that goes well beyond opening a can or a package and dropping something into a pot to warm it up. That concept alone makes “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” valuable and worthwhile.Coda #3: Another criticism of the book centered on Pollan himself, and the idea that the concepts in “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” can only be absorbed and put into action by an affluent audience. I’m not really sure I buy this argument. It’s true that “foodie” culture seems to have a footprint squarely in a sort of urban-hipster vibe, but the fact is that lower-income folks can put any of the ideas in this book into action just the same as any other demographic. In point, much has been made in the news lately of the current regime’s idea to hand out “food boxes” in place of letting assistance recipients make their own food choices. That would mean a direct impact on the farmer’s markets who accept assistance payments. That tells me that plenty of lower-income people have learned how to make healthy and ethical culinary choices that stretch their food dollars to the max. "

204,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/693262-huyen,5," If i could think of this book as a meal, then indeed Michael Pollan is a marvelous cook. He writes well, vividly and convincingly.As dense and informative as it is, the book doesn't make me feel bloated, but nourished :] I can't remember the last time I have discussed a book so many times, with so many different people. Chapter 17 on the ethics of eating animals is just mind-blowing and alone can make this book a worthwhile read.i can't resist talking about it before anything else. I've tried to become a vegetarian a couple of times and have always eventually lapsed back into eating meat. The main reason I would ever become a vegetarian is environmental, the huge amount of energy expended in producing and preserving meat. I've always found the ethics of eating meat hard to defend on the moral basis. And it's fascinating to see a person do it convincingly like Pollan. Pollan starst with Peter Singer's argument against eating meat. A wonderfully simple but powerful idea: ""if possessing a higher degree of intelligence does not entitle one human to use another for his or her own ends, how can it entitle humans to exploit non-humans for the same purpose?"". Leaving aside the problematic question of how we define animal ""intelligence"", there is no debate as to whether animals can suffer. And if we have extended equal rights to women, minorities, homosexuals, should we and why don't we extend these rights to other species? ouch. most people, like me, when faced with this question and thinking about it seriously, either look away or become vegetarians. it is difficult to reconcile our instincts to eat meat and the moral implications of it. but Pollan shows us that those are not the only two alternatives.He argues that while animals rightists have always stressed the suffering of animals due to our meat eating habits (although we have rather slim evidence of exactly what goes on in the brain of a pig about to go to heaven, (or hell?)), they have also failed to acknowledge that humans are capable of giving animals a decent and happy life. and ""happy"" in this case means the ability to do what they would naturally do, either pigs rooting around in the dirt, or cows wandering on pastures. ""to think of domestication as a form of slavery or even exploitation is to miscontrue that whole relationship-to project a human idea or power onto what is in fact an example of mutualism or symbiosis between species."" as he points out, domestication is an evolutionary development. domesticated animals have a much higher chance of surviving than in the wild, compare dogs and wolves for example. they therefore evolve to serve human benefits, winning our favor, in order to be provided with shelter and protection. they probably don't like being killed very much, but if that gives them a longer life and a much better chance to spread their genes to the next generation, they would much rather be with us than be in nature. ""predation is not a matter of morality or of politics, it, too, is a matter of symbiosis. from the point of view of the individual prey animal predation is a horror, but from the point of view of the group-and of its gene pool-it is indispensable."" That is exactly the point that most animals rightists miss. they concern only with individuals, but nature doesn't work that way, no matter how cruel that might sound. nature is about maximizing the survival of the whole species. our morals were developed to help us function as a healthy, cooperative society, but it is rather irrelevant to what should happen in nature.Pollan charges that this very embraced and apparently self-righteous ""ideology"" is a product of an urban society which has lost touch with nature. A friend of mine told me that he took his children to a slaughterhouse to see how pigs are killed because he believes that if we want to eat meat, we should be able to face the morality involved in it. that, i think, is a respectable viewpoint. the children were slightly disturbed but it didn't stop them eating meat. this father is probably an exception in our society. most of us probably have never raised a cow and seen a cow. our meat comes from nice little packages that never remind us of that it comes from something that used to have a brain and can suffer. when i asked my NZ friends why people no longer eat animal organs, like we do in Vietnam, they stared at me with disturbed looks. but really, when you think about it, offal is very nutritious, and there's little reason why we can accept eating meat, but not kidney, heart, or brain. i suspect the reason is the viscera brings home to us the fact that what we are eating used to be quite similar to us, which means, having eyes, lungs, heart. and we are so scared to face that reality that we get rid of it altogether. the second reason is that once the meat production process is out of sight, we have lost the traditional rituals justifying the act of killing and governing the slaughter of animals. the disappearance of these old practices gives way to the brutalization of animals to the extent that the animals become so sick that we have pretty much run out of anti-biotics.but that is not the same as to say that we can eat meat carefree without any moral consideration. given the fact that our food chain has become increasingly industrialized and heavily dependent on fossil fuels, we do have a moral obligation to care about the health of nature, i.e, the condition of the soil, the health of the animals we eat, the impact of animal farming on the environment. I can't agree more with him that while we don't need or arguably shouldn't give up our meat consumption, we should at least make sure that the way we eat is sustainable and the animals we eat are treated decently. the way that animals are treated in most farms is quite despicable. and i bet that if we had a chance to look at it, most would quite happily choose to be vegetarian. giving animals a humane treatment does not only give us a clear conscience but really serves our benefits as well. who would not want to eat a healthy chicken instead of a disease-ridden one? recently, when a documentary about the treatment of pigs in battery farms in NZ was broadcast on TV, the public displayed outrage at what they saw and have pushed quite vigorously for legislation prohibiting cruel treatment of farm animals  see here. i don't know of progress elsewhere. i like the idea that once the public know about what's happening to what they eat, they can make a difference.most of the rest of the book deals with corn and how our (meaning American) food chain has been reduced to a monoculture of soy and corn. they are present in something like 75% of the processed food products on the market. 40% of the calories a Mexican eats comes from food. if you think that's quite astonishing, then apparently American have overtaken Mexicans to be kings of walking corns. corn became the winner in the competition to be human's favorite crop because of its capacity to store a lot more calories than other species. the invention of fertilizers (interestingly made widely available by the surplus ammonium nitrate after the war) made growing corn so incredibly efficient that corn gradually replaced all other crops. and in the 1950s, feeding cattle on feedlots was cheaper than on grass, enabling the farmers to build massive chicken factories. livestock farmers went out of business because they couldn't compete with giant factories. fertilizer was a mixed blessing because the soil fertility shifted from reliance on the sun and a careful rotation of crops, to fossil fuels. we might like to think that fertilizers make agriculture a lot more efficient, but in fact, we expend twice as much energy to produce corn than when we relied on nature. and that's not to mention the huge cost of environmental pollution.when corn got cheaper and cheaper, the Nixon government stepped in to subsidize it, encouraging growing even more corn of lower nutritional quality and sparking the beginning of agribusiness. the excess corn finds its way into most processed energy-dense foods and feeding livestock. getting rid of this huge amount of excess energy contributes to obesity and an impoverished food culture. it makes good economic sense to dump excess corn on cattle, but biologically, they evolved to eat grass, and being forced to eat something they are not supposed to eat has caused grave problems. in a shit hole with piles of waste, polluted air and water and no space to even wiggle their tails, the only way these cows can survive is to swallow humongous amounts of anti-biotics. that sounds quite depressing, but the organic industry doesn't really hold a torch toward a moral utopia as we would hope. Pollan points out that the organic industry has diverged exponentially from its original ideals in the 1960s, and is now not so much better than the establishment. they consume a huge amount of energy to transport their products across the country, most ""free range"" farms mean that the chicken has a palm-sized window to look at the sun 5 minutes a day. real organic farmers have a hard time to get their products on the market because of government regulations. to me it seems like America's unsustainable food consumption is perpetuated by a cycle of ignorance and government intervention. so much for laissez-faire capitalism. growing so much corn might seem to make good economic sense. we must admit that it's quite remarkable that this is the first time in human history, we can produce food so cheaply and so abundantly. but this is the thing that has always not sat right with me about economics. that it hides all the expensive external costs involved in the process: environmental degradation, costs to the government in terms of subsidies, a huge consumption of fossil fuels, public health and malnourishment. so in fact, eating cheap corn is very expensive. so the key question is WHY is America doing all these things that defy logic? to summarize the whole story in one word, I'd say efficiency. feeding corn to livestock is so much cheaper and easier than grass (don't have to wait for grass to grow). and it supports a legion of other industries: the chemical and biotech industries, the food industry, the oil industry, pharma, agribusiness. If we keep in mind that hunter-gathers didn't become agriculturists out of choice, but because they depleted the animals they were hunting, it makes me worry what will happen to us when we deplete our soil and degrade our environment so the same disastrous extent. the food price riots in 2007/8 give us a glance at how depressing such a world would be.but this book isn't just depressing, it's enlightening and inspiring. it shows us that there ARE alternatives to the status quo: eat local, subscribe to a farm you know, and as he says in ""In defense of food"", then simply ""eat food, not too much, mostly plants"". I find Michael Pollan a remarkable writer, very humble and articulate. I can't recommend this book too highly."
205,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,5,"We are a notably unhealthy people obsessed by the idea of eating healthily (p. 3).Michael Pollan's Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals is a critique of industrial farms: they raise animals shoulder to shoulder standing in their own manure, feeding them foods that they are not designed for and which make them ill, and then use chemicals to compensate for these sins. Who knew that we are corn-eaters – not directly, like Mexicans, but through our cattle and chickens, and in processed foods.“When you look at the isotope ratios,.. we North Americans look like corn chips with legs.” Compared to us, Mexicans today consume a far more varied carbon diet: the animals they eat still eat grass (until recently, Mexicans regarded feeding corn to livestock as a sacrilege); much of their protein comes from legumes; and they still sweeten their beverages with cane sugar."" (p. 23)Pollan looks at industrial and pastoral farms, briefly flirts with being a vegetarian, then becomes a hunter/gatherer. He doesn't ""look"" the way I would, but goes out in the field, visiting and working farms, learning to hunt (and kill), and to gather wild mushrooms. Each major step on his journey is punctuated with a meal.Our typical, industrial farm, Pollan argues, is not healthy for us (making us obese), not healthy for the animals (making them ill), and not healthy for the soil and environment (using vast amounts of oil to raise food in a monoculture). He may something good about this kind of farming, but I've forgotten it. This farming is good for conglomerates – making them rich – but not farmers or consumers.His week on Joel Salatin's pastoral farm is fascinating – even for me, a vegetarian of more than 40 years. Salatin is a libertarian, deeply suspicious of government and governmental intervention. However, hw is a scientist's kind of farmer. He recognizes that everything is connected, so considers how to balance the activity and placement of cattle, chickens, pigs, and trees, each entering an environmental niche at a time that makes sense for the animals and farm, keeping all healthy while being largely chemical-free. As Salatin argues:""Society is not bearing the cost of water pollution, of antibiotic resistance, of food-borne illnesses, of crop subsidies, of subsidized oil and water—of all the hidden costs to the environment and the taxpayer that make cheap food seem cheap. No thinking person will tell you they don’t care about all that. I tell them the choice is simple: You can buy honestly priced food or you can buy irresponsibly priced food.” (p. 243)Finally, Omnivore's Dilemma is an ode to mindful, grounded eating, praising the food from Salatin's farm, but also that hunted and gathered in Sonoma and the Bay Area of California. He drools not just as be eats, but as he prepares to do so (although some of what he must do brings him close to losing his lunch), For Pollan, a meal that is eaten in full consciousness of what it took to make it is worth preparing every now and again, if only as a way to remind us of the true costs of the things we take for granted (pp. 409-410). He ends up in favor of locally-grown and harvested foods, foods with few chemicals, foods where we own the costs of eating.Pollan convinces me – not to eat cow, as some parts of Omnivore's Dilemma would be well-served with Sinclair Lewis's The Jungle. He does convince me to invest in local farms. I had been considering dropping my CSA membership in favor of the farmer's market, but decided against this so I support local farmers (mine is a cooperative of 12 Amish farms and includes a handwritten letter by one farmer each week). We have been decreasing our consumption of processed foods, but Omnivore's Dilemma will likely speed up this process. And, I will hesitate – I can't promise more – the next time I am looking at vegetables from half-way around the world.As Claude Lévi-Strauss argued, food must be “not only good to eat, but also good to think” (quoted on p. 289). Pollan's food-writing is thoughtful, and I enjoyed Omnivore's Dilemma as much for the writing as the content. And, he is dryly humorous.Pollan clears Lévi-Strauss's bar."
206,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/394959-susan,2,"While I read this book, I couldn't help but think about the muckrakers of the early 20th century. This book is pretty much nothing like The Jungle, starting with the fact that it is nonfiction, but its goal isn't that far away. It's telling a story about a part of our food industry that we don't normally think to ask about and painting a picture that should make us angry enough to do something about it.And don't get me wrong, Pollan rakes a lot of really good muck. Mostly it's his interpretation of his muck that doesn't work for me.I think the really important information comes in the first half of the book. Pollan gives us a crash course in agriculture subsidies. He compares our currently corn-focused subsidy structure to historic subsidies that were geared toward a broader spectrum of food. Then he goes into detail about what it means to live in a food chain that is designed to produce the most corn at the cheapest price. The answer? Corn is essentially in every processed food we eat. Meanwhile, corn farmers can barely keep their farms afloat because the price has been pushed down so far that they can barely produce enough product to cover their mortgages, and they dump so much fertilizer onto their fields to raise production that it ends up leeching into the water supply all the way to the ocean.Pollan then takes the corn story to the cattle industry and gives us a pretty ugly picture of what it means to raise corn-fed cattle. We thought that corn-fed cattle were a good thing, right? It's advertised on the stickers on our steaks. Except that cow biology rejects corn. The resulting situation not only makes the lives of the cows highly questionable at best, but it presents some very real health concerns for we the consumers.Buying organic fixes the problem, right? Wrong. Large-scale organic produce and livestock may not be what you think they are. Think your chickens are free-range? That just means they need to have access to the outdoors, which they are trained never to use. Corporate organic livestock is raised in environments little better than its non-organic counterpart, and they're probably fed corn too.OTOH, Pollock's story actually made me more positive about organic produce. One thing that organic regulations do accomplish is requiring a use of fertilizer that is not nearly so destructive to the environment.All of this stuff is good stuff to know. In fact, I'd like to look for some other sources of this information so I deepen my knowledge and cross-check Pollan. The place where he loses me is in his interpretation.This book got a lot of people justifiably riled up about the quality of their food and the state of their food production. And where does Pollan direct them? To back yard gardens and small family farming operations. In large part from this book, the bourgeois Localvore movement sprang up. So if you have enough money to pay twice the price for your food or the free time to produce it yourself, then you can have the satisfaction of opting out of the flawed food chain while leaving it essentially unimproved. A whole new luxury food industry has grown up to provide local food to the Localvores. Meanwhile, the corn subsidies and all their consequences continue unabated.The problem as I see it is that Pollan wraps up aesthetics with his practicality. Aesthetically, he is drawn to family farms where there are a lot more workers per square acre, a larger variety of produce and livestock are produced, and resources are used in a way he perceives as more efficient. The problem is that these qualities might make him feel good, but they don't actually address most of the problems he brought up in his muckraking. One of the sections that got my goat most was a several-page indictment of Value Added. You see, when companies make breakfast cereal, they take corn, puff it up, color it, put sugar on it, and (gasp) sell it for more than the price of the corn! The horrors of those corporate money grubbers!Look. Value Added is a core economic concept. I don't suppose Pollan expected people to pay the same amount for his book as the cost of the wood pulp used to make the paper. I suppose he wanted to be paid more for writing it than the cost of the computer he composed it on. And what's his solution to paying for overpriced processed corn? To pay more for food that comes from the right farm. So which Value Added is legitimate and which one isn't? It seems to me that food production needs four core traits. It needs to be: - Responsible: Producing it doesn't destroy the land, the water supply, or the consumers. - Plentiful: There's enough produced to feed everyone. - Reliable: Every weather fluctuation doesn't put us in danger of a shortage or a famine. - Cheap: Affordable to as many people as possible who need to eat.Pollan really only addresses the first of these four issues, and that in an incomplete manner. His solutions pretty much stomp on Plentiful and Cheap. Back yard gardens and family farms are not going to be able to produce enough food to feed a majority of Americans, no matter what they are willing to pay. It's really too bad that we couldn't have directed a lot more of this food production anger toward agricultural subsidy reform instead."
207,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/165589-gwen,3,"The first section of the book, in which Pollan follows the path of corn through the industrial food chain and discusses the effects of corn on our diets, supermarkets, and the environment, is fascinating. Despite being trained in the sociology of agriculture and specifically in the analysis of commodity chains, I learned a lot and found few details to quibble with (the main exception being his tendency to anthropomorphize corn, discussing it as though it intentionally chose to evolve in certain ways). If I were teaching a class on food, I would totally assign that section of the book.The second section of the book is also good, though not as great as the first. Probably this is because I already knew that ""organic"" and ""sustainable"" are not the same and that Horizon-brand organic dairy products come from huge dairies that, from the point of view of the cow, the quality of the milk, and the environment, are little better than regular non-organic ones.But the final section is really annoying me. Most of the things that are irritating me are much more clearly discussed at http://www.powells.com/review/2007_08..., but there were a few other things as well. Pollan keeps talking about how only omnivores have any trouble deciding what to eat, using koalas and cows as examples of animals that, being specialists, don't need to worry about whether something is an acceptable food source or not. Anyone who raises cows will tell you he's highly underestimating cows' experimentation with non-grass foods. They eat weeds and poisonous plants; they get nails and wire and bones stuck in their throats. It's a pain in the ass to have to try to remove a deer vertebra some cow has managed to lodge in her throat. I suppose this seems like a minor detail, except his entire argument is that humans (and other omnivores) are unique in facing problems deciding what is and isn't safe to eat.Connected to that is Pollan's reference to ""human nature"" from time to time, something that drives me nuts when my students do it and is even more exasperating from someone who at least ostensibly has the intellectual capacity and training to not fall back on such a simplistic explanation (that is, ""humans do it, therefore it's human nature""). He seems to buy in to the popular conception that there's a ""human nature"" that we've just smeared a little civilization and culture on top of (think of frosting on a cake).I don't think I can finish the book--I'm increasingly irritated by his tone and the problems with his argument. It's too bad, because the book really did start off well."
208,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20495277-anny,4,"Truly an eye-opener! I absolutely loved the first part of the book about the industrial agriculture. I would've never thought that our humble 'corn' is actually the tyrant of mono-culture farming. Farmers went broke, took a huge debt, taking side jobs driving trailers and depended on their wife salary for the sake of planting corn. Animals (cow, pig, chicken) got ousted from the farm and pasture and cramped into CAFO a.k.a. concentration camp for animals, where they live their short miserable life. First, they were fed food (corn or dubious meat-by-product or whatever cheapest feed available) that is making them sick and making us who eat them sick (mad cows anyone?). Second, they were cramped as much as physically possible, resulting in stressed, depressed, and psychotic animals (often resorting to self-mutilation or cannibalism). Third, they were doused with much antibiotics and medications (because their living conditions made them sick) and hormones and whatnot (to fatten them as much as possible) with who knows what side-effects that might cause for us (antibiotic-resistant bacteria for example).Taking the stand against industrial agriculture were small farms, like Polyface farm owned by Joel Salatin. If CAFO were hell for animals, then Polyface farm must be its heaven. There were so many good things about this farm, suffice to say, if I could buy from there (or any other place that practice sustainable agriculture), I would certainly do so. The last part of the book about hunting and gathering was the part that I liked the least. Too many pages rambling on and on about the ethics of killing animals. It's a weak finish, but the first two parts of the book was definitely worth reading!"
209,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/327527-missy-jean,5,"I can say without hesitation that this is a life-changing book. It's elegantly written and unflinching. Pollan is honest about his own cognitive dissonance about being an omnivore, which means he never sounds self-righteous (an impressive feat for the genre). And I love the widespread anthropomorphism of the book, the mysticism that Pollan is willing to embrace as he cites scientific sources.That said... Halfway through the book I was so depressed that I went home and ate graham crackers dipped in a can of chocolate frosting. All I could think was, so there's no choice! I am going to eat chemicals and toxins and animal byproducts unwittingly every day of my life, and they are going to kill me in the end! By the end of the book, though, I felt like I had a real sense of small measures that I can take to eat in a healthier and more environmentally responsible way. So I went to the farmstand and bought a big old pile of locally-grown buttercup squash, peaches, chard and zucchini. Better than synthetic frosting, right?I think there are a lot of different conclusions that people can draw from this book, and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who wants to be more mindful about what they eat. For me, it validated my penchant for vegetarianism (and my habitual eschewing of McDonalds), but you might get something slightly different from it. (Pollan is not a vegetarian.) Honestly, I don't think I'll ever look at my plate in quite the same way again, and I feel grateful for that."
210,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82365956-veronica,4,"""Yet there are other images of animals on other kinds of farms that contradict the nightmare ones. I'm thinking of the hens I saw at Polyface Farm, fanning out over the cow pasture on a June morning, pecking at the cowpats and the grass...or the image of pig happiness I witnessed in that cattle barn in March, watching the hogs, all upturned pink hams and corkscrew tails, nosing their way through that deep cake of compost in search of alcoholic morsels of corn. It is true that farms like this are but a speck on the monolith of modern animal agriculture, yet their very existence, and the possibility that implies, throws the whole argument for animal rights into a different light."" Pollan knows that the so-called happiness at Polyface Farm could never be scaled to a magnitude sufficient to feed the many required. ""To many animal people even Polyface Farm is a 'death camp'—a way station for doomed creatures awaiting their date with the executioner. But to look at the lives of these animals is to see this holocaust analogy for the sentimental conceit it really is. In the same way we can probably recognize animal suffering when we see it, animal happiness is unmistakable, too, and during my week on the farm I saw it in abundance.""I will permit the possibility of brief animal happiness on a small farm right before the slaughter. Still, the inconvenient reality is that human agriculture contravenes the natural order of predation because we are the only creatures that bring animals into existence in order to slaughter them. The lion does not raise and propagate zebras in a nested enclosure indefinitely and delight in creating more and more efficient ways of slaughtering their offspring. This apparently small detail is conveniently left out in arguments from nature, as I will call them. ""To think of domestication as a form of slavery or even exploitation is to misconstrue that whole relationship—to project a human idea of power onto what is in fact an example of mutualism or symbiosis, rather than a political, development. The animals grew tame and lost their ability to fend for themselves in the wild and the humans traded hunter-gatherer ways for the settled lives of agriculturists. Humans changed biologically, too.""Don't equate the domestication of wolves to the slaughter of chicks. Red herring fallacy. ""[This] is where the animal rightists betray a deep ignorance about the workings of nature."" Again, there is nothing natural about industrial agriculture. ""The very existence of predation in nature, of animals eating animals, is the cause of much anguished hand-wringing in the animal rights literature. 'It must be admitted,' Peter Singer writes, 'that the existence of carnivorous animals does pose one problems for the ethics of Animal Liberation, and that is whether we should do anything about it.' (Talk about the need for peacekeeping forces!)""On the one hand, this made me laugh a bit because I've always been disturbed by the existence of predation in the wild. That many creatures rely on the pain and suffering of other animals in order to live is but a testament to the fallen state of the world, which is also why Jupiter is a purer and superior planet to Earth. But I digress. (My sister has christened this Jupiter propaganda🪐, which I readily admit.)In any event, I've already unravelled this false equivalency between natural predation and the very systematic multiplication of animals bred for the slaughter, season after season. From doom to dust.""Today, the organic food industry finds itself in a most unexpected, uncomfortable, and yes, unsustainable position: floating on a sinking sea of petroleum.""""U.S. agricultural policy, like the Declaration of Independence, is founded on the principle that all carrots are created equal, even though there's good reason to believe this isn't really true.""Birds can't get access to the outdoors until at least 5 weeks old and are slaughtered at 7, so ""free range turns out to be not so much a lifestyle for these chickens as a two-week vacation option.""""From the moment an organic lettuce plant is ready for harvest, the rest of its journey from field to produce aisle follows a swift and often ingenious industrial logic that is only nominally organic.""The fact that steer are given numbers as names makes Holocaust comparisons all too facile...""The farmers desperate to boost yield end up degrading their land, plowing and planting marginal land, applying more nitrogen—anything to squeeze a few more bushels from the soil.""""Nor would such a culture be shocked to discover that there are other countries, such as Italy and France, that decide their dinner questions on the basis of such quaint and unscientific criteria as pleasure and tradition, eat all manner of 'unhealthy' foods, and, lo and behold, wind up actually healthier and happier in their eating than we are. We show our surprise at this by speaking of something called the 'French paradox,' for how could a people who eat such demonstrably toxic substance as foie gras and triple crème cheese actually be slimmer and healthier than we are? Yet I wonder if it doesn't make more sense to speak in terms of an American paradox—that is, a notably unhealthy people obsessed by the idea of eating heathily."""
211,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73483095-cynnamon,0,"I bought this book, because I had thouroughly enjoyed Michael Pollans ""Cooking"".But here I give up.I have read around 100 pages about corn. I learned a lot I didn't know before, but unfortunately I didn't care about my newly acquired knowledge.Also the book is completely US-centric, which makes it for me as an European not quite so interesting.This book is outside of my scope of interest, therefore I refrain from assigning a rating."
212,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,5,"I really like Pollan’s writing style, he brings points home with simplicity, and he is able to cover a lot of ground without the writing feelings unnecessarily circuitous or blustery. More than that though, I like that he is willing to experience. I mean, that’s the very core of responsible journalism, Pollan goes and works on the farms, he helps slaughter chickens, he sits in tractors, he goes hunting and foraging, he throws himself bodily and emotionally into these experiences, and at each point I felt that he was incredibly honest with both himself and the reader about the impacts of his actions and his emotional state.All in all I thought it was refreshingly non-biased, fair appraising look at industrial agriculture/ranching, industrial/artisanal organic agriculture/ranching, and hunting/foraging. I say that as a person literally smack dab in the middle of row-crop country (my husband and his family farms), as a gardener, and as a hunter. I’ve long had a problem with the way we raise meat in this country, and the lack of connection between people and their food. Its one of the reasons that I do hunt and garden, and its also one of the reasons that I’ve mostly switched to plant proteins for all meals except supper. I am continuing to try and evolve how I eat, and it’s a learning experience and I don’t always get it right (I ate spaghettio’s twice in three days last week, no one’s perfect). But its hard to read this book without examining the role that we eaters have in the natural world. I am going to make a concerted effort to eat in-season vegetables except for those that I froze from my garden in the summer, and I’m going to try and rely on our game meats more. Despite reading much about early life on the prairie, somehow I had never considered that even meat was seasonal, or that foods grown out of season lack the nutrition that we think we are getting. They’re both very “duh” concepts, but its not something that I had really appreciated. Nor had I valued the waste of petroleum in shipping year round under-nourished produce from Argentina to the US just so that we could eat whatever fruit or veggie that we want, despite its lack of flavor.Perhaps the greatest thing that came from this was the conversations with my husband. He listened to the audiobook while in the tractor, and it was great to talk to him when he came home at night about the ways agriculture has changed since Pollan wrote (advances in technology have changed the level of precision for farmers, becoming more environmentally friendly for those that upgrade), but also the ways that it could continue to change. What could we do as eaters, hunters, buyers, and producers in our local community? Books that foster conversation and change always get a 5 out of 5.Absolutely recommend to everyone. Read those food labels. Speak out. We deserve, as buyers, connectivity and information about our food, and animals especially deserve better than what we manage for our convenience."
213,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/307041-ginny-messina,3,"A truly important book by gifted writer and journalist Michael Pollan. It's not without its flaws, however, and for all the promise of the first two-thirds of the book, it kind of leaves the reader hanging at the end. In the first part, Pollan exposes the damaging effects of industrial agriculture, and—-importantly—-this includes large-scale organic production which is not nearly as benign as most people would like to believe. Later in the book he addresses the inhumane aspect of industrial agriculture as well—-organic production included. He puts it succinctly: you look away, or you stop eating meat. In the second part of the book, we see farming as it should be, on Polyface Farm in the Shenandoah Valley. Here, farming practices are closely tied to nature including the natural behavior of farm animals. While the system doesn't adhere completely to organic regulations, it is far more sustainable and humane than industrial organic agriculture and certainly more so than conventional agriculture. Polyface Farm is not able to separate itself from industrial agriculture completely (by law, the steer are killed in conventional slaughterhouses) but it still seems like a very nice place. Unfortunately, the scale on which it operates means that this type of sustainable farming can never produce enough food for the U.S. population. Food from farms like Polyface is likely to be available to only a privileged few. The last part of the book struck me as downright nonsensical. Pollan explores the possibility of putting together the ultimate local meal—-one composed of food that he himself has hunted, gathered and grown. But don't try this at home, he says. It is not at all a realistic way to eat. Well—-no—-not if you do it by gathering chanterelle mushrooms with a bunch of chefs from Chez Panisse, hunting wild boar in the California woods, and diving for abalone along a rocky coast. Granted, most Americans would be hard-pressed to produce their own food, but Pollan doesn't even explore the option in any kind of realistic or meaningful fashion. In the end, it appears that the problems associated with food production are insurmountable. Industrial agriculture provides most of the food in this country and is a wasteful and unsustainable system. But more sustainable systems are not realistic for feeding the population. Pollan does not offer any clear cut answers, much to my surprise. (I didn't expect him to solve the problem; I did expect a little guidance!) But the thoughtful reader can still pull together a plan of action to minimize the environmental and ethical cost of a meal. Reduce intake of animal foods. Buy locally-produced food. Grow or produce as much as is realistic for you. Pollan makes his readers think about where their meals come from and how to measure the true cost of our ""inexpensive"" food. This is a must-read for anyone who expresses a desire to live and eat responsibly. "

I can't really say this book was a waste of my time though because i gained some useful knowledge from it and some parts equally annoyed me but what more can i expect from a book riddled with self righteous prose from an author who writes in a way that sets him up on the ""right"" moral pedestal? This may not have been his intention but i do not care either way. I am just glad i finished it and i hope to never be subjected to the torture of reading a book i have no interest in, for class again. So long and good riddance!"

"
217,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147289-jason-pettus,5,"Journalist Michael Pollan has a reputation for writing books that people don't just like, but whose very lives get permanently changed because of reading them; and I can attest that this exact thing has happened to me after reading my first book of his, the extraordinary 2006 guide to modern food practices known as The Omnivore's Dilemma. In it, Pollan imagines three typical meals a contemporary American might eat -- one of fast food, one of Whole Foods-type groceries, and one literally put together through foraging and hunting -- then over the course of 60,000 words shows us exactly, step by minute step, how the ingredients in each meal can be traced back and back until finally reaching a point of a living plant being grown in the ground somewhere, then building us back forward again by showing exactly what happens to that plant step by step as it makes its way from the farm to eventually our mouths.Along the way, then, Pollan gives us an astute history of the post-war industrial agricultural industry; explains why exactly corn is the overwhelming number-one crop now grown in America; gives us the horrifying reasons that most cattle and chicken have to be fed so many antibiotics in order to merely survive under such harsh industrial conditions; demonstrates why in a middle-class consumerist society these conditions have to happen in the first place (that is, because if cows were still grown in the humane way they were in an agricultural society, a McDonald's hamburger would cost $30, and the American people would riot); shows through personal field trips what exactly the difference is between ""cage-free,"" ""free range"" and ""pastured"" eggs, and why one of these options is infinitely better than the others; details why the term ""organic"" on a food label can mean vastly different things depending on the company and circumstances; and shows through illuminating first-hand experience why we are no longer a hunter-gatherer society (namely, because it's exhausting, inefficient, and makes people run the risk of sometimes going entire weeks at a time without finding anything edible to eat).Easily the most interesting book I've read in a decade, The Omnivore's Dilemma has permanently changed the way I now shop for groceries, knowing as I now do so many more details about what each label on a package means, and how different growing circumstances can often literally mean a difference in the resulting food's nutrition (just for one example, how Pollan scientifically proves here that eggs from chickens that are allowed to roam freely on farmland are literally better for you than eggs grown from chickens kept in cages); and although I haven't completely given up fast food, certainly every hamburger I now buy makes me ponder the indescribably monstrous and cruel circumstances by which that cow lived its life, which has already influenced just how many hamburgers I buy in general. (It also makes me understand a lot better why there will always be people around in any society who are more than happy to perform that society's most inhumane tasks, such as rounding up undocumented immigrants, ripping their children away from them, and throwing them into concentration camps while openly laughing in their faces...but that's neither here nor there, I suppose.) To tell the truth, the only reason I read this in the first place was because I was waiting for the day in early June that Pollan's newest book came out, a 600-page whopper called How to Change Your Mind that looks in exhaustive detail at all the latest 21st-century research into the connections between psychedelic drugs, mindfulness, meditation, mental health, what MRIs can teach us about what we've traditionally called the ""soul,"" and a lot more. That book is now finished too, and was just as fascinating as The Omnivore's Dilemma, so keep an eye out for my write-up of that in another couple of weeks.UPDATE 1: I find it utterly fascinating that the only negative reviews here of this book are from vegetarians, who are so upset at Pollan's conclusion that humans as omnivores are perfectly capable of eating meat, they're willing to dismiss every single other vegetarian-friendly thing he has to say. (Ultimately Pollan is pro-vegetable in this book, despite concluding that meat is indeed an edible substance that humans find edible.) A huge part of this book is all about how the politics of any given age has a huge influence over our opinions on the supposedly ""scientifically objective"" subjects of diet and nutrition, and the vitriolic negative reviews of the book by militant vegetarians here simply proves his point all over again.UPDATE 2: After reading other people's reviews, I agree with something I saw a lot of people mention; that a clear sign of how much I loved this book is that people at Twitter eventually got sick of me constantly tweeting about it while I was reading it. Be prepared to drive your friends and spouse crazy!"

Well, Actually, Eat Sh*t and Flourish. Each of these would have been a more classy title for the book ""Omnivore's Dilemma"". To paraphrase another reviewer 'The dude structures this book by following the path of four finished meals from origin to plate - one McDonald's meal, one comprised of supermarket organic products, one from a ""beyond-organic"" self-sustaining farm in Virginia, and one he forages almost entirely on his own. This book tries to provokes a lot of thought about the origins of our food and the biological, political, social and economic implications of those origins, and for the most part, it is successful.' So after reading this book I realize that maybe, just maybe, I don’t argue with people about food enough. Ever since I read  Fast Food Nation  and watched  Supersize Me  I have been pretty good about avoiding eating at Mc-stablishments and drinking soda. Knowing these efforts aren’t enough, but not having had the ...chutzpah ... to make the leap to full fledged, ""morally superior"" vegetarianism. I am way to lazy to manage an urban garden, -- preferring rather to watch one made on TV OD presents, as a moral alternative to growing, actually hunting and eating wild game. The parts of the book that describe this stuff, although not seemingly not feasible, reinforced these previously formed notions about foraging. Still, it is pretty interesting to see the details fleshed out.One thing discussed in the book that i hadn't internalized, and that makes sense when I think about it, is that going to whole foods and buying an organic Chilean artichoke in the winter can be a lot worse ethically than eating a fat juicy steak from a locally raised mature grass fed cow. I guess that the ethical answer culled from the book on how to shop food in the city is to buy at farmers markets or join one of these CSA’s. Take the extra step and get to know your farmer, know how they grow, know how they feed and treat the animals is the right thing to do. This seems like undue effort and cost but the ethical equivalent seems to be to hunt and dress bloody dead animals or forage for mushrooms in central park. In that perspective, the first options seems like less effort ."

These range from the nearby McDonald's and Burger Kind to the supermarket to the local farmer's stand. Michael Pollan takes a look at four ways to have a meal - one industrial meal at McDonald's, one organic meal from Whole Foods, one local meal from a farmer's field, and one completely ""homemade"" meal made from hunting and foraging.I must say, the first 300 pages are riveting, absolutely enthralling! I kept putting aside fiction to read this book, it was so good! However, when I hit the chapters on hunting and foraging, I found my interest severely waning. I really don't care at all about hunting animals and foraging for mushrooms, so keeping my attention was nearly impossible (this is why I took off a star). But the end picks up as Pollan returns to the final ""perfect"" meal.This book had so much really good information - information that once again cements my desire never to eat food at a fast food restaurant ever again. If one of your New Year's Resolutions is to eat healthier, read this book to bolster that desire!!"

The parts on farming, the evils of monoculture, the importance of grass, were especially enlightening. I don't normally eat beef and I would definitely reduce the intake even more. The most shocking part for me was the 'pastoral organic' revelation. I wonder if the organic products sold in Indonesia as are bad as the greenwashed examples in this book, which are all about the US market. The later parts of the book - hunting and cooking - were not as interesting for me as the earlier parts. Hence the four stars. Still, a fascinating read and highly recommended to everyone."

I support a small flock of happy chickens instead.Lengthy review to come. In the meantime, let me just say---I learned a lot from this book. I also enjoyed some segments very much. I would have done some extensive editing.The final chapter is sublime. OK, my real review:I am a convenience eater. Michael Pollan's work is transforming me into a conscious eater. Two concrete changes in my behavior: I will now pay the price of a fancy mocha coffee beverage for a dozen eggs gathered from happy chickens. I will also see commercially available breaded chicken with a side of corn as corn dressed with corn and a side of corn. I still may eat it, but at least I know what I'm getting!It is my hope that these wonderful books I have been reading indicate an American paradigm shift, and that the marketplace will allow people like me (who don't want to spend the time and effort tracking down purveyers of all sorts of specialty foods) more chances to make conscious choices in a convenient way. I will do my best to make choices that are more healthful for me and our planet regardless.This book was successful in changing my behavior. In large part, it was successful because I was already ripe for changing. Everything from Kingsolver's Animal Vegetable Miracle to Buford's Heat to Van Draanen's sweet young adult novel Flipped has been telling me to embrace these changes. This work built upon that foundation and presented a lot more detailed information supporting the choices that we should all be making. It was well structured, and it needed to be. So much information was packed into each section, it was necessary for me to take breaks. Some peeves---Too many declarative sentences. All declarative sentences put me on guard. (See what I did there?) I read something that says or implies ""all"" and I immediately start casting about defensively for the exceptions. I blame SAT prep. I was also put off by the way in which those declarations seemed designed to make me so defensive, mostly when he seemed dismissive of the travails of gardening, or scornful of the kind of hunter who does not agonize over the creatures' deaths. Second person. I hate second person. Here's a sentence that combined 2 peeves: ""You can forage in the garden, in the way Adam and Eve presumably did, but there isn't much to it: no dilemmas, no hunting stories."" And it's kind of a run on sentence too, now that I look at it, although that (obviously, having read any of my reviews!) isn't such a major irritation for me. (See what I did there?)Rampant anthropomorphism. Corn does not feel happy about taking over the world! Corn does not feel happy! Corn does not feel! This is a Truth. I believe that much of the anthropomorphism here was used as a bit of shorthand, implying all the Darwinian blah blah blah rather than spelling it out, and also trying to fix an image in the mind of the reader, but it is NOT TRUE. It bothers me. (Althoug I do like the image of an army of cornstalks marchng across the landscape, and it truly did stick with me.)LOVED---All descriptions of all meals.All the time spent at the idealized farm. (I forget what it's called and can't be bothered to look it up.)Everything to do with the mushrooms. (I think I'm due to read a book about mushrooms next.)The desription of the first hunt----soooooo true to my one hunting experience, in which I spent every fiber of my being on NOT MAKING ANY NOISE. It was such an intense time, and he captured that beautiully.I feel like there's so much more to say. Suiffice---I enjoyed most of this book. I learned. A lot. "
223,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1242165-schmacko,4,"So much has been written about this book, and so much will be defined by how you feel comfortable when discussing your eating habits. Here are, in short forms, my 10 observations:1)	If you’ve ever wondered how much the American government is responsible for your eating by subsidizing corporations who grow corn and make high fructose corn syrup, this is a book for you! SHORT VERSION: Corn is in EVERYTHING! We committed to growing corn when we could possibly switch to many varied crops. Corn is uniform, so it’s very corporate. If you hate political reading, if you don’t want to know this stuff, or you don’t frankly care, skip Pollan’s book. (Hope you enjoy your diabetes.)2)	Yes, we know organic food is better for us. But Pollan does a great job telling us that the US family’s annual food budget has actually dropped over the last 60 years, so Americans could conceivably spend more on food (and probably less on entertainment) and help out their diets.3)	I thought his section on Whole Foods founder John Mackey was interesting. Mackey completely concedes that he isn’t as radical as he started, that he has basically bought into the American corporate structure in order to take baby steps in supporting a business and helping people eat more healthfully.4)	At times, Pollan sounds a little Communist. At least, anti-Capitalist. I’m ok with that – to each his own – and I believe that American politics is all about constant discourse and adjustment.5)	Knowing the details of a slaughterhouse was a little much for me, but then again, I have no problem killing what I eat. Which makes me unlike 97% of Americans, who like to think their meat comes fully formed in plastic packages.6)	I love how Pollan describes the grey color of a McDonald’s burger. Funny! (I still crave Wendy’s once or twice a month.)7)	Mushroom foraging always sounded like something I wanted to do. Until I read his accounts. Mushroom foragers are crazy, obsessed people!8)	He’s lucky he had help at parts, or Pollan would’ve starved.9)	I like how he concedes that there is a better way to eat meat – that you don’t have to become a militant vegan.10)	I still wish we humans would accept that we are PART of the food chain!!! GRRR! We have canines; we have eaten meat for centuries. Our whole digestive system is built for meat! Lots of animals eat meat. We are not better than other animals that kill; the only thing that could possibly make us better is if we kill as quickly and painlessly as possible. We are the predators, and we should act as such – but with judiciousness and care. When we try to be ABOVE IT ALL – when we manipulate the environment – as Pollan excellently points out – we ruin it. “Dominion” humans create corporate slaughterhouses and run animals to extinction. Vegans treat animals as individuals to be coddled and encouraged to overproduce; soon, we’ll be overrun with deer and pumas and wild boar while we huddle eating berries from the sides of our abandoned roads (vehicles lead to road kill!) We need to accept that humans – like our predator cousins - do kill to survive, that we can be better at it, and that we are not ABOVE the food chain – as meat eaters or vegans – we are part of the system and should act accordingly. (Pollan mentions this, but doesn’t bring it home.)"
224,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260196-peter,5,"I started into this worried it was going to force me into vegetarianism, that I was going to read some passage about calves born into rancid waste, and a blue light somewhere in my brain would turn green and a gag reflex would accompany the thought of meat moving forward....Which speaks either to my penchant for pessimism, or the ominous relationship we have to our food chain, where we _don't_ really want to know how food got there, we just want to eat it.But read the book I did, fearful to encounter that meat-snatching passage within the book. Thankfully, Pollan is not an alarmist, but rather a quite methodical inquisitor about the roots of our food. It sounds kind of..esoteric, but he makes it fascinating, like a great humanities teacher he tells the larger story of food: of why we grow so much fricking corn in America, and how it's bad for almost everyone involved: ourselves, our diet, farmers in other countries.The good thing is that the book never descends into a polemic, unlike Michael Moore's work, Pollan's evenhandedness keeps the reader open to what he is saying. Nothing is extreme or revolutionary or incendiary.I feel like this book will, in the long term, shape the way I think about food by giving me a vocabulary for considering my personal and our cultural relationship to food. He discusses how America as a nation of immigrants never developed a stable national cuisine (unlike France or Italy), and the absence of that makes us vulnerable to an endless array of fad diets (coughAdkinscough) and an overall menu that is out of balance.There is a fascinating chapter on mushrooms and fungi, which details how they are utterly different from plants, and grow from this crazy underground symbiosis with decomposing nutrients and tree roots, taking a single drop of sugar from the tree root in exchange for processed minerals from the soil.There is an extended look at a farm outside Charlottesville--Polyface Farm--which models itself after natural ecosystems and creates this method of rotating cattle and chickens with grass growth cycles to create this wonderful whirlwind of spreadsheets, efficiency, and microdata on growth patterns of grass.To wit: it's better to have grass pasture surrounded by trees, because a blade of grass will burn X calories turning the face of it's blade toward the sun to receive solar energy. Planting forests around removes wind, allowing the grass to grow higher. Brilliant.In the end, it's about food, but it's also about systems in general. It begins to feel like a universal look at the interrelationship of history and commerce, and how everything is this big interconnected fabric, but that you can begin to see some of those connections, and kind of surf those links to great personal and collective gain.12/2007"
225,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1940200-stephanie,4,"It’s not every day you read a book that threatens to change your life. I use the word “threaten” very deliberately, because they are changes that I know I'm going to find challenging.Michael Pollan challenges his readers to examine their food a little closer, to consider where it comes from. And it's a logical request I think. We can spend days searching for the perfect doctor or mechanic, but how much time do we take to really think about our food? Do you know where your steak came from? Is your asparagus from a nearby farm, or far-flung Argentina? Are your peaches organic, and if so, what does that really mean? Most of us have no idea how to answer these questions.In most cases, the answers are simple. Most of our food likely comes from a massive industrial farm or feed-lot hundreds of miles away, fed by incredible amounts of fossil fuels -- the fertilizer, the machines used for harvesting, the trucks it took to transport the food to your local mega-mart, to name just a few uses of fossil fuel. Pollan's descriptions of these farms (and in particular, the feed lots) can be quite disturbing. However, Pollan does not outright condemn this ""industrial food chain."" He concedes that it would be difficult to feed billions of people inexpensively without it. Instead, he advocates having several different avenues for delivering food to our tables, and he describes several alternatives. It is up to the reader to determine how they want to eat. As for me, my eyes have been opened to the appeal of ""eating locally,"" where possible. (Emphasis on ""where possible."" There aren't too many oranges grown in Idaho.) By eating foods produced as close to my home as possible, I support the local economy, less fossil fuels are used, and the food should have fewer preservatives, hormones, and other chemical ingredients. Best of all, the food should be fresher and more flavorful. Yes, it will cost more, but I think it will be worth it. At least I'm willing to try it. Consider it an experiement. I've already found local sources of milk, eggs and meat that I'm going to try. I found Pollan's writing engaging and easy to read. (Disclaimer: I am a huge nerd, and the topic really spoke to me. If you don't like science, you may not find this book as fascinating.) A few words of warning: if evolution makes you uncomfortable, you may not like this book, as it often talks about the evolution of plants, animals and humans. Also, there were two or three instances where objectionable language was used. "
226,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4161947-m-l-rudolph,5,"2006. NY Times Book Review One of the 10 Best Books of the Year. We eat every day of our lives but we don't often give much thought to what we put in our bodies. If we are what we eat, then when it comes to meat, we are what the animal eats; and when it comes to produce, we are what the plant's grown in. There's a food chain that extends around the world and throughout evolutionary history from the beginning of man. Michael Pollan takes us on a tour of that chain and in the process gives any thinking, eating, person a new, often disturbing, view of what he/she consumes.Organized in three sections to illuminate industrial food (corn), pastoral food (grass), and personal food (the forest), Pollan's narrative builds toward meals made as nearly as possible with ingredients and methods from each of these categories.I double-dog-dare anyone to read this book and walk through a modern supermarket without viewing each item of food differently. And if you're like me, take your glasses, because the real information about what we buy and eat is in the small print, written in code, to disguise as much as possible what we truly consume. The central area of the supermarket is processed food. Good luck figuring that out. (When you can't determine the identity of fifteen out of eighteen ingredients on that package of processed whatever - chances are high what you're reading - and eating - are corn derivatives.) Around the walls, where we find the produce, meat, and fish, it would seem that the information describing the food would be more straight-forward. Good luck figuring that out, too. (Chances are every formerly living item was nourished or fertilized with corn or corn derivatives.)Unless you plan to follow a steer or a chicken through its life cycle to see how the animal lives, and dies, and becomes the food on your plate, you have to rely on someone like Pollan to take that trip for you, document his findings, and present it as he does here. I've read about food my entire life and tried to keep up on healthy eating without succumbing to fads, but I've never encountered such an intelligent, entertaining, and practical guide to the state of food in America today as The Omnivore's Dilemma. Read it and eat. "
227,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36341-c,5,"Pollan's book is not just a fascinating look at the modern state and evolution of our industrial food complex; it's not merely an anthropological investigation of the history of eating and cultural rituals; it's more than a scientific discourse of the biological nature of corn, small farm ecosystems, and fungi -- it's also, surprisingly, a page turner. When I was finished, I wanted the book to be twice as long.The book is also not (as many people seem to think) a political screed or manifesto -- Pollan isn't necessarily telling everyone to stop eating industrial food and switch to local, small farm food, as he acknowledges how impractical such a course of action actually is. Rather, he investigates our relationships with food, both personal and societal, scientific and ethical. He does find the industrial complex distasteful and disturbing and the small, sustainable farm he visits ideal but (and perhaps this is the choir appreciating the sermon) those conclusions seem inescapable.This book didn't change any of my ideas about eating, as I already try to eat locally and avoid processed food, but I learned a lot about the nature of food, from how terrifyingly omnipresent corn is to the amazingly complex ecosystem of a farm. It's one of those books that you constantly put down so you can turn to someone and say ""Oh my god, did you know that . . . """
228,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"This book has profoundly changed my view on my food, and subsequently, my world. I have read many nonfiction books, but nothing was so personal as this investigation on where our food comes from. Pollan sets put to investigate four markedly different food chains, and ends up having to revise his world view, and acquire new friends in search for a profound understanding of food, nature, and humanity.I have finished this on Feb 28, 2019. I will write a longer review when I collect my thoughts. There is plenty of food for thought (pardon the pun... did not intend it but hey, it fits.)"
229,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4123952-alasse,5,"I was so scared that this would turn out to be a foodie hipster's rant on what food should be like, instead of what it actually is. I'm relieved to admit that I was mistaken - in fact, it's one of the most thought-provoking books I've read this year. It's helped me to fully flesh out some apprehensions I had which I'd never actually put into words, such as 'Is organic really about chemical paranoia?' 'What's the environmental impact of mindlessly shipping food all over the continent?' 'How in the world does that even make sense economically?' Okay, that last one I had actually wondered about, more than once. I used to have a long commute.The Omnivore's Dilemma is also less location specific than Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal, which was a plus for me. I love reading about American lifestyles and behaviors (it's the whole deep-down-i-know-we're-next thing), but most of the industrial talk doesn't really apply to me. Pollan did a great job of giving a panoramic view of all the different approaches to eating in the first world, that's true. But mostly, it was his naturalist's view of things that made his discourse universal and relatable for me.Also, I've realized I have some very strong and mostly unfair prejudices against hunters. A book that manages to make me change my mind on a particular subject* is a book that deserves 5 stars. Shame on me.What else? Oh, apparently now I find ecology fascinating, which poses a new TBR list control challenge. F****ck.*while quoting a lot of Ortega y Gasset, I might add. Ortega FTW!! I went through an Ortega phase when I was like 17, so anyone who quotes Ortega to prove a point instantly gets bonus points with me."
230,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,3,"I grew up on a farm in Michigan where we grew corn and soybeans. The years when we rotated our crops to grow field corn, it was harvested to feed the chickens at the local egg farm. Thus I have some first hand experience with the first few chapters of the Omnivore’s Dilemma and the chapter on the farm rang especially true for me.This book is popular and enough time has passed that it probably qualifies as a classic and is certainly worth a read. It is a honest portrayal by a professor on the modern US food web highlighting many of the problems of our modern omnivore society spanning the spectrum from steroids to animal ethics. There were four chapters that I would consider as excellent: The Farm, The Feedlot, Grass and the Forager. The other twenty chapters were ok.I had no issue with the messaging of the book and wholly agree that it is important to understand where our modern food comes from. I will admit that I promptly ate organic vegetarian for my next meal after finishing the book as there are a few unpleasant facts associated with meat processing. I am sure I will become a carnivore again by tomorrow.I did have a few problems with the construction of the book however.1. At times it strayed from the science and empirical observations to become a little too professorial or perhaps too philosophical. This choice was understandable but gave me a meh kind of feeling.2. At times the book was a bit boring, although there were some intriguing chapters mixed throughout the book.3. I did not like most of the chapter titles such as Slaughter is a Glass Abattoir. Keep it simple like Cows, Corn, Chickens, Grass and the messaging of the chapter would resonate more.I rate the book at 3.5 stars."
231,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66672731-michael-jandrok,4,"I have always been interested in food culture, though I would have never considered myself to be a “foodie” in the strictest sense. That term always carried a bit of hipster baggage to my mind. I would tend to picture modern U.S. food culture as a sort of hummus-slathered menu dominated by low-fat recipes meant to reflect the popular diet trends of the day. Those attitudes began to change for me when I was diagnosed with cancer. Suddenly food became a big deal for me, first as something that I actively avoided as my appetite dwindled and my daily routine ran to getting as many calories in my body as I could, regardless of the delivery system. As someone living with colorectal cancer, food was a tough sell for me as the disease progressed. My tastes changed and most foods that I used to love became alien to me. But a funny thing happened as my treatment started to take hold and my appetite slowly began to return. I began to consciously embrace “foodie” culture with an eye towards expanding my palate and eating healthier. A big part of this ongoing effort has been educating myself on what would be the “right” things to eat given that I had a disease that directly affected my tastes and digestive functions. I didn’t want specific “diet” books, per se. What I wanted and needed was comprehensive information on what constitutes food itself, with an eye towards the science and sociology of developing better food habits and cooking techniques. Before my disease took hold, I was a 5’5”, 165 pound ball of muscle and muffin top, still trying to fit into size 34 jeans. At the peak of the cancer, when I was at my lowest point physically, I was 106 pounds and looked like a shell of my former self. After a year and a half of treatment, I am back up to 140 pounds, due in large part to eating better and making more informed choices as to the food that I put into my body. I can thank books like “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” for giving me a respectable knowledge base to make those wise culinary decisions. Author Michael Pollan has been writing about food for many years now. This book was originally published in 2006 and was one of his earlier efforts at culinary writing. The material has aged well. I do think that we have become a bit smarter as a food culture in the intervening years, but the basic information presented here is still valid and useful. I will take a moment here to caution prospective readers that Pollan’s visit to a large-scale feedlot and the rendering plant is graphic and somewhat disturbing. One can’t read these sections and not begin to question what it means to consume beef. The premise of the text is pretty simple and the nature of the ""omnivore's dilemma"" can be summed up quite nicely: as creatures that can eat virtually anything, the big question can be defined as ""what SHOULD we eat?” Pollan sets out to find the answer to this question by tracing 4 meals back to their sources. IN the course of the book he dissects a fast food meal, a store-bought organic entree, a ""beyond organic"" meal produced entirely at a polyculture farm, and a meal that he hunts and gathers (almost) entirely by himself. Along the way, he asks the reader to join him in his quest for a more thorough knowledge of the food that we eat and a better understanding of how the decisions that we make as food consumers help to shape our cultural and physical landscape.This is an intensely interesting book, and an important addition to the bookshelf for anyone interested in becoming more ""food-aware"". Pollan's journey is always engaging, sometimes spiritual (""we are what we eat…."" takes on a new dimension when one stops to look at it with this much depth), and occasionally frightening. He is always respectful of his cast of characters, and he is willing to challenge his own preconceptions and ideas as he gathers knowledge and experience. Note that there are no recipes to be found within these pages, nor any specific information on the art of cooking. This is a book that is fully invested in talking about food as a consumer product; what it is, where it comes from, and what the impacts and implications are when you decide to make a food consumption choice.Michael Pollan strikes me as a fairly engaging and nice guy. I’d like to sit down to a meal with him and talk shop. I learned a lot from this book that I can actively put into practice as I seek to modify my eating habits with an eye towards maximum health benefits. Along with that I gained some ways to make more responsible choices as a food consumer, and that’s just as important as the health angle for me. I’ll be seeking out more of Pollan’s food writing.Coda #1: After reading a number of reviews for this book, I can honestly say that this is a pretty polarizing piece of writing. A substantial number of vegetarians and vegans panned the book because of its acceptance of what Pollan would call “responsible” meat consumption. And there is no doubt that the author does indeed support the idea that eating meat can be done in an ethical fashion. I won’t rehash the arguments in the reviews here. Having a background in anthropology I can tell you that from a biological perspective humans have absolutely evolved as omnivores. Those canine teeth in your mouth didn’t appear because primates had an exclusively vegetarian diet, they are there specifically for the catching of prey and the tearing of meat. That said, we would do well as a species to eat a lot LESS meat, and there is no denying the environmental damage that is done by widespread meat consumption. Coda #2: That idea of responsible meat consumption is central to Pollan’s ideas. But it’s larger than just meat. The whole idea here is to gain a more thorough understanding of where our food comes from and from there develop better and more responsible food habits. Modern supermarket culture has taken away a lot of the basic knowledge of food...where it comes from, how it is grown or raised, etc. Pollan states outright that we would all be better off if we once again gained a real connection to our food, one that goes well beyond opening a can or a package and dropping something into a pot to warm it up. That concept alone makes “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” valuable and worthwhile.Coda #3: Another criticism of the book centered on Pollan himself, and the idea that the concepts in “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” can only be absorbed and put into action by an affluent audience. I’m not really sure I buy this argument. It’s true that “foodie” culture seems to have a footprint squarely in a sort of urban-hipster vibe, but the fact is that lower-income folks can put any of the ideas in this book into action just the same as any other demographic. In point, much has been made in the news lately of the current regime’s idea to hand out “food boxes” in place of letting assistance recipients make their own food choices. That would mean a direct impact on the farmer’s markets who accept assistance payments. That tells me that plenty of lower-income people have learned how to make healthy and ethical culinary choices that stretch their food dollars to the max. "

234,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/693262-huyen,5," If i could think of this book as a meal, then indeed Michael Pollan is a marvelous cook. He writes well, vividly and convincingly.As dense and informative as it is, the book doesn't make me feel bloated, but nourished :] I can't remember the last time I have discussed a book so many times, with so many different people. Chapter 17 on the ethics of eating animals is just mind-blowing and alone can make this book a worthwhile read.i can't resist talking about it before anything else. I've tried to become a vegetarian a couple of times and have always eventually lapsed back into eating meat. The main reason I would ever become a vegetarian is environmental, the huge amount of energy expended in producing and preserving meat. I've always found the ethics of eating meat hard to defend on the moral basis. And it's fascinating to see a person do it convincingly like Pollan. Pollan starst with Peter Singer's argument against eating meat. A wonderfully simple but powerful idea: ""if possessing a higher degree of intelligence does not entitle one human to use another for his or her own ends, how can it entitle humans to exploit non-humans for the same purpose?"". Leaving aside the problematic question of how we define animal ""intelligence"", there is no debate as to whether animals can suffer. And if we have extended equal rights to women, minorities, homosexuals, should we and why don't we extend these rights to other species? ouch. most people, like me, when faced with this question and thinking about it seriously, either look away or become vegetarians. it is difficult to reconcile our instincts to eat meat and the moral implications of it. but Pollan shows us that those are not the only two alternatives.He argues that while animals rightists have always stressed the suffering of animals due to our meat eating habits (although we have rather slim evidence of exactly what goes on in the brain of a pig about to go to heaven, (or hell?)), they have also failed to acknowledge that humans are capable of giving animals a decent and happy life. and ""happy"" in this case means the ability to do what they would naturally do, either pigs rooting around in the dirt, or cows wandering on pastures. ""to think of domestication as a form of slavery or even exploitation is to miscontrue that whole relationship-to project a human idea or power onto what is in fact an example of mutualism or symbiosis between species."" as he points out, domestication is an evolutionary development. domesticated animals have a much higher chance of surviving than in the wild, compare dogs and wolves for example. they therefore evolve to serve human benefits, winning our favor, in order to be provided with shelter and protection. they probably don't like being killed very much, but if that gives them a longer life and a much better chance to spread their genes to the next generation, they would much rather be with us than be in nature. ""predation is not a matter of morality or of politics, it, too, is a matter of symbiosis. from the point of view of the individual prey animal predation is a horror, but from the point of view of the group-and of its gene pool-it is indispensable."" That is exactly the point that most animals rightists miss. they concern only with individuals, but nature doesn't work that way, no matter how cruel that might sound. nature is about maximizing the survival of the whole species. our morals were developed to help us function as a healthy, cooperative society, but it is rather irrelevant to what should happen in nature.Pollan charges that this very embraced and apparently self-righteous ""ideology"" is a product of an urban society which has lost touch with nature. A friend of mine told me that he took his children to a slaughterhouse to see how pigs are killed because he believes that if we want to eat meat, we should be able to face the morality involved in it. that, i think, is a respectable viewpoint. the children were slightly disturbed but it didn't stop them eating meat. this father is probably an exception in our society. most of us probably have never raised a cow and seen a cow. our meat comes from nice little packages that never remind us of that it comes from something that used to have a brain and can suffer. when i asked my NZ friends why people no longer eat animal organs, like we do in Vietnam, they stared at me with disturbed looks. but really, when you think about it, offal is very nutritious, and there's little reason why we can accept eating meat, but not kidney, heart, or brain. i suspect the reason is the viscera brings home to us the fact that what we are eating used to be quite similar to us, which means, having eyes, lungs, heart. and we are so scared to face that reality that we get rid of it altogether. the second reason is that once the meat production process is out of sight, we have lost the traditional rituals justifying the act of killing and governing the slaughter of animals. the disappearance of these old practices gives way to the brutalization of animals to the extent that the animals become so sick that we have pretty much run out of anti-biotics.but that is not the same as to say that we can eat meat carefree without any moral consideration. given the fact that our food chain has become increasingly industrialized and heavily dependent on fossil fuels, we do have a moral obligation to care about the health of nature, i.e, the condition of the soil, the health of the animals we eat, the impact of animal farming on the environment. I can't agree more with him that while we don't need or arguably shouldn't give up our meat consumption, we should at least make sure that the way we eat is sustainable and the animals we eat are treated decently. the way that animals are treated in most farms is quite despicable. and i bet that if we had a chance to look at it, most would quite happily choose to be vegetarian. giving animals a humane treatment does not only give us a clear conscience but really serves our benefits as well. who would not want to eat a healthy chicken instead of a disease-ridden one? recently, when a documentary about the treatment of pigs in battery farms in NZ was broadcast on TV, the public displayed outrage at what they saw and have pushed quite vigorously for legislation prohibiting cruel treatment of farm animals  see here. i don't know of progress elsewhere. i like the idea that once the public know about what's happening to what they eat, they can make a difference.most of the rest of the book deals with corn and how our (meaning American) food chain has been reduced to a monoculture of soy and corn. they are present in something like 75% of the processed food products on the market. 40% of the calories a Mexican eats comes from food. if you think that's quite astonishing, then apparently American have overtaken Mexicans to be kings of walking corns. corn became the winner in the competition to be human's favorite crop because of its capacity to store a lot more calories than other species. the invention of fertilizers (interestingly made widely available by the surplus ammonium nitrate after the war) made growing corn so incredibly efficient that corn gradually replaced all other crops. and in the 1950s, feeding cattle on feedlots was cheaper than on grass, enabling the farmers to build massive chicken factories. livestock farmers went out of business because they couldn't compete with giant factories. fertilizer was a mixed blessing because the soil fertility shifted from reliance on the sun and a careful rotation of crops, to fossil fuels. we might like to think that fertilizers make agriculture a lot more efficient, but in fact, we expend twice as much energy to produce corn than when we relied on nature. and that's not to mention the huge cost of environmental pollution.when corn got cheaper and cheaper, the Nixon government stepped in to subsidize it, encouraging growing even more corn of lower nutritional quality and sparking the beginning of agribusiness. the excess corn finds its way into most processed energy-dense foods and feeding livestock. getting rid of this huge amount of excess energy contributes to obesity and an impoverished food culture. it makes good economic sense to dump excess corn on cattle, but biologically, they evolved to eat grass, and being forced to eat something they are not supposed to eat has caused grave problems. in a shit hole with piles of waste, polluted air and water and no space to even wiggle their tails, the only way these cows can survive is to swallow humongous amounts of anti-biotics. that sounds quite depressing, but the organic industry doesn't really hold a torch toward a moral utopia as we would hope. Pollan points out that the organic industry has diverged exponentially from its original ideals in the 1960s, and is now not so much better than the establishment. they consume a huge amount of energy to transport their products across the country, most ""free range"" farms mean that the chicken has a palm-sized window to look at the sun 5 minutes a day. real organic farmers have a hard time to get their products on the market because of government regulations. to me it seems like America's unsustainable food consumption is perpetuated by a cycle of ignorance and government intervention. so much for laissez-faire capitalism. growing so much corn might seem to make good economic sense. we must admit that it's quite remarkable that this is the first time in human history, we can produce food so cheaply and so abundantly. but this is the thing that has always not sat right with me about economics. that it hides all the expensive external costs involved in the process: environmental degradation, costs to the government in terms of subsidies, a huge consumption of fossil fuels, public health and malnourishment. so in fact, eating cheap corn is very expensive. so the key question is WHY is America doing all these things that defy logic? to summarize the whole story in one word, I'd say efficiency. feeding corn to livestock is so much cheaper and easier than grass (don't have to wait for grass to grow). and it supports a legion of other industries: the chemical and biotech industries, the food industry, the oil industry, pharma, agribusiness. If we keep in mind that hunter-gathers didn't become agriculturists out of choice, but because they depleted the animals they were hunting, it makes me worry what will happen to us when we deplete our soil and degrade our environment so the same disastrous extent. the food price riots in 2007/8 give us a glance at how depressing such a world would be.but this book isn't just depressing, it's enlightening and inspiring. it shows us that there ARE alternatives to the status quo: eat local, subscribe to a farm you know, and as he says in ""In defense of food"", then simply ""eat food, not too much, mostly plants"". I find Michael Pollan a remarkable writer, very humble and articulate. I can't recommend this book too highly."
235,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,5,"We are a notably unhealthy people obsessed by the idea of eating healthily (p. 3).Michael Pollan's Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals is a critique of industrial farms: they raise animals shoulder to shoulder standing in their own manure, feeding them foods that they are not designed for and which make them ill, and then use chemicals to compensate for these sins. Who knew that we are corn-eaters – not directly, like Mexicans, but through our cattle and chickens, and in processed foods.“When you look at the isotope ratios,.. we North Americans look like corn chips with legs.” Compared to us, Mexicans today consume a far more varied carbon diet: the animals they eat still eat grass (until recently, Mexicans regarded feeding corn to livestock as a sacrilege); much of their protein comes from legumes; and they still sweeten their beverages with cane sugar."" (p. 23)Pollan looks at industrial and pastoral farms, briefly flirts with being a vegetarian, then becomes a hunter/gatherer. He doesn't ""look"" the way I would, but goes out in the field, visiting and working farms, learning to hunt (and kill), and to gather wild mushrooms. Each major step on his journey is punctuated with a meal.Our typical, industrial farm, Pollan argues, is not healthy for us (making us obese), not healthy for the animals (making them ill), and not healthy for the soil and environment (using vast amounts of oil to raise food in a monoculture). He may something good about this kind of farming, but I've forgotten it. This farming is good for conglomerates – making them rich – but not farmers or consumers.His week on Joel Salatin's pastoral farm is fascinating – even for me, a vegetarian of more than 40 years. Salatin is a libertarian, deeply suspicious of government and governmental intervention. However, hw is a scientist's kind of farmer. He recognizes that everything is connected, so considers how to balance the activity and placement of cattle, chickens, pigs, and trees, each entering an environmental niche at a time that makes sense for the animals and farm, keeping all healthy while being largely chemical-free. As Salatin argues:""Society is not bearing the cost of water pollution, of antibiotic resistance, of food-borne illnesses, of crop subsidies, of subsidized oil and water—of all the hidden costs to the environment and the taxpayer that make cheap food seem cheap. No thinking person will tell you they don’t care about all that. I tell them the choice is simple: You can buy honestly priced food or you can buy irresponsibly priced food.” (p. 243)Finally, Omnivore's Dilemma is an ode to mindful, grounded eating, praising the food from Salatin's farm, but also that hunted and gathered in Sonoma and the Bay Area of California. He drools not just as be eats, but as he prepares to do so (although some of what he must do brings him close to losing his lunch), For Pollan, a meal that is eaten in full consciousness of what it took to make it is worth preparing every now and again, if only as a way to remind us of the true costs of the things we take for granted (pp. 409-410). He ends up in favor of locally-grown and harvested foods, foods with few chemicals, foods where we own the costs of eating.Pollan convinces me – not to eat cow, as some parts of Omnivore's Dilemma would be well-served with Sinclair Lewis's The Jungle. He does convince me to invest in local farms. I had been considering dropping my CSA membership in favor of the farmer's market, but decided against this so I support local farmers (mine is a cooperative of 12 Amish farms and includes a handwritten letter by one farmer each week). We have been decreasing our consumption of processed foods, but Omnivore's Dilemma will likely speed up this process. And, I will hesitate – I can't promise more – the next time I am looking at vegetables from half-way around the world.As Claude Lévi-Strauss argued, food must be “not only good to eat, but also good to think” (quoted on p. 289). Pollan's food-writing is thoughtful, and I enjoyed Omnivore's Dilemma as much for the writing as the content. And, he is dryly humorous.Pollan clears Lévi-Strauss's bar."
236,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/394959-susan,2,"While I read this book, I couldn't help but think about the muckrakers of the early 20th century. This book is pretty much nothing like The Jungle, starting with the fact that it is nonfiction, but its goal isn't that far away. It's telling a story about a part of our food industry that we don't normally think to ask about and painting a picture that should make us angry enough to do something about it.And don't get me wrong, Pollan rakes a lot of really good muck. Mostly it's his interpretation of his muck that doesn't work for me.I think the really important information comes in the first half of the book. Pollan gives us a crash course in agriculture subsidies. He compares our currently corn-focused subsidy structure to historic subsidies that were geared toward a broader spectrum of food. Then he goes into detail about what it means to live in a food chain that is designed to produce the most corn at the cheapest price. The answer? Corn is essentially in every processed food we eat. Meanwhile, corn farmers can barely keep their farms afloat because the price has been pushed down so far that they can barely produce enough product to cover their mortgages, and they dump so much fertilizer onto their fields to raise production that it ends up leeching into the water supply all the way to the ocean.Pollan then takes the corn story to the cattle industry and gives us a pretty ugly picture of what it means to raise corn-fed cattle. We thought that corn-fed cattle were a good thing, right? It's advertised on the stickers on our steaks. Except that cow biology rejects corn. The resulting situation not only makes the lives of the cows highly questionable at best, but it presents some very real health concerns for we the consumers.Buying organic fixes the problem, right? Wrong. Large-scale organic produce and livestock may not be what you think they are. Think your chickens are free-range? That just means they need to have access to the outdoors, which they are trained never to use. Corporate organic livestock is raised in environments little better than its non-organic counterpart, and they're probably fed corn too.OTOH, Pollock's story actually made me more positive about organic produce. One thing that organic regulations do accomplish is requiring a use of fertilizer that is not nearly so destructive to the environment.All of this stuff is good stuff to know. In fact, I'd like to look for some other sources of this information so I deepen my knowledge and cross-check Pollan. The place where he loses me is in his interpretation.This book got a lot of people justifiably riled up about the quality of their food and the state of their food production. And where does Pollan direct them? To back yard gardens and small family farming operations. In large part from this book, the bourgeois Localvore movement sprang up. So if you have enough money to pay twice the price for your food or the free time to produce it yourself, then you can have the satisfaction of opting out of the flawed food chain while leaving it essentially unimproved. A whole new luxury food industry has grown up to provide local food to the Localvores. Meanwhile, the corn subsidies and all their consequences continue unabated.The problem as I see it is that Pollan wraps up aesthetics with his practicality. Aesthetically, he is drawn to family farms where there are a lot more workers per square acre, a larger variety of produce and livestock are produced, and resources are used in a way he perceives as more efficient. The problem is that these qualities might make him feel good, but they don't actually address most of the problems he brought up in his muckraking. One of the sections that got my goat most was a several-page indictment of Value Added. You see, when companies make breakfast cereal, they take corn, puff it up, color it, put sugar on it, and (gasp) sell it for more than the price of the corn! The horrors of those corporate money grubbers!Look. Value Added is a core economic concept. I don't suppose Pollan expected people to pay the same amount for his book as the cost of the wood pulp used to make the paper. I suppose he wanted to be paid more for writing it than the cost of the computer he composed it on. And what's his solution to paying for overpriced processed corn? To pay more for food that comes from the right farm. So which Value Added is legitimate and which one isn't? It seems to me that food production needs four core traits. It needs to be: - Responsible: Producing it doesn't destroy the land, the water supply, or the consumers. - Plentiful: There's enough produced to feed everyone. - Reliable: Every weather fluctuation doesn't put us in danger of a shortage or a famine. - Cheap: Affordable to as many people as possible who need to eat.Pollan really only addresses the first of these four issues, and that in an incomplete manner. His solutions pretty much stomp on Plentiful and Cheap. Back yard gardens and family farms are not going to be able to produce enough food to feed a majority of Americans, no matter what they are willing to pay. It's really too bad that we couldn't have directed a lot more of this food production anger toward agricultural subsidy reform instead."
237,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/165589-gwen,3,"The first section of the book, in which Pollan follows the path of corn through the industrial food chain and discusses the effects of corn on our diets, supermarkets, and the environment, is fascinating. Despite being trained in the sociology of agriculture and specifically in the analysis of commodity chains, I learned a lot and found few details to quibble with (the main exception being his tendency to anthropomorphize corn, discussing it as though it intentionally chose to evolve in certain ways). If I were teaching a class on food, I would totally assign that section of the book.The second section of the book is also good, though not as great as the first. Probably this is because I already knew that ""organic"" and ""sustainable"" are not the same and that Horizon-brand organic dairy products come from huge dairies that, from the point of view of the cow, the quality of the milk, and the environment, are little better than regular non-organic ones.But the final section is really annoying me. Most of the things that are irritating me are much more clearly discussed at http://www.powells.com/review/2007_08..., but there were a few other things as well. Pollan keeps talking about how only omnivores have any trouble deciding what to eat, using koalas and cows as examples of animals that, being specialists, don't need to worry about whether something is an acceptable food source or not. Anyone who raises cows will tell you he's highly underestimating cows' experimentation with non-grass foods. They eat weeds and poisonous plants; they get nails and wire and bones stuck in their throats. It's a pain in the ass to have to try to remove a deer vertebra some cow has managed to lodge in her throat. I suppose this seems like a minor detail, except his entire argument is that humans (and other omnivores) are unique in facing problems deciding what is and isn't safe to eat.Connected to that is Pollan's reference to ""human nature"" from time to time, something that drives me nuts when my students do it and is even more exasperating from someone who at least ostensibly has the intellectual capacity and training to not fall back on such a simplistic explanation (that is, ""humans do it, therefore it's human nature""). He seems to buy in to the popular conception that there's a ""human nature"" that we've just smeared a little civilization and culture on top of (think of frosting on a cake).I don't think I can finish the book--I'm increasingly irritated by his tone and the problems with his argument. It's too bad, because the book really did start off well."
238,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20495277-anny,4,"Truly an eye-opener! I absolutely loved the first part of the book about the industrial agriculture. I would've never thought that our humble 'corn' is actually the tyrant of mono-culture farming. Farmers went broke, took a huge debt, taking side jobs driving trailers and depended on their wife salary for the sake of planting corn. Animals (cow, pig, chicken) got ousted from the farm and pasture and cramped into CAFO a.k.a. concentration camp for animals, where they live their short miserable life. First, they were fed food (corn or dubious meat-by-product or whatever cheapest feed available) that is making them sick and making us who eat them sick (mad cows anyone?). Second, they were cramped as much as physically possible, resulting in stressed, depressed, and psychotic animals (often resorting to self-mutilation or cannibalism). Third, they were doused with much antibiotics and medications (because their living conditions made them sick) and hormones and whatnot (to fatten them as much as possible) with who knows what side-effects that might cause for us (antibiotic-resistant bacteria for example).Taking the stand against industrial agriculture were small farms, like Polyface farm owned by Joel Salatin. If CAFO were hell for animals, then Polyface farm must be its heaven. There were so many good things about this farm, suffice to say, if I could buy from there (or any other place that practice sustainable agriculture), I would certainly do so. The last part of the book about hunting and gathering was the part that I liked the least. Too many pages rambling on and on about the ethics of killing animals. It's a weak finish, but the first two parts of the book was definitely worth reading!"
239,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/327527-missy-jean,5,"I can say without hesitation that this is a life-changing book. It's elegantly written and unflinching. Pollan is honest about his own cognitive dissonance about being an omnivore, which means he never sounds self-righteous (an impressive feat for the genre). And I love the widespread anthropomorphism of the book, the mysticism that Pollan is willing to embrace as he cites scientific sources.That said... Halfway through the book I was so depressed that I went home and ate graham crackers dipped in a can of chocolate frosting. All I could think was, so there's no choice! I am going to eat chemicals and toxins and animal byproducts unwittingly every day of my life, and they are going to kill me in the end! By the end of the book, though, I felt like I had a real sense of small measures that I can take to eat in a healthier and more environmentally responsible way. So I went to the farmstand and bought a big old pile of locally-grown buttercup squash, peaches, chard and zucchini. Better than synthetic frosting, right?I think there are a lot of different conclusions that people can draw from this book, and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who wants to be more mindful about what they eat. For me, it validated my penchant for vegetarianism (and my habitual eschewing of McDonalds), but you might get something slightly different from it. (Pollan is not a vegetarian.) Honestly, I don't think I'll ever look at my plate in quite the same way again, and I feel grateful for that."
240,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82365956-veronica,4,"""Yet there are other images of animals on other kinds of farms that contradict the nightmare ones. I'm thinking of the hens I saw at Polyface Farm, fanning out over the cow pasture on a June morning, pecking at the cowpats and the grass...or the image of pig happiness I witnessed in that cattle barn in March, watching the hogs, all upturned pink hams and corkscrew tails, nosing their way through that deep cake of compost in search of alcoholic morsels of corn. It is true that farms like this are but a speck on the monolith of modern animal agriculture, yet their very existence, and the possibility that implies, throws the whole argument for animal rights into a different light."" Pollan knows that the so-called happiness at Polyface Farm could never be scaled to a magnitude sufficient to feed the many required. ""To many animal people even Polyface Farm is a 'death camp'—a way station for doomed creatures awaiting their date with the executioner. But to look at the lives of these animals is to see this holocaust analogy for the sentimental conceit it really is. In the same way we can probably recognize animal suffering when we see it, animal happiness is unmistakable, too, and during my week on the farm I saw it in abundance.""I will permit the possibility of brief animal happiness on a small farm right before the slaughter. Still, the inconvenient reality is that human agriculture contravenes the natural order of predation because we are the only creatures that bring animals into existence in order to slaughter them. The lion does not raise and propagate zebras in a nested enclosure indefinitely and delight in creating more and more efficient ways of slaughtering their offspring. This apparently small detail is conveniently left out in arguments from nature, as I will call them. ""To think of domestication as a form of slavery or even exploitation is to misconstrue that whole relationship—to project a human idea of power onto what is in fact an example of mutualism or symbiosis, rather than a political, development. The animals grew tame and lost their ability to fend for themselves in the wild and the humans traded hunter-gatherer ways for the settled lives of agriculturists. Humans changed biologically, too.""Don't equate the domestication of wolves to the slaughter of chicks. Red herring fallacy. ""[This] is where the animal rightists betray a deep ignorance about the workings of nature."" Again, there is nothing natural about industrial agriculture. ""The very existence of predation in nature, of animals eating animals, is the cause of much anguished hand-wringing in the animal rights literature. 'It must be admitted,' Peter Singer writes, 'that the existence of carnivorous animals does pose one problems for the ethics of Animal Liberation, and that is whether we should do anything about it.' (Talk about the need for peacekeeping forces!)""On the one hand, this made me laugh a bit because I've always been disturbed by the existence of predation in the wild. That many creatures rely on the pain and suffering of other animals in order to live is but a testament to the fallen state of the world, which is also why Jupiter is a purer and superior planet to Earth. But I digress. (My sister has christened this Jupiter propaganda🪐, which I readily admit.)In any event, I've already unravelled this false equivalency between natural predation and the very systematic multiplication of animals bred for the slaughter, season after season. From doom to dust.""Today, the organic food industry finds itself in a most unexpected, uncomfortable, and yes, unsustainable position: floating on a sinking sea of petroleum.""""U.S. agricultural policy, like the Declaration of Independence, is founded on the principle that all carrots are created equal, even though there's good reason to believe this isn't really true.""Birds can't get access to the outdoors until at least 5 weeks old and are slaughtered at 7, so ""free range turns out to be not so much a lifestyle for these chickens as a two-week vacation option.""""From the moment an organic lettuce plant is ready for harvest, the rest of its journey from field to produce aisle follows a swift and often ingenious industrial logic that is only nominally organic.""The fact that steer are given numbers as names makes Holocaust comparisons all too facile...""The farmers desperate to boost yield end up degrading their land, plowing and planting marginal land, applying more nitrogen—anything to squeeze a few more bushels from the soil.""""Nor would such a culture be shocked to discover that there are other countries, such as Italy and France, that decide their dinner questions on the basis of such quaint and unscientific criteria as pleasure and tradition, eat all manner of 'unhealthy' foods, and, lo and behold, wind up actually healthier and happier in their eating than we are. We show our surprise at this by speaking of something called the 'French paradox,' for how could a people who eat such demonstrably toxic substance as foie gras and triple crème cheese actually be slimmer and healthier than we are? Yet I wonder if it doesn't make more sense to speak in terms of an American paradox—that is, a notably unhealthy people obsessed by the idea of eating heathily."""
241,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73483095-cynnamon,0,"I bought this book, because I had thouroughly enjoyed Michael Pollans ""Cooking"".But here I give up.I have read around 100 pages about corn. I learned a lot I didn't know before, but unfortunately I didn't care about my newly acquired knowledge.Also the book is completely US-centric, which makes it for me as an European not quite so interesting.This book is outside of my scope of interest, therefore I refrain from assigning a rating."
242,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,5,"I really like Pollan’s writing style, he brings points home with simplicity, and he is able to cover a lot of ground without the writing feelings unnecessarily circuitous or blustery. More than that though, I like that he is willing to experience. I mean, that’s the very core of responsible journalism, Pollan goes and works on the farms, he helps slaughter chickens, he sits in tractors, he goes hunting and foraging, he throws himself bodily and emotionally into these experiences, and at each point I felt that he was incredibly honest with both himself and the reader about the impacts of his actions and his emotional state.All in all I thought it was refreshingly non-biased, fair appraising look at industrial agriculture/ranching, industrial/artisanal organic agriculture/ranching, and hunting/foraging. I say that as a person literally smack dab in the middle of row-crop country (my husband and his family farms), as a gardener, and as a hunter. I’ve long had a problem with the way we raise meat in this country, and the lack of connection between people and their food. Its one of the reasons that I do hunt and garden, and its also one of the reasons that I’ve mostly switched to plant proteins for all meals except supper. I am continuing to try and evolve how I eat, and it’s a learning experience and I don’t always get it right (I ate spaghettio’s twice in three days last week, no one’s perfect). But its hard to read this book without examining the role that we eaters have in the natural world. I am going to make a concerted effort to eat in-season vegetables except for those that I froze from my garden in the summer, and I’m going to try and rely on our game meats more. Despite reading much about early life on the prairie, somehow I had never considered that even meat was seasonal, or that foods grown out of season lack the nutrition that we think we are getting. They’re both very “duh” concepts, but its not something that I had really appreciated. Nor had I valued the waste of petroleum in shipping year round under-nourished produce from Argentina to the US just so that we could eat whatever fruit or veggie that we want, despite its lack of flavor.Perhaps the greatest thing that came from this was the conversations with my husband. He listened to the audiobook while in the tractor, and it was great to talk to him when he came home at night about the ways agriculture has changed since Pollan wrote (advances in technology have changed the level of precision for farmers, becoming more environmentally friendly for those that upgrade), but also the ways that it could continue to change. What could we do as eaters, hunters, buyers, and producers in our local community? Books that foster conversation and change always get a 5 out of 5.Absolutely recommend to everyone. Read those food labels. Speak out. We deserve, as buyers, connectivity and information about our food, and animals especially deserve better than what we manage for our convenience."
243,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/307041-ginny-messina,3,"A truly important book by gifted writer and journalist Michael Pollan. It's not without its flaws, however, and for all the promise of the first two-thirds of the book, it kind of leaves the reader hanging at the end. In the first part, Pollan exposes the damaging effects of industrial agriculture, and—-importantly—-this includes large-scale organic production which is not nearly as benign as most people would like to believe. Later in the book he addresses the inhumane aspect of industrial agriculture as well—-organic production included. He puts it succinctly: you look away, or you stop eating meat. In the second part of the book, we see farming as it should be, on Polyface Farm in the Shenandoah Valley. Here, farming practices are closely tied to nature including the natural behavior of farm animals. While the system doesn't adhere completely to organic regulations, it is far more sustainable and humane than industrial organic agriculture and certainly more so than conventional agriculture. Polyface Farm is not able to separate itself from industrial agriculture completely (by law, the steer are killed in conventional slaughterhouses) but it still seems like a very nice place. Unfortunately, the scale on which it operates means that this type of sustainable farming can never produce enough food for the U.S. population. Food from farms like Polyface is likely to be available to only a privileged few. The last part of the book struck me as downright nonsensical. Pollan explores the possibility of putting together the ultimate local meal—-one composed of food that he himself has hunted, gathered and grown. But don't try this at home, he says. It is not at all a realistic way to eat. Well—-no—-not if you do it by gathering chanterelle mushrooms with a bunch of chefs from Chez Panisse, hunting wild boar in the California woods, and diving for abalone along a rocky coast. Granted, most Americans would be hard-pressed to produce their own food, but Pollan doesn't even explore the option in any kind of realistic or meaningful fashion. In the end, it appears that the problems associated with food production are insurmountable. Industrial agriculture provides most of the food in this country and is a wasteful and unsustainable system. But more sustainable systems are not realistic for feeding the population. Pollan does not offer any clear cut answers, much to my surprise. (I didn't expect him to solve the problem; I did expect a little guidance!) But the thoughtful reader can still pull together a plan of action to minimize the environmental and ethical cost of a meal. Reduce intake of animal foods. Buy locally-produced food. Grow or produce as much as is realistic for you. Pollan makes his readers think about where their meals come from and how to measure the true cost of our ""inexpensive"" food. This is a must-read for anyone who expresses a desire to live and eat responsibly. "

I can't really say this book was a waste of my time though because i gained some useful knowledge from it and some parts equally annoyed me but what more can i expect from a book riddled with self righteous prose from an author who writes in a way that sets him up on the ""right"" moral pedestal? This may not have been his intention but i do not care either way. I am just glad i finished it and i hope to never be subjected to the torture of reading a book i have no interest in, for class again. So long and good riddance!"

"
247,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147289-jason-pettus,5,"Journalist Michael Pollan has a reputation for writing books that people don't just like, but whose very lives get permanently changed because of reading them; and I can attest that this exact thing has happened to me after reading my first book of his, the extraordinary 2006 guide to modern food practices known as The Omnivore's Dilemma. In it, Pollan imagines three typical meals a contemporary American might eat -- one of fast food, one of Whole Foods-type groceries, and one literally put together through foraging and hunting -- then over the course of 60,000 words shows us exactly, step by minute step, how the ingredients in each meal can be traced back and back until finally reaching a point of a living plant being grown in the ground somewhere, then building us back forward again by showing exactly what happens to that plant step by step as it makes its way from the farm to eventually our mouths.Along the way, then, Pollan gives us an astute history of the post-war industrial agricultural industry; explains why exactly corn is the overwhelming number-one crop now grown in America; gives us the horrifying reasons that most cattle and chicken have to be fed so many antibiotics in order to merely survive under such harsh industrial conditions; demonstrates why in a middle-class consumerist society these conditions have to happen in the first place (that is, because if cows were still grown in the humane way they were in an agricultural society, a McDonald's hamburger would cost $30, and the American people would riot); shows through personal field trips what exactly the difference is between ""cage-free,"" ""free range"" and ""pastured"" eggs, and why one of these options is infinitely better than the others; details why the term ""organic"" on a food label can mean vastly different things depending on the company and circumstances; and shows through illuminating first-hand experience why we are no longer a hunter-gatherer society (namely, because it's exhausting, inefficient, and makes people run the risk of sometimes going entire weeks at a time without finding anything edible to eat).Easily the most interesting book I've read in a decade, The Omnivore's Dilemma has permanently changed the way I now shop for groceries, knowing as I now do so many more details about what each label on a package means, and how different growing circumstances can often literally mean a difference in the resulting food's nutrition (just for one example, how Pollan scientifically proves here that eggs from chickens that are allowed to roam freely on farmland are literally better for you than eggs grown from chickens kept in cages); and although I haven't completely given up fast food, certainly every hamburger I now buy makes me ponder the indescribably monstrous and cruel circumstances by which that cow lived its life, which has already influenced just how many hamburgers I buy in general. (It also makes me understand a lot better why there will always be people around in any society who are more than happy to perform that society's most inhumane tasks, such as rounding up undocumented immigrants, ripping their children away from them, and throwing them into concentration camps while openly laughing in their faces...but that's neither here nor there, I suppose.) To tell the truth, the only reason I read this in the first place was because I was waiting for the day in early June that Pollan's newest book came out, a 600-page whopper called How to Change Your Mind that looks in exhaustive detail at all the latest 21st-century research into the connections between psychedelic drugs, mindfulness, meditation, mental health, what MRIs can teach us about what we've traditionally called the ""soul,"" and a lot more. That book is now finished too, and was just as fascinating as The Omnivore's Dilemma, so keep an eye out for my write-up of that in another couple of weeks.UPDATE 1: I find it utterly fascinating that the only negative reviews here of this book are from vegetarians, who are so upset at Pollan's conclusion that humans as omnivores are perfectly capable of eating meat, they're willing to dismiss every single other vegetarian-friendly thing he has to say. (Ultimately Pollan is pro-vegetable in this book, despite concluding that meat is indeed an edible substance that humans find edible.) A huge part of this book is all about how the politics of any given age has a huge influence over our opinions on the supposedly ""scientifically objective"" subjects of diet and nutrition, and the vitriolic negative reviews of the book by militant vegetarians here simply proves his point all over again.UPDATE 2: After reading other people's reviews, I agree with something I saw a lot of people mention; that a clear sign of how much I loved this book is that people at Twitter eventually got sick of me constantly tweeting about it while I was reading it. Be prepared to drive your friends and spouse crazy!"

Well, Actually, Eat Sh*t and Flourish. Each of these would have been a more classy title for the book ""Omnivore's Dilemma"". To paraphrase another reviewer 'The dude structures this book by following the path of four finished meals from origin to plate - one McDonald's meal, one comprised of supermarket organic products, one from a ""beyond-organic"" self-sustaining farm in Virginia, and one he forages almost entirely on his own. This book tries to provokes a lot of thought about the origins of our food and the biological, political, social and economic implications of those origins, and for the most part, it is successful.' So after reading this book I realize that maybe, just maybe, I don’t argue with people about food enough. Ever since I read  Fast Food Nation  and watched  Supersize Me  I have been pretty good about avoiding eating at Mc-stablishments and drinking soda. Knowing these efforts aren’t enough, but not having had the ...chutzpah ... to make the leap to full fledged, ""morally superior"" vegetarianism. I am way to lazy to manage an urban garden, -- preferring rather to watch one made on TV OD presents, as a moral alternative to growing, actually hunting and eating wild game. The parts of the book that describe this stuff, although not seemingly not feasible, reinforced these previously formed notions about foraging. Still, it is pretty interesting to see the details fleshed out.One thing discussed in the book that i hadn't internalized, and that makes sense when I think about it, is that going to whole foods and buying an organic Chilean artichoke in the winter can be a lot worse ethically than eating a fat juicy steak from a locally raised mature grass fed cow. I guess that the ethical answer culled from the book on how to shop food in the city is to buy at farmers markets or join one of these CSA’s. Take the extra step and get to know your farmer, know how they grow, know how they feed and treat the animals is the right thing to do. This seems like undue effort and cost but the ethical equivalent seems to be to hunt and dress bloody dead animals or forage for mushrooms in central park. In that perspective, the first options seems like less effort ."

These range from the nearby McDonald's and Burger Kind to the supermarket to the local farmer's stand. Michael Pollan takes a look at four ways to have a meal - one industrial meal at McDonald's, one organic meal from Whole Foods, one local meal from a farmer's field, and one completely ""homemade"" meal made from hunting and foraging.I must say, the first 300 pages are riveting, absolutely enthralling! I kept putting aside fiction to read this book, it was so good! However, when I hit the chapters on hunting and foraging, I found my interest severely waning. I really don't care at all about hunting animals and foraging for mushrooms, so keeping my attention was nearly impossible (this is why I took off a star). But the end picks up as Pollan returns to the final ""perfect"" meal.This book had so much really good information - information that once again cements my desire never to eat food at a fast food restaurant ever again. If one of your New Year's Resolutions is to eat healthier, read this book to bolster that desire!!"

The parts on farming, the evils of monoculture, the importance of grass, were especially enlightening. I don't normally eat beef and I would definitely reduce the intake even more. The most shocking part for me was the 'pastoral organic' revelation. I wonder if the organic products sold in Indonesia as are bad as the greenwashed examples in this book, which are all about the US market. The later parts of the book - hunting and cooking - were not as interesting for me as the earlier parts. Hence the four stars. Still, a fascinating read and highly recommended to everyone."

I support a small flock of happy chickens instead.Lengthy review to come. In the meantime, let me just say---I learned a lot from this book. I also enjoyed some segments very much. I would have done some extensive editing.The final chapter is sublime. OK, my real review:I am a convenience eater. Michael Pollan's work is transforming me into a conscious eater. Two concrete changes in my behavior: I will now pay the price of a fancy mocha coffee beverage for a dozen eggs gathered from happy chickens. I will also see commercially available breaded chicken with a side of corn as corn dressed with corn and a side of corn. I still may eat it, but at least I know what I'm getting!It is my hope that these wonderful books I have been reading indicate an American paradigm shift, and that the marketplace will allow people like me (who don't want to spend the time and effort tracking down purveyers of all sorts of specialty foods) more chances to make conscious choices in a convenient way. I will do my best to make choices that are more healthful for me and our planet regardless.This book was successful in changing my behavior. In large part, it was successful because I was already ripe for changing. Everything from Kingsolver's Animal Vegetable Miracle to Buford's Heat to Van Draanen's sweet young adult novel Flipped has been telling me to embrace these changes. This work built upon that foundation and presented a lot more detailed information supporting the choices that we should all be making. It was well structured, and it needed to be. So much information was packed into each section, it was necessary for me to take breaks. Some peeves---Too many declarative sentences. All declarative sentences put me on guard. (See what I did there?) I read something that says or implies ""all"" and I immediately start casting about defensively for the exceptions. I blame SAT prep. I was also put off by the way in which those declarations seemed designed to make me so defensive, mostly when he seemed dismissive of the travails of gardening, or scornful of the kind of hunter who does not agonize over the creatures' deaths. Second person. I hate second person. Here's a sentence that combined 2 peeves: ""You can forage in the garden, in the way Adam and Eve presumably did, but there isn't much to it: no dilemmas, no hunting stories."" And it's kind of a run on sentence too, now that I look at it, although that (obviously, having read any of my reviews!) isn't such a major irritation for me. (See what I did there?)Rampant anthropomorphism. Corn does not feel happy about taking over the world! Corn does not feel happy! Corn does not feel! This is a Truth. I believe that much of the anthropomorphism here was used as a bit of shorthand, implying all the Darwinian blah blah blah rather than spelling it out, and also trying to fix an image in the mind of the reader, but it is NOT TRUE. It bothers me. (Althoug I do like the image of an army of cornstalks marchng across the landscape, and it truly did stick with me.)LOVED---All descriptions of all meals.All the time spent at the idealized farm. (I forget what it's called and can't be bothered to look it up.)Everything to do with the mushrooms. (I think I'm due to read a book about mushrooms next.)The desription of the first hunt----soooooo true to my one hunting experience, in which I spent every fiber of my being on NOT MAKING ANY NOISE. It was such an intense time, and he captured that beautiully.I feel like there's so much more to say. Suiffice---I enjoyed most of this book. I learned. A lot. "
253,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1242165-schmacko,4,"So much has been written about this book, and so much will be defined by how you feel comfortable when discussing your eating habits. Here are, in short forms, my 10 observations:1)	If you’ve ever wondered how much the American government is responsible for your eating by subsidizing corporations who grow corn and make high fructose corn syrup, this is a book for you! SHORT VERSION: Corn is in EVERYTHING! We committed to growing corn when we could possibly switch to many varied crops. Corn is uniform, so it’s very corporate. If you hate political reading, if you don’t want to know this stuff, or you don’t frankly care, skip Pollan’s book. (Hope you enjoy your diabetes.)2)	Yes, we know organic food is better for us. But Pollan does a great job telling us that the US family’s annual food budget has actually dropped over the last 60 years, so Americans could conceivably spend more on food (and probably less on entertainment) and help out their diets.3)	I thought his section on Whole Foods founder John Mackey was interesting. Mackey completely concedes that he isn’t as radical as he started, that he has basically bought into the American corporate structure in order to take baby steps in supporting a business and helping people eat more healthfully.4)	At times, Pollan sounds a little Communist. At least, anti-Capitalist. I’m ok with that – to each his own – and I believe that American politics is all about constant discourse and adjustment.5)	Knowing the details of a slaughterhouse was a little much for me, but then again, I have no problem killing what I eat. Which makes me unlike 97% of Americans, who like to think their meat comes fully formed in plastic packages.6)	I love how Pollan describes the grey color of a McDonald’s burger. Funny! (I still crave Wendy’s once or twice a month.)7)	Mushroom foraging always sounded like something I wanted to do. Until I read his accounts. Mushroom foragers are crazy, obsessed people!8)	He’s lucky he had help at parts, or Pollan would’ve starved.9)	I like how he concedes that there is a better way to eat meat – that you don’t have to become a militant vegan.10)	I still wish we humans would accept that we are PART of the food chain!!! GRRR! We have canines; we have eaten meat for centuries. Our whole digestive system is built for meat! Lots of animals eat meat. We are not better than other animals that kill; the only thing that could possibly make us better is if we kill as quickly and painlessly as possible. We are the predators, and we should act as such – but with judiciousness and care. When we try to be ABOVE IT ALL – when we manipulate the environment – as Pollan excellently points out – we ruin it. “Dominion” humans create corporate slaughterhouses and run animals to extinction. Vegans treat animals as individuals to be coddled and encouraged to overproduce; soon, we’ll be overrun with deer and pumas and wild boar while we huddle eating berries from the sides of our abandoned roads (vehicles lead to road kill!) We need to accept that humans – like our predator cousins - do kill to survive, that we can be better at it, and that we are not ABOVE the food chain – as meat eaters or vegans – we are part of the system and should act accordingly. (Pollan mentions this, but doesn’t bring it home.)"

Thankfully, Pollan is not an alarmist, but rather a quite methodical inquisitor about the roots of our food. It sounds kind of..esoteric, but he makes it fascinating, like a great humanities teacher he tells the larger story of food: of why we grow so much fricking corn in America, and how it's bad for almost everyone involved: ourselves, our diet, farmers in other countries.The good thing is that the book never descends into a polemic, unlike Michael Moore's work, Pollan's evenhandedness keeps the reader open to what he is saying. Nothing is extreme or revolutionary or incendiary.I feel like this book will, in the long term, shape the way I think about food by giving me a vocabulary for considering my personal and our cultural relationship to food. He discusses how America as a nation of immigrants never developed a stable national cuisine (unlike France or Italy), and the absence of that makes us vulnerable to an endless array of fad diets (coughAdkinscough) and an overall menu that is out of balance.There is a fascinating chapter on mushrooms and fungi, which details how they are utterly different from plants, and grow from this crazy underground symbiosis with decomposing nutrients and tree roots, taking a single drop of sugar from the tree root in exchange for processed minerals from the soil.There is an extended look at a farm outside Charlottesville--Polyface Farm--which models itself after natural ecosystems and creates this method of rotating cattle and chickens with grass growth cycles to create this wonderful whirlwind of spreadsheets, efficiency, and microdata on growth patterns of grass.To wit: it's better to have grass pasture surrounded by trees, because a blade of grass will burn X calories turning the face of it's blade toward the sun to receive solar energy. Planting forests around removes wind, allowing the grass to grow higher. Brilliant.In the end, it's about food, but it's also about systems in general. It begins to feel like a universal look at the interrelationship of history and commerce, and how everything is this big interconnected fabric, but that you can begin to see some of those connections, and kind of surf those links to great personal and collective gain.12/2007"

I use the word “threaten” very deliberately, because they are changes that I know I'm going to find challenging.Michael Pollan challenges his readers to examine their food a little closer, to consider where it comes from. And it's a logical request I think. We can spend days searching for the perfect doctor or mechanic, but how much time do we take to really think about our food? Do you know where your steak came from? Is your asparagus from a nearby farm, or far-flung Argentina? Are your peaches organic, and if so, what does that really mean? Most of us have no idea how to answer these questions.In most cases, the answers are simple. Most of our food likely comes from a massive industrial farm or feed-lot hundreds of miles away, fed by incredible amounts of fossil fuels -- the fertilizer, the machines used for harvesting, the trucks it took to transport the food to your local mega-mart, to name just a few uses of fossil fuel. Pollan's descriptions of these farms (and in particular, the feed lots) can be quite disturbing. However, Pollan does not outright condemn this ""industrial food chain."" He concedes that it would be difficult to feed billions of people inexpensively without it. Instead, he advocates having several different avenues for delivering food to our tables, and he describes several alternatives. It is up to the reader to determine how they want to eat. As for me, my eyes have been opened to the appeal of ""eating locally,"" where possible. (Emphasis on ""where possible."" There aren't too many oranges grown in Idaho.) By eating foods produced as close to my home as possible, I support the local economy, less fossil fuels are used, and the food should have fewer preservatives, hormones, and other chemical ingredients. Best of all, the food should be fresher and more flavorful. Yes, it will cost more, but I think it will be worth it. At least I'm willing to try it. Consider it an experiement. I've already found local sources of milk, eggs and meat that I'm going to try. I found Pollan's writing engaging and easy to read. (Disclaimer: I am a huge nerd, and the topic really spoke to me. If you don't like science, you may not find this book as fascinating.) A few words of warning: if evolution makes you uncomfortable, you may not like this book, as it often talks about the evolution of plants, animals and humans. Also, there were two or three instances where objectionable language was used. "
256,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4161947-m-l-rudolph,5,"2006. NY Times Book Review One of the 10 Best Books of the Year. We eat every day of our lives but we don't often give much thought to what we put in our bodies. If we are what we eat, then when it comes to meat, we are what the animal eats; and when it comes to produce, we are what the plant's grown in. There's a food chain that extends around the world and throughout evolutionary history from the beginning of man. Michael Pollan takes us on a tour of that chain and in the process gives any thinking, eating, person a new, often disturbing, view of what he/she consumes.Organized in three sections to illuminate industrial food (corn), pastoral food (grass), and personal food (the forest), Pollan's narrative builds toward meals made as nearly as possible with ingredients and methods from each of these categories.I double-dog-dare anyone to read this book and walk through a modern supermarket without viewing each item of food differently. And if you're like me, take your glasses, because the real information about what we buy and eat is in the small print, written in code, to disguise as much as possible what we truly consume. The central area of the supermarket is processed food. Good luck figuring that out. (When you can't determine the identity of fifteen out of eighteen ingredients on that package of processed whatever - chances are high what you're reading - and eating - are corn derivatives.) Around the walls, where we find the produce, meat, and fish, it would seem that the information describing the food would be more straight-forward. Good luck figuring that out, too. (Chances are every formerly living item was nourished or fertilized with corn or corn derivatives.)Unless you plan to follow a steer or a chicken through its life cycle to see how the animal lives, and dies, and becomes the food on your plate, you have to rely on someone like Pollan to take that trip for you, document his findings, and present it as he does here. I've read about food my entire life and tried to keep up on healthy eating without succumbing to fads, but I've never encountered such an intelligent, entertaining, and practical guide to the state of food in America today as The Omnivore's Dilemma. Read it and eat. "
257,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36341-c,5,"Pollan's book is not just a fascinating look at the modern state and evolution of our industrial food complex; it's not merely an anthropological investigation of the history of eating and cultural rituals; it's more than a scientific discourse of the biological nature of corn, small farm ecosystems, and fungi -- it's also, surprisingly, a page turner. When I was finished, I wanted the book to be twice as long.The book is also not (as many people seem to think) a political screed or manifesto -- Pollan isn't necessarily telling everyone to stop eating industrial food and switch to local, small farm food, as he acknowledges how impractical such a course of action actually is. Rather, he investigates our relationships with food, both personal and societal, scientific and ethical. He does find the industrial complex distasteful and disturbing and the small, sustainable farm he visits ideal but (and perhaps this is the choir appreciating the sermon) those conclusions seem inescapable.This book didn't change any of my ideas about eating, as I already try to eat locally and avoid processed food, but I learned a lot about the nature of food, from how terrifyingly omnipresent corn is to the amazingly complex ecosystem of a farm. It's one of those books that you constantly put down so you can turn to someone and say ""Oh my god, did you know that . . . """
258,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"This book has profoundly changed my view on my food, and subsequently, my world. I have read many nonfiction books, but nothing was so personal as this investigation on where our food comes from. Pollan sets put to investigate four markedly different food chains, and ends up having to revise his world view, and acquire new friends in search for a profound understanding of food, nature, and humanity.I have finished this on Feb 28, 2019. I will write a longer review when I collect my thoughts. There is plenty of food for thought (pardon the pun... did not intend it but hey, it fits.)"
259,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4123952-alasse,5,"I was so scared that this would turn out to be a foodie hipster's rant on what food should be like, instead of what it actually is. I'm relieved to admit that I was mistaken - in fact, it's one of the most thought-provoking books I've read this year. It's helped me to fully flesh out some apprehensions I had which I'd never actually put into words, such as 'Is organic really about chemical paranoia?' 'What's the environmental impact of mindlessly shipping food all over the continent?' 'How in the world does that even make sense economically?' Okay, that last one I had actually wondered about, more than once. I used to have a long commute.The Omnivore's Dilemma is also less location specific than Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal, which was a plus for me. I love reading about American lifestyles and behaviors (it's the whole deep-down-i-know-we're-next thing), but most of the industrial talk doesn't really apply to me. Pollan did a great job of giving a panoramic view of all the different approaches to eating in the first world, that's true. But mostly, it was his naturalist's view of things that made his discourse universal and relatable for me.Also, I've realized I have some very strong and mostly unfair prejudices against hunters. A book that manages to make me change my mind on a particular subject* is a book that deserves 5 stars. Shame on me.What else? Oh, apparently now I find ecology fascinating, which poses a new TBR list control challenge. F****ck.*while quoting a lot of Ortega y Gasset, I might add. Ortega FTW!! I went through an Ortega phase when I was like 17, so anyone who quotes Ortega to prove a point instantly gets bonus points with me."
260,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,3,"I grew up on a farm in Michigan where we grew corn and soybeans. The years when we rotated our crops to grow field corn, it was harvested to feed the chickens at the local egg farm. Thus I have some first hand experience with the first few chapters of the Omnivore’s Dilemma and the chapter on the farm rang especially true for me.This book is popular and enough time has passed that it probably qualifies as a classic and is certainly worth a read. It is a honest portrayal by a professor on the modern US food web highlighting many of the problems of our modern omnivore society spanning the spectrum from steroids to animal ethics. There were four chapters that I would consider as excellent: The Farm, The Feedlot, Grass and the Forager. The other twenty chapters were ok.I had no issue with the messaging of the book and wholly agree that it is important to understand where our modern food comes from. I will admit that I promptly ate organic vegetarian for my next meal after finishing the book as there are a few unpleasant facts associated with meat processing. I am sure I will become a carnivore again by tomorrow.I did have a few problems with the construction of the book however.1. At times it strayed from the science and empirical observations to become a little too professorial or perhaps too philosophical. This choice was understandable but gave me a meh kind of feeling.2. At times the book was a bit boring, although there were some intriguing chapters mixed throughout the book.3. I did not like most of the chapter titles such as Slaughter is a Glass Abattoir. Keep it simple like Cows, Corn, Chickens, Grass and the messaging of the chapter would resonate more.I rate the book at 3.5 stars."
261,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66672731-michael-jandrok,4,"I have always been interested in food culture, though I would have never considered myself to be a “foodie” in the strictest sense. That term always carried a bit of hipster baggage to my mind. I would tend to picture modern U.S. food culture as a sort of hummus-slathered menu dominated by low-fat recipes meant to reflect the popular diet trends of the day. Those attitudes began to change for me when I was diagnosed with cancer. Suddenly food became a big deal for me, first as something that I actively avoided as my appetite dwindled and my daily routine ran to getting as many calories in my body as I could, regardless of the delivery system. As someone living with colorectal cancer, food was a tough sell for me as the disease progressed. My tastes changed and most foods that I used to love became alien to me. But a funny thing happened as my treatment started to take hold and my appetite slowly began to return. I began to consciously embrace “foodie” culture with an eye towards expanding my palate and eating healthier. A big part of this ongoing effort has been educating myself on what would be the “right” things to eat given that I had a disease that directly affected my tastes and digestive functions. I didn’t want specific “diet” books, per se. What I wanted and needed was comprehensive information on what constitutes food itself, with an eye towards the science and sociology of developing better food habits and cooking techniques. Before my disease took hold, I was a 5’5”, 165 pound ball of muscle and muffin top, still trying to fit into size 34 jeans. At the peak of the cancer, when I was at my lowest point physically, I was 106 pounds and looked like a shell of my former self. After a year and a half of treatment, I am back up to 140 pounds, due in large part to eating better and making more informed choices as to the food that I put into my body. I can thank books like “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” for giving me a respectable knowledge base to make those wise culinary decisions. Author Michael Pollan has been writing about food for many years now. This book was originally published in 2006 and was one of his earlier efforts at culinary writing. The material has aged well. I do think that we have become a bit smarter as a food culture in the intervening years, but the basic information presented here is still valid and useful. I will take a moment here to caution prospective readers that Pollan’s visit to a large-scale feedlot and the rendering plant is graphic and somewhat disturbing. One can’t read these sections and not begin to question what it means to consume beef. The premise of the text is pretty simple and the nature of the ""omnivore's dilemma"" can be summed up quite nicely: as creatures that can eat virtually anything, the big question can be defined as ""what SHOULD we eat?” Pollan sets out to find the answer to this question by tracing 4 meals back to their sources. IN the course of the book he dissects a fast food meal, a store-bought organic entree, a ""beyond organic"" meal produced entirely at a polyculture farm, and a meal that he hunts and gathers (almost) entirely by himself. Along the way, he asks the reader to join him in his quest for a more thorough knowledge of the food that we eat and a better understanding of how the decisions that we make as food consumers help to shape our cultural and physical landscape.This is an intensely interesting book, and an important addition to the bookshelf for anyone interested in becoming more ""food-aware"". Pollan's journey is always engaging, sometimes spiritual (""we are what we eat…."" takes on a new dimension when one stops to look at it with this much depth), and occasionally frightening. He is always respectful of his cast of characters, and he is willing to challenge his own preconceptions and ideas as he gathers knowledge and experience. Note that there are no recipes to be found within these pages, nor any specific information on the art of cooking. This is a book that is fully invested in talking about food as a consumer product; what it is, where it comes from, and what the impacts and implications are when you decide to make a food consumption choice.Michael Pollan strikes me as a fairly engaging and nice guy. I’d like to sit down to a meal with him and talk shop. I learned a lot from this book that I can actively put into practice as I seek to modify my eating habits with an eye towards maximum health benefits. Along with that I gained some ways to make more responsible choices as a food consumer, and that’s just as important as the health angle for me. I’ll be seeking out more of Pollan’s food writing.Coda #1: After reading a number of reviews for this book, I can honestly say that this is a pretty polarizing piece of writing. A substantial number of vegetarians and vegans panned the book because of its acceptance of what Pollan would call “responsible” meat consumption. And there is no doubt that the author does indeed support the idea that eating meat can be done in an ethical fashion. I won’t rehash the arguments in the reviews here. Having a background in anthropology I can tell you that from a biological perspective humans have absolutely evolved as omnivores. Those canine teeth in your mouth didn’t appear because primates had an exclusively vegetarian diet, they are there specifically for the catching of prey and the tearing of meat. That said, we would do well as a species to eat a lot LESS meat, and there is no denying the environmental damage that is done by widespread meat consumption. Coda #2: That idea of responsible meat consumption is central to Pollan’s ideas. But it’s larger than just meat. The whole idea here is to gain a more thorough understanding of where our food comes from and from there develop better and more responsible food habits. Modern supermarket culture has taken away a lot of the basic knowledge of food...where it comes from, how it is grown or raised, etc. Pollan states outright that we would all be better off if we once again gained a real connection to our food, one that goes well beyond opening a can or a package and dropping something into a pot to warm it up. That concept alone makes “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” valuable and worthwhile.Coda #3: Another criticism of the book centered on Pollan himself, and the idea that the concepts in “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” can only be absorbed and put into action by an affluent audience. I’m not really sure I buy this argument. It’s true that “foodie” culture seems to have a footprint squarely in a sort of urban-hipster vibe, but the fact is that lower-income folks can put any of the ideas in this book into action just the same as any other demographic. In point, much has been made in the news lately of the current regime’s idea to hand out “food boxes” in place of letting assistance recipients make their own food choices. That would mean a direct impact on the farmer’s markets who accept assistance payments. That tells me that plenty of lower-income people have learned how to make healthy and ethical culinary choices that stretch their food dollars to the max. "

264,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/693262-huyen,5," If i could think of this book as a meal, then indeed Michael Pollan is a marvelous cook. He writes well, vividly and convincingly.As dense and informative as it is, the book doesn't make me feel bloated, but nourished :] I can't remember the last time I have discussed a book so many times, with so many different people. Chapter 17 on the ethics of eating animals is just mind-blowing and alone can make this book a worthwhile read.i can't resist talking about it before anything else. I've tried to become a vegetarian a couple of times and have always eventually lapsed back into eating meat. The main reason I would ever become a vegetarian is environmental, the huge amount of energy expended in producing and preserving meat. I've always found the ethics of eating meat hard to defend on the moral basis. And it's fascinating to see a person do it convincingly like Pollan. Pollan starst with Peter Singer's argument against eating meat. A wonderfully simple but powerful idea: ""if possessing a higher degree of intelligence does not entitle one human to use another for his or her own ends, how can it entitle humans to exploit non-humans for the same purpose?"". Leaving aside the problematic question of how we define animal ""intelligence"", there is no debate as to whether animals can suffer. And if we have extended equal rights to women, minorities, homosexuals, should we and why don't we extend these rights to other species? ouch. most people, like me, when faced with this question and thinking about it seriously, either look away or become vegetarians. it is difficult to reconcile our instincts to eat meat and the moral implications of it. but Pollan shows us that those are not the only two alternatives.He argues that while animals rightists have always stressed the suffering of animals due to our meat eating habits (although we have rather slim evidence of exactly what goes on in the brain of a pig about to go to heaven, (or hell?)), they have also failed to acknowledge that humans are capable of giving animals a decent and happy life. and ""happy"" in this case means the ability to do what they would naturally do, either pigs rooting around in the dirt, or cows wandering on pastures. ""to think of domestication as a form of slavery or even exploitation is to miscontrue that whole relationship-to project a human idea or power onto what is in fact an example of mutualism or symbiosis between species."" as he points out, domestication is an evolutionary development. domesticated animals have a much higher chance of surviving than in the wild, compare dogs and wolves for example. they therefore evolve to serve human benefits, winning our favor, in order to be provided with shelter and protection. they probably don't like being killed very much, but if that gives them a longer life and a much better chance to spread their genes to the next generation, they would much rather be with us than be in nature. ""predation is not a matter of morality or of politics, it, too, is a matter of symbiosis. from the point of view of the individual prey animal predation is a horror, but from the point of view of the group-and of its gene pool-it is indispensable."" That is exactly the point that most animals rightists miss. they concern only with individuals, but nature doesn't work that way, no matter how cruel that might sound. nature is about maximizing the survival of the whole species. our morals were developed to help us function as a healthy, cooperative society, but it is rather irrelevant to what should happen in nature.Pollan charges that this very embraced and apparently self-righteous ""ideology"" is a product of an urban society which has lost touch with nature. A friend of mine told me that he took his children to a slaughterhouse to see how pigs are killed because he believes that if we want to eat meat, we should be able to face the morality involved in it. that, i think, is a respectable viewpoint. the children were slightly disturbed but it didn't stop them eating meat. this father is probably an exception in our society. most of us probably have never raised a cow and seen a cow. our meat comes from nice little packages that never remind us of that it comes from something that used to have a brain and can suffer. when i asked my NZ friends why people no longer eat animal organs, like we do in Vietnam, they stared at me with disturbed looks. but really, when you think about it, offal is very nutritious, and there's little reason why we can accept eating meat, but not kidney, heart, or brain. i suspect the reason is the viscera brings home to us the fact that what we are eating used to be quite similar to us, which means, having eyes, lungs, heart. and we are so scared to face that reality that we get rid of it altogether. the second reason is that once the meat production process is out of sight, we have lost the traditional rituals justifying the act of killing and governing the slaughter of animals. the disappearance of these old practices gives way to the brutalization of animals to the extent that the animals become so sick that we have pretty much run out of anti-biotics.but that is not the same as to say that we can eat meat carefree without any moral consideration. given the fact that our food chain has become increasingly industrialized and heavily dependent on fossil fuels, we do have a moral obligation to care about the health of nature, i.e, the condition of the soil, the health of the animals we eat, the impact of animal farming on the environment. I can't agree more with him that while we don't need or arguably shouldn't give up our meat consumption, we should at least make sure that the way we eat is sustainable and the animals we eat are treated decently. the way that animals are treated in most farms is quite despicable. and i bet that if we had a chance to look at it, most would quite happily choose to be vegetarian. giving animals a humane treatment does not only give us a clear conscience but really serves our benefits as well. who would not want to eat a healthy chicken instead of a disease-ridden one? recently, when a documentary about the treatment of pigs in battery farms in NZ was broadcast on TV, the public displayed outrage at what they saw and have pushed quite vigorously for legislation prohibiting cruel treatment of farm animals  see here. i don't know of progress elsewhere. i like the idea that once the public know about what's happening to what they eat, they can make a difference.most of the rest of the book deals with corn and how our (meaning American) food chain has been reduced to a monoculture of soy and corn. they are present in something like 75% of the processed food products on the market. 40% of the calories a Mexican eats comes from food. if you think that's quite astonishing, then apparently American have overtaken Mexicans to be kings of walking corns. corn became the winner in the competition to be human's favorite crop because of its capacity to store a lot more calories than other species. the invention of fertilizers (interestingly made widely available by the surplus ammonium nitrate after the war) made growing corn so incredibly efficient that corn gradually replaced all other crops. and in the 1950s, feeding cattle on feedlots was cheaper than on grass, enabling the farmers to build massive chicken factories. livestock farmers went out of business because they couldn't compete with giant factories. fertilizer was a mixed blessing because the soil fertility shifted from reliance on the sun and a careful rotation of crops, to fossil fuels. we might like to think that fertilizers make agriculture a lot more efficient, but in fact, we expend twice as much energy to produce corn than when we relied on nature. and that's not to mention the huge cost of environmental pollution.when corn got cheaper and cheaper, the Nixon government stepped in to subsidize it, encouraging growing even more corn of lower nutritional quality and sparking the beginning of agribusiness. the excess corn finds its way into most processed energy-dense foods and feeding livestock. getting rid of this huge amount of excess energy contributes to obesity and an impoverished food culture. it makes good economic sense to dump excess corn on cattle, but biologically, they evolved to eat grass, and being forced to eat something they are not supposed to eat has caused grave problems. in a shit hole with piles of waste, polluted air and water and no space to even wiggle their tails, the only way these cows can survive is to swallow humongous amounts of anti-biotics. that sounds quite depressing, but the organic industry doesn't really hold a torch toward a moral utopia as we would hope. Pollan points out that the organic industry has diverged exponentially from its original ideals in the 1960s, and is now not so much better than the establishment. they consume a huge amount of energy to transport their products across the country, most ""free range"" farms mean that the chicken has a palm-sized window to look at the sun 5 minutes a day. real organic farmers have a hard time to get their products on the market because of government regulations. to me it seems like America's unsustainable food consumption is perpetuated by a cycle of ignorance and government intervention. so much for laissez-faire capitalism. growing so much corn might seem to make good economic sense. we must admit that it's quite remarkable that this is the first time in human history, we can produce food so cheaply and so abundantly. but this is the thing that has always not sat right with me about economics. that it hides all the expensive external costs involved in the process: environmental degradation, costs to the government in terms of subsidies, a huge consumption of fossil fuels, public health and malnourishment. so in fact, eating cheap corn is very expensive. so the key question is WHY is America doing all these things that defy logic? to summarize the whole story in one word, I'd say efficiency. feeding corn to livestock is so much cheaper and easier than grass (don't have to wait for grass to grow). and it supports a legion of other industries: the chemical and biotech industries, the food industry, the oil industry, pharma, agribusiness. If we keep in mind that hunter-gathers didn't become agriculturists out of choice, but because they depleted the animals they were hunting, it makes me worry what will happen to us when we deplete our soil and degrade our environment so the same disastrous extent. the food price riots in 2007/8 give us a glance at how depressing such a world would be.but this book isn't just depressing, it's enlightening and inspiring. it shows us that there ARE alternatives to the status quo: eat local, subscribe to a farm you know, and as he says in ""In defense of food"", then simply ""eat food, not too much, mostly plants"". I find Michael Pollan a remarkable writer, very humble and articulate. I can't recommend this book too highly."
265,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,5,"We are a notably unhealthy people obsessed by the idea of eating healthily (p. 3).Michael Pollan's Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals is a critique of industrial farms: they raise animals shoulder to shoulder standing in their own manure, feeding them foods that they are not designed for and which make them ill, and then use chemicals to compensate for these sins. Who knew that we are corn-eaters – not directly, like Mexicans, but through our cattle and chickens, and in processed foods.“When you look at the isotope ratios,.. we North Americans look like corn chips with legs.” Compared to us, Mexicans today consume a far more varied carbon diet: the animals they eat still eat grass (until recently, Mexicans regarded feeding corn to livestock as a sacrilege); much of their protein comes from legumes; and they still sweeten their beverages with cane sugar."" (p. 23)Pollan looks at industrial and pastoral farms, briefly flirts with being a vegetarian, then becomes a hunter/gatherer. He doesn't ""look"" the way I would, but goes out in the field, visiting and working farms, learning to hunt (and kill), and to gather wild mushrooms. Each major step on his journey is punctuated with a meal.Our typical, industrial farm, Pollan argues, is not healthy for us (making us obese), not healthy for the animals (making them ill), and not healthy for the soil and environment (using vast amounts of oil to raise food in a monoculture). He may something good about this kind of farming, but I've forgotten it. This farming is good for conglomerates – making them rich – but not farmers or consumers.His week on Joel Salatin's pastoral farm is fascinating – even for me, a vegetarian of more than 40 years. Salatin is a libertarian, deeply suspicious of government and governmental intervention. However, hw is a scientist's kind of farmer. He recognizes that everything is connected, so considers how to balance the activity and placement of cattle, chickens, pigs, and trees, each entering an environmental niche at a time that makes sense for the animals and farm, keeping all healthy while being largely chemical-free. As Salatin argues:""Society is not bearing the cost of water pollution, of antibiotic resistance, of food-borne illnesses, of crop subsidies, of subsidized oil and water—of all the hidden costs to the environment and the taxpayer that make cheap food seem cheap. No thinking person will tell you they don’t care about all that. I tell them the choice is simple: You can buy honestly priced food or you can buy irresponsibly priced food.” (p. 243)Finally, Omnivore's Dilemma is an ode to mindful, grounded eating, praising the food from Salatin's farm, but also that hunted and gathered in Sonoma and the Bay Area of California. He drools not just as be eats, but as he prepares to do so (although some of what he must do brings him close to losing his lunch), For Pollan, a meal that is eaten in full consciousness of what it took to make it is worth preparing every now and again, if only as a way to remind us of the true costs of the things we take for granted (pp. 409-410). He ends up in favor of locally-grown and harvested foods, foods with few chemicals, foods where we own the costs of eating.Pollan convinces me – not to eat cow, as some parts of Omnivore's Dilemma would be well-served with Sinclair Lewis's The Jungle. He does convince me to invest in local farms. I had been considering dropping my CSA membership in favor of the farmer's market, but decided against this so I support local farmers (mine is a cooperative of 12 Amish farms and includes a handwritten letter by one farmer each week). We have been decreasing our consumption of processed foods, but Omnivore's Dilemma will likely speed up this process. And, I will hesitate – I can't promise more – the next time I am looking at vegetables from half-way around the world.As Claude Lévi-Strauss argued, food must be “not only good to eat, but also good to think” (quoted on p. 289). Pollan's food-writing is thoughtful, and I enjoyed Omnivore's Dilemma as much for the writing as the content. And, he is dryly humorous.Pollan clears Lévi-Strauss's bar."
266,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/394959-susan,2,"While I read this book, I couldn't help but think about the muckrakers of the early 20th century. This book is pretty much nothing like The Jungle, starting with the fact that it is nonfiction, but its goal isn't that far away. It's telling a story about a part of our food industry that we don't normally think to ask about and painting a picture that should make us angry enough to do something about it.And don't get me wrong, Pollan rakes a lot of really good muck. Mostly it's his interpretation of his muck that doesn't work for me.I think the really important information comes in the first half of the book. Pollan gives us a crash course in agriculture subsidies. He compares our currently corn-focused subsidy structure to historic subsidies that were geared toward a broader spectrum of food. Then he goes into detail about what it means to live in a food chain that is designed to produce the most corn at the cheapest price. The answer? Corn is essentially in every processed food we eat. Meanwhile, corn farmers can barely keep their farms afloat because the price has been pushed down so far that they can barely produce enough product to cover their mortgages, and they dump so much fertilizer onto their fields to raise production that it ends up leeching into the water supply all the way to the ocean.Pollan then takes the corn story to the cattle industry and gives us a pretty ugly picture of what it means to raise corn-fed cattle. We thought that corn-fed cattle were a good thing, right? It's advertised on the stickers on our steaks. Except that cow biology rejects corn. The resulting situation not only makes the lives of the cows highly questionable at best, but it presents some very real health concerns for we the consumers.Buying organic fixes the problem, right? Wrong. Large-scale organic produce and livestock may not be what you think they are. Think your chickens are free-range? That just means they need to have access to the outdoors, which they are trained never to use. Corporate organic livestock is raised in environments little better than its non-organic counterpart, and they're probably fed corn too.OTOH, Pollock's story actually made me more positive about organic produce. One thing that organic regulations do accomplish is requiring a use of fertilizer that is not nearly so destructive to the environment.All of this stuff is good stuff to know. In fact, I'd like to look for some other sources of this information so I deepen my knowledge and cross-check Pollan. The place where he loses me is in his interpretation.This book got a lot of people justifiably riled up about the quality of their food and the state of their food production. And where does Pollan direct them? To back yard gardens and small family farming operations. In large part from this book, the bourgeois Localvore movement sprang up. So if you have enough money to pay twice the price for your food or the free time to produce it yourself, then you can have the satisfaction of opting out of the flawed food chain while leaving it essentially unimproved. A whole new luxury food industry has grown up to provide local food to the Localvores. Meanwhile, the corn subsidies and all their consequences continue unabated.The problem as I see it is that Pollan wraps up aesthetics with his practicality. Aesthetically, he is drawn to family farms where there are a lot more workers per square acre, a larger variety of produce and livestock are produced, and resources are used in a way he perceives as more efficient. The problem is that these qualities might make him feel good, but they don't actually address most of the problems he brought up in his muckraking. One of the sections that got my goat most was a several-page indictment of Value Added. You see, when companies make breakfast cereal, they take corn, puff it up, color it, put sugar on it, and (gasp) sell it for more than the price of the corn! The horrors of those corporate money grubbers!Look. Value Added is a core economic concept. I don't suppose Pollan expected people to pay the same amount for his book as the cost of the wood pulp used to make the paper. I suppose he wanted to be paid more for writing it than the cost of the computer he composed it on. And what's his solution to paying for overpriced processed corn? To pay more for food that comes from the right farm. So which Value Added is legitimate and which one isn't? It seems to me that food production needs four core traits. It needs to be: - Responsible: Producing it doesn't destroy the land, the water supply, or the consumers. - Plentiful: There's enough produced to feed everyone. - Reliable: Every weather fluctuation doesn't put us in danger of a shortage or a famine. - Cheap: Affordable to as many people as possible who need to eat.Pollan really only addresses the first of these four issues, and that in an incomplete manner. His solutions pretty much stomp on Plentiful and Cheap. Back yard gardens and family farms are not going to be able to produce enough food to feed a majority of Americans, no matter what they are willing to pay. It's really too bad that we couldn't have directed a lot more of this food production anger toward agricultural subsidy reform instead."
267,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/165589-gwen,3,"The first section of the book, in which Pollan follows the path of corn through the industrial food chain and discusses the effects of corn on our diets, supermarkets, and the environment, is fascinating. Despite being trained in the sociology of agriculture and specifically in the analysis of commodity chains, I learned a lot and found few details to quibble with (the main exception being his tendency to anthropomorphize corn, discussing it as though it intentionally chose to evolve in certain ways). If I were teaching a class on food, I would totally assign that section of the book.The second section of the book is also good, though not as great as the first. Probably this is because I already knew that ""organic"" and ""sustainable"" are not the same and that Horizon-brand organic dairy products come from huge dairies that, from the point of view of the cow, the quality of the milk, and the environment, are little better than regular non-organic ones.But the final section is really annoying me. Most of the things that are irritating me are much more clearly discussed at http://www.powells.com/review/2007_08..., but there were a few other things as well. Pollan keeps talking about how only omnivores have any trouble deciding what to eat, using koalas and cows as examples of animals that, being specialists, don't need to worry about whether something is an acceptable food source or not. Anyone who raises cows will tell you he's highly underestimating cows' experimentation with non-grass foods. They eat weeds and poisonous plants; they get nails and wire and bones stuck in their throats. It's a pain in the ass to have to try to remove a deer vertebra some cow has managed to lodge in her throat. I suppose this seems like a minor detail, except his entire argument is that humans (and other omnivores) are unique in facing problems deciding what is and isn't safe to eat.Connected to that is Pollan's reference to ""human nature"" from time to time, something that drives me nuts when my students do it and is even more exasperating from someone who at least ostensibly has the intellectual capacity and training to not fall back on such a simplistic explanation (that is, ""humans do it, therefore it's human nature""). He seems to buy in to the popular conception that there's a ""human nature"" that we've just smeared a little civilization and culture on top of (think of frosting on a cake).I don't think I can finish the book--I'm increasingly irritated by his tone and the problems with his argument. It's too bad, because the book really did start off well."
268,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20495277-anny,4,"Truly an eye-opener! I absolutely loved the first part of the book about the industrial agriculture. I would've never thought that our humble 'corn' is actually the tyrant of mono-culture farming. Farmers went broke, took a huge debt, taking side jobs driving trailers and depended on their wife salary for the sake of planting corn. Animals (cow, pig, chicken) got ousted from the farm and pasture and cramped into CAFO a.k.a. concentration camp for animals, where they live their short miserable life. First, they were fed food (corn or dubious meat-by-product or whatever cheapest feed available) that is making them sick and making us who eat them sick (mad cows anyone?). Second, they were cramped as much as physically possible, resulting in stressed, depressed, and psychotic animals (often resorting to self-mutilation or cannibalism). Third, they were doused with much antibiotics and medications (because their living conditions made them sick) and hormones and whatnot (to fatten them as much as possible) with who knows what side-effects that might cause for us (antibiotic-resistant bacteria for example).Taking the stand against industrial agriculture were small farms, like Polyface farm owned by Joel Salatin. If CAFO were hell for animals, then Polyface farm must be its heaven. There were so many good things about this farm, suffice to say, if I could buy from there (or any other place that practice sustainable agriculture), I would certainly do so. The last part of the book about hunting and gathering was the part that I liked the least. Too many pages rambling on and on about the ethics of killing animals. It's a weak finish, but the first two parts of the book was definitely worth reading!"
269,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/327527-missy-jean,5,"I can say without hesitation that this is a life-changing book. It's elegantly written and unflinching. Pollan is honest about his own cognitive dissonance about being an omnivore, which means he never sounds self-righteous (an impressive feat for the genre). And I love the widespread anthropomorphism of the book, the mysticism that Pollan is willing to embrace as he cites scientific sources.That said... Halfway through the book I was so depressed that I went home and ate graham crackers dipped in a can of chocolate frosting. All I could think was, so there's no choice! I am going to eat chemicals and toxins and animal byproducts unwittingly every day of my life, and they are going to kill me in the end! By the end of the book, though, I felt like I had a real sense of small measures that I can take to eat in a healthier and more environmentally responsible way. So I went to the farmstand and bought a big old pile of locally-grown buttercup squash, peaches, chard and zucchini. Better than synthetic frosting, right?I think there are a lot of different conclusions that people can draw from this book, and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who wants to be more mindful about what they eat. For me, it validated my penchant for vegetarianism (and my habitual eschewing of McDonalds), but you might get something slightly different from it. (Pollan is not a vegetarian.) Honestly, I don't think I'll ever look at my plate in quite the same way again, and I feel grateful for that."
270,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82365956-veronica,4,"""Yet there are other images of animals on other kinds of farms that contradict the nightmare ones. I'm thinking of the hens I saw at Polyface Farm, fanning out over the cow pasture on a June morning, pecking at the cowpats and the grass...or the image of pig happiness I witnessed in that cattle barn in March, watching the hogs, all upturned pink hams and corkscrew tails, nosing their way through that deep cake of compost in search of alcoholic morsels of corn. It is true that farms like this are but a speck on the monolith of modern animal agriculture, yet their very existence, and the possibility that implies, throws the whole argument for animal rights into a different light."" Pollan knows that the so-called happiness at Polyface Farm could never be scaled to a magnitude sufficient to feed the many required. ""To many animal people even Polyface Farm is a 'death camp'—a way station for doomed creatures awaiting their date with the executioner. But to look at the lives of these animals is to see this holocaust analogy for the sentimental conceit it really is. In the same way we can probably recognize animal suffering when we see it, animal happiness is unmistakable, too, and during my week on the farm I saw it in abundance.""I will permit the possibility of brief animal happiness on a small farm right before the slaughter. Still, the inconvenient reality is that human agriculture contravenes the natural order of predation because we are the only creatures that bring animals into existence in order to slaughter them. The lion does not raise and propagate zebras in a nested enclosure indefinitely and delight in creating more and more efficient ways of slaughtering their offspring. This apparently small detail is conveniently left out in arguments from nature, as I will call them. ""To think of domestication as a form of slavery or even exploitation is to misconstrue that whole relationship—to project a human idea of power onto what is in fact an example of mutualism or symbiosis, rather than a political, development. The animals grew tame and lost their ability to fend for themselves in the wild and the humans traded hunter-gatherer ways for the settled lives of agriculturists. Humans changed biologically, too.""Don't equate the domestication of wolves to the slaughter of chicks. Red herring fallacy. ""[This] is where the animal rightists betray a deep ignorance about the workings of nature."" Again, there is nothing natural about industrial agriculture. ""The very existence of predation in nature, of animals eating animals, is the cause of much anguished hand-wringing in the animal rights literature. 'It must be admitted,' Peter Singer writes, 'that the existence of carnivorous animals does pose one problems for the ethics of Animal Liberation, and that is whether we should do anything about it.' (Talk about the need for peacekeeping forces!)""On the one hand, this made me laugh a bit because I've always been disturbed by the existence of predation in the wild. That many creatures rely on the pain and suffering of other animals in order to live is but a testament to the fallen state of the world, which is also why Jupiter is a purer and superior planet to Earth. But I digress. (My sister has christened this Jupiter propaganda🪐, which I readily admit.)In any event, I've already unravelled this false equivalency between natural predation and the very systematic multiplication of animals bred for the slaughter, season after season. From doom to dust.""Today, the organic food industry finds itself in a most unexpected, uncomfortable, and yes, unsustainable position: floating on a sinking sea of petroleum.""""U.S. agricultural policy, like the Declaration of Independence, is founded on the principle that all carrots are created equal, even though there's good reason to believe this isn't really true.""Birds can't get access to the outdoors until at least 5 weeks old and are slaughtered at 7, so ""free range turns out to be not so much a lifestyle for these chickens as a two-week vacation option.""""From the moment an organic lettuce plant is ready for harvest, the rest of its journey from field to produce aisle follows a swift and often ingenious industrial logic that is only nominally organic.""The fact that steer are given numbers as names makes Holocaust comparisons all too facile...""The farmers desperate to boost yield end up degrading their land, plowing and planting marginal land, applying more nitrogen—anything to squeeze a few more bushels from the soil.""""Nor would such a culture be shocked to discover that there are other countries, such as Italy and France, that decide their dinner questions on the basis of such quaint and unscientific criteria as pleasure and tradition, eat all manner of 'unhealthy' foods, and, lo and behold, wind up actually healthier and happier in their eating than we are. We show our surprise at this by speaking of something called the 'French paradox,' for how could a people who eat such demonstrably toxic substance as foie gras and triple crème cheese actually be slimmer and healthier than we are? Yet I wonder if it doesn't make more sense to speak in terms of an American paradox—that is, a notably unhealthy people obsessed by the idea of eating heathily."""
271,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73483095-cynnamon,0,"I bought this book, because I had thouroughly enjoyed Michael Pollans ""Cooking"".But here I give up.I have read around 100 pages about corn. I learned a lot I didn't know before, but unfortunately I didn't care about my newly acquired knowledge.Also the book is completely US-centric, which makes it for me as an European not quite so interesting.This book is outside of my scope of interest, therefore I refrain from assigning a rating."
272,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,5,"I really like Pollan’s writing style, he brings points home with simplicity, and he is able to cover a lot of ground without the writing feelings unnecessarily circuitous or blustery. More than that though, I like that he is willing to experience. I mean, that’s the very core of responsible journalism, Pollan goes and works on the farms, he helps slaughter chickens, he sits in tractors, he goes hunting and foraging, he throws himself bodily and emotionally into these experiences, and at each point I felt that he was incredibly honest with both himself and the reader about the impacts of his actions and his emotional state.All in all I thought it was refreshingly non-biased, fair appraising look at industrial agriculture/ranching, industrial/artisanal organic agriculture/ranching, and hunting/foraging. I say that as a person literally smack dab in the middle of row-crop country (my husband and his family farms), as a gardener, and as a hunter. I’ve long had a problem with the way we raise meat in this country, and the lack of connection between people and their food. Its one of the reasons that I do hunt and garden, and its also one of the reasons that I’ve mostly switched to plant proteins for all meals except supper. I am continuing to try and evolve how I eat, and it’s a learning experience and I don’t always get it right (I ate spaghettio’s twice in three days last week, no one’s perfect). But its hard to read this book without examining the role that we eaters have in the natural world. I am going to make a concerted effort to eat in-season vegetables except for those that I froze from my garden in the summer, and I’m going to try and rely on our game meats more. Despite reading much about early life on the prairie, somehow I had never considered that even meat was seasonal, or that foods grown out of season lack the nutrition that we think we are getting. They’re both very “duh” concepts, but its not something that I had really appreciated. Nor had I valued the waste of petroleum in shipping year round under-nourished produce from Argentina to the US just so that we could eat whatever fruit or veggie that we want, despite its lack of flavor.Perhaps the greatest thing that came from this was the conversations with my husband. He listened to the audiobook while in the tractor, and it was great to talk to him when he came home at night about the ways agriculture has changed since Pollan wrote (advances in technology have changed the level of precision for farmers, becoming more environmentally friendly for those that upgrade), but also the ways that it could continue to change. What could we do as eaters, hunters, buyers, and producers in our local community? Books that foster conversation and change always get a 5 out of 5.Absolutely recommend to everyone. Read those food labels. Speak out. We deserve, as buyers, connectivity and information about our food, and animals especially deserve better than what we manage for our convenience."
273,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/307041-ginny-messina,3,"A truly important book by gifted writer and journalist Michael Pollan. It's not without its flaws, however, and for all the promise of the first two-thirds of the book, it kind of leaves the reader hanging at the end. In the first part, Pollan exposes the damaging effects of industrial agriculture, and—-importantly—-this includes large-scale organic production which is not nearly as benign as most people would like to believe. Later in the book he addresses the inhumane aspect of industrial agriculture as well—-organic production included. He puts it succinctly: you look away, or you stop eating meat. In the second part of the book, we see farming as it should be, on Polyface Farm in the Shenandoah Valley. Here, farming practices are closely tied to nature including the natural behavior of farm animals. While the system doesn't adhere completely to organic regulations, it is far more sustainable and humane than industrial organic agriculture and certainly more so than conventional agriculture. Polyface Farm is not able to separate itself from industrial agriculture completely (by law, the steer are killed in conventional slaughterhouses) but it still seems like a very nice place. Unfortunately, the scale on which it operates means that this type of sustainable farming can never produce enough food for the U.S. population. Food from farms like Polyface is likely to be available to only a privileged few. The last part of the book struck me as downright nonsensical. Pollan explores the possibility of putting together the ultimate local meal—-one composed of food that he himself has hunted, gathered and grown. But don't try this at home, he says. It is not at all a realistic way to eat. Well—-no—-not if you do it by gathering chanterelle mushrooms with a bunch of chefs from Chez Panisse, hunting wild boar in the California woods, and diving for abalone along a rocky coast. Granted, most Americans would be hard-pressed to produce their own food, but Pollan doesn't even explore the option in any kind of realistic or meaningful fashion. In the end, it appears that the problems associated with food production are insurmountable. Industrial agriculture provides most of the food in this country and is a wasteful and unsustainable system. But more sustainable systems are not realistic for feeding the population. Pollan does not offer any clear cut answers, much to my surprise. (I didn't expect him to solve the problem; I did expect a little guidance!) But the thoughtful reader can still pull together a plan of action to minimize the environmental and ethical cost of a meal. Reduce intake of animal foods. Buy locally-produced food. Grow or produce as much as is realistic for you. Pollan makes his readers think about where their meals come from and how to measure the true cost of our ""inexpensive"" food. This is a must-read for anyone who expresses a desire to live and eat responsibly. "

277,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147289-jason-pettus,5,"Journalist Michael Pollan has a reputation for writing books that people don't just like, but whose very lives get permanently changed because of reading them; and I can attest that this exact thing has happened to me after reading my first book of his, the extraordinary 2006 guide to modern food practices known as The Omnivore's Dilemma. In it, Pollan imagines three typical meals a contemporary American might eat -- one of fast food, one of Whole Foods-type groceries, and one literally put together through foraging and hunting -- then over the course of 60,000 words shows us exactly, step by minute step, how the ingredients in each meal can be traced back and back until finally reaching a point of a living plant being grown in the ground somewhere, then building us back forward again by showing exactly what happens to that plant step by step as it makes its way from the farm to eventually our mouths.Along the way, then, Pollan gives us an astute history of the post-war industrial agricultural industry; explains why exactly corn is the overwhelming number-one crop now grown in America; gives us the horrifying reasons that most cattle and chicken have to be fed so many antibiotics in order to merely survive under such harsh industrial conditions; demonstrates why in a middle-class consumerist society these conditions have to happen in the first place (that is, because if cows were still grown in the humane way they were in an agricultural society, a McDonald's hamburger would cost $30, and the American people would riot); shows through personal field trips what exactly the difference is between ""cage-free,"" ""free range"" and ""pastured"" eggs, and why one of these options is infinitely better than the others; details why the term ""organic"" on a food label can mean vastly different things depending on the company and circumstances; and shows through illuminating first-hand experience why we are no longer a hunter-gatherer society (namely, because it's exhausting, inefficient, and makes people run the risk of sometimes going entire weeks at a time without finding anything edible to eat).Easily the most interesting book I've read in a decade, The Omnivore's Dilemma has permanently changed the way I now shop for groceries, knowing as I now do so many more details about what each label on a package means, and how different growing circumstances can often literally mean a difference in the resulting food's nutrition (just for one example, how Pollan scientifically proves here that eggs from chickens that are allowed to roam freely on farmland are literally better for you than eggs grown from chickens kept in cages); and although I haven't completely given up fast food, certainly every hamburger I now buy makes me ponder the indescribably monstrous and cruel circumstances by which that cow lived its life, which has already influenced just how many hamburgers I buy in general. (It also makes me understand a lot better why there will always be people around in any society who are more than happy to perform that society's most inhumane tasks, such as rounding up undocumented immigrants, ripping their children away from them, and throwing them into concentration camps while openly laughing in their faces...but that's neither here nor there, I suppose.) To tell the truth, the only reason I read this in the first place was because I was waiting for the day in early June that Pollan's newest book came out, a 600-page whopper called How to Change Your Mind that looks in exhaustive detail at all the latest 21st-century research into the connections between psychedelic drugs, mindfulness, meditation, mental health, what MRIs can teach us about what we've traditionally called the ""soul,"" and a lot more. That book is now finished too, and was just as fascinating as The Omnivore's Dilemma, so keep an eye out for my write-up of that in another couple of weeks.UPDATE 1: I find it utterly fascinating that the only negative reviews here of this book are from vegetarians, who are so upset at Pollan's conclusion that humans as omnivores are perfectly capable of eating meat, they're willing to dismiss every single other vegetarian-friendly thing he has to say. (Ultimately Pollan is pro-vegetable in this book, despite concluding that meat is indeed an edible substance that humans find edible.) A huge part of this book is all about how the politics of any given age has a huge influence over our opinions on the supposedly ""scientifically objective"" subjects of diet and nutrition, and the vitriolic negative reviews of the book by militant vegetarians here simply proves his point all over again.UPDATE 2: After reading other people's reviews, I agree with something I saw a lot of people mention; that a clear sign of how much I loved this book is that people at Twitter eventually got sick of me constantly tweeting about it while I was reading it. Be prepared to drive your friends and spouse crazy!"

Well, Actually, Eat Sh*t and Flourish. Each of these would have been a more classy title for the book ""Omnivore's Dilemma"". To paraphrase another reviewer 'The dude structures this book by following the path of four finished meals from origin to plate - one McDonald's meal, one comprised of supermarket organic products, one from a ""beyond-organic"" self-sustaining farm in Virginia, and one he forages almost entirely on his own. This book tries to provokes a lot of thought about the origins of our food and the biological, political, social and economic implications of those origins, and for the most part, it is successful.' So after reading this book I realize that maybe, just maybe, I don’t argue with people about food enough. Ever since I read  Fast Food Nation  and watched  Supersize Me  I have been pretty good about avoiding eating at Mc-stablishments and drinking soda. Knowing these efforts aren’t enough, but not having had the ...chutzpah ... to make the leap to full fledged, ""morally superior"" vegetarianism. I am way to lazy to manage an urban garden, -- preferring rather to watch one made on TV OD presents, as a moral alternative to growing, actually hunting and eating wild game. The parts of the book that describe this stuff, although not seemingly not feasible, reinforced these previously formed notions about foraging. Still, it is pretty interesting to see the details fleshed out.One thing discussed in the book that i hadn't internalized, and that makes sense when I think about it, is that going to whole foods and buying an organic Chilean artichoke in the winter can be a lot worse ethically than eating a fat juicy steak from a locally raised mature grass fed cow. I guess that the ethical answer culled from the book on how to shop food in the city is to buy at farmers markets or join one of these CSA’s. Take the extra step and get to know your farmer, know how they grow, know how they feed and treat the animals is the right thing to do. This seems like undue effort and cost but the ethical equivalent seems to be to hunt and dress bloody dead animals or forage for mushrooms in central park. In that perspective, the first options seems like less effort ."

Michael Pollan takes a look at four ways to have a meal - one industrial meal at McDonald's, one organic meal from Whole Foods, one local meal from a farmer's field, and one completely ""homemade"" meal made from hunting and foraging.I must say, the first 300 pages are riveting, absolutely enthralling! I kept putting aside fiction to read this book, it was so good! However, when I hit the chapters on hunting and foraging, I found my interest severely waning. I really don't care at all about hunting animals and foraging for mushrooms, so keeping my attention was nearly impossible (this is why I took off a star). But the end picks up as Pollan returns to the final ""perfect"" meal.This book had so much really good information - information that once again cements my desire never to eat food at a fast food restaurant ever again. If one of your New Year's Resolutions is to eat healthier, read this book to bolster that desire!!"

The parts on farming, the evils of monoculture, the importance of grass, were especially enlightening. I don't normally eat beef and I would definitely reduce the intake even more. The most shocking part for me was the 'pastoral organic' revelation. I wonder if the organic products sold in Indonesia as are bad as the greenwashed examples in this book, which are all about the US market. The later parts of the book - hunting and cooking - were not as interesting for me as the earlier parts. Hence the four stars. Still, a fascinating read and highly recommended to everyone."

I'm having to use all my brain cells to process THE POINT. Not a light read. Author's writing style doesn't mesh with my brain wiring. No go for me. Disappointing. Moving on."

I support a small flock of happy chickens instead.Lengthy review to come. In the meantime, let me just say---I learned a lot from this book. I also enjoyed some segments very much. I would have done some extensive editing.The final chapter is sublime. OK, my real review:I am a convenience eater. Michael Pollan's work is transforming me into a conscious eater. Two concrete changes in my behavior: I will now pay the price of a fancy mocha coffee beverage for a dozen eggs gathered from happy chickens. I will also see commercially available breaded chicken with a side of corn as corn dressed with corn and a side of corn. I still may eat it, but at least I know what I'm getting!It is my hope that these wonderful books I have been reading indicate an American paradigm shift, and that the marketplace will allow people like me (who don't want to spend the time and effort tracking down purveyers of all sorts of specialty foods) more chances to make conscious choices in a convenient way. I will do my best to make choices that are more healthful for me and our planet regardless.This book was successful in changing my behavior. In large part, it was successful because I was already ripe for changing. Everything from Kingsolver's Animal Vegetable Miracle to Buford's Heat to Van Draanen's sweet young adult novel Flipped has been telling me to embrace these changes. This work built upon that foundation and presented a lot more detailed information supporting the choices that we should all be making. It was well structured, and it needed to be. So much information was packed into each section, it was necessary for me to take breaks. Some peeves---Too many declarative sentences. All declarative sentences put me on guard. (See what I did there?) I read something that says or implies ""all"" and I immediately start casting about defensively for the exceptions. I blame SAT prep. I was also put off by the way in which those declarations seemed designed to make me so defensive, mostly when he seemed dismissive of the travails of gardening, or scornful of the kind of hunter who does not agonize over the creatures' deaths. Second person. I hate second person. Here's a sentence that combined 2 peeves: ""You can forage in the garden, in the way Adam and Eve presumably did, but there isn't much to it: no dilemmas, no hunting stories."" And it's kind of a run on sentence too, now that I look at it, although that (obviously, having read any of my reviews!) isn't such a major irritation for me. (See what I did there?)Rampant anthropomorphism. Corn does not feel happy about taking over the world! Corn does not feel happy! Corn does not feel! This is a Truth. I believe that much of the anthropomorphism here was used as a bit of shorthand, implying all the Darwinian blah blah blah rather than spelling it out, and also trying to fix an image in the mind of the reader, but it is NOT TRUE. It bothers me. (Althoug I do like the image of an army of cornstalks marchng across the landscape, and it truly did stick with me.)LOVED---All descriptions of all meals.All the time spent at the idealized farm. (I forget what it's called and can't be bothered to look it up.)Everything to do with the mushrooms. (I think I'm due to read a book about mushrooms next.)The desription of the first hunt----soooooo true to my one hunting experience, in which I spent every fiber of my being on NOT MAKING ANY NOISE. It was such an intense time, and he captured that beautiully.I feel like there's so much more to say. Suiffice---I enjoyed most of this book. I learned. A lot. "
283,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1242165-schmacko,4,"So much has been written about this book, and so much will be defined by how you feel comfortable when discussing your eating habits. Here are, in short forms, my 10 observations:1)	If you’ve ever wondered how much the American government is responsible for your eating by subsidizing corporations who grow corn and make high fructose corn syrup, this is a book for you! SHORT VERSION: Corn is in EVERYTHING! We committed to growing corn when we could possibly switch to many varied crops. Corn is uniform, so it’s very corporate. If you hate political reading, if you don’t want to know this stuff, or you don’t frankly care, skip Pollan’s book. (Hope you enjoy your diabetes.)2)	Yes, we know organic food is better for us. But Pollan does a great job telling us that the US family’s annual food budget has actually dropped over the last 60 years, so Americans could conceivably spend more on food (and probably less on entertainment) and help out their diets.3)	I thought his section on Whole Foods founder John Mackey was interesting. Mackey completely concedes that he isn’t as radical as he started, that he has basically bought into the American corporate structure in order to take baby steps in supporting a business and helping people eat more healthfully.4)	At times, Pollan sounds a little Communist. At least, anti-Capitalist. I’m ok with that – to each his own – and I believe that American politics is all about constant discourse and adjustment.5)	Knowing the details of a slaughterhouse was a little much for me, but then again, I have no problem killing what I eat. Which makes me unlike 97% of Americans, who like to think their meat comes fully formed in plastic packages.6)	I love how Pollan describes the grey color of a McDonald’s burger. Funny! (I still crave Wendy’s once or twice a month.)7)	Mushroom foraging always sounded like something I wanted to do. Until I read his accounts. Mushroom foragers are crazy, obsessed people!8)	He’s lucky he had help at parts, or Pollan would’ve starved.9)	I like how he concedes that there is a better way to eat meat – that you don’t have to become a militant vegan.10)	I still wish we humans would accept that we are PART of the food chain!!! GRRR! We have canines; we have eaten meat for centuries. Our whole digestive system is built for meat! Lots of animals eat meat. We are not better than other animals that kill; the only thing that could possibly make us better is if we kill as quickly and painlessly as possible. We are the predators, and we should act as such – but with judiciousness and care. When we try to be ABOVE IT ALL – when we manipulate the environment – as Pollan excellently points out – we ruin it. “Dominion” humans create corporate slaughterhouses and run animals to extinction. Vegans treat animals as individuals to be coddled and encouraged to overproduce; soon, we’ll be overrun with deer and pumas and wild boar while we huddle eating berries from the sides of our abandoned roads (vehicles lead to road kill!) We need to accept that humans – like our predator cousins - do kill to survive, that we can be better at it, and that we are not ABOVE the food chain – as meat eaters or vegans – we are part of the system and should act accordingly. (Pollan mentions this, but doesn’t bring it home.)"
284,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260196-peter,5,"I started into this worried it was going to force me into vegetarianism, that I was going to read some passage about calves born into rancid waste, and a blue light somewhere in my brain would turn green and a gag reflex would accompany the thought of meat moving forward....Which speaks either to my penchant for pessimism, or the ominous relationship we have to our food chain, where we _don't_ really want to know how food got there, we just want to eat it.But read the book I did, fearful to encounter that meat-snatching passage within the book. Thankfully, Pollan is not an alarmist, but rather a quite methodical inquisitor about the roots of our food. It sounds kind of..esoteric, but he makes it fascinating, like a great humanities teacher he tells the larger story of food: of why we grow so much fricking corn in America, and how it's bad for almost everyone involved: ourselves, our diet, farmers in other countries.The good thing is that the book never descends into a polemic, unlike Michael Moore's work, Pollan's evenhandedness keeps the reader open to what he is saying. Nothing is extreme or revolutionary or incendiary.I feel like this book will, in the long term, shape the way I think about food by giving me a vocabulary for considering my personal and our cultural relationship to food. He discusses how America as a nation of immigrants never developed a stable national cuisine (unlike France or Italy), and the absence of that makes us vulnerable to an endless array of fad diets (coughAdkinscough) and an overall menu that is out of balance.There is a fascinating chapter on mushrooms and fungi, which details how they are utterly different from plants, and grow from this crazy underground symbiosis with decomposing nutrients and tree roots, taking a single drop of sugar from the tree root in exchange for processed minerals from the soil.There is an extended look at a farm outside Charlottesville--Polyface Farm--which models itself after natural ecosystems and creates this method of rotating cattle and chickens with grass growth cycles to create this wonderful whirlwind of spreadsheets, efficiency, and microdata on growth patterns of grass.To wit: it's better to have grass pasture surrounded by trees, because a blade of grass will burn X calories turning the face of it's blade toward the sun to receive solar energy. Planting forests around removes wind, allowing the grass to grow higher. Brilliant.In the end, it's about food, but it's also about systems in general. It begins to feel like a universal look at the interrelationship of history and commerce, and how everything is this big interconnected fabric, but that you can begin to see some of those connections, and kind of surf those links to great personal and collective gain.12/2007"

I use the word “threaten” very deliberately, because they are changes that I know I'm going to find challenging.Michael Pollan challenges his readers to examine their food a little closer, to consider where it comes from. And it's a logical request I think. We can spend days searching for the perfect doctor or mechanic, but how much time do we take to really think about our food? Do you know where your steak came from? Is your asparagus from a nearby farm, or far-flung Argentina? Are your peaches organic, and if so, what does that really mean? Most of us have no idea how to answer these questions.In most cases, the answers are simple. Most of our food likely comes from a massive industrial farm or feed-lot hundreds of miles away, fed by incredible amounts of fossil fuels -- the fertilizer, the machines used for harvesting, the trucks it took to transport the food to your local mega-mart, to name just a few uses of fossil fuel. Pollan's descriptions of these farms (and in particular, the feed lots) can be quite disturbing. However, Pollan does not outright condemn this ""industrial food chain."" He concedes that it would be difficult to feed billions of people inexpensively without it. Instead, he advocates having several different avenues for delivering food to our tables, and he describes several alternatives. It is up to the reader to determine how they want to eat. As for me, my eyes have been opened to the appeal of ""eating locally,"" where possible. (Emphasis on ""where possible."" There aren't too many oranges grown in Idaho.) By eating foods produced as close to my home as possible, I support the local economy, less fossil fuels are used, and the food should have fewer preservatives, hormones, and other chemical ingredients. Best of all, the food should be fresher and more flavorful. Yes, it will cost more, but I think it will be worth it. At least I'm willing to try it. Consider it an experiement. I've already found local sources of milk, eggs and meat that I'm going to try. I found Pollan's writing engaging and easy to read. (Disclaimer: I am a huge nerd, and the topic really spoke to me. If you don't like science, you may not find this book as fascinating.) A few words of warning: if evolution makes you uncomfortable, you may not like this book, as it often talks about the evolution of plants, animals and humans. Also, there were two or three instances where objectionable language was used. "
286,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4161947-m-l-rudolph,5,"2006. NY Times Book Review One of the 10 Best Books of the Year. We eat every day of our lives but we don't often give much thought to what we put in our bodies. If we are what we eat, then when it comes to meat, we are what the animal eats; and when it comes to produce, we are what the plant's grown in. There's a food chain that extends around the world and throughout evolutionary history from the beginning of man. Michael Pollan takes us on a tour of that chain and in the process gives any thinking, eating, person a new, often disturbing, view of what he/she consumes.Organized in three sections to illuminate industrial food (corn), pastoral food (grass), and personal food (the forest), Pollan's narrative builds toward meals made as nearly as possible with ingredients and methods from each of these categories.I double-dog-dare anyone to read this book and walk through a modern supermarket without viewing each item of food differently. And if you're like me, take your glasses, because the real information about what we buy and eat is in the small print, written in code, to disguise as much as possible what we truly consume. The central area of the supermarket is processed food. Good luck figuring that out. (When you can't determine the identity of fifteen out of eighteen ingredients on that package of processed whatever - chances are high what you're reading - and eating - are corn derivatives.) Around the walls, where we find the produce, meat, and fish, it would seem that the information describing the food would be more straight-forward. Good luck figuring that out, too. (Chances are every formerly living item was nourished or fertilized with corn or corn derivatives.)Unless you plan to follow a steer or a chicken through its life cycle to see how the animal lives, and dies, and becomes the food on your plate, you have to rely on someone like Pollan to take that trip for you, document his findings, and present it as he does here. I've read about food my entire life and tried to keep up on healthy eating without succumbing to fads, but I've never encountered such an intelligent, entertaining, and practical guide to the state of food in America today as The Omnivore's Dilemma. Read it and eat. "
287,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36341-c,5,"Pollan's book is not just a fascinating look at the modern state and evolution of our industrial food complex; it's not merely an anthropological investigation of the history of eating and cultural rituals; it's more than a scientific discourse of the biological nature of corn, small farm ecosystems, and fungi -- it's also, surprisingly, a page turner. When I was finished, I wanted the book to be twice as long.The book is also not (as many people seem to think) a political screed or manifesto -- Pollan isn't necessarily telling everyone to stop eating industrial food and switch to local, small farm food, as he acknowledges how impractical such a course of action actually is. Rather, he investigates our relationships with food, both personal and societal, scientific and ethical. He does find the industrial complex distasteful and disturbing and the small, sustainable farm he visits ideal but (and perhaps this is the choir appreciating the sermon) those conclusions seem inescapable.This book didn't change any of my ideas about eating, as I already try to eat locally and avoid processed food, but I learned a lot about the nature of food, from how terrifyingly omnipresent corn is to the amazingly complex ecosystem of a farm. It's one of those books that you constantly put down so you can turn to someone and say ""Oh my god, did you know that . . . """
288,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"This book has profoundly changed my view on my food, and subsequently, my world. I have read many nonfiction books, but nothing was so personal as this investigation on where our food comes from. Pollan sets put to investigate four markedly different food chains, and ends up having to revise his world view, and acquire new friends in search for a profound understanding of food, nature, and humanity.I have finished this on Feb 28, 2019. I will write a longer review when I collect my thoughts. There is plenty of food for thought (pardon the pun... did not intend it but hey, it fits.)"
289,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4123952-alasse,5,"I was so scared that this would turn out to be a foodie hipster's rant on what food should be like, instead of what it actually is. I'm relieved to admit that I was mistaken - in fact, it's one of the most thought-provoking books I've read this year. It's helped me to fully flesh out some apprehensions I had which I'd never actually put into words, such as 'Is organic really about chemical paranoia?' 'What's the environmental impact of mindlessly shipping food all over the continent?' 'How in the world does that even make sense economically?' Okay, that last one I had actually wondered about, more than once. I used to have a long commute.The Omnivore's Dilemma is also less location specific than Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal, which was a plus for me. I love reading about American lifestyles and behaviors (it's the whole deep-down-i-know-we're-next thing), but most of the industrial talk doesn't really apply to me. Pollan did a great job of giving a panoramic view of all the different approaches to eating in the first world, that's true. But mostly, it was his naturalist's view of things that made his discourse universal and relatable for me.Also, I've realized I have some very strong and mostly unfair prejudices against hunters. A book that manages to make me change my mind on a particular subject* is a book that deserves 5 stars. Shame on me.What else? Oh, apparently now I find ecology fascinating, which poses a new TBR list control challenge. F****ck.*while quoting a lot of Ortega y Gasset, I might add. Ortega FTW!! I went through an Ortega phase when I was like 17, so anyone who quotes Ortega to prove a point instantly gets bonus points with me."
290,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,3,"I grew up on a farm in Michigan where we grew corn and soybeans. The years when we rotated our crops to grow field corn, it was harvested to feed the chickens at the local egg farm. Thus I have some first hand experience with the first few chapters of the Omnivore’s Dilemma and the chapter on the farm rang especially true for me.This book is popular and enough time has passed that it probably qualifies as a classic and is certainly worth a read. It is a honest portrayal by a professor on the modern US food web highlighting many of the problems of our modern omnivore society spanning the spectrum from steroids to animal ethics. There were four chapters that I would consider as excellent: The Farm, The Feedlot, Grass and the Forager. The other twenty chapters were ok.I had no issue with the messaging of the book and wholly agree that it is important to understand where our modern food comes from. I will admit that I promptly ate organic vegetarian for my next meal after finishing the book as there are a few unpleasant facts associated with meat processing. I am sure I will become a carnivore again by tomorrow.I did have a few problems with the construction of the book however.1. At times it strayed from the science and empirical observations to become a little too professorial or perhaps too philosophical. This choice was understandable but gave me a meh kind of feeling.2. At times the book was a bit boring, although there were some intriguing chapters mixed throughout the book.3. I did not like most of the chapter titles such as Slaughter is a Glass Abattoir. Keep it simple like Cows, Corn, Chickens, Grass and the messaging of the chapter would resonate more.I rate the book at 3.5 stars."
291,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66672731-michael-jandrok,4,"I have always been interested in food culture, though I would have never considered myself to be a “foodie” in the strictest sense. That term always carried a bit of hipster baggage to my mind. I would tend to picture modern U.S. food culture as a sort of hummus-slathered menu dominated by low-fat recipes meant to reflect the popular diet trends of the day. Those attitudes began to change for me when I was diagnosed with cancer. Suddenly food became a big deal for me, first as something that I actively avoided as my appetite dwindled and my daily routine ran to getting as many calories in my body as I could, regardless of the delivery system. As someone living with colorectal cancer, food was a tough sell for me as the disease progressed. My tastes changed and most foods that I used to love became alien to me. But a funny thing happened as my treatment started to take hold and my appetite slowly began to return. I began to consciously embrace “foodie” culture with an eye towards expanding my palate and eating healthier. A big part of this ongoing effort has been educating myself on what would be the “right” things to eat given that I had a disease that directly affected my tastes and digestive functions. I didn’t want specific “diet” books, per se. What I wanted and needed was comprehensive information on what constitutes food itself, with an eye towards the science and sociology of developing better food habits and cooking techniques. Before my disease took hold, I was a 5’5”, 165 pound ball of muscle and muffin top, still trying to fit into size 34 jeans. At the peak of the cancer, when I was at my lowest point physically, I was 106 pounds and looked like a shell of my former self. After a year and a half of treatment, I am back up to 140 pounds, due in large part to eating better and making more informed choices as to the food that I put into my body. I can thank books like “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” for giving me a respectable knowledge base to make those wise culinary decisions. Author Michael Pollan has been writing about food for many years now. This book was originally published in 2006 and was one of his earlier efforts at culinary writing. The material has aged well. I do think that we have become a bit smarter as a food culture in the intervening years, but the basic information presented here is still valid and useful. I will take a moment here to caution prospective readers that Pollan’s visit to a large-scale feedlot and the rendering plant is graphic and somewhat disturbing. One can’t read these sections and not begin to question what it means to consume beef. The premise of the text is pretty simple and the nature of the ""omnivore's dilemma"" can be summed up quite nicely: as creatures that can eat virtually anything, the big question can be defined as ""what SHOULD we eat?” Pollan sets out to find the answer to this question by tracing 4 meals back to their sources. IN the course of the book he dissects a fast food meal, a store-bought organic entree, a ""beyond organic"" meal produced entirely at a polyculture farm, and a meal that he hunts and gathers (almost) entirely by himself. Along the way, he asks the reader to join him in his quest for a more thorough knowledge of the food that we eat and a better understanding of how the decisions that we make as food consumers help to shape our cultural and physical landscape.This is an intensely interesting book, and an important addition to the bookshelf for anyone interested in becoming more ""food-aware"". Pollan's journey is always engaging, sometimes spiritual (""we are what we eat…."" takes on a new dimension when one stops to look at it with this much depth), and occasionally frightening. He is always respectful of his cast of characters, and he is willing to challenge his own preconceptions and ideas as he gathers knowledge and experience. Note that there are no recipes to be found within these pages, nor any specific information on the art of cooking. This is a book that is fully invested in talking about food as a consumer product; what it is, where it comes from, and what the impacts and implications are when you decide to make a food consumption choice.Michael Pollan strikes me as a fairly engaging and nice guy. I’d like to sit down to a meal with him and talk shop. I learned a lot from this book that I can actively put into practice as I seek to modify my eating habits with an eye towards maximum health benefits. Along with that I gained some ways to make more responsible choices as a food consumer, and that’s just as important as the health angle for me. I’ll be seeking out more of Pollan’s food writing.Coda #1: After reading a number of reviews for this book, I can honestly say that this is a pretty polarizing piece of writing. A substantial number of vegetarians and vegans panned the book because of its acceptance of what Pollan would call “responsible” meat consumption. And there is no doubt that the author does indeed support the idea that eating meat can be done in an ethical fashion. I won’t rehash the arguments in the reviews here. Having a background in anthropology I can tell you that from a biological perspective humans have absolutely evolved as omnivores. Those canine teeth in your mouth didn’t appear because primates had an exclusively vegetarian diet, they are there specifically for the catching of prey and the tearing of meat. That said, we would do well as a species to eat a lot LESS meat, and there is no denying the environmental damage that is done by widespread meat consumption. Coda #2: That idea of responsible meat consumption is central to Pollan’s ideas. But it’s larger than just meat. The whole idea here is to gain a more thorough understanding of where our food comes from and from there develop better and more responsible food habits. Modern supermarket culture has taken away a lot of the basic knowledge of food...where it comes from, how it is grown or raised, etc. Pollan states outright that we would all be better off if we once again gained a real connection to our food, one that goes well beyond opening a can or a package and dropping something into a pot to warm it up. That concept alone makes “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” valuable and worthwhile.Coda #3: Another criticism of the book centered on Pollan himself, and the idea that the concepts in “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” can only be absorbed and put into action by an affluent audience. I’m not really sure I buy this argument. It’s true that “foodie” culture seems to have a footprint squarely in a sort of urban-hipster vibe, but the fact is that lower-income folks can put any of the ideas in this book into action just the same as any other demographic. In point, much has been made in the news lately of the current regime’s idea to hand out “food boxes” in place of letting assistance recipients make their own food choices. That would mean a direct impact on the farmer’s markets who accept assistance payments. That tells me that plenty of lower-income people have learned how to make healthy and ethical culinary choices that stretch their food dollars to the max. "

294,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/693262-huyen,5," If i could think of this book as a meal, then indeed Michael Pollan is a marvelous cook. He writes well, vividly and convincingly.As dense and informative as it is, the book doesn't make me feel bloated, but nourished :] I can't remember the last time I have discussed a book so many times, with so many different people. Chapter 17 on the ethics of eating animals is just mind-blowing and alone can make this book a worthwhile read.i can't resist talking about it before anything else. I've tried to become a vegetarian a couple of times and have always eventually lapsed back into eating meat. The main reason I would ever become a vegetarian is environmental, the huge amount of energy expended in producing and preserving meat. I've always found the ethics of eating meat hard to defend on the moral basis. And it's fascinating to see a person do it convincingly like Pollan. Pollan starst with Peter Singer's argument against eating meat. A wonderfully simple but powerful idea: ""if possessing a higher degree of intelligence does not entitle one human to use another for his or her own ends, how can it entitle humans to exploit non-humans for the same purpose?"". Leaving aside the problematic question of how we define animal ""intelligence"", there is no debate as to whether animals can suffer. And if we have extended equal rights to women, minorities, homosexuals, should we and why don't we extend these rights to other species? ouch. most people, like me, when faced with this question and thinking about it seriously, either look away or become vegetarians. it is difficult to reconcile our instincts to eat meat and the moral implications of it. but Pollan shows us that those are not the only two alternatives.He argues that while animals rightists have always stressed the suffering of animals due to our meat eating habits (although we have rather slim evidence of exactly what goes on in the brain of a pig about to go to heaven, (or hell?)), they have also failed to acknowledge that humans are capable of giving animals a decent and happy life. and ""happy"" in this case means the ability to do what they would naturally do, either pigs rooting around in the dirt, or cows wandering on pastures. ""to think of domestication as a form of slavery or even exploitation is to miscontrue that whole relationship-to project a human idea or power onto what is in fact an example of mutualism or symbiosis between species."" as he points out, domestication is an evolutionary development. domesticated animals have a much higher chance of surviving than in the wild, compare dogs and wolves for example. they therefore evolve to serve human benefits, winning our favor, in order to be provided with shelter and protection. they probably don't like being killed very much, but if that gives them a longer life and a much better chance to spread their genes to the next generation, they would much rather be with us than be in nature. ""predation is not a matter of morality or of politics, it, too, is a matter of symbiosis. from the point of view of the individual prey animal predation is a horror, but from the point of view of the group-and of its gene pool-it is indispensable."" That is exactly the point that most animals rightists miss. they concern only with individuals, but nature doesn't work that way, no matter how cruel that might sound. nature is about maximizing the survival of the whole species. our morals were developed to help us function as a healthy, cooperative society, but it is rather irrelevant to what should happen in nature.Pollan charges that this very embraced and apparently self-righteous ""ideology"" is a product of an urban society which has lost touch with nature. A friend of mine told me that he took his children to a slaughterhouse to see how pigs are killed because he believes that if we want to eat meat, we should be able to face the morality involved in it. that, i think, is a respectable viewpoint. the children were slightly disturbed but it didn't stop them eating meat. this father is probably an exception in our society. most of us probably have never raised a cow and seen a cow. our meat comes from nice little packages that never remind us of that it comes from something that used to have a brain and can suffer. when i asked my NZ friends why people no longer eat animal organs, like we do in Vietnam, they stared at me with disturbed looks. but really, when you think about it, offal is very nutritious, and there's little reason why we can accept eating meat, but not kidney, heart, or brain. i suspect the reason is the viscera brings home to us the fact that what we are eating used to be quite similar to us, which means, having eyes, lungs, heart. and we are so scared to face that reality that we get rid of it altogether. the second reason is that once the meat production process is out of sight, we have lost the traditional rituals justifying the act of killing and governing the slaughter of animals. the disappearance of these old practices gives way to the brutalization of animals to the extent that the animals become so sick that we have pretty much run out of anti-biotics.but that is not the same as to say that we can eat meat carefree without any moral consideration. given the fact that our food chain has become increasingly industrialized and heavily dependent on fossil fuels, we do have a moral obligation to care about the health of nature, i.e, the condition of the soil, the health of the animals we eat, the impact of animal farming on the environment. I can't agree more with him that while we don't need or arguably shouldn't give up our meat consumption, we should at least make sure that the way we eat is sustainable and the animals we eat are treated decently. the way that animals are treated in most farms is quite despicable. and i bet that if we had a chance to look at it, most would quite happily choose to be vegetarian. giving animals a humane treatment does not only give us a clear conscience but really serves our benefits as well. who would not want to eat a healthy chicken instead of a disease-ridden one? recently, when a documentary about the treatment of pigs in battery farms in NZ was broadcast on TV, the public displayed outrage at what they saw and have pushed quite vigorously for legislation prohibiting cruel treatment of farm animals  see here. i don't know of progress elsewhere. i like the idea that once the public know about what's happening to what they eat, they can make a difference.most of the rest of the book deals with corn and how our (meaning American) food chain has been reduced to a monoculture of soy and corn. they are present in something like 75% of the processed food products on the market. 40% of the calories a Mexican eats comes from food. if you think that's quite astonishing, then apparently American have overtaken Mexicans to be kings of walking corns. corn became the winner in the competition to be human's favorite crop because of its capacity to store a lot more calories than other species. the invention of fertilizers (interestingly made widely available by the surplus ammonium nitrate after the war) made growing corn so incredibly efficient that corn gradually replaced all other crops. and in the 1950s, feeding cattle on feedlots was cheaper than on grass, enabling the farmers to build massive chicken factories. livestock farmers went out of business because they couldn't compete with giant factories. fertilizer was a mixed blessing because the soil fertility shifted from reliance on the sun and a careful rotation of crops, to fossil fuels. we might like to think that fertilizers make agriculture a lot more efficient, but in fact, we expend twice as much energy to produce corn than when we relied on nature. and that's not to mention the huge cost of environmental pollution.when corn got cheaper and cheaper, the Nixon government stepped in to subsidize it, encouraging growing even more corn of lower nutritional quality and sparking the beginning of agribusiness. the excess corn finds its way into most processed energy-dense foods and feeding livestock. getting rid of this huge amount of excess energy contributes to obesity and an impoverished food culture. it makes good economic sense to dump excess corn on cattle, but biologically, they evolved to eat grass, and being forced to eat something they are not supposed to eat has caused grave problems. in a shit hole with piles of waste, polluted air and water and no space to even wiggle their tails, the only way these cows can survive is to swallow humongous amounts of anti-biotics. that sounds quite depressing, but the organic industry doesn't really hold a torch toward a moral utopia as we would hope. Pollan points out that the organic industry has diverged exponentially from its original ideals in the 1960s, and is now not so much better than the establishment. they consume a huge amount of energy to transport their products across the country, most ""free range"" farms mean that the chicken has a palm-sized window to look at the sun 5 minutes a day. real organic farmers have a hard time to get their products on the market because of government regulations. to me it seems like America's unsustainable food consumption is perpetuated by a cycle of ignorance and government intervention. so much for laissez-faire capitalism. growing so much corn might seem to make good economic sense. we must admit that it's quite remarkable that this is the first time in human history, we can produce food so cheaply and so abundantly. but this is the thing that has always not sat right with me about economics. that it hides all the expensive external costs involved in the process: environmental degradation, costs to the government in terms of subsidies, a huge consumption of fossil fuels, public health and malnourishment. so in fact, eating cheap corn is very expensive. so the key question is WHY is America doing all these things that defy logic? to summarize the whole story in one word, I'd say efficiency. feeding corn to livestock is so much cheaper and easier than grass (don't have to wait for grass to grow). and it supports a legion of other industries: the chemical and biotech industries, the food industry, the oil industry, pharma, agribusiness. If we keep in mind that hunter-gathers didn't become agriculturists out of choice, but because they depleted the animals they were hunting, it makes me worry what will happen to us when we deplete our soil and degrade our environment so the same disastrous extent. the food price riots in 2007/8 give us a glance at how depressing such a world would be.but this book isn't just depressing, it's enlightening and inspiring. it shows us that there ARE alternatives to the status quo: eat local, subscribe to a farm you know, and as he says in ""In defense of food"", then simply ""eat food, not too much, mostly plants"". I find Michael Pollan a remarkable writer, very humble and articulate. I can't recommend this book too highly."
295,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,5,"We are a notably unhealthy people obsessed by the idea of eating healthily (p. 3).Michael Pollan's Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals is a critique of industrial farms: they raise animals shoulder to shoulder standing in their own manure, feeding them foods that they are not designed for and which make them ill, and then use chemicals to compensate for these sins. Who knew that we are corn-eaters – not directly, like Mexicans, but through our cattle and chickens, and in processed foods.“When you look at the isotope ratios,.. we North Americans look like corn chips with legs.” Compared to us, Mexicans today consume a far more varied carbon diet: the animals they eat still eat grass (until recently, Mexicans regarded feeding corn to livestock as a sacrilege); much of their protein comes from legumes; and they still sweeten their beverages with cane sugar."" (p. 23)Pollan looks at industrial and pastoral farms, briefly flirts with being a vegetarian, then becomes a hunter/gatherer. He doesn't ""look"" the way I would, but goes out in the field, visiting and working farms, learning to hunt (and kill), and to gather wild mushrooms. Each major step on his journey is punctuated with a meal.Our typical, industrial farm, Pollan argues, is not healthy for us (making us obese), not healthy for the animals (making them ill), and not healthy for the soil and environment (using vast amounts of oil to raise food in a monoculture). He may something good about this kind of farming, but I've forgotten it. This farming is good for conglomerates – making them rich – but not farmers or consumers.His week on Joel Salatin's pastoral farm is fascinating – even for me, a vegetarian of more than 40 years. Salatin is a libertarian, deeply suspicious of government and governmental intervention. However, hw is a scientist's kind of farmer. He recognizes that everything is connected, so considers how to balance the activity and placement of cattle, chickens, pigs, and trees, each entering an environmental niche at a time that makes sense for the animals and farm, keeping all healthy while being largely chemical-free. As Salatin argues:""Society is not bearing the cost of water pollution, of antibiotic resistance, of food-borne illnesses, of crop subsidies, of subsidized oil and water—of all the hidden costs to the environment and the taxpayer that make cheap food seem cheap. No thinking person will tell you they don’t care about all that. I tell them the choice is simple: You can buy honestly priced food or you can buy irresponsibly priced food.” (p. 243)Finally, Omnivore's Dilemma is an ode to mindful, grounded eating, praising the food from Salatin's farm, but also that hunted and gathered in Sonoma and the Bay Area of California. He drools not just as be eats, but as he prepares to do so (although some of what he must do brings him close to losing his lunch), For Pollan, a meal that is eaten in full consciousness of what it took to make it is worth preparing every now and again, if only as a way to remind us of the true costs of the things we take for granted (pp. 409-410). He ends up in favor of locally-grown and harvested foods, foods with few chemicals, foods where we own the costs of eating.Pollan convinces me – not to eat cow, as some parts of Omnivore's Dilemma would be well-served with Sinclair Lewis's The Jungle. He does convince me to invest in local farms. I had been considering dropping my CSA membership in favor of the farmer's market, but decided against this so I support local farmers (mine is a cooperative of 12 Amish farms and includes a handwritten letter by one farmer each week). We have been decreasing our consumption of processed foods, but Omnivore's Dilemma will likely speed up this process. And, I will hesitate – I can't promise more – the next time I am looking at vegetables from half-way around the world.As Claude Lévi-Strauss argued, food must be “not only good to eat, but also good to think” (quoted on p. 289). Pollan's food-writing is thoughtful, and I enjoyed Omnivore's Dilemma as much for the writing as the content. And, he is dryly humorous.Pollan clears Lévi-Strauss's bar."
296,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/394959-susan,2,"While I read this book, I couldn't help but think about the muckrakers of the early 20th century. This book is pretty much nothing like The Jungle, starting with the fact that it is nonfiction, but its goal isn't that far away. It's telling a story about a part of our food industry that we don't normally think to ask about and painting a picture that should make us angry enough to do something about it.And don't get me wrong, Pollan rakes a lot of really good muck. Mostly it's his interpretation of his muck that doesn't work for me.I think the really important information comes in the first half of the book. Pollan gives us a crash course in agriculture subsidies. He compares our currently corn-focused subsidy structure to historic subsidies that were geared toward a broader spectrum of food. Then he goes into detail about what it means to live in a food chain that is designed to produce the most corn at the cheapest price. The answer? Corn is essentially in every processed food we eat. Meanwhile, corn farmers can barely keep their farms afloat because the price has been pushed down so far that they can barely produce enough product to cover their mortgages, and they dump so much fertilizer onto their fields to raise production that it ends up leeching into the water supply all the way to the ocean.Pollan then takes the corn story to the cattle industry and gives us a pretty ugly picture of what it means to raise corn-fed cattle. We thought that corn-fed cattle were a good thing, right? It's advertised on the stickers on our steaks. Except that cow biology rejects corn. The resulting situation not only makes the lives of the cows highly questionable at best, but it presents some very real health concerns for we the consumers.Buying organic fixes the problem, right? Wrong. Large-scale organic produce and livestock may not be what you think they are. Think your chickens are free-range? That just means they need to have access to the outdoors, which they are trained never to use. Corporate organic livestock is raised in environments little better than its non-organic counterpart, and they're probably fed corn too.OTOH, Pollock's story actually made me more positive about organic produce. One thing that organic regulations do accomplish is requiring a use of fertilizer that is not nearly so destructive to the environment.All of this stuff is good stuff to know. In fact, I'd like to look for some other sources of this information so I deepen my knowledge and cross-check Pollan. The place where he loses me is in his interpretation.This book got a lot of people justifiably riled up about the quality of their food and the state of their food production. And where does Pollan direct them? To back yard gardens and small family farming operations. In large part from this book, the bourgeois Localvore movement sprang up. So if you have enough money to pay twice the price for your food or the free time to produce it yourself, then you can have the satisfaction of opting out of the flawed food chain while leaving it essentially unimproved. A whole new luxury food industry has grown up to provide local food to the Localvores. Meanwhile, the corn subsidies and all their consequences continue unabated.The problem as I see it is that Pollan wraps up aesthetics with his practicality. Aesthetically, he is drawn to family farms where there are a lot more workers per square acre, a larger variety of produce and livestock are produced, and resources are used in a way he perceives as more efficient. The problem is that these qualities might make him feel good, but they don't actually address most of the problems he brought up in his muckraking. One of the sections that got my goat most was a several-page indictment of Value Added. You see, when companies make breakfast cereal, they take corn, puff it up, color it, put sugar on it, and (gasp) sell it for more than the price of the corn! The horrors of those corporate money grubbers!Look. Value Added is a core economic concept. I don't suppose Pollan expected people to pay the same amount for his book as the cost of the wood pulp used to make the paper. I suppose he wanted to be paid more for writing it than the cost of the computer he composed it on. And what's his solution to paying for overpriced processed corn? To pay more for food that comes from the right farm. So which Value Added is legitimate and which one isn't? It seems to me that food production needs four core traits. It needs to be: - Responsible: Producing it doesn't destroy the land, the water supply, or the consumers. - Plentiful: There's enough produced to feed everyone. - Reliable: Every weather fluctuation doesn't put us in danger of a shortage or a famine. - Cheap: Affordable to as many people as possible who need to eat.Pollan really only addresses the first of these four issues, and that in an incomplete manner. His solutions pretty much stomp on Plentiful and Cheap. Back yard gardens and family farms are not going to be able to produce enough food to feed a majority of Americans, no matter what they are willing to pay. It's really too bad that we couldn't have directed a lot more of this food production anger toward agricultural subsidy reform instead."
297,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/165589-gwen,3,"The first section of the book, in which Pollan follows the path of corn through the industrial food chain and discusses the effects of corn on our diets, supermarkets, and the environment, is fascinating. Despite being trained in the sociology of agriculture and specifically in the analysis of commodity chains, I learned a lot and found few details to quibble with (the main exception being his tendency to anthropomorphize corn, discussing it as though it intentionally chose to evolve in certain ways). If I were teaching a class on food, I would totally assign that section of the book.The second section of the book is also good, though not as great as the first. Probably this is because I already knew that ""organic"" and ""sustainable"" are not the same and that Horizon-brand organic dairy products come from huge dairies that, from the point of view of the cow, the quality of the milk, and the environment, are little better than regular non-organic ones.But the final section is really annoying me. Most of the things that are irritating me are much more clearly discussed at http://www.powells.com/review/2007_08..., but there were a few other things as well. Pollan keeps talking about how only omnivores have any trouble deciding what to eat, using koalas and cows as examples of animals that, being specialists, don't need to worry about whether something is an acceptable food source or not. Anyone who raises cows will tell you he's highly underestimating cows' experimentation with non-grass foods. They eat weeds and poisonous plants; they get nails and wire and bones stuck in their throats. It's a pain in the ass to have to try to remove a deer vertebra some cow has managed to lodge in her throat. I suppose this seems like a minor detail, except his entire argument is that humans (and other omnivores) are unique in facing problems deciding what is and isn't safe to eat.Connected to that is Pollan's reference to ""human nature"" from time to time, something that drives me nuts when my students do it and is even more exasperating from someone who at least ostensibly has the intellectual capacity and training to not fall back on such a simplistic explanation (that is, ""humans do it, therefore it's human nature""). He seems to buy in to the popular conception that there's a ""human nature"" that we've just smeared a little civilization and culture on top of (think of frosting on a cake).I don't think I can finish the book--I'm increasingly irritated by his tone and the problems with his argument. It's too bad, because the book really did start off well."
298,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20495277-anny,4,"Truly an eye-opener! I absolutely loved the first part of the book about the industrial agriculture. I would've never thought that our humble 'corn' is actually the tyrant of mono-culture farming. Farmers went broke, took a huge debt, taking side jobs driving trailers and depended on their wife salary for the sake of planting corn. Animals (cow, pig, chicken) got ousted from the farm and pasture and cramped into CAFO a.k.a. concentration camp for animals, where they live their short miserable life. First, they were fed food (corn or dubious meat-by-product or whatever cheapest feed available) that is making them sick and making us who eat them sick (mad cows anyone?). Second, they were cramped as much as physically possible, resulting in stressed, depressed, and psychotic animals (often resorting to self-mutilation or cannibalism). Third, they were doused with much antibiotics and medications (because their living conditions made them sick) and hormones and whatnot (to fatten them as much as possible) with who knows what side-effects that might cause for us (antibiotic-resistant bacteria for example).Taking the stand against industrial agriculture were small farms, like Polyface farm owned by Joel Salatin. If CAFO were hell for animals, then Polyface farm must be its heaven. There were so many good things about this farm, suffice to say, if I could buy from there (or any other place that practice sustainable agriculture), I would certainly do so. The last part of the book about hunting and gathering was the part that I liked the least. Too many pages rambling on and on about the ethics of killing animals. It's a weak finish, but the first two parts of the book was definitely worth reading!"
299,1594200823,http://goodreads.com/user/show/327527-missy-jean,5,"I can say without hesitation that this is a life-changing book. It's elegantly written and unflinching. Pollan is honest about his own cognitive dissonance about being an omnivore, which means he never sounds self-righteous (an impressive feat for the genre). And I love the widespread anthropomorphism of the book, the mysticism that Pollan is willing to embrace as he cites scientific sources.That said... Halfway through the book I was so depressed that I went home and ate graham crackers dipped in a can of chocolate frosting. All I could think was, so there's no choice! I am going to eat chemicals and toxins and animal byproducts unwittingly every day of my life, and they are going to kill me in the end! By the end of the book, though, I felt like I had a real sense of small measures that I can take to eat in a healthier and more environmentally responsible way. So I went to the farmstand and bought a big old pile of locally-grown buttercup squash, peaches, chard and zucchini. Better than synthetic frosting, right?I think there are a lot of different conclusions that people can draw from this book, and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who wants to be more mindful about what they eat. For me, it validated my penchant for vegetarianism (and my habitual eschewing of McDonalds), but you might get something slightly different from it. (Pollan is not a vegetarian.) Honestly, I don't think I'll ever look at my plate in quite the same way again, and I feel grateful for that."
