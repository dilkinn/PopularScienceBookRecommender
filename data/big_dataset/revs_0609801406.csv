0,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17744555-blackoxford,5," Sources of the Divine In the two decades or so since the publication of Stephen Jay Gould’s  Full House , it has attracted attention and criticism from many corners - evolutionary scientists, religious spokespersons, even from some of his allies in promoting humanistic rationality. Gould’s central point is that Darwinian evolution is not a progressive process, specifically that the species Homo sapiens is not the top-most branch of an evolutionary tree. Rather, for Gould, the development of species is more like an expanding spider’s web (my metaphor not Gould’s), stretching out in multiple directions with numerous interconnections which are mutually dependent. This deconstruction of evolutionary hierarchy - in which ‘later’ is presumed ‘better’ and ‘complex’ is superior to ‘simple’ - is a brilliant insight. So brilliant that I would like to suggest it goes beyond biology. It is an insight which actually accomplishes what religious fundamentalists mistakenly feared about Darwin. Gould provides what is essentially a natural theology, by which I mean he articulates the source of the apparently universal human instinct for contemplating the miracle of their existence. Just how profound a miracle is revealed by Gould’s analysis of the origin and maintenance of life on Earth, both of which depend upon an invisible, effectively omnipotent, beneficent, yet impassive entity: the domain of bacteria.Bacteria are neither plant nor animal; yet they are necessary for all plant and animal life. Some bacteria have the capacity for photosynthesis; others ‘eat’ various organic and inorganic material in chemical reactions. They stabilise global ecology, create our food, digest our dinners (as well as our oil spills), manufacture our vitamins, consume our waste, and sometimes kill us in large numbers. Some have a more complex genetic structure than human beings. They can even extract DNA from their environment. Bacteria are both top and bottom of the food chain. If all other life disappeared, they could live on each other. We need them but they do not need us.Bacteria arrived on the planet long before we did; and they will probably outlast us because their mutational processes allow them to adapt quickly to almost any environment. There are consequently a lot more of them than us no matter how you measure it - sheer numbers, gross mass, or prevalence. They are everywhere, on or in everything. Without bacteria, the human species would simply not exist. Collectively bacteria are what we typically mean by the word God - the source and destination of our existence which protects us, and lovingly returns us to the dust whence we came. We are not caretakers of the planet but its in-patients. Bacteria are the ones in charge.So the biblical story of creation is certainly deficient, as well as species-centric. Even before the command ‘Fiat Lux’ much less the division of the waters and the separation of land, ‘Fiat Prokaryote’ (necessarily mixing Latin and Greek), ‘Let there be bacteria,’ should have sounded. But, of course, bacteria are mute... as far as we know. Then again, so is God - yet another data point suggesting bacterial divinity. Perhaps this was what Spinoza was trying to articulate in his pantheistic philosophy - God everywhere, in everything, the universal divine spark. Even the intuition of the Christian Trinity concisely describes the situation of bacterial dominance: God within us, God among us, God entirely separate from us.According to Gould  “humans can occupy no preferred status as a pinnacle or culmination. Life has always been dominated by its bacterial mode.” It is bacteria which created us and it is bacteria which sustain us. It is bacteria, if anything, that will redeem and save us from the destruction we have wrought on the planet and its other species. Long live the bacteria! Thanks to Gould, we know to whom the religions of the world are really dedicated - or should be. Bacteria are at the centre of the web which is nowhere, and its circumference which is everywhere. The divine bacterial mind is as inscrutable as any mythical figure. It deserves our devoted respect and, who knows, perhaps even our prayers.

In it Gould discusses Plato's forms, his fight with cancer and his explanation of evolution as not being about increasing complexity. Prepare to have your fundamental assumptions about evolution shaken to the core.I love this man's writing - over the years he taught me more about the world than just about anyone else I've ever read. In fact, if there was anyone I would quite like to have been..."
2,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1257629-karl-o,4,"The ideas outlined in this book can easily get a 5-star rating. My understanding of evolution after reading it is entirely different from what it was before doing so. Gould shattered some old concepts and replaced them with powerful and concrete ideas that helped me appreciate life even more so (especially after knowing how improbable our own existence is). There is indeed ""grandeur in this view of life"".I deducted one star because of the part about baseball, which was too painful to read for a non-American who doesn't know a thing about the game, but most importantly because the author was repetitious regarding the main premise of the book, i.e. the history of life is void of any drive towards progress when all living things (Full-House) are taken into account. I believe the book could have been shorter, but I won't deny that it was a very enjoyable read. I strongly recommend it to anyone who's interested in Evolution. "
3,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,4,"If you think, like a lot of people do, that evolution is a progressive process that moves towards complexity (whatever that means), and, even worse, if you’re a member of a solipsistic species called Homo sapiens who think that they’re the goal and the pinnacle of evolution, you need to read this book. Gould shows that progress is not only NOT the goal of evolution; it’s not even a general trend. The book may also help you with answering another one of the dumb questions asked by the creationists: Why didn’t all apes evolve to become humans? (But why even bother talking to creationists?)Gould didn’t emphasize this point hard enough, but this book also puts a chill on the enthusiasm of finding intelligent life outside this planet. If there’s a planet that is amenable to life, surely given enough time evolution will produce an intelligent species like us, right? Wrong! As Carl Sagan said in another book, this is like elephants expecting evolution producing an extraterrestrial species with large trunks. We’re just an unpredictable and contingent accident of evolution, not its intended culmination. If you replay the evolution of life over and over again, almost surely we will never appear again.Gould is very good in statistics – as also proved in The Mismeasurement of Man – and he can spot wrong conclusions from sloppy statistical reasoning very well. If you care enough, you can also learn from this book that why the disappearing of 0.4 hitting in baseball is because the game has improved, not worsened. "
4,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,4,"After having defended life's contingency in Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History, Stephen Jay Gould, this time, strikes again against the misconceived idea that evolution implies any kind of progress. It's not. It is, in fact, all about 'non predictable non directionality' (as he so rightly puts it).Such fallacy (the belief in life's ascendency, a progress towards something better) when thinking about evolutionary science stems not only from our arrogant anthropocentrism, but, also, our tendency, when looking at systems, to focus more on means and/or extremes than the variations within the said systems. The implications when coming to evolutionary science are crucial. They enable us in fact to change our whole perspective upon the nature of life itself. This may sound dull or complicated, but it's actually very simple to understand. Gould, true to his inimitable style and demeanour, illustrates this basic role of randomness using entertaining examples -from the drunkard's walk to why the disappearance of 0.400 hitting in baseball! The slight digression about bacteria will be just one more nail if necessary into the coffin of the misconceived idea of life's ascendency. As always with Gould, we have here a fascinating read, both enlightening and entertaining."
5,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/565673-nicholas-whyte,3,"http://nwhyte.livejournal.com/1788521...In this book, Gould appeals to us to consider the full range of complexity in systems, rather than concentrating on the outliers. His overall point is that while human beings may be particularly complex life forms, that doesn't in itself make us the destined end-point of evolution, which will quite naturally increase the number of more complex organisms because all in all they are not as likely to become less complex.He bolsters this argument with a rather moving personal testimony about being a cancer survivor, and an excessively lengthy section ( a quarter of the book!) about why baseball will never again see anyone achieve a batting average of 0.400 or better, in which the term ""batting average"" is nowhere explained, which makes it pretty uninteresting for those of us who know little of baseball. But the other three quarters of the book are good."
6,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,3,"How do I say this properly. Gould is brilliant, and a wonderful writer for starters. I also don't think his approach was wrong with this one. I thought the idea of hitting it out with statistics was a good one. But please too much baseball! If I buy a book referenced under science I want to read more science. I think he either should have lengthened the book to compensate on the science end of it or shortened the baseball reference considerably. I mean really how many pages were really necessary to get that point home? For me? I could have believed him and seen it in three I imagine, but did anyone count the pages in this dedicated to baseball? Eee Gads I get the comparison, great! MOVE ON! "
7,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2716255-andrew-breslin,3,"Well said, Professor Gould! No, really, very well said indeed. Almost perfect, really. No need to repeat it, I got the idea the first time and . . . well now you’ve gone and said it again in a slightly different way, which makes me wonder if you think I’m some sort of dimwit who needs you to draw me a picture. Oh look, now there’s a picture . . .That’s my only complaint about this otherwise remarkably entertaining and stimulating book, which lucidly expresses some fascinating ideas that will leave any self-respecting homo sapiens respecting himself a little less and bacteria a little more. Those guys are the dominant species on this planet. Always have been. Always will be. We humans are just a crazy idea evolution got when it stayed up all night smoking crystal meth. Sure, it seemed like a good idea at the time, but in the last three billion years, it’s never improved on bacteria, the megalomaniac delusions of evolution’s latest flight of fancy notwithstanding. The book’s central theme is crucial to a genuine understanding of evolution. Pardon the shameless self-promotion, but I recently wrote a  blog post about evolution expressing some similar ideas. It was motivated by my frustration with the retort that “language evolves,” in response to my complaints about the cacophonous mangling of our language, largely at the hands, or, mostly, thumbs, of the text-message generation. As Gould expresses it so well: “we get to a ‘better’ place by removing the ill-adapted, not by actively constructing an improved version.” I think we’d all do well to fully realize that. Evolution is not a conscious, directed march toward perfection. It’s very nearly the opposite of that. The use of baseball to convey a fairly sophisticated mathematical concept at the heart of his central idea was, in my opinion, clever and effective, though I could see how that entire section would be tedious for anyone who isn’t a fan of either sports or math. I have no interest in sports, but get possibly giddy at the mere sight of lowercase Greek letters, so I found the analogy brilliant, albeit, as noted, a little repetitive and redundant. And possibly iterative. But mostly, he just said the same thing over and over. "
8,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/215221-bria,2,"In the prologue Gould promises that this is a short book. It is not short enough. All the arguments and evidence could have been thoroughly covered in a few pages. The book is full of repetition and harping, harping, harping on the same thing. It should have been an article, not a book. But he's right, and I suppose a book reaches a wider and more lay audience than an article. Still, I could have used less baseball and lot less patting himself on the back."
9,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1258538-ann,3,"A good book with a lot of valuable information. I think that Gould goes on far longer than necessary to make his point, but it's understandable since it goes against traditional thinking, and I imagine he's had to fight quite a bit to promote this concept at all.

11,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5900232-heather-browning,4,"Probably not one for those without an interest in statistical distributions, but I found it an interesting analysis of the way in which our perception of some effects can mask their true nature - in particular with reference to the idea that evolution drives towards greater complexity. The ideas seem obvious once explained but do run counter to some 'accepted wisdom'"
12,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77120730-laura,4,Did not totally agree with the baseball findings.
13,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,3,"Why are there no 400 hitters in baseball?Where have all the great composers gone?How did Gould ""beat the odds"" regarding his cancer?Does evolution produce a concept of progress?These are central questions elegantly answered by Gould in Full House, an exploration of the phenomena that fall out of the variation found in complex systems. Gould shows how some properties of systems can create the illusion of progress and how this myth of progress taints our thinking about the natural world. Gould pushes the reader's conceptual understanding of things like distribution tails and skewness to a much more fundamental level to show how these basic properties can explain the nature of variation for instance regarding the apparent increasing complexity of life.Gould presumes reasonably that life started with what will be some minimum state of complexity. The standard view is that life got increasingly more complex up until you reach primates but Gould contests this progress as just being a tail of the distribution of complexity. Most life, by quantity, by species count, or by sheer mass is still very much close to that minimum level of complexity as demonstrated by bacteria. If you were to use any standard measurement for quantity or variation we still live in the age of the bacteria but just happen to be the first self-conscious species.I found his discussion of why there are no great classical composers anymore to also be compelling. It is not the case that the kind of musical genius required to be great is not existent, far from, but that there is a demand of novelty for musical greatness and that most accessible forms of novelty have been exhausted. There may be limited space for large enough stylistic variation for a new great composer to register.As is often the case with Gould, the text is wordy and borders on the rhetorical. Few avenues of an argument go unexplored which you can take as either thoroughness or pedantry, but I found this book unusually interesting based on my love of statistics."
14,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11657479-richard-thompson,4,"The core principles of the Theory of Natural Selection are incredibly simple and easy to understand, but they have astonishing and far reaching implications, and as easy as they are to understand, they are easy to misunderstand and misapply. Sometimes this has been done by overrated jerks like Herbert Spencer and sometimes by smart men like Thomas Huxley who got most of it right, but who were sometimes wrong in serious ways around the edges. Stephen J Gould was a fine writer of popular science books who had a deep understanding of natural selection and a wonderful ability to convey that understanding in simple comprehensible prose. Most of what I know about evolution, I know from reading Gould's books. I admire him so much that I once tried reading his serious academic book on his famous theory of punctuated equilibrium. It was opaque and jargony in the worst academic style, so that I put it down after two chapters and marveled even more at the lucidity of Gould's popular writing.In Full House Gould explains how complexity in life forms develops through natural selection as a function of randomness that does not require any sort of natural tendency over time toward more complex forms. Indeed to the extent that any tendency exists at all, it may point away from complexity. Very interesting and in some ways counterintuitive, but I completely bought Gould's argument, which he backs up with numbers and many examples. He tells a parallel story about how a similar phenomenon of randomness acting over time explains the end of .400 hitting in baseball. I like baseball stats as much as the next guy and found this section interesting enough, but it really didn't do anything to explain the main point about evolution.This book is now over 20 years old and some of the material at the end felt a little dated, but the overall premise of the book is still totally sound, and Gould is such an engaging writer that this book will still be fun to read in another 20 years."
15,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1442431-chad-bearden,4,"Stephen Jay Gould is a skeptic's skeptic. Most of his longer form books (as opposed to his wonderful essay collections) deal with some long-held belief in scientific or societal thinking, and then using sometimes tedious statistical analysis to show how said belief is wrong. What's not to love about a man who made a hobby out of trying to break various paradigms of thought?Sure, he can get a little bit repetitive as he states and restates his thesis and gives detailed re-accounts of points he made just a few pages or chapters ago. And when I used the word 'tedious', I absolutely meant it. The lengths to which Gould goes to prove his hypotheses are quite entertaining in their own rights. And yes, the subject matter itself may seem a bit dry. How exciting can a book about the contrast between opposing ideas concerning the presence or absence of 'progress' in the history of life be?Now to be sure, I only recommend this book to the nerdiest of academic wannabes. To the kinds of people who find modal dominance and skewed means via extreme variations interesting. Or if those don't float your boat, I'd also recommend this to people who might delight in watching Gould taking an idea that is quite counter-intuitive (that the extinction of 0.400 batters in baseball signifies an improvement in overall play, not a decline) and then proving it quite convincingly true.That the illusion of 'progress' in evolutionary history now seems more an artifact of human's egocentric perceptions than a natural law is a testament to how thorough and convincing Gould can be when he gets on a role.And the delight in watching him dance nimbly from point to point to make his case is part of what makes this book so enjoyable. Even if statistical analysis of the modal and average complexity through the history of life isn't your cup of tea."
16,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/527519-alexander,5,"this is a wonderful book. gould examines the ways in which evolutionary theory has been distorted in order to serve humankind's tendency to apotheosize ourselves as the pinnacle of the process of life and nature. debunking ourselves and looking at the bigger picture (the full house), gould reveals an unbiased and engaging interpretation of the evidence. evolution is about variation occuring in the only direction open to it (that of complexity) and adaptation to local changing environment. humankind is a contingent result of the process of life, and as gould is apt to say, would never recur were the seed of life planted again. gould describes the erroneous ways that the evidence is usually interpreted by examining claims that deal with the disappearance of .400 hitting in baseball, a drunkard walking along a sidewalk, and other tangible examples. the way statistics and averages are construed, either as a mode, mean, or median, directs the interpretation that emerges. so, even if, say, a millionaire's sudden increase in salary from $1 million to $10 million justifies the claim that the (mean) average salary of a whole population has risen, in this case the mode would serve as a better model for the average salary. Gould invites us to see life as a process of variation and diversity, to think of averages as abstractions pulled from reality, and to find beauty and value in this naturalistic interpretation."

SJG was the co-author of the concept of ""punctuated equilibrium"", a kind of refactoring of the basic concept of natural selection first proposed by Darwin, kind of a General Relativity to Newtons 3rd law of motion.This book is written not towards biologist but lay-folk. SJG is very good at explaining statistics and how the use of statistics is important to the study of evolutionary biology.A particularly insightful essay in this book gives a wonderfully simple explanation on the continued growth and in diversity and complexity in nature using only a statistical argument.SJC was one of the greatest and most respected scientist and skeptic of the last century."

Gould has the gift of making difficult subjects accessible to the average reader. In this case, he uses an analysis of baseball statistics and the curious disappearance of the 400 batting average as a way to explain the bell curve. He then uses a similar statistical analysis of evolution to explain how humans are a curious accident at the right tail of the bell curve and not the pinnacle of evolutionary ""progress"". "
19,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14734538-roberto-rigolin-f-lopes,5,"Gould bets his ‘full house’ against our biased view of natural evolution. Watch out because he is a damn good player. He builds his arguments in such a convincing way making deep thinking not just palatable but exciting and, more importantly, reusable. The whole thing starts revisiting basic statistics concepts using baseball numbers. To ended up with an elegant argument that evolution doesn’t mean increase in complexity. Well, it may feel like a punch in the face since we have been living the age of bacteria for ~3.5 billion years. Yeap, forget dinos and humans; we are just at the right tail of a skewed distribution."

Wonderful Life was great, but where that sometimes was strident, or dismissive, or just plain had different ideas in it, honestly held at the time, Full House is an opus to WHY life is wonderful: not because of complexity, but because of variety. It's written more confidently, more empathically, and more accessibly. A fitting book to remember the great Dr. Gould with."

31,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5277047-connie,4,"I don't normally review academic books on GoodReads, but this one was really quite good--and let's face it, I need the extra help to reach my book goal this year. [Also I had to do the write-up anyway, yes, lazy me.]First, in spite of some conspicuous flaws, I found this book absolutely fantastic. Stephen Jay Gould might have been more than a little a bit pompous, more than a little bit redundant, and his writing style might have been a touch on the bizarre side, but I found myself fully engaged and amused throughout the book. This book is an odd one and may not strike everyone’s fancy—with its pages split fairly equally among paleontology, statistics, and baseball—but I would in all seriousness call it a must-read for biology majors for the unique concepts it presents. Full House centers around two main examples which Gould uses to illustrate the same underlying principle: fundamental barriers exist in nature, and convergence toward or departure from that barrier must be taken into account when measuring “progress.” On the one hand, Gould argues, the loss of the .400 batting average in baseball doesn’t mean that batters are getting worse—instead the general game has gotten better. The mean batting average has been externally manipulated over baseball's history (through changes in the pitcher’s mound, strike zone, ball and bat materials, etc.) to remain around .260, and improved gameplay has made the standard deviation around that average much narrower. On the other hand, “progress” in evolution is a myth: life started out being extremely simple, and there’s a lower limit to how simple life can get. Just by random chance, some organisms will get more complex, but this doesn’t mean there’s any general trend toward progress. In both examples, Gould uses the idea of a wall: in baseball, the players are inching toward a right wall, a wall that is set by the limits of the human physique. Just as marathoners can only run a marathon so quickly (and the marathon time has largely plateaued, at least for men, over the last half century), batters in baseball can only hit so well. Modern training methods and a larger pool of players have meant that the standard deviation of baseball players’ batting average has shrunk, dispelling the notion that baseball has fallen far from the excellence of the “good old days.” Conversely, there is a wall on the left hand side of biology: life can only get so simple and so small. Because of that limit, through random chance over millions of years, some organisms will become more complex. Gould uses the imagery of a drunk man to explain this concept: on one side of the drunk man is the wall of the bar; 30 feet away is a gutter. He stumbles five feet at a time in one of two directions, either toward the wall or toward the gutter. If he stumbles long enough, just by chance he’ll wind up in the gutter eventually: every time he gets back to the wall of the bar, he’ll simply ricochet back. Like flipping a coin and getting six heads in a row, he’ll eventually stumble toward the gutter enough times in a row to fall in. The complexity that we see in nature represents longer tail on the distribution of species away from that wall, not an overarching trend toward progress.In different hands the book could have been a downer: after all, Gould relegates the human race to a mere accident, with no room for arguing that there was any coherent evolutionary trend leading to our species. And yet, Gould keeps the book light enough that instead I found it fascinating and enlightening, despite some of its gloomier implications.That isn’t to say there weren’t issues with the book. First, as previously mentioned, Gould’s writing style was a bizarre: I enjoyed it, but found that it barely fell on the right side of the line between amusing and irritating. I think Gould used more words that I was unfamiliar with than anything else I’ve read recently (aside from some neurobiology papers published in Science, which I don’t think count). I think the first part of the book that made me chuckle was a passage from the beginning—Gould spends the first several pages exhorting his readers to stick with the book, to give it a chance. In making this argument, he writes:“I say nothing that has not been stated before by other folks in other ways, but I do try to explicate a broad range of cases not usually gathered together, and I am making my plea by gentle example, rather than by tendentious frontal assault in the empyrean realm of philosophical abstraction (the usual way to attack the nature of reality, and to guarantee limited attention for want of anchoring)…” etc. (Pg. 3)I couldn’t help but think of the scholar in his ivory tower reading that passage—surely Gould must see the irony of exhorting his readers to stay with the book by using phrases like “tendentious frontal assault in the empyrean realm of philosophical abstraction.” This unusual writing style continues throughout the book, and Gould has an unique way of mixing lofty vocabulary with colloquialisms, for example using the phrase “variational fallacy” in the same sentence as “ass-backwards.” (Pgs. 38-39)But, unique writing style aside, I did have some substantive concerns with the book. First, I think at times Gould gets so impassioned in his argument that he distorts some of his examples, or at least uses them out of context. For example, in Chapter 5, Gould largely deconstructs our common depiction of the evolution of the horse: as Gould writes (and as can be seen in Yale's very own Peabody museum), the evolution and specialization of the horse is a commonly used example to demonstrate evolution. It is easy to see the gradual increase in body size and skull size over time, as well as the simultaneous specialization in hooves and teeth. Gould criticizes this heavily for distorting evolution—for implying that the horse has inevitably “progressed” over time, even though history tells a different story. If we looked at the horse lineage from several million years ago, instead of the lineage today, it was a much more robust group, with diverse genera and no such observable linear trend. The progression from small to large and generalized to specialized occurred in the lineage of the modern horse, yes, but this progression was not inevitable. I think in making this argument Gould misses a larger point: part of the reason the horse lineage is so commonly used in museums and textbooks is that it clearly demonstrates evolution. The skeptic can look at a display, and, with an open mind, may be won over by the evolution from one form to another that can be easily seen. The casual observer’s eyes would glaze over with Gould’s arguments; more important to the plebeian masses is the demonstration that evolution occurs at all. Gould is similarly harsh on many of his colleagues, never hesitating to use phrases written or spoken by them, out of context, as examples of their misunderstanding of the basic truths of evolution. You’ve got to wonder how many enemies he made with some of these antics.Finally, while Gould convinced me with many of his arguments, the one that bothered me the most was his assertion that, because the human race evolved through mere chance, if a twist of fate had eliminated humanity’s lineage millennia ago, no other sentient species would have arisen. Furthermore, Gould asserts that the chances of sentient species existing on other planets are almost nonexistent, too. Gould repeats this idea several times throughout the book, but never really explains his logic. I couldn’t figure out how Gould’s premise that there is no inevitable progression toward complexity—merely a tail of complex species promoted by chance—negates the possibility of the evolution of another sentient species. If we presume that there is life on some of the billions of other planets out there (a discussion for a different day), then there should be similar tails of complexity on all of them: couldn’t one of them have also led to sentience? For someone as brutally honest, and often times sarcastic and cynical, as Gould—this struck me as a sentimental oddity. Perhaps even Gould himself was, however inadvertently, clinging to the idea that humans are in some way unique.Attempts at philosophical discussions aside, the ideas Gould presents about barriers and the insights he offers into statistics and evolution (and baseball, for those inclined to follow the sport), make the book a worthy read, despite some of its oddities.

32,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21965967-amber,3,"I'm not sure how we got the subtitle, “The Spread of Excellence from Plato to Darwin,” but the point of this book is a really important one that challenges our fundamental assumptions about evolution and humanity's place on earth and in the universe. Just as people once assumed the Earth was the center of the universe and everything revolved around it, we still today are plagued with the idea that humanity is the inevitable and ultimate pinnacle of evolution, and that all of evolution has been slowly but inexorably working toward intelligent, conscious life, and that we are the crowning glory of an evolutionary process that was always destined to produce us or something like us. Well, prepare to have your sense of privilege checked, 
hard.
The Baseball Angle. Yes, as mentioned by other reviewers, Gould spends far too much time on it. It's useful as an analogy: as with evolution and the fallacy of a general trend toward improvement/complexity, there is a fallacy in baseball that the extinction of the .400 batter is a sign of the general decline of batting skills, or at least that batting isn't improving as rapidly as other aspects of the game and is in effect falling behind over time. Gould thinks that if he can convince you that what's really happening in baseball is not what the conventional wisdom says it is, then he can also convince you of his similar point about evolution. That's fine, and if you want to make points about anything statistical in nature, baseball is a rich source of data to work with. But Gould spends so much time on the baseball problem that it's hard to remember how it fits into the book's bigger picture, and even hard at times to remember that this is really a book about evolutionary biology and not about baseball.More helpful in debunking the popular fallacy of a trend toward complexity is the analogy of the Drunkard's Walk. Say a drunkard is staggering down a long sidewalk with a wall on one side and a gutter on the other. When he hits the wall, he can lean there and then keep going, but when he hits the gutter, he falls down into it and stays there. Every scenario ends with the drunkard in the gutter, but it's not because the gutter is attracting him – rather, the wall is a barrier he can't pass, so over time all his random staggers will eventually put him into the gutter. Similarly, life began in a state of pre-Cambrian single-celled prokaryotic simplicity, and that minimum level of simplicity is a wall. Since life can't get simpler, over time the only possible variations are toward the more complex. Thus, the highly complex forms of life that later evolved don't represent a drive toward complexity, but are merely outliers at the most complex end of a full distribution of complexity – the “full house” of the title. And those original simple forms of life didn't ""give way"" to more complex forms, as the popular parlance would have it - anyone who has ever had strep throat can testify they are still around and doing just fine, thank you very much, and they outnumber all other life forms by many orders of magnitude, so it's hard to argue they're less successful. It's humbling to be told the world hasn't been waiting 4 billion years for you, that you're just a random outlier, a single twig on the huge and shapeless bush of life, and that the real Earthlings are arguably single-celled bacterial slime who preceded us by billions of years and will likely outlive us. And that's exactly the message that Gould is working very hard to convey. We're not “better” than single-celled primordial ooze. Maybe we're worse, and only deep time will tell.The seamless web. One of the major principles this book arguably stands for is that we need to accept that bacteria are the dominant form of life on Earth, and we and all other plants and animals are a blip in comparison – in terms of numerosity, diversity, ubiquity, and time spent on the planet. If you're intrigued by the taste of evolutionary biology presented here, the next book you should consider vreading is The Vital Question: Energy, Evolution, and the Origins of Complex Life, which posits that the simple single-celled life that dominates Earth probably dominates the universe as well, and complex eukaryotic life is not just a blip on Earth, but a blip in the universe.Audio Notes. This book was published in 1996, and apparently recorded in audio shortly thereafter, and the director made the poor decision to substitute the phrase “this audio cassette” for “this book” every time it appeared. The result is so clunky and dated it's embarrassing."
33,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5355687-ashley,2,"This is the first full length book of Dr. Gould’s I had read, all previously having been essays. Must admit to being disappointed a good deal, with the caveat that this book was published late in his life & dedicated to a rather discrete theory. While most of his essays appeal to the non-professional interested in evolutionary science, “Full House” is certainly for the scientist reading to broaden her understanding of evolution without having to digest research. If you crave evolutionary theories & varying world views on them, particularly those in opposition to the homo-sapien-centric ones, you may find this worth your time. Oddly enough, the other narrow realm of pursuit which could realistically be attracted may be baseball historians who enjoy trend analysis across the full history of the game, or those unsatisfiable SABREmetricians craving any new avenue of statistical reductionism (first half of the book).OK here we go. As Dr. Gould writes on pg. 168, the theme of this book is that “trends (result from) changes in variation rather than things moving somewhere.” Further, “graspers for progress have looked exclusively at the history of the most complex organism through time...& have used the increasing complexity of the most complex as a false surrogate for progress of the whole.” Human beings are not the end product of misunderstood evolutionary processes moving life towards more complex, sentient, & metacognitive beings, but merely an advanced outlier in the random, skewed distribution of all life on Earth, acted upon by non-directional forces producing no net “advance” but a modal stasis of simplicity. This mode, at a firm left wall of organismal plainness, is bacteria—always has been, & always will be. His argument is that means & medians are misleading devices in understanding the variation in a skewed array of any sort. Modes, however, more consistently represent what is common & are not as greatly disturbed by extreme, outlying data points. So life began as unicellular, & the most abundant life forms millions of years later remain at this left hand wall in the guise of bacteria. More abundant & more varied, but still overwhelmingly simple. Lots of examples & data follow, some leading to basic & clear points, & some of them more clumsily & less convincingly handled. The rub: the complete variety of life, Gould’s “full house”, is best understood as a profound mass of creatures grouped at the left end of a horizontal axis representing organismal complexity, with a long, & thin, right hand tail (typically longer as time accrues) of more and more complicated, albeit isolated, beings. The analogy for this increase in variability while the left-ended mode stays constant is contrasted with an interesting but complex & confusing baseball enigma, occupying around the first 1/3 of the book. Various data is brought forth to support his argument that hitting is improved (as a full house) in the modern day, though .400 hitters have disappeared since 1941, the latter being this enigma I speak of. In this case, variation in batting averages decreases as the mode increases. This occurs despite better hitting outliers shrinking away from the hypothetical right hand wall of maximal human ability. It follows that hitting is thus better now than in the days of Hornsby, Lajoie, Cobb, & Sisler, tho they indeed neared that unknown barrier of maximum hitting efficiency. Yeah that’s the best I can do—I know it’s a reach for not only logic but understanding as well. But thoughts worthy of consideration nonetheless. And whether you want to agree or disagree vehemently with Dr. Gould’s theme of non-directional evolutionary forces stumbling upon the creation of humans & humanity and not arriving at the intentional & inevitable end result of us, his ideas are unique if not fully transformative. His conclusion, however, was unwieldy & rushed, providing an unsatisfactory finish to a difficult & perplexing book. "
34,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,4,"Stephen Jay Gould was an author of popular science addressing topics in evolution. His specific credentials included his status as a professor of zoology and geology and a specialty in invertebrate paleoclimatology. Despite those increasingly complex academic credentials he wrote very comfortable and deep essays and books. His topics in Full House are several particular aspects of evolution. Fortunately he was writing in a time before this evolution had become as militarized as it appears to be today and despite reviewer comments otherwise he had religious values and as such tended to respect others with religious values. His books always include humor and self-deprecation.Drawing examples from several of his favorite topics including baseball, Gould addresses the popular misconception that evolution necessarily moves in any direction or necessarily favors either the process that resulted in the human being or any singularly upward trend.By making the argument that bacteria can rightfully claim to be the dominant life form across the history of Earth as a living planet Gould deliberately disorients those readers who had been taught that humans are dominant .On a more abstract level he demonstrates a scientific model known as the drunkard's walk. This is a classic thought problem wherein it is shown that if you have an absolute minimum value like zero that all variation must exist at some higher number. The analogy is to a drunken person stumbling out of a bar where if there is a wall to the left of his intended path and therefore his stumbling root must favor the other direction.The third leg of his argument allows him to use sports mostly baseball to demonstrate not only can there be a right wall where in the variations effectively exist between two values one absolute and the other less easily defined but relatively easy to demonstrate. He has his own argument for why the .4000 hitter has disappeared from professional baseball. There is no absolute reason why this number has become unobtainable but the evidence would suggest that some combination of factors effectively created a right-hand wall.By combining arguments that are usually easy for a scientifically oriented reader to follow Stephen Gould's Full House walks the careful reader through a sequence of arguments that effectively address a number of problems in understanding the statistics of the evolutionary process.This is a rereading by me of this particular book. As much as science is moved forward in the 20 years since publication of I believe this content is sufficiently general to still be consistent with more recent finds. More than this I've always found it a pleasure to follow Gould as he helps me to answer questions about evolution and to enjoy myself with his friendly and personal writing style."
35,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7190669-nightlite,1,"I loved Gould's book on the Burgess Shale. But this book arguing for a materialist view of evolution where random chance produces the marvelous variety of life we know, just didn't hold water for me.I have been a science buff since childhood, and have read all kinds of science across the board. For me this was not science, it was a biased scientist putting forth an agenda based on a weak thesis and a weak argument.I am not some sort of Christian ""intelligent designer"" (read ""creationist""), but I also don't believe in a purely random material universe. There are mysteries to the universe that scientists don't even begin to address, but which philosophy always has. If science ignores basic philosophical questions, then it does not deserve to be called ""science.""Questions:Where did everything come from?How could ""something"" come from ""nothing""?How could ""everything"" have always existed?Gould does not deal with these questions, he simply begins with the Universe as we observe it, and life as a given. Then he tries to explain the emergence of life in all its diversity as ""the Spread of Excellence."" This is absurd on the face of it. Bacteria have existed since the earliest forms of life, and bacteria are ""excellent,"" they are great survivors, great adapters, and our human bodies would not even function if we did not share some of the same genes as bacteria.He makes the same mistake that better evolutionary scientists have already dismissed, which is the idea that life is always ""improving"" as it ""evolves."" This is false and it can be argued that some species have ""devolved"" into weaker, less ""excellent"" forms. We as humans like to see ourselves as the pinnacle of evolution, because we enjoy certain characteristics that are unique and clearly superior to other animals, but at the same time we are also ""inferior"" to other animals in many ways.We appear to be successful because we seem to dominate the Earth. But ants also dominate the earth, and humans will probably be long extinct, as we are busy committing mass suicide, while the ants will continue on to survive and further diversify their species.So Gould lost me on this one...."

As a non specialist who reads a lot of science, history, and non-fiction, I found the narrative easy to follow, but at certain points the material seemed dated. However, for its time, it must have been revolutionary to begin to poke holes into Darwin's argument about evolution being linear, or Wilson's notion of progress in evolution, which I think he has now corrected. But it with this example in mind that he does some of the most interesting analysis, which is that evolution is not a simply linear progressive progress that only becomes better and better and more complex. The reason we believe in this teleology is because we are analyzing this process from our own subject position as individuals that believe we are gods gift to creation. Having read more recent works in this field, I can also see how Goulds ideas were adopted and assimilated by so many others, including the colleagues that he gently chides...

The only weakness...and this is a personal one...is a prolonged explanation of the statistics behind the disappearance of the phenomenon of 0.400 hitting in baseball. The stats were interesting but as someone with little knowledge of and interest in baseball, the analogy lost me.I really appreciated Gould's exposition on the directionlessness (passivity) of the evolutionary process, i.e. that evolution does necessarily move toward greater sophistication, complexity and ascendancy. Rather that it is all about survival and local adaption via the selection of specific traits via the process of natural selection.Gould also provides a great delineation between biological evolution (which is Darwinian) and cultural evolution/change/development (which is Lamarckian at its best).I definite read for fans of Richard Dawkins and those fascinated by the theory of evolution."

Harvard paleontologist Gould examines trends in natural variation throughout organic evolution, thereby discrediting the abstract ideas of eternal forms, fixed essences, and intrinsic progress. His insightful study even applies to sports systems, accounting for the apparent extinction of .400 hitting in baseball. In light of fossil evidence and overwhelming biodiversity, he concludes that there is no linear pattern or ultimate design to evolution. Instead, life is a spreading web or a branching bush; variation, rather than progression, is nature's expression of excellence. Consequently, our species is not the inevitable end-goal of evolution."

This supremacy is viewed by creationists as God’s work, while evolutionists see it as an inevitable product of evolution. Full House by Stephen Jay Gould agrees with no one and intends to convince scientifically minded readers of a third alternative.With arguments heavily based on math, probability, and statistics, the author proposes that evolution does not prefer more complex organisms, or more directly, there is no survival advantage, or natural selection, for complexity. Thus, Homo sapiens do not represent the goal and accomplishment of evolution, but merely the accident of a random walk.If you are comfortable with statistical modeling and reasoning, this is an easy read.

If several billion preceding years displayed an overarching trend that sensibly culminated in our mental evolution, then our eventual origin has been implicit from the beginning of time.

Can't really argue with that, because I found reading this book easy, all the science was understandable and clear. Like some other reveiwers, I did find it getting a bit repetitive. He told you what he was going to tell you; he told you; then he told you what he just said. I read the first half with great interest, that waned by the last 50 pages, which I just skimmed. His point was that there is no proven direction for evolution. There is no provable reason for humans to think they are special, just because we demonstrate evolutionary complexity.

The point is central to Gould's overall theme, and he develops it very well ... but not all of us are as interested in baseball as he is. It would be a very different book without this particular disquisition, and it probably would not be as good or make the point so well, but for me it was a bit distracting. Still, I was delighted to have read the book and come to a new understanding of what is being measured (and what isn't) when we talk about ""averages.""

Being a strict Darwinian, Gould calls for stringent scientific methods, and dispels many myths that have grown up around evolution as a system that moves from simplicity to complexity as an intrinsic function. Hence ‘progress’ is a dirty word in Gould’s terminology, as he has us invest our focus in the analysis of ‘whole systems’ and not just the branch of a system that includes movement toward complexity, i.e. Homo sapiens.

Gould takes a passage from an article in the Baseball Research Journal completely out of context in an effort to disagree with the author's assertion - not mentioning that the BRJ article's author completely refutes the statements that Gould cites.It's either dishonest or sloppy, and neither is a good look for someone as intelligent and groundbreaking as Stephen Jay Gould."

Otherwise the message of the book is an interesting one: basically evolution does not mean progress or even increase of complexity, and that we humans are but the tail on the glorious evolution of and a mere footnote to the age of bacteria.

Thiswas really easy to get through and quite rewarding. Gould is not breezy like Carl Zimmer or some other popular science writers, but the point of this book, that evolution is not some pyramid with human beings at the zenith and protozoans at the bottom, really comes through in quite readable language. Life forms move to exploit every opportunity and a bacteria that lives in a sulphur pool is no less an example of evolutionary perfection than a dolphin, an orchid or Arnold Schwarzenegger, circa 1976.

My main complaint of the book is that there are sections where he gets very bogged down in details with his example of batting in baseball, and it distracts the reader from the overall argument.

Rather, we are the result of endless twists and turns, and exists on a tiny offshoot from a larger branch, extending from numerous other branches of random development of the epochs.

79,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101345189-derek,5,"Great intersect of stats, pop culture, and evolution"
80,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1213868-mark,3,"First, let me say that Gould did indeed demonstrate via statistics that evolution is not a purpose-driven march to higher complexity and larger size creatures, but rather a general spread of diversity in all directions that has the appearance of increasing complexity simply because the process started with the least complex organisms. Except that he takes several hundred pages to say that, repetitiously, and with several tangential conversations along the way. One of those is his conversation on why there are no more .400 hitters in US major league baseball. He clearly shows, again statistically, that yep, no one's hitting .400. He argues that it's not because of any one thing, but because of everything: rules changes, better pitching, better fielding, better gloves, better coaching, better conditioning, better training, the works. And he's wrong. Well, not completely wrong, because baseball today is much better than it was in 1920, which was much better than it was in 1880, and for all of those reasons. But, he completely ignores the ""human factor"" in his statistical dissection of hitting, pitching, and fielding, in that he ignores that hitting is a competitive, *repetative* exercise between the catcher, the pitcher, and the batter. He does mention that the batter is competing against his own physical limitations, but neglects the environment and the competitive duo behind and in front of him. But, he gives not only no ""smoking gun"" explanation for the lack of a .400 average, he really doesn't give much of an explanation at all, other than to conclude that's the way it is now.In 2001, Boston Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra said it best when asked how hard is it to hit .400 and replied that it's almost impossible because you don't usually see the starting pitcher for more than two at-bats in a game. He said by the third at-bat he would have figured out the pitcher for that night, and when you need to average 2 hits a night to end up .400, that third at-bat becomes the make-it-or-break-it moment in the chase to end higher than .399 with your hitting. Given that the fascination with relief pitching began in the late 1950s, I think that squares with what we have seen since.The other nagging annoyance were all the little assumptions that Gould seem to make at least once a chapter that were so glaringly wrong. Things like hand-waving off the designated hitter rule in the American League as not a significant rules change, right after declaring he hated the rule, and then going out of his way to gloss a change in the stats after it was introduced. And stuff like this: ""We are now fairly certain that ordinary life exists nowhere else in our solar system"". This wasn't true even in 1996, because the Voyager probes had been to Jupiter and we were pretty certain there was a liquid layer beneath the crust of Europa. It's even less true now that the Cassini probe has been to Saturn and we know there is sub-surface liquid on Titan and Enceledus. And where there is liquid, there can be bacteria or other simple organisms. He then goes on to make the even more stunningly wrong conclusion ""such earthly surface conditions are probably rare in the universe"". We now know, thanks to the Kepler telescope, 9 of the 554 rocky planets we have observed outside of our solar system orbit in their system's ""Goldilocks zone"" where there is the possibility of liquid water and a gaseous atmosphere. And that was just in 9 years of looking around and developing the techniques to understand what we were seeing.So, it was a good book in that it is very informative and insightful about statistical analysis, and using Gould's favorite stats technique to show that evolution is about all the changes in all the organisms all the time, not just the move from simple to complex, and small to large. But he does it in just enough of a repetitious, biased, assumptive way that made this a much more annoying read than it ever needed to be."
81,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26223717-cropredy,3,"This is a book best read on Blinkist, the site that condenses the key ideas from a book into at most 15 minutes.I got this book from a Greatest Generation family friend who said - here's this book, I've filled it with marginalia and by the way, don't bother reading it. So, why give it to me? I was naturally curious and having never read any Gould, a noted paleontologist who wrote for the popular market, I said, ""let's give it a go"".There are two essential takeaways from the book -1 - Evolution is not characterized by ""progress"" - that is, we as humans should not think of ourselves as the end product of ever greater complexity from the first eukaryotes. Rather, evolutionary success should be measured by the vast numbers of bacteria that have proliferated and dominate all species groupings. Humans are basically a lucky random outcome of a series of other random events over millions of years and that we are basically a single twig on an otherwise vast tree of much simpler and equally successful organisms. Were evolution to be replayed, it is doubtful that humans would exist. There's nothing inevitable about humans as a species.2 - The absence of .400 baseball hitters since 1941 can not be explained by decreasing quality in baseball hitters, but rather that the overall level of baseball play has improved so the opportunity for a relative large difference between a good hitter against a collection of opponents has vanished - hence the absence of a .400 hitter. If anything, today's hitters are more skilled than those of the 1920s and 30s - with vastly better conditioning, training, and tools to improve. But opposing fielders have gotten better as have pitchers.These two main concepts can be explained by the drunkard's walk. If starting next to the wall outside a bar, and able to go only laterally (with some probability that the drunkard goes left or right), it is guaranteed that the drunkard ends up in the gutter. It may take a while, but it will happen. Why? Because of the immovable wall that the drunkard can't go past.In evolution, the immovable left wall is that life can't get any simpler than the simplest animals and still be life. In baseball, there is a finite ""wall"" where human bio-mechanical performance can't exceed (Gould wrote this before the steroid era). So, if this is at all fascinating to you (baseball or evolution), read the book. It reads quickly and is filled with interesting charts that support Gould's points. "
82,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10346669-eric-sullenberger,2,"I have wanted to read a book by Stephen J Gould for some time now. I've heard him recommended by many science communicators and have heard him positively compared to the greats, like Carl Sagan and Neil DeGrasse Tyson, except he covers biology. I found it interesting that his background was in geology, one of my favorites. Maybe my expectations were too high, or maybe reading a less popular work like Full House is the reason, but I was disappointed with this book. As an audiobook without the visuals it is sometimes hard to follow. Also, the target audience seems to be other scientist or science communicators and not the general public. Although, I am sure that his goal was to write to a general audience- so then I wonder is he misguided or do we still he somehow hope that if he can change the language of the lay-person that this will somehow influence the professional? His main point is that evolution doesn't have a point or a goal it is just a process. So then thinking of evolution like a tree or a lineage is mistaken and instead we should think of it like a bush with many terminuses or as a ""full house"". Beyond that he sp nds a descent chunk (like the middle third almost) of the book talking about statstics through the lens of baseball. The point of this section being that statstics is easy, but interrupting statstics, drawing conclusions, and identifying assumptions and boundaries is hard. It is a good overview of basic statistics and it is nice to see that he didn't just use baseball as an example (which seems to be the love of a lot of statisticians, like Nate Silver), but instead did some rigorous calculations himself and argued for more proper conclusions. Still hard to follow as an audiobook, but a good overview. He then goes through a lot of examples and comparisons between the baseball statistics and evolution to support his main point. I can say I learned a lot, outside of specific supporting examples, but it was an OK read. I'll certainly give Gould another chance if I can find other works on audio, because I can see the potential there- I just think he choose to combine two disperate topics to address the wrong audience."
83,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73548608-helio,3,"Gould's ""Full House"" is mostly about why baseball players no longer break the .400 hits level.  A ""hit"" is only counted when a batter makes it to first base.  Reasons for not getting as many ""hits"" maybe better pitching (as with new types of throws) and better fielding (bigger gloves and more coordination).  Through stats Gould shows that players connect with throws as often as before so it not the improvement in pitching.Seems to me they could have easily ascertainad if there was an improvement in fielding through statistics and there was, which would explain fewer batters making it to first base.  But Gould takes a long way around to getting there through explaining variation decreasing with time through being more efficiency of plays then tries to appy this notion to other facets (such as evolution).His promise of explaining why there are no more Mozarts or Beethovens isn't well presented and why he extolls the German composers when there many Russian ones (e.g. Rachmaninoff, Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Mussorgsky etc.) is a puzzle.The section on horses was pretty much a repeat from one of his other books.  The section on bacteria was interesting. With a possible insight on bacteria I looked up if there was bacteria in the brain and it turns out they (around 2018) had discovered it in three places: Hippocampus (area for short and long term memory),  Substantia Nigra (movement and reward) and the Prefrontal Cortex (region for planning, personality expression, moderating social behaviour and decision making).Since gut bacteria helps with digestion it makes on wonder if bacteria in the brain helps with thinking processes.  So far we don't know what the bacteria are doing there and why in just these parts of the brain."
84,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4771466-john-martindale,2,"I honestly don't understand the drive to dethrone humanity and to prove humans are not special, so demolish human ""arrogance"", as if the bacteria were offended by our pride. Well, I guess it derives from atheist's giddy pleasure in asserting people are not made in the image of God. Darwin is believed to have shown that people are nothing but animals, and Gould wants to make sure this dethronement of humanity isn't undermined by the secular humanist embrace of progress in evolution.But even in a completely godless universe, it still seems people are rather unique. Sure, possibly we are not different in kind, but definitely in degree, like the difference of a penny and a million dollars. Sure humans are not as numerous and successful in the game of reproduction as bacteria, and they are not as big as the elephant and the humpback whale, as fast as the cheetah, or as swift as an Eagle, but as long as people like Gould use reason and words to write how valueless and insignificant humanity is and how they are nothing special, they are being deeply oxymoronic. "
85,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17525925-stephen,2,"I love Gould. He's an excellent writer and thinker. Even some of his observations that have been shown to be in error were borne of good scientific thought at the time, and only further observations proved him wrong. This book is only, ""OK."". The baseball part made me want to jump off a building. He spent about 3x as long as he needed on that, and although the statistical lesson can indeed be applied to other fields, what a long-winded borefest. Unfortunately, even some of the other points suffered the same fate of repetition. If you're new to Gould, go for Bully for Brontosaurus or one of his others. "

113,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73548608-helio,3,"Gould's ""Full House"" is mostly about why baseball players no longer break the .400 hits level.  A ""hit"" is only counted when a batter makes it to first base.  Reasons for not getting as many ""hits"" maybe better pitching (as with new types of throws) and better fielding (bigger gloves and more coordination).  Through stats Gould shows that players connect with throws as often as before so it not the improvement in pitching.Seems to me they could have easily ascertainad if there was an improvement in fielding through statistics and there was, which would explain fewer batters making it to first base.  But Gould takes a long way around to getting there through explaining variation decreasing with time through being more efficiency of plays then tries to appy this notion to other facets (such as evolution).His promise of explaining why there are no more Mozarts or Beethovens isn't well presented and why he extolls the German composers when there many Russian ones (e.g. Rachmaninoff, Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Mussorgsky etc.) is a puzzle.The section on horses was pretty much a repeat from one of his other books.  The section on bacteria was interesting.

Well, I guess it derives from atheist's giddy pleasure in asserting people are not made in the image of God. Darwin is believed to have shown that people are nothing but animals, and Gould wants to make sure this dethronement of humanity isn't undermined by the secular humanist embrace of progress in evolution.But even in a completely godless universe, it still seems people are rather unique. Sure, possibly we are not different in kind, but definitely in degree, like the difference of a penny and a million dollars. Sure humans are not as numerous and successful in the game of reproduction as bacteria, and they are not as big as the elephant and the humpback whale, as fast as the cheetah, or as swift as an Eagle, but as long as people like Gould use reason and words to write how valueless and insignificant humanity is and how they are nothing special, they are being deeply oxymoronic.

139,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101345189-derek,5,"Great intersect of stats, pop culture, and evolution"
140,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1213868-mark,3,"First, let me say that Gould did indeed demonstrate via statistics that evolution is not a purpose-driven march to higher complexity and larger size creatures, but rather a general spread of diversity in all directions that has the appearance of increasing complexity simply because the process started with the least complex organisms. Except that he takes several hundred pages to say that, repetitiously, and with several tangential conversations along the way. One of those is his conversation on why there are no more .400 hitters in US major league baseball. He clearly shows, again statistically, that yep, no one's hitting .400. He argues that it's not because of any one thing, but because of everything: rules changes, better pitching, better fielding, better gloves, better coaching, better conditioning, better training, the works. And he's wrong. Well, not completely wrong, because baseball today is much better than it was in 1920, which was much better than it was in 1880, and for all of those reasons. But, he completely ignores the ""human factor"" in his statistical dissection of hitting, pitching, and fielding, in that he ignores that hitting is a competitive, *repetative* exercise between the catcher, the pitcher, and the batter. He does mention that the batter is competing against his own physical limitations, but neglects the environment and the competitive duo behind and in front of him. But, he gives not only no ""smoking gun"" explanation for the lack of a .400 average, he really doesn't give much of an explanation at all, other than to conclude that's the way it is now.In 2001, Boston Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra said it best when asked how hard is it to hit .400 and replied that it's almost impossible because you don't usually see the starting pitcher for more than two at-bats in a game. He said by the third at-bat he would have figured out the pitcher for that night, and when you need to average 2 hits a night to end up .400, that third at-bat becomes the make-it-or-break-it moment in the chase to end higher than .399 with your hitting. Given that the fascination with relief pitching began in the late 1950s, I think that squares with what we have seen since.The other nagging annoyance were all the little assumptions that Gould seem to make at least once a chapter that were so glaringly wrong. Things like hand-waving off the designated hitter rule in the American League as not a significant rules change, right after declaring he hated the rule, and then going out of his way to gloss a change in the stats after it was introduced. And stuff like this: ""We are now fairly certain that ordinary life exists nowhere else in our solar system"". This wasn't true even in 1996, because the Voyager probes had been to Jupiter and we were pretty certain there was a liquid layer beneath the crust of Europa. It's even less true now that the Cassini probe has been to Saturn and we know there is sub-surface liquid on Titan and Enceledus. And where there is liquid, there can be bacteria or other simple organisms. He then goes on to make the even more stunningly wrong conclusion ""such earthly surface conditions are probably rare in the universe"". We now know, thanks to the Kepler telescope, 9 of the 554 rocky planets we have observed outside of our solar system orbit in their system's ""Goldilocks zone"" where there is the possibility of liquid water and a gaseous atmosphere. And that was just in 9 years of looking around and developing the techniques to understand what we were seeing.So, it was a good book in that it is very informative and insightful about statistical analysis, and using Gould's favorite stats technique to show that evolution is about all the changes in all the organisms all the time, not just the move from simple to complex, and small to large. But he does it in just enough of a repetitious, biased, assumptive way that made this a much more annoying read than it ever needed to be."
141,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26223717-cropredy,3,"This is a book best read on Blinkist, the site that condenses the key ideas from a book into at most 15 minutes.I got this book from a Greatest Generation family friend who said - here's this book, I've filled it with marginalia and by the way, don't bother reading it. So, why give it to me? I was naturally curious and having never read any Gould, a noted paleontologist who wrote for the popular market, I said, ""let's give it a go"".There are two essential takeaways from the book -1 - Evolution is not characterized by ""progress"" - that is, we as humans should not think of ourselves as the end product of ever greater complexity from the first eukaryotes. Rather, evolutionary success should be measured by the vast numbers of bacteria that have proliferated and dominate all species groupings. Humans are basically a lucky random outcome of a series of other random events over millions of years and that we are basically a single twig on an otherwise vast tree of much simpler and equally successful organisms. Were evolution to be replayed, it is doubtful that humans would exist. There's nothing inevitable about humans as a species.2 - The absence of .400 baseball hitters since 1941 can not be explained by decreasing quality in baseball hitters, but rather that the overall level of baseball play has improved so the opportunity for a relative large difference between a good hitter against a collection of opponents has vanished - hence the absence of a .400 hitter. If anything, today's hitters are more skilled than those of the 1920s and 30s - with vastly better conditioning, training, and tools to improve. But opposing fielders have gotten better as have pitchers.These two main concepts can be explained by the drunkard's walk. If starting next to the wall outside a bar, and able to go only laterally (with some probability that the drunkard goes left or right), it is guaranteed that the drunkard ends up in the gutter. It may take a while, but it will happen. Why? Because of the immovable wall that the drunkard can't go past.In evolution, the immovable left wall is that life can't get any simpler than the simplest animals and still be life. In baseball, there is a finite ""wall"" where human bio-mechanical performance can't exceed (Gould wrote this before the steroid era). So, if this is at all fascinating to you (baseball or evolution), read the book. It reads quickly and is filled with interesting charts that support Gould's points. "
142,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10346669-eric-sullenberger,2,"I have wanted to read a book by Stephen J Gould for some time now. I've heard him recommended by many science communicators and have heard him positively compared to the greats, like Carl Sagan and Neil DeGrasse Tyson, except he covers biology. I found it interesting that his background was in geology, one of my favorites. Maybe my expectations were too high, or maybe reading a less popular work like Full House is the reason, but I was disappointed with this book. As an audiobook without the visuals it is sometimes hard to follow. Also, the target audience seems to be other scientist or science communicators and not the general public. Although, I am sure that his goal was to write to a general audience- so then I wonder is he misguided or do we still he somehow hope that if he can change the language of the lay-person that this will somehow influence the professional? His main point is that evolution doesn't have a point or a goal it is just a process. So then thinking of evolution like a tree or a lineage is mistaken and instead we should think of it like a bush with many terminuses or as a ""full house"". Beyond that he sp nds a descent chunk (like the middle third almost) of the book talking about statstics through the lens of baseball. The point of this section being that statstics is easy, but interrupting statstics, drawing conclusions, and identifying assumptions and boundaries is hard. It is a good overview of basic statistics and it is nice to see that he didn't just use baseball as an example (which seems to be the love of a lot of statisticians, like Nate Silver), but instead did some rigorous calculations himself and argued for more proper conclusions. Still hard to follow as an audiobook, but a good overview. He then goes through a lot of examples and comparisons between the baseball statistics and evolution to support his main point. I can say I learned a lot, outside of specific supporting examples, but it was an OK read. I'll certainly give Gould another chance if I can find other works on audio, because I can see the potential there- I just think he choose to combine two disperate topics to address the wrong audience."

And that was just in 9 years of looking around and developing the techniques to understand what we were seeing.So, it was a good book in that it is very informative and insightful about statistical analysis, and using Gould's favorite stats technique to show that evolution is about all the changes in all the organisms all the time, not just the move from simple to complex, and small to large. But he does it in just enough of a repetitious, biased, assumptive way that made this a much more annoying read than it ever needed to be."
171,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26223717-cropredy,3,"This is a book best read on Blinkist, the site that condenses the key ideas from a book into at most 15 minutes.I got this book from a Greatest Generation family friend who said - here's this book, I've filled it with marginalia and by the way, don't bother reading it. So, why give it to me? I was naturally curious and having never read any Gould, a noted paleontologist who wrote for the popular market, I said, ""let's give it a go"".There are two essential takeaways from the book -1 - Evolution is not characterized by ""progress"" - that is, we as humans should not think of ourselves as the end product of ever greater complexity from the first eukaryotes. Rather, evolutionary success should be measured by the vast numbers of bacteria that have proliferated and dominate all species groupings. Humans are basically a lucky random outcome of a series of other random events over millions of years and that we are basically a single twig on an otherwise vast tree of much simpler and equally successful organisms. Were evolution to be replayed, it is doubtful that humans would exist. There's nothing inevitable about humans as a species.2 - The absence of .400 baseball hitters since 1941 can not be explained by decreasing quality in baseball hitters, but rather that the overall level of baseball play has improved so the opportunity for a relative large difference between a good hitter against a collection of opponents has vanished - hence the absence of a .400 hitter. If anything, today's hitters are more skilled than those of the 1920s and 30s - with vastly better conditioning, training, and tools to improve. But opposing fielders have gotten better as have pitchers.These two main concepts can be explained by the drunkard's walk. If starting next to the wall outside a bar, and able to go only laterally (with some probability that the drunkard goes left or right), it is guaranteed that the drunkard ends up in the gutter. It may take a while, but it will happen. Why? Because of the immovable wall that the drunkard can't go past.In evolution, the immovable left wall is that life can't get any simpler than the simplest animals and still be life. In baseball, there is a finite ""wall"" where human bio-mechanical performance can't exceed (Gould wrote this before the steroid era). So, if this is at all fascinating to you (baseball or evolution), read the book. It reads quickly and is filled with interesting charts that support Gould's points. "
172,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10346669-eric-sullenberger,2,"I have wanted to read a book by Stephen J Gould for some time now. I've heard him recommended by many science communicators and have heard him positively compared to the greats, like Carl Sagan and Neil DeGrasse Tyson, except he covers biology. I found it interesting that his background was in geology, one of my favorites. Maybe my expectations were too high, or maybe reading a less popular work like Full House is the reason, but I was disappointed with this book. As an audiobook without the visuals it is sometimes hard to follow. Also, the target audience seems to be other scientist or science communicators and not the general public. Although, I am sure that his goal was to write to a general audience- so then I wonder is he misguided or do we still he somehow hope that if he can change the language of the lay-person that this will somehow influence the professional? His main point is that evolution doesn't have a point or a goal it is just a process. So then thinking of evolution like a tree or a lineage is mistaken and instead we should think of it like a bush with many terminuses or as a ""full house"". Beyond that he sp nds a descent chunk (like the middle third almost) of the book talking about statstics through the lens of baseball. The point of this section being that statstics is easy, but interrupting statstics, drawing conclusions, and identifying assumptions and boundaries is hard. It is a good overview of basic statistics and it is nice to see that he didn't just use baseball as an example (which seems to be the love of a lot of statisticians, like Nate Silver), but instead did some rigorous calculations himself and argued for more proper conclusions. Still hard to follow as an audiobook, but a good overview. He then goes through a lot of examples and comparisons between the baseball statistics and evolution to support his main point. I can say I learned a lot, outside of specific supporting examples, but it was an OK read. I'll certainly give Gould another chance if I can find other works on audio, because I can see the potential there- I just think he choose to combine two disperate topics to address the wrong audience."
173,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73548608-helio,3,"Gould's ""Full House"" is mostly about why baseball players no longer break the .400 hits level.  A ""hit"" is only counted when a batter makes it to first base.  Reasons for not getting as many ""hits"" maybe better pitching (as with new types of throws) and better fielding (bigger gloves and more coordination).  Through stats Gould shows that players connect with throws as often as before so it not the improvement in pitching.Seems to me they could have easily ascertainad if there was an improvement in fielding through statistics and there was, which would explain fewer batters making it to first base.  But Gould takes a long way around to getting there through explaining variation decreasing with time through being more efficiency of plays then tries to appy this notion to other facets (such as evolution).His promise of explaining why there are no more Mozarts or Beethovens isn't well presented and why he extolls the German composers when there many Russian ones (e.g. Rachmaninoff, Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Mussorgsky etc.) is a puzzle.The section on horses was pretty much a repeat from one of his other books.  The section on bacteria was interesting. With a possible insight on bacteria I looked up if there was bacteria in the brain and it turns out they (around 2018) had discovered it in three places: Hippocampus (area for short and long term memory),  Substantia Nigra (movement and reward) and the Prefrontal Cortex (region for planning, personality expression, moderating social behaviour and decision making).Since gut bacteria helps with digestion it makes on wonder if bacteria in the brain helps with thinking processes.  So far we don't know what the bacteria are doing there and why in just these parts of the brain."

Well, I guess it derives from atheist's giddy pleasure in asserting people are not made in the image of God. Darwin is believed to have shown that people are nothing but animals, and Gould wants to make sure this dethronement of humanity isn't undermined by the secular humanist embrace of progress in evolution.But even in a completely godless universe, it still seems people are rather unique. Sure, possibly we are not different in kind, but definitely in degree, like the difference of a penny and a million dollars. Sure humans are not as numerous and successful in the game of reproduction as bacteria, and they are not as big as the elephant and the humpback whale, as fast as the cheetah, or as swift as an Eagle, but as long as people like Gould use reason and words to write how valueless and insignificant humanity is and how they are nothing special, they are being deeply oxymoronic.

He spent about 3x as long as he needed on that, and although the statistical lesson can indeed be applied to other fields, what a long-winded borefest.

200,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1213868-mark,3,"First, let me say that Gould did indeed demonstrate via statistics that evolution is not a purpose-driven march to higher complexity and larger size creatures, but rather a general spread of diversity in all directions that has the appearance of increasing complexity simply because the process started with the least complex organisms. Except that he takes several hundred pages to say that, repetitiously, and with several tangential conversations along the way. One of those is his conversation on why there are no more .400 hitters in US major league baseball. He clearly shows, again statistically, that yep, no one's hitting .400. He argues that it's not because of any one thing, but because of everything: rules changes, better pitching, better fielding, better gloves, better coaching, better conditioning, better training, the works. And he's wrong. Well, not completely wrong, because baseball today is much better than it was in 1920, which was much better than it was in 1880, and for all of those reasons. But, he completely ignores the ""human factor"" in his statistical dissection of hitting, pitching, and fielding, in that he ignores that hitting is a competitive, *repetative* exercise between the catcher, the pitcher, and the batter. He does mention that the batter is competing against his own physical limitations, but neglects the environment and the competitive duo behind and in front of him. But, he gives not only no ""smoking gun"" explanation for the lack of a .400 average, he really doesn't give much of an explanation at all, other than to conclude that's the way it is now.In 2001, Boston Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra said it best when asked how hard is it to hit .400 and replied that it's almost impossible because you don't usually see the starting pitcher for more than two at-bats in a game. He said by the third at-bat he would have figured out the pitcher for that night, and when you need to average 2 hits a night to end up .400, that third at-bat becomes the make-it-or-break-it moment in the chase to end higher than .399 with your hitting. Given that the fascination with relief pitching began in the late 1950s, I think that squares with what we have seen since.The other nagging annoyance were all the little assumptions that Gould seem to make at least once a chapter that were so glaringly wrong. Things like hand-waving off the designated hitter rule in the American League as not a significant rules change, right after declaring he hated the rule, and then going out of his way to gloss a change in the stats after it was introduced. And stuff like this: ""We are now fairly certain that ordinary life exists nowhere else in our solar system"". This wasn't true even in 1996, because the Voyager probes had been to Jupiter and we were pretty certain there was a liquid layer beneath the crust of Europa. It's even less true now that the Cassini probe has been to Saturn and we know there is sub-surface liquid on Titan and Enceledus. And where there is liquid, there can be bacteria or other simple organisms. He then goes on to make the even more stunningly wrong conclusion ""such earthly surface conditions are probably rare in the universe"". We now know, thanks to the Kepler telescope, 9 of the 554 rocky planets we have observed outside of our solar system orbit in their system's ""Goldilocks zone"" where there is the possibility of liquid water and a gaseous atmosphere. And that was just in 9 years of looking around and developing the techniques to understand what we were seeing.So, it was a good book in that it is very informative and insightful about statistical analysis, and using Gould's favorite stats technique to show that evolution is about all the changes in all the organisms all the time, not just the move from simple to complex, and small to large.

230,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1213868-mark,3,"First, let me say that Gould did indeed demonstrate via statistics that evolution is not a purpose-driven march to higher complexity and larger size creatures, but rather a general spread of diversity in all directions that has the appearance of increasing complexity simply because the process started with the least complex organisms. Except that he takes several hundred pages to say that, repetitiously, and with several tangential conversations along the way. One of those is his conversation on why there are no more .400 hitters in US major league baseball. He clearly shows, again statistically, that yep, no one's hitting .400. He argues that it's not because of any one thing, but because of everything: rules changes, better pitching, better fielding, better gloves, better coaching, better conditioning, better training, the works. And he's wrong. Well, not completely wrong, because baseball today is much better than it was in 1920, which was much better than it was in 1880, and for all of those reasons. But, he completely ignores the ""human factor"" in his statistical dissection of hitting, pitching, and fielding, in that he ignores that hitting is a competitive, *repetative* exercise between the catcher, the pitcher, and the batter. He does mention that the batter is competing against his own physical limitations, but neglects the environment and the competitive duo behind and in front of him. But, he gives not only no ""smoking gun"" explanation for the lack of a .400 average, he really doesn't give much of an explanation at all, other than to conclude that's the way it is now.In 2001, Boston Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra said it best when asked how hard is it to hit .400 and replied that it's almost impossible because you don't usually see the starting pitcher for more than two at-bats in a game. He said by the third at-bat he would have figured out the pitcher for that night, and when you need to average 2 hits a night to end up .400, that third at-bat becomes the make-it-or-break-it moment in the chase to end higher than .399 with your hitting. Given that the fascination with relief pitching began in the late 1950s, I think that squares with what we have seen since.The other nagging annoyance were all the little assumptions that Gould seem to make at least once a chapter that were so glaringly wrong. Things like hand-waving off the designated hitter rule in the American League as not a significant rules change, right after declaring he hated the rule, and then going out of his way to gloss a change in the stats after it was introduced. And stuff like this: ""We are now fairly certain that ordinary life exists nowhere else in our solar system"". This wasn't true even in 1996, because the Voyager probes had been to Jupiter and we were pretty certain there was a liquid layer beneath the crust of Europa. It's even less true now that the Cassini probe has been to Saturn and we know there is sub-surface liquid on Titan and Enceledus. And where there is liquid, there can be bacteria or other simple organisms. He then goes on to make the even more stunningly wrong conclusion ""such earthly surface conditions are probably rare in the universe"". We now know, thanks to the Kepler telescope, 9 of the 554 rocky planets we have observed outside of our solar system orbit in their system's ""Goldilocks zone"" where there is the possibility of liquid water and a gaseous atmosphere. And that was just in 9 years of looking around and developing the techniques to understand what we were seeing.So, it was a good book in that it is very informative and insightful about statistical analysis, and using Gould's favorite stats technique to show that evolution is about all the changes in all the organisms all the time, not just the move from simple to complex, and small to large. But he does it in just enough of a repetitious, biased, assumptive way that made this a much more annoying read than it ever needed to be."
231,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26223717-cropredy,3,"This is a book best read on Blinkist, the site that condenses the key ideas from a book into at most 15 minutes.I got this book from a Greatest Generation family friend who said - here's this book, I've filled it with marginalia and by the way, don't bother reading it. So, why give it to me? I was naturally curious and having never read any Gould, a noted paleontologist who wrote for the popular market, I said, ""let's give it a go"".There are two essential takeaways from the book -1 - Evolution is not characterized by ""progress"" - that is, we as humans should not think of ourselves as the end product of ever greater complexity from the first eukaryotes. Rather, evolutionary success should be measured by the vast numbers of bacteria that have proliferated and dominate all species groupings. Humans are basically a lucky random outcome of a series of other random events over millions of years and that we are basically a single twig on an otherwise vast tree of much simpler and equally successful organisms. Were evolution to be replayed, it is doubtful that humans would exist. There's nothing inevitable about humans as a species.2 - The absence of .400 baseball hitters since 1941 can not be explained by decreasing quality in baseball hitters, but rather that the overall level of baseball play has improved so the opportunity for a relative large difference between a good hitter against a collection of opponents has vanished - hence the absence of a .400 hitter. If anything, today's hitters are more skilled than those of the 1920s and 30s - with vastly better conditioning, training, and tools to improve. But opposing fielders have gotten better as have pitchers.These two main concepts can be explained by the drunkard's walk. If starting next to the wall outside a bar, and able to go only laterally (with some probability that the drunkard goes left or right), it is guaranteed that the drunkard ends up in the gutter. It may take a while, but it will happen. Why? Because of the immovable wall that the drunkard can't go past.In evolution, the immovable left wall is that life can't get any simpler than the simplest animals and still be life. In baseball, there is a finite ""wall"" where human bio-mechanical performance can't exceed (Gould wrote this before the steroid era). So, if this is at all fascinating to you (baseball or evolution), read the book. It reads quickly and is filled with interesting charts that support Gould's points. "
232,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10346669-eric-sullenberger,2,"I have wanted to read a book by Stephen J Gould for some time now. I've heard him recommended by many science communicators and have heard him positively compared to the greats, like Carl Sagan and Neil DeGrasse Tyson, except he covers biology. I found it interesting that his background was in geology, one of my favorites. Maybe my expectations were too high, or maybe reading a less popular work like Full House is the reason, but I was disappointed with this book. As an audiobook without the visuals it is sometimes hard to follow. Also, the target audience seems to be other scientist or science communicators and not the general public. Although, I am sure that his goal was to write to a general audience- so then I wonder is he misguided or do we still he somehow hope that if he can change the language of the lay-person that this will somehow influence the professional? His main point is that evolution doesn't have a point or a goal it is just a process. So then thinking of evolution like a tree or a lineage is mistaken and instead we should think of it like a bush with many terminuses or as a ""full house"". Beyond that he sp nds a descent chunk (like the middle third almost) of the book talking about statstics through the lens of baseball. The point of this section being that statstics is easy, but interrupting statstics, drawing conclusions, and identifying assumptions and boundaries is hard. It is a good overview of basic statistics and it is nice to see that he didn't just use baseball as an example (which seems to be the love of a lot of statisticians, like Nate Silver), but instead did some rigorous calculations himself and argued for more proper conclusions. Still hard to follow as an audiobook, but a good overview. He then goes through a lot of examples and comparisons between the baseball statistics and evolution to support his main point. I can say I learned a lot, outside of specific supporting examples, but it was an OK read. I'll certainly give Gould another chance if I can find other works on audio, because I can see the potential there- I just think he choose to combine two disperate topics to address the wrong audience."
233,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73548608-helio,3,"Gould's ""Full House"" is mostly about why baseball players no longer break the .400 hits level.  A ""hit"" is only counted when a batter makes it to first base.  Reasons for not getting as many ""hits"" maybe better pitching (as with new types of throws) and better fielding (bigger gloves and more coordination).  Through stats Gould shows that players connect with throws as often as before so it not the improvement in pitching.Seems to me they could have easily ascertainad if there was an improvement in fielding through statistics and there was, which would explain fewer batters making it to first base.  But Gould takes a long way around to getting there through explaining variation decreasing with time through being more efficiency of plays then tries to appy this notion to other facets (such as evolution).His promise of explaining why there are no more Mozarts or Beethovens isn't well presented and why he extolls the German composers when there many Russian ones (e.g. Rachmaninoff, Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Mussorgsky etc.) is a puzzle.The section on horses was pretty much a repeat from one of his other books.  The section on bacteria was interesting. With a possible insight on bacteria I looked up if there was bacteria in the brain and it turns out they (around 2018) had discovered it in three places: Hippocampus (area for short and long term memory),  Substantia Nigra (movement and reward) and the Prefrontal Cortex (region for planning, personality expression, moderating social behaviour and decision making).Since gut bacteria helps with digestion it makes on wonder if bacteria in the brain helps with thinking processes.  So far we don't know what the bacteria are doing there and why in just these parts of the brain."
234,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4771466-john-martindale,2,"I honestly don't understand the drive to dethrone humanity and to prove humans are not special, so demolish human ""arrogance"", as if the bacteria were offended by our pride. Well, I guess it derives from atheist's giddy pleasure in asserting people are not made in the image of God. Darwin is believed to have shown that people are nothing but animals, and Gould wants to make sure this dethronement of humanity isn't undermined by the secular humanist embrace of progress in evolution.But even in a completely godless universe, it still seems people are rather unique. Sure, possibly we are not different in kind, but definitely in degree, like the difference of a penny and a million dollars. Sure humans are not as numerous and successful in the game of reproduction as bacteria, and they are not as big as the elephant and the humpback whale, as fast as the cheetah, or as swift as an Eagle, but as long as people like Gould use reason and words to write how valueless and insignificant humanity is and how they are nothing special, they are being deeply oxymoronic. "
235,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17525925-stephen,2,"I love Gould. He's an excellent writer and thinker. Even some of his observations that have been shown to be in error were borne of good scientific thought at the time, and only further observations proved him wrong. This book is only, ""OK."". The baseball part made me want to jump off a building. He spent about 3x as long as he needed on that, and although the statistical lesson can indeed be applied to other fields, what a long-winded borefest. Unfortunately, even some of the other points suffered the same fate of repetition. If you're new to Gould, go for Bully for Brontosaurus or one of his others. "

290,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1213868-mark,3,"First, let me say that Gould did indeed demonstrate via statistics that evolution is not a purpose-driven march to higher complexity and larger size creatures, but rather a general spread of diversity in all directions that has the appearance of increasing complexity simply because the process started with the least complex organisms. Except that he takes several hundred pages to say that, repetitiously, and with several tangential conversations along the way. One of those is his conversation on why there are no more .400 hitters in US major league baseball. He clearly shows, again statistically, that yep, no one's hitting .400. He argues that it's not because of any one thing, but because of everything: rules changes, better pitching, better fielding, better gloves, better coaching, better conditioning, better training, the works. And he's wrong. Well, not completely wrong, because baseball today is much better than it was in 1920, which was much better than it was in 1880, and for all of those reasons. But, he completely ignores the ""human factor"" in his statistical dissection of hitting, pitching, and fielding, in that he ignores that hitting is a competitive, *repetative* exercise between the catcher, the pitcher, and the batter. He does mention that the batter is competing against his own physical limitations, but neglects the environment and the competitive duo behind and in front of him. But, he gives not only no ""smoking gun"" explanation for the lack of a .400 average, he really doesn't give much of an explanation at all, other than to conclude that's the way it is now.In 2001, Boston Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra said it best when asked how hard is it to hit .400 and replied that it's almost impossible because you don't usually see the starting pitcher for more than two at-bats in a game. He said by the third at-bat he would have figured out the pitcher for that night, and when you need to average 2 hits a night to end up .400, that third at-bat becomes the make-it-or-break-it moment in the chase to end higher than .399 with your hitting. Given that the fascination with relief pitching began in the late 1950s, I think that squares with what we have seen since.The other nagging annoyance were all the little assumptions that Gould seem to make at least once a chapter that were so glaringly wrong. Things like hand-waving off the designated hitter rule in the American League as not a significant rules change, right after declaring he hated the rule, and then going out of his way to gloss a change in the stats after it was introduced. And stuff like this: ""We are now fairly certain that ordinary life exists nowhere else in our solar system"". This wasn't true even in 1996, because the Voyager probes had been to Jupiter and we were pretty certain there was a liquid layer beneath the crust of Europa. It's even less true now that the Cassini probe has been to Saturn and we know there is sub-surface liquid on Titan and Enceledus. And where there is liquid, there can be bacteria or other simple organisms. He then goes on to make the even more stunningly wrong conclusion ""such earthly surface conditions are probably rare in the universe"". We now know, thanks to the Kepler telescope, 9 of the 554 rocky planets we have observed outside of our solar system orbit in their system's ""Goldilocks zone"" where there is the possibility of liquid water and a gaseous atmosphere. And that was just in 9 years of looking around and developing the techniques to understand what we were seeing.So, it was a good book in that it is very informative and insightful about statistical analysis, and using Gould's favorite stats technique to show that evolution is about all the changes in all the organisms all the time, not just the move from simple to complex, and small to large. But he does it in just enough of a repetitious, biased, assumptive way that made this a much more annoying read than it ever needed to be."
291,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26223717-cropredy,3,"This is a book best read on Blinkist, the site that condenses the key ideas from a book into at most 15 minutes.I got this book from a Greatest Generation family friend who said - here's this book, I've filled it with marginalia and by the way, don't bother reading it. So, why give it to me? I was naturally curious and having never read any Gould, a noted paleontologist who wrote for the popular market, I said, ""let's give it a go"".There are two essential takeaways from the book -1 - Evolution is not characterized by ""progress"" - that is, we as humans should not think of ourselves as the end product of ever greater complexity from the first eukaryotes. Rather, evolutionary success should be measured by the vast numbers of bacteria that have proliferated and dominate all species groupings. Humans are basically a lucky random outcome of a series of other random events over millions of years and that we are basically a single twig on an otherwise vast tree of much simpler and equally successful organisms. Were evolution to be replayed, it is doubtful that humans would exist. There's nothing inevitable about humans as a species.2 - The absence of .400 baseball hitters since 1941 can not be explained by decreasing quality in baseball hitters, but rather that the overall level of baseball play has improved so the opportunity for a relative large difference between a good hitter against a collection of opponents has vanished - hence the absence of a .400 hitter. If anything, today's hitters are more skilled than those of the 1920s and 30s - with vastly better conditioning, training, and tools to improve. But opposing fielders have gotten better as have pitchers.These two main concepts can be explained by the drunkard's walk. If starting next to the wall outside a bar, and able to go only laterally (with some probability that the drunkard goes left or right), it is guaranteed that the drunkard ends up in the gutter. It may take a while, but it will happen. Why? Because of the immovable wall that the drunkard can't go past.In evolution, the immovable left wall is that life can't get any simpler than the simplest animals and still be life. In baseball, there is a finite ""wall"" where human bio-mechanical performance can't exceed (Gould wrote this before the steroid era). So, if this is at all fascinating to you (baseball or evolution), read the book. It reads quickly and is filled with interesting charts that support Gould's points. "
292,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10346669-eric-sullenberger,2,"I have wanted to read a book by Stephen J Gould for some time now. I've heard him recommended by many science communicators and have heard him positively compared to the greats, like Carl Sagan and Neil DeGrasse Tyson, except he covers biology. I found it interesting that his background was in geology, one of my favorites. Maybe my expectations were too high, or maybe reading a less popular work like Full House is the reason, but I was disappointed with this book. As an audiobook without the visuals it is sometimes hard to follow. Also, the target audience seems to be other scientist or science communicators and not the general public. Although, I am sure that his goal was to write to a general audience- so then I wonder is he misguided or do we still he somehow hope that if he can change the language of the lay-person that this will somehow influence the professional? His main point is that evolution doesn't have a point or a goal it is just a process. So then thinking of evolution like a tree or a lineage is mistaken and instead we should think of it like a bush with many terminuses or as a ""full house"". Beyond that he sp nds a descent chunk (like the middle third almost) of the book talking about statstics through the lens of baseball. The point of this section being that statstics is easy, but interrupting statstics, drawing conclusions, and identifying assumptions and boundaries is hard. It is a good overview of basic statistics and it is nice to see that he didn't just use baseball as an example (which seems to be the love of a lot of statisticians, like Nate Silver), but instead did some rigorous calculations himself and argued for more proper conclusions. Still hard to follow as an audiobook, but a good overview. He then goes through a lot of examples and comparisons between the baseball statistics and evolution to support his main point. I can say I learned a lot, outside of specific supporting examples, but it was an OK read. I'll certainly give Gould another chance if I can find other works on audio, because I can see the potential there- I just think he choose to combine two disperate topics to address the wrong audience."
293,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73548608-helio,3,"Gould's ""Full House"" is mostly about why baseball players no longer break the .400 hits level.  A ""hit"" is only counted when a batter makes it to first base.  Reasons for not getting as many ""hits"" maybe better pitching (as with new types of throws) and better fielding (bigger gloves and more coordination).  Through stats Gould shows that players connect with throws as often as before so it not the improvement in pitching.Seems to me they could have easily ascertainad if there was an improvement in fielding through statistics and there was, which would explain fewer batters making it to first base.  But Gould takes a long way around to getting there through explaining variation decreasing with time through being more efficiency of plays then tries to appy this notion to other facets (such as evolution).His promise of explaining why there are no more Mozarts or Beethovens isn't well presented and why he extolls the German composers when there many Russian ones (e.g. Rachmaninoff, Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Mussorgsky etc.) is a puzzle.The section on horses was pretty much a repeat from one of his other books.  The section on bacteria was interesting. With a possible insight on bacteria I looked up if there was bacteria in the brain and it turns out they (around 2018) had discovered it in three places: Hippocampus (area for short and long term memory),  Substantia Nigra (movement and reward) and the Prefrontal Cortex (region for planning, personality expression, moderating social behaviour and decision making).Since gut bacteria helps with digestion it makes on wonder if bacteria in the brain helps with thinking processes.  So far we don't know what the bacteria are doing there and why in just these parts of the brain."
294,0609801406,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4771466-john-martindale,2,"I honestly don't understand the drive to dethrone humanity and to prove humans are not special, so demolish human ""arrogance"", as if the bacteria were offended by our pride. Well, I guess it derives from atheist's giddy pleasure in asserting people are not made in the image of God. Darwin is believed to have shown that people are nothing but animals, and Gould wants to make sure this dethronement of humanity isn't undermined by the secular humanist embrace of progress in evolution.But even in a completely godless universe, it still seems people are rather unique. Sure, possibly we are not different in kind, but definitely in degree, like the difference of a penny and a million dollars. Sure humans are not as numerous and successful in the game of reproduction as bacteria, and they are not as big as the elephant and the humpback whale, as fast as the cheetah, or as swift as an Eagle, but as long as people like Gould use reason and words to write how valueless and insignificant humanity is and how they are nothing special, they are being deeply oxymoronic.
