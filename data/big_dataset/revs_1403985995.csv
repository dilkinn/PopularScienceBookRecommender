From first chapters, even including introduction part, I didn't understand the meaning of the book: calendar, Arthur, Egyptian pyramids... What is the relation between them. Furthermore, author does not state a final point of view for particular questions, so he leaves them open. The most interesting parts were discussions about Egyptian pyramids and Shroud of Turin. However, gradually, I understood that Turney wants to explain us the world of polentology and archeology. By reading this book, I have explored a different types of dating methods, Minoan Civilization and that there were 4 types of homindae living at one time."

Las dataciones siguen diferentes métodos en función de la cantidad de tiempo que se quiera datar y la formación geológica o biológica de lo que se quiere datar. Incluso son capaces de datar las erupciones volcánicas con los feómenos que se dan al cabo del tiempo entre sus cenizas.El libro es muy corto, apenas 180 páginas, con capítulos por separado totalmente diferenciados, siendo cada capítulo una forma de datación. Habrá a quien interesa datar restos humanos, o animales y habrá quien quiera datar la Tierra o el Universo. Cada uno con su método.Recomendado para públicos con un mínimo de formación; no porque sea excesivamente técnico, sino por el disfrute que se siente cuando se leen la cantidad de métodos que hay y lo ingeniosos que son algunos de ellos."

I am a creationist and the author is an evolutionist but I do not see that we are much different. Both of our views require faith. We are just putting our faith into different things. He puts his faith in science and I put mine in God. There are many truths that have been proven in science but much that I read in this book is based on assumptions that cannot be proven although they have been stated as proofs. I also cannot ""prove"" that God exists other than to say that He has proven Himself to me and I can give examples of how He has worked in my life. So, even though there is disagreement I still enjoyed learning about the things in this book. Now I understand why Easter is at a different time every year!"

В конечном итоге не пожалел - внушительное достоинство этой книги заключается в том, что после её внимательного прочтения начинаешь понимать вопросы и проблемы археологической датировки, а также впечатляешься богатством и сложностью её методик. И она не толстая, как раз на денёк."

5,1403985995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12225197-victoria-adams,5,"As I unpack all those books we’ve had for years I find treasures that I meant to read but, well, never got around to. It’s like Christmas in my house these days. This title is one I probably acquired through a book club. It was purchased to answer a question an avid history nut, such as myself, finds perplexing – how do we know how to date things?This is no easy question in the world of historical and archeological investigation. It gets even touchier when we talk about the age of the earth, the universe, or the advent of man. For instance, you may hear something like, radiocarbon dating is unreliable. Fine, but why, and when? I felt it was time that I read the science and left the media hype to the tabloids and those with specific agendas. This book opened that door, and in an entertaining way. A lot of science, but an easy read.Before I address the book itself, I would like to posit a thought. I have friends and followers with varying positions on evolution, creationism, and all the emotional baggage on both sides. I’ve been there, and reading up on the science is part of what gave me some sense of clarity. For those who are more concerned with scriptural interpretations, I’d like to point out a few things that helped me. There are several chapters in Job where God puts forth on the wonders of the natural world. They are introduced with the question, “Where were you when I laid the foundations of the world?” Yes, indeed. The message in these passages burned in my heart was – don’t make assumptions. Look to creation for your answers, there is a reason things work the way they do.Fast forward to New Testament times and the apostle Paul (whatever his reputation may be) and we find in Romans 1:20 “For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse.” (New American Standard). Again, things evident in nature are meant to tell a story. There are many more similar references. So, why the mini-sermon? Because if I am to believe that we have some direction, that the ancient holy books of our species have something to say about the place we find ourselves and what we should do about it, then I have to believe that there is value in what is said. My thought is this. If we are admonished to look to nature for the creative power within -- if the ancients of many religions tell us to look, to see, to contemplate the marvels before us—then why should we expect something other than truth? Should we expect to find an “appearance of age” to mislead us? Should we find things that are not what they appear to be? Man’s knowledge is not perfect. However, we do have the ability to seek, to find, to follow where the evidence leads. What’s more, I sincerely believe we are commanded to do so.Thus, we get to the book. How do we date things? Turney leads the reader through a step by step process of what amounts to the history of sorting out just how old things are. Starting with how we date things using calendars, and how we convert ancient historical documents to modern calendars to get a sense of time. He describes the fascinating science of dendrochronology: the use of tree rings to count the years and study climate changes. Comparing these records with journals and legends we can better understand when events occurred and some of the reasons a culture changed or died out. He carefully explains how we compare the ratios of compounds in samples, check for luminescence, uranium content and even radiocarbon dating. Yes, it is true, radiocarbon dating has it limits. Due to the half-life of the Carbon 14 atom it is only accurate to somewhere near 40,000 years. I also learned that these methods work not because of one test, but because of a series of tests in an around a sample to plot curves in order to reduce the chance of contamination skewing the sample.The steps taken on specific claims show how the frauds are discovered, and how science corrects itself. He speaks with clarity and provides headline cases and inside adventures to show the reader how the conclusions were constructed. How we learned and how our knowledge is growing.We live in an incredible universe of unbelievable wonder. Our own history is filled with lessons, information, wisdom that we cannot ignore. If we do not put these events in proper context, we cannot learn, we cannot be all that we are created to be. Check out “the science of when things happened.” I think you will find much to contemplate."

7,1403985995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385097-harry-rutherford,3,"Or to give it its fuller, more informative title: Bones Rocks and Stars: The Science of When Things Happened. It is what it sounds like: a brief (under 200 pages, including the index) overview of dating technologies for a general audience: radio isotope dating, dendrochronology, Antarctic ice cores and so on. And I enjoyed it; Turney writes well, and he whizzes through the material leaving me feeling a bit better-informed without it being too much like hard work. And I think that's pretty good going for what is a very technical subject.Interestingly he starts with what I don't think of as a 'scientific' technique at all: his first example of dating is an attempt to fix a plausible date for King Arthur by looking at all the different manuscript evidence and trying to coordinate it. This carries all the usual problems of early medieval history: sparse evidence; second, third, fourth-hand accounts written many years after the event; confusions between different calendars and so on. I was slightly surprised by this way of starting the book, but actually it's quite a good way into the subject. Without any of the technical stuff about radioactive isotopes it illustrates the same kind of problems you might have dating a fossil or anything else: trying to reconcile various kinds of data, each of which carries its own particular problems and sources of error.The choice of King Arthur, as opposed to any of the other myriad shadowy early medieval figures, is an indication of his popular instincts: he does like to use colourful examples. So we get the Turin Shroud, the Pyramids, Thera, Java Man. Which is fine by me.So brief, colourful, and not too technical overview of what is really a vast and complex subject, but if that's what you're looking for (and on the whole I think it was), it does a good job of it."
8,1403985995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3038974-steve-van-slyke,3,"I was expecting this to be more about the science behind dating techniques rather than about the events chosen to illustrate the method. However, it is more the reverse. So, for example, the chapter about the Shroud of Turin is more about the history and controversy surrounding the shroud than it is about the the radio-carbon isotope method used to finally accurately date it. And the same was true for the other examples chosen.Be that as it may, it was still an interesting read, although it will be too basic for anyone who has done much reading in science. For example, anyone who has read a book or two on paleoanthropology will find the chapter on dating human origins very basic. Consequently, it is an excellent book for anyone who wants an accessible introduction to many aspects of science seen through the lense of how we have learned to determine how old things really are.Unfortunately the author starts the book off with the least interesting chapter which details how by cross-referencing ancient texts one can assess the probability that King Arthur might have been more than a mythical character. Once you're past that chapter it rolls along at a nice enjoyable pace.This might also be a good choice for young people just starting to seriously explore the fascinating world of science. The science is blended with enough intriguing mysteries to hold their attention,"
9,1403985995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3265556-converse,3,"Turney, a geologist, uses case studies to explore how events are dated. Topics such as whether or not the explosion of the volcano on the island of Thera destroyed Minoan Crete, when the Earth originated, whether or not the Shroud of Turin is a forgery, when King Arthur might have lived, and the extinction of the dinosaurs are discussed. The means of dating covered include dendrochronology (tree rings), carbon dating, other radioactive decay sequences such as potssium to argon and argon-argon, and uranium to lead decay. Turney takes the view that a ""young earth"" (6000 years) creationist viewpoint would require a lot of science to be overturned; in particular it would require the speed of light (in a vacum) to have been changing. The author keeps to prose rather than mathematical formulas, so those without a science background are unlikely to have difficulty in understanding the text."
10,1403985995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8802285-riina-ojanen,4,"4.5 tähteä.Chris Turneyn kirja iänmäärityksen tieteestä on nautittava ja helppolukuinen johdanto aiheeseen. Iänmääritystä käsitellään mielenkiintoisten case-tapausten kautta, ja mukana on niin kuningas Arthuria, komeettoja, Torinon kääreliinaa kuin dinosauruksiakin. Itse asiassa kirjan rakenne on hyvä. Asiakirjamääritysten kautta siirrytään hiljalleen kohti maasegmenttejä, puiden vuosirenkaita ja radiohiilitutkimusta, josta päästään aina vain uudempiin tekniikoihin. Itse case-tapausten lisäksi kirjaan on mahdutettu myös ajanmäärityksen historiaa, ja mukaan valitut anekdootit kertovat hauskoja ja välillä hieman traagisiakin tarinoita tiedemiesten ponnisteluista aiheen parissa. Aiheeseen jo perehtyineille kirja ei välttämättä tarjoa uutta tietoa, mutta kaltasilleni maallikoille se on kiehtovaa ja yleissivistävää luettavaa.Jos Esko Valtaojan kirjat maistuvat, myös Chris Turneyn kirjalle kannattaa antaa mahdollisuus. Suosittelen lämpimästi."
11,1403985995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5884823-luis,2,"Se trata de un libro que introduce al lector en grandes momentos del pasado y en cómo la ciencia puede ayudarnos a conocer su antigüedad con la mayor exactitud, ya tenga nociones o no en esto de la datación científica.Las preguntas que ofrece son sin duda interesantes: la veracidad de la Sábana Santa, del Rey Arturo, de las grandes extinciones, de la orientación de las pirámides de Keops... La exposición en ese sentido es buena. Donde sin duda el libro se despista bastante es a la hora de meterse en harina: a la hora de explicar los métodos de datación se eleva a un nivel técnico endiablado que no le hace justicia al tono ameno que profesa. A mí estas partes puntuales me han llegado a desmotivar.Sin embargo, si se cogen fuerzas, se le puede dar un intento. Las preguntas quedan respondidas con la mayor precisión que permiten los registros históricos y científicos. En ese sentido, he aprendido bastantes cosas."
12,1403985995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"An interesting book which delves into the science of 'when' events occurred using techniques such as dendochronology, radiocarbon dating, argon dating, electron spin resonance dating and others. Each chapter covers the dating of a different event including: construction of the Egyptian pyramids, the shroud of Turin, ice ages, and the migration of hominids out of Africa among others. From a readability standpoint I'd have to say that some chapters are far more interesting than others. In fact the first chapter which discusses who King Arthur may have been and when he lived was almost unreadable. I suppose this book could best be described as 'uneven'.Some good information nonetheless and several chapters were quite interesting. "
13,1403985995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2273065-wayne-stone,0,"""Time is one of the greatest of all our obsessions (p. 1)."" This is the first sentence and the author builds on it through the book. He gives a quick hitting scientific cause and effect of why and how scientific dating methods were developed and applied to solve problems of historical importance. Ultimately he concludes the book with the problem of dating the age of the earth and how that came about and its implications. In general, quick read, narrative and lots of interesting information about the dating methods [not pick up lines:]."
14,1403985995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5264590-david-porter,4,"Surveys pretty much all of the dating discipline, without going into too much detail about any one specific technique. Discusses why dating is important, uncertainties and limitations of each technique, a sampling of controversial theories as a result of different estimated ages, and how dating drives many of the largest disciplines (climatology, astronomy, evolution, anthropology, etc)"
15,1403985995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2248469-anna,5,"Super easy to read, and informative. A great book for anyone who wants a light shined on how different dating methods work. Written by a Brit so all the little allegorical stories are British (one is about a pop song), and all the measurements are metric, which kind of sucks... (how tall is 3 meters?) But other than that its great."
16,1403985995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/903061-tometheus,4,"Good overview of different dating techniques for the layperson. I would have liked a little more detail personally, but I would definitely recommend it for non-physicists. My only real quibble was the chapter on King Arthur, which was more about literary criticism than hard science."
17,1403985995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5775132-scott,4,"This is a great book about what we know and how we know it. I got out of it exactly what I was hoping to - and also what I had been hoping for from Dawkins' Magic of Reality, which I found extremely disappointing."
18,1403985995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1329406-sara,5,"this book is pretty good. trying to ease myself back into an academic mindset. also, if you have any relatives that are younger, like in jr. high or so, i think this would be a good read to spur interest in science or history.highly recommended. absolutely."
19,1403985995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3282557-marc,4,Why time is important as a scientific parameter; how is it measured or estimated? A great book for the interested non-scientist. Explains various ways that time can be measured and the disciplines that use or measure it.
20,1403985995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6898927-ben-hammond,4,I found this book a very accessible and enjoyable account of the many different ways that scientists date ancient objects.
21,1403985995,http://goodreads.com/user/show/688965-sean,3,"A very introductory book on various dating controversies. Good enough for what it is, but not for anyone who's at all familiar with anything scientific. It would be great for kids."
