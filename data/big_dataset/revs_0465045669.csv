Because I understood almost all of it the very first time through while GEB took me about a year to digest, chewing slowly over each cognitive morsel, sometimes metaphorically regurgitating it a few times before getting it through the cerebral equivalent of my lower intestines. Metamagical Themas is food for thought, but it’s simple sugars, perhaps a fruit smoothie to GEB’s heavy proteins and complex carbohydrates. GEB was work to read. Immensely satisfying, but work nonetheless. This was a stroll in the park by comparison, and what a delightful park indeed. This book introduced me to many fascinating concepts, and had a lasting influence on me in two significant ways. 1) I tried to develop my very own personal font. And 2) It inspired me write my own book about game theory. I finished writing the book. The font remains an unrealized fantasy. But definitely something with serifs. The title, by the way, is an anagram of “Mathematical Games.” This is appropriate, because games are, by definition, fun. And you’d have to look far and wide to find so much fun in mathematics. "
2,0465045669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/482722-neil,5,"I don't recall how or where I got this book as a young teenager; I swear my aunt gave it to me but she denies it. This book is a collection of Hofstader's essays and columns, many of which were published in Scientific American. I'd say the first time I read this book I understood about an eighth of what he was talking about; I dare say if I read it again I might barely be above half. Not because the writing is difficult, but because the topics are diverse and deep. Hofstader's column in Scientific American was intended to bridge the literary and the scientific, and does. The book - titled after the column - contains essays on self-referential sentences (""The reader of this sentence exists only while reading me"" is one of my favorites); the mathematics of Frederic Chopin's compositions; a taxonomy of Rubik's Cube variations; the emerging studies of chaos and compexity; metafonts; artificial intelligence and machine learning; what the word ""I"" means; and a deep study of the mechanics and ethics of cooperation. This book was probably the most influential book I read growing up, as I think it set me on the path to study computer science. But its effect was even broader. Metamagical Themas encouraged me to play with ideas, with words and with the world around me. "
3,0465045669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5," This book is as good as Godel, Escher, and Bach (1979)because it goes Meta with the material. It is a collection of articles that Hofstadter wrote for the Scientific American magazine in the early 1980s after his hit with Godel, Escher, and Bach. It explores a myriad of topics related to the original plus his fears of the day like sexism and the nuclear arms race and of course, the philosophical and mathematical ideas are timeless and perennial. "
4,0465045669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2155518-sara,4,"This book is huge - like a massive dictionary - and packed with a bunch of essays on a range of topics too broad to even try to describe. Some of them were great and either made you laugh or think about things you hadn't before, though a few weren't as good. But overall, if you can make it through this book, it's worth the interesting journey. "
5,0465045669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58921426-keenan,2,"It's hard to give up on a book 200 pages in, but this collection of essays by Douglas Hofstadter really doesn't present anything new that other authors haven't done better. I got past all his stuff about self referential sentences (a few gems in the rough), a political science game where the rules keep changing (total yawnfest), some opinions about people's gullibility to the supernatural (meh), and the inability of most to properly estimate large numbers (also not terribly interesting). His post scriptums don't add much to the original essays beyond tangential rambling, and with hundreds of pages to go this is going to be a definite pass from me."
6,0465045669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/917269-thomas,5,"While this is not exactly a review, I thought I'd leave a few comments here. I recently got this on Kindle, so I've been slowly revisiting a few choice bits here and there. For what it's worth, I was dumbfounded to see this was available on Kindle. Given that his most popular and best selling book Gödel, Escher, Bach is still not available for Kindle, I took it for granted that none of his books were available on Kindle (except, perhaps, I am a Strange Loop, published, if I recall correctly, after Kindles were already on the market).Anyway, after downloading this, I started flipping through the chapters wondering which I should reread and was a bit stunned to be reminded that there are 3 chapters on Lisp. What's interesting about this is imagining this text appearing in Scientific American. While I have fond memories of what SciAm used to be, it's hard to gel that with the image of SciAm that I currently have in my head. The days of meaty, tangible material in technical magazine that you could actually sit down and do something with (c.f., Byte), seem so long ago (Make and the recently deceased, in print format, Linux Journal, not withstanding) that it's hard to picture actual articles on Lisp appearing in what was, in fact, a fairly popular science magazine. This is not to say that SciAm is not still of good quality, but it's certainly a very different beast than what it used to be. These days, I would basically call it a nicer version of Discover (again, not to denigrate that magazine, but it certainly lacks depth in most cases).To be continued..."
7,0465045669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/136820-nicholas,4,"This is (mostly) a collection of Hofstadter's Scientific American columns. As a result the content is even more diverse in this book than in Gödel, Escher, Bach, and reading a few columns in a row left me a little bewildered. A couple of the essays seemed a little dated. For example, he gives a discussion of large numbers with frequent references to Rubik's Cube - but maybe my dislike of the reference is just because I'm terrible at that thing.That said, Hofstadter is a wonderfully imaginative and entertaining writer, and there were some themes underlying the whole book which anybody familiar with Hofstadter will be able to guess, such as the nature of intelligence and consciousness and the concept of self-reference. Each essay is small and self-contained, making this book one I will feel comfortable going back to and re-reading."
8,0465045669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180908-tatiana,5,"The thing I loved about this one is the playfulness involved. Sometimes I thought my head was going to explode from the weird wonderfulness of the ideas. The two chapters on self-referential sentences were absolutely delightful. Some I recall: ""It goes without saying that""""Let us make a new convention that any thing shown in triple quotes, for instance '''I've changed my mind, when you reach the close of the triple quotes, just go directly to the period at the end of the sentence, and ignore everything up to that point''' should not even be read or given the slightest attention, much less actually obeyed.""Yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation"" yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation.Definitely a great read!"
9,0465045669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126741-jimi-olivo,5,"I'd always wanted to solve the Rubik's Cube. Then, while reading his chapter on the principles of the cube, specifically 'Partial Inverses', I had the flash of insight I needed, and BLAMMO: cube solved. This isn't a joke, it really happened.I expect most people will have similar flashes of insight in every chapter. Buy this book. Read it. Forget treating it well. Destroy the book while reading it. Take it to the beach. Write in the margins. Scribble out words and replace them with improved approximations. Spill coffee on it. Throw it against the wall. Forget you left it on the bed and fuck on it. Dog ear the pages. Skip chapters and never look back (you'll be back).Do everything you can to get through it. No judgments. Feeling comfortable with these ideas will enrich your life. "

Not only is Metamagical Themas a great source (and resource) in itself, but it will lead you to other fascinating books--to wit books that deal not only with science but with literature and music. I owe Hofstadter a debt of gratitude for providing me with his wonderful introduction to the works of Allen Wheelis."

12,0465045669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6706284-assaad,5,"Another book added to my personal favorite! This book is just amazing, I liked it even more than the mystical Godel Escher Bach. I bought the book originally just to have the honor to read the original article of Dr. Hofstadter on Superrationality in game theory, and I was completely stunned by the diversity of articles presented in the book. Surely my best part of the book is the last 100 pages where he tackled game theoretical problems and experiments. The best passage ever, is the one that I have waited all along my reading, the recursive definition of superrational players: “Supperational thinkers, by recursive definition, include in their calculations the fact that they are in a group of superrational thinkers.""What a beautiful mind on Dr. Doug. All my respects!"

22,0465045669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509598-alex-lee,4,"Douglas Hofstadter is a strange man. He obviously likes building systems of thought; but he resists often solidifying his conjectures into systems. He resists building systems. The reason why is that he takes a STEM approach to things; that for that he has a system. Instead, in these conjectures he dovetails into other areas that are not hand-science (like that of philosophy of mind or philosophy or linguistics) but he utilizes a STEM approach.The problem with this is that STEM approaches like all sciences attempts to focus on defining its content in terms of what that content does -- which is NOT the only way humans create meaning. For instance, people can reason by metaphor or analogy. These can work in order to highlight the avenues of sensemaking for humans; with that sensemaking we know what options we have, even if the content is non-literal. Doing science requires content that is literal however; attempting to treat alchemy like science, for instance, will fail because the content of alchemy is littered with cultural modes of reason, like the medieval elements of air, earth, fire and water -- literally not true. But for the purposes of highlighting which medicines to take (based on cultural knowledge) it can work... sometimes. Anyway, because Hofstadter focuses on content one of the ""trippy"" areas he delights in is exploring where form and content interrelate because that boundary is ill defined in STEM thinking, so he will look at something in terms of form, and then in terms of content and then mix the two together, seeing them flip inside and out. Interesting perhaps, but I, like many of us ""serious"" readers, like ""insight-porn"" and so he is providing me with inkling of tidbits but lacks the sophisticated terminology to really systematize his thinking. So to me that is sad and a waste of time. For instance, his exploration of fonts is interesting but it leads nowhere because he doesn't avoids developing the language of graphology or iconography in order to truly answer his questions (like ""what makes the letter ""A"" ""A"" when we change fonts radically?) He could go into some early machine learning techniques -- he is certainly smart enough to do so -- but resists that too, because this is just an intellectual game for him, not something that has deeper implications in to other areas. He often finds interesting relationships but then resists extending them into other areas (although sometimes he does extend them into other areas!) But I suspect this limitation is because he adopts a STEM view in which only certain descriptions are worthy of nominalization and only certain methods can yield consistent truths...Still, towards the end when he looks at game theory that is very interesting, and that made this otherwise somewhat disappointing book worth reading. I like his arguments for how to reason in terms of game theory because it takes a meta-approach that positions the thinker among those he thinks about, and that my friends is totally fantastic, because it relates to things like metamodernism and post-structuralism in a fascinating way... but that is for a different topic. My opinion of Hofstadter is that he is a brilliant man, an engaging writer but for me, he lacks the methods really needed to answer the questions he asks. Instead he asks them and is pleased to look at what he examines in wonder. And that wonder is a great attitude to have, even though if he was a little more critical I think he would see much more available. Still that attitude is something we can all learn from, and for me, reading him in HS, that was a great influence even though decades later I am a little muffled at what looks like close attempts at developing new avenues of thinking -- but ultimately it is thwarted because the author is too busy playing in the muckity-muck to really see what he has done."
23,0465045669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/811989-douglas-summers-stay,4,"When I first read this (it was during the summer, I remember, at my grandparents' house-- 1989, maybe? so about 30 years ago) it opened my eyes to a hundred new ideas. I found his meta- play endlessly funny, and was awestruck by the cleverness and thoughtfulness displayed on every page. It was playing with ideas in a way I had never seen. I had enjoyed Godel Escher Bach, but a lot of it had gone over my head. This book however, was right at my level and it just grabbed me. It's probably a big part of why I am an AI researcher today: the questions he asked -- about how thinking happens, analogies, the nature of concepts, the depth of connotations, what it means to understand, the source of creativity -- never left me.Since that time, though, I feel like many of those questions have been answered to my satisfaction. For example, one of the essays is about what would need to happen to create a machine capable of inventing new typefaces. There's been research on that, and with Generative Adversarial Networks and artistic style transfer I feel like the problem is more than half-solved. He raises the issue of how a concept, as represented by a computer, can carry all the richness of association that human concepts do. But in the General Pretrained Transformer networks, they've really captured that. It's just as amazing as he hinted that it would be. Hofstadter himself, though, has been left behind. He no longer keeps up with the relevant research in the field. His last lecture that I saw online was a grouchy complaint that Google Translate was unable to handle famously difficult, heavily constrained ancient Chinese poetry. Which, yeah. Hofstadter himself taught me, though, that the ability to be creative in little ways (translating everyday French to English, say) is not a difference in kind from creative genius. It's just a matter of degree, and degree translates to processing power, which we get more of every year. So I feel this deep frustration that he has refused to carry on his arguments into the present day, to respond to the miraculous achievement of many of his dreams in his clever, thoughtful way. (Which I know is not his fault, exactly.)In many ways, he is still ahead of time in this book, though. In the last five years or so, people have begun to talk about what pronouns they want to be called by, and at least two people I know personally go by ""they/their."" And we have generally moved away as a society over the last 30 years from ""default male"" language patterns, like ""early man"", ""all men are created equal"", ""fireman"", and ""he"" meaning ""he or she."" But Hofstadter goes a step beyond this, showing how embedding gender information into pronouns at all is, in a Sapir/Whorf way, sexist at a very deep level.I also have a better understanding of consciousness than I did back then. In the early 80s, you could still (as Hofstadter frequently does in this book) talk about ""consciousness"" to philosophers and not get called on it. Today, though, we routinely separate access consciousness from phenomenal consciousness, sentience, wakefulness, transitive consciousness, and so forth. We can talk about how they are related or distinct. I think if Hofstadter could clarify with modern vocabulary which he was talking about, a lot of the clouds surrounding his ideas would be dispelled-- maybe to their benefit, but also maybe to their detriment.At several times as I read the book, I paused to see if GPT-2 could continue his line of thinking, or his lists of examples. It did an amazing job on continuing the self-referential story, in which every sentence is self-referential.I want to write a detailed paper in response, addressing his points one by one. Who would read it, though? The arguments have moved on."
24,0465045669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8173124-george-marshall,3,"It was enjoyable to read, but by the end I was simply happy to be done. The topics are numerous, and interesting, some more than others. And I even have a basic affinity for much of the author's views. I was just weary of him speaking in a way. And I can't put my finger on directly why. Maybe it is the repetition. Individual articles overlap significantly in theme. But even within a single article a particular nail can be hit with a colorful assortment of hammers, pipe-wrenches, violin cases and ant farms. Maybe it would have been better to read all these articles serialized in the magazine, without all the commentary and post post post scriptums. They were interesting though!Martin Gardner. I get it. Awesome guy, great puzzler and writer. Magician, I suppose? But I find myself unenthused. And Hofstadter's role with Scientific American, its dependence on Gardner, and their friendship, all make his repeated mention understandable. But at some point you tire of it. I think the author does well-enough of making his own voice and mood clear, especially toward the very end. But by then it was too late. I wasn't reading to hear about Gardner, magic or puzzles. I was reading because of my interest in math, intelligence, logic, language, and what I saw as Hofstadter's shared interest. All related, for sure, but not the same. Obviously, he is quite interested in the puzzle side of tackling these things, and I not so much. Or maybe that is just a facet of his approach, attempting to popularize these topics. So that is on me I suppose, and not any failure he owns.Then there are the repeated mentions of Gödel, Escher, Bach. Yes, that is maybe what most people are familiar with in relation to the author. But I found myself thinking, was the column just a reheat of GEB, or does he have something novel, a new twist or thought to offer? Actually, his columns on analogy in this book offered some benefit over GEB, and I found that section all the more enjoyable for it.Unfortunately this is coming off more negative than I would like, and this is due to my ""mood"" concerning it at the finish. But it was enjoyable. There are many, many nuggets to grab hold of and twist in the brain in prolonged study: for example, analogy and its centrality to human-like thought (or is it all thought?), the barrier/boundary between connectedness and symbol manipulation and its relevance to both artificial and ""real"" intelligence or consciousness, and I was enthralled by the column concerning Chopin, different as it was, yet echoing in a lovely way.So, happy I read it. But also happy to read something else for a change."
25,0465045669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43650579-duncan,4,"This book has taken me a while to read, but apart from two or three chapters I failed to get into, I have really enjoyed it. Douglas writes in a pleasant conversational style, only occasionally seeming outdated.Of course, the most important aspect of this book was the ideas, many of which have worked their way into my skull and will continue to to dance around in there for months to come. I particularly enjoyed the chapters on self-referential sentences, and I found the the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma chapter to resonate strongly and provide much food for thought.The two rapturous chapters on the Rubik's Cube and the notation for solving it were amusing in their enthusiasm, but I must admit I flipped through most of the details. The idea of Parquet deformations inspired me to try to think of of a way to create animations of them. I had a brief assignation with Lisp with an app on my phone after Hofstadter's Lisp: Recursion and Generality chapter, and enjoyed the silly food-related expanding acronyms.In all it has been a fairly long journey, but a very enjoyable one. There are ideas in my head now which would be worthwhile thinking and writing about, even if for the sole reason that it would be a shame to let them diffuse into my my brain without recalling a definite impression."
26,0465045669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13542582-bohdan-pechenyak,5,"A whale of a book, but totally worth it - a collection of the author's columns from ""Scientific American"" in the early 1980s, each with its own ""Post-script"", which in some cases exceeds the original column, depending on the topic.

In short, it's a whirlwind tour through cognitive science (self-reference, recursion, meaning of ""self"", rationality), computer science (artificial intelligence, subcognition computation, Alan Turing), music and art reviews (as seen through cognitive science and philosophy of mind - Chopin, mechanizing and creativity, typography, etc.), social commentary (i.e. on the sexist language use), mathematics (Rubik's cube, patterns, chaos theory), and more (game theory, genetics).

It was not a good move on the part of Scientific American to change it's foreword writer (which he did for each issue for a long time) for the reason of the Computer Age.....the writer who took over from Hofstadter for Scientific American just did not have as much character, in fact I can't even remember his name - Hofstadter's predecessor was Martin Gardner, without looking anything up - I also bought the collection of his Scientific American articles ~ Mathematical Games - The Entire Collection of Martin Gardner's Scientific American Articles, yes, both volumes. Much much better than ""the Computer Age guy"", that is all he is to me, S.

Along the way there is material on the Rubik's cube, on the nuclear arms war, on typefaces, on the Lisp programming language, and on game theory. It's not quite the integrated tour-de-force that GEB is, but still extremely thought-provoking.

This time, I found many of the chapters very dated because the whole field of AI has simply exploded in the intervening years. Some of the chapters are more relevant than ever such as Chapter 5 World Views in Collision. It presents a sort of preview to the kind of dueling realities we see online every day now. Also the chapters on Alan Turing are always a good read and the discussions on consciousness, perception and free will are timeless and thought provoking as ever.

But there is so much here that showcases an incredible perspective and intellect, on so many wonderful issues around intelligence, identity and patterns in life.

32,0465045669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57111184-spartacus7,3,"I started this book in the late 80s - I think I must have bought it at the Harvard Coop. It consists of 30+ chapters + postscripts, most of which were written for Scientific American. Hofstadter took over from Martin Gardner in 1981. Gardner's Mathematical Games column lasted over 20 years and became the the most popular feature of the magazine. Hofstadter took a different view to just 'games' - he stepped into mind and meaning, with considerable focus on Artificial Intelligence. These are his fortes. All very appealing, in principle.I got about 2-3 chapters into Metamagical Themas at the time and never picked it up again till now (2019). Those first 2-3 chapters are very interesting and quite a few others are well done and thought-provoking. The quality is very patchy, however, and the repetitive nature of many of the points to be made becomes increasingly frustrating, as does the persistent - almost narcissistic - referencing to his major work, ""Godel, Escher, Bach"". Beyond this, however, many of the chapters, unfortunately, are utterly tedious. As examples: The 3 chapters on the AI program Lisp became progressively more dire, and never, in my view, actually get to the point. Instead, they persisted with a series of increasingly difficult coding exercises - great for coders who wanted to learn Lisp, I guess, but barely illuminating about AI coding in general.

It consists of 30+ chapters + postscripts, most of which were written for Scientific American. Hofstadter took over from Martin Gardner in 1981. Gardner's Mathematical Games column lasted over 20 years and became the the most popular feature of the magazine. Hofstadter took a different view to just 'games' - he stepped into mind and meaning, with considerable focus on Artificial Intelligence. These are his fortes. All very appealing, in principle.I got about 2-3 chapters into Metamagical Themas at the time and never picked it up again till now (2019). Those first 2-3 chapters are very interesting and quite a few others are well done and thought-provoking. The quality is very patchy, however, and the repetitive nature of many of the points to be made becomes increasingly frustrating, as does the persistent - almost narcissistic - referencing to his major work, ""Godel, Escher, Bach"". Beyond this, however, many of the chapters, unfortunately, are utterly tedious. As examples: The 3 chapters on the AI program Lisp became progressively more dire, and never, in my view, actually get to the point. Instead, they persisted with a series of increasingly difficult coding exercises - great for coders who wanted to learn Lisp, I guess, but barely illuminating about AI coding in general. Scientific American readers at the time were 'treated' to these 3 chapters in successive issues. The worst chapter is Inside the Careenium - a Platonic-style discussion between Achilles and a tortoise. Poor Plato, to be (ab)used in this way. Perhaps he would give a bitter shake of the head, and one also coming from Randy Read, Hofstadter's initial and partial co-author of this piece. Hofstadter claims that after 2.5 years of columns he had said all he wanted to say but I can only think that SciAm had all they wanted to have of this rather rapidly degenerating, increasingly marginalising stuff. Maybe a hard core would have been left as this column played towards an increasingly niche section of the readership.I have given 3 stars but perhaps 2 is enough - and the range for the chapters is large...anywhere from 0-4 stars."

It consists of 30+ chapters + postscripts, most of which were written for Scientific American. Hofstadter took over from Martin Gardner in 1981. Gardner's Mathematical Games column lasted over 20 years and became the the most popular feature of the magazine. Hofstadter took a different view to just 'games' - he stepped into mind and meaning, with considerable focus on Artificial Intelligence. These are his fortes. All very appealing, in principle.I got about 2-3 chapters into Metamagical Themas at the time and never picked it up again till now (2019). Those first 2-3 chapters are very interesting and quite a few others are well done and thought-provoking. The quality is very patchy, however, and the repetitive nature of many of the points to be made becomes increasingly frustrating, as does the persistent - almost narcissistic - referencing to his major work, ""Godel, Escher, Bach"". Beyond this, however, many of the chapters, unfortunately, are utterly tedious. As examples: The 3 chapters on the AI program Lisp became progressively more dire, and never, in my view, actually get to the point. Instead, they persisted with a series of increasingly difficult coding exercises - great for coders who wanted to learn Lisp, I guess, but barely illuminating about AI coding in general. Scientific American readers at the time were 'treated' to these 3 chapters in successive issues. The worst chapter is Inside the Careenium - a Platonic-style discussion between Achilles and a tortoise. Poor Plato, to be (ab)used in this way. Perhaps he would give a bitter shake of the head, and one also coming from Randy Read, Hofstadter's initial and partial co-author of this piece. Hofstadter claims that after 2.5 years of columns he had said all he wanted to say but I can only think that SciAm had all they wanted to have of this rather rapidly degenerating, increasingly marginalising stuff. Maybe a hard core would have been left as this column played towards an increasingly niche section of the readership.I have given 3 stars but perhaps 2 is enough - and the range for the chapters is large...anywhere from 0-4 stars."

It consists of 30+ chapters + postscripts, most of which were written for Scientific American. Hofstadter took over from Martin Gardner in 1981. Gardner's Mathematical Games column lasted over 20 years and became the the most popular feature of the magazine. Hofstadter took a different view to just 'games' - he stepped into mind and meaning, with considerable focus on Artificial Intelligence. These are his fortes. All very appealing, in principle.I got about 2-3 chapters into Metamagical Themas at the time and never picked it up again till now (2019). Those first 2-3 chapters are very interesting and quite a few others are well done and thought-provoking. The quality is very patchy, however, and the repetitive nature of many of the points to be made becomes increasingly frustrating, as does the persistent - almost narcissistic - referencing to his major work, ""Godel, Escher, Bach"". Beyond this, however, many of the chapters, unfortunately, are utterly tedious. As examples: The 3 chapters on the AI program Lisp became progressively more dire, and never, in my view, actually get to the point. Instead, they persisted with a series of increasingly difficult coding exercises - great for coders who wanted to learn Lisp, I guess, but barely illuminating about AI coding in general. Scientific American readers at the time were 'treated' to these 3 chapters in successive issues. The worst chapter is Inside the Careenium - a Platonic-style discussion between Achilles and a tortoise. Poor Plato, to be (ab)used in this way. Perhaps he would give a bitter shake of the head, and one also coming from Randy Read, Hofstadter's initial and partial co-author of this piece. Hofstadter claims that after 2.5 years of columns he had said all he wanted to say but I can only think that SciAm had all they wanted to have of this rather rapidly degenerating, increasingly marginalising stuff. Maybe a hard core would have been left as this column played towards an increasingly niche section of the readership.I have given 3 stars but perhaps 2 is enough - and the range for the chapters is large...anywhere from 0-4 stars."

Somehow that concern has faded from the forefront of our minds, but now we have terrorism and global warming to deal with instead.
