1906...the shrug.We have all had those professors who have spent a lifetime sticking interesting facts into their heads. These facts may be pertinent to their particular line of enquiry for which they are considered an expert, or they might be random interesting tidbits of knowledge that have been squirrelled away for future research. They might even be just fascinating stories that may have very little to do with anything else. Except of course that everything is connected. Degrees of separation and all that. I had this Russian history professor at the University of Arizona who was decades removed from his best years, and nearing the time when someone was going to start talking to him about all the time he will have to devout to research...once he retires. The hook, in other words, was coming soon. His diseased spine bent him forward. It required some effort for him to raise his head far enough to look someone in the eye. He also listed a bit to the right when he walked, reminding me of Stevenson’s Hyde. He had a full beard, still naturally black despite his age, which made him look very Russian, and therefore, very authentic when discussing Ivan the Terrible or the Cossacks. He would pace back and forth with his hands behind his back gazing at the floor as he lectured. He always wore this black coat. I was once talking to him after class when he fumbled open the black buttons with thick fingers and flapped the jacket open. Hot air escaped as if he’d just opened an Egyptian tomb. Sweat stained his shirt from his armpit to his waist, and the fetid odor of fennel marinated in vodka and stale socks blossomed in the room. He was a terrible rambler, skipping from one point in history to another, and throwing in bits and pieces of history outside of Russia as well. One day a student interrupted him for the second time to ask, yet again, if what he was discussing was going to be on the test. He asked her very kindly to leave the room and to please drop the class. I was slogging my way through the class textbook, so I really didn’t need him to regurgitate what I was already reading. Mostly, I just wanted to stay quiet, and let him talk about whatever he wanted to talk about. Most people expect and want things presented to them in a linear fashion, so I was not surprised to see the class shrink in size as students abandoned ship for the lifeboats with the hope that some other teacher would provide them with more pleasant waters to float in. Now the reason I tell this story is that this book reminded me of that professor. Simon Winchester has written a book that is not easy to categorize. Is it simply a book of random musings, loosely contained to a theme by duct tape and bailing wire? Is it an indulgent travelogue? Is it a 101 geology seminar? Is Kenny G playing saxophone in the background? I’d have to answer yes to these questions...well...not Kenny G. Let’s not be ridiculous. The subtitle of the book is America and the Great California Earthquake of 1906. From perusing quickly through other reviews, there were many readers who were very frustrated with the fact that the book was not focused on the topic they were most interested in reading about... the Great Earthquake of 1906. The title is mildly misleading, but then again I think there was an editor, a publisher, and a writer who were unsure of exactly how to categorize this book and decided to simplify things for marketing purposes. 

The Eastern edge of the North American Plate reminds me of fortresses from another time.Winchester does discuss the San Francisco disaster, but before that he takes us on a trip to Iceland, to the eastern edge of the North American Plate, which also happens to be the location of some of the world’s oldest parliamentary democracies. The edge forms a dramatic, though stable geography that certainly lends grandeur to any gathering. We cross the U.S. where he discusses the 1886 Charleston quake, the rumblings that happened at New Madrid, Missouri, in 1811-12, and Meers, Oklahoma, where there is a beautiful fault visible from the air. He climbs Mount Diablo and catches a clear enough day to be able to gaze upon San Francisco. ”I squinted through a big brass telescope that had been obligingly placed on the parapet. My feeling that this was a confection of untoward and only half-urban-looking delicacy was confirmed by the magnifying lenses. How tightly San Francisco appeared to cling on to its hillsides: One would imagine knuckles whitened, sinews straining, teeth gritted.”

The San Andreas Fault, the Western edge of the The North American Plate, much more volatile than the Eastern edge. We slide over to Parkfield, California, which right now is the seismic capital of the world with numerous earthquakes per month that range up and down the richter scale. We go to Alaska to see where the trans-Alaska pipeline crosses the Denali Fault. The pipeline is crooked like the back of my professor and placed on rollers that will hopefully give the pipeline enough give to not rupture if an earthquake does occur. He does spend a decent amount of time talking about the 8.25 earthquake that forever changed the cityscape of San Francisco. He tells individual stories, some of them by famous people, some of them just incredibly unlucky people like Paul Pickney who had the distinction of surviving the 1884 Charleston trembler and the 1906 San Francisco quake. One of my favorite stories involved a four year old Ansel Adams who was thrown to the ground during the quake and cracked his nose. His parents and doctor decided not to fix the nose, and it became the most rugged feature of his famous, classical profile. 28,188 buildings were destroyed. It was stated, to quell fears of future and present residents, that most of the destruction came from fire (error of man) instead of from the earthquake (God’s wrath). They believe over 3000 people perished, but due to a conspiracy of suppression of the actual numbers only 700 were officially claimed. For the city to rebuild they needed more people to come West, and they quite effectively controlled the narrative of the extent of the destruction. 

It is a rare opportunity indeed to have your picture taken in front of such devastation. Irrefutable evidence that you were there. I thought it was interesting how suicide rates went way down after the earthquake. People suddenly had something more, something larger than themselves, to worry about. If their lives were stressful or pathetic or wretched before the earthquake, suddenly all of that was swept away, along with quite possibly all that they owned in the world. I have often thought that, if everyone had to worry more about day to day living, many of our psychological problems would be reduced in size or even possibly eliminated. I think we have too much time to think about our current state of affairs, many of them beyond our control; and yet, we are swimming in a relative lap of luxury and safety compared to most of human history. It is so difficult to be happy. Maybe we own too much and try to do too much. The San Francisco quake, called the Loma Prieta Earthquake, that occurred in 1989 was not, as everyone hoped, a releasing of pressure along the San Andreas. ”If the assumption about Loma Prieta is correct, then the last time the San Andreas Fault moved in Northern California was not in 1989 but in fact a very long time ago, back in 1906--which means that, with the steady annual movement of its foundations, the two plates are now nearly 200 inches, about 17 feet, out of kilter. This means that an unimaginably enormous amount of kinetic energy is currently stored in the rocks of the Bay Area; one day, and probably very soon, this energy will all be relieved, without warning.”I finished reading this book at about 12:55AM in the morning of November 19th, 2015. I was finally drifting off to sleep after sifting through some of the last pieces of information that Winchester had stuck in my head when I felt or heard a jolt that brought me wide awake. The window in the bathroom rattled. I didn’t for one second think it was a truck rumbling through the neighborhood. I knew it was an earthquake. My daughter texted me from her apartment in Wichita. “Did you feel that?”Oh yeah, I felt it alright. I found out the next morning that it was a 4.7 magnitude earthquake with an epicenter just south of us in Cherokee, Oklahoma. To say this book moved me would be an understatement. The timing couldn’t have been better for the universe to talk to me.

1,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1232712-matt,2,"The story of how I started reading this book begins outside San Antonio, as I guided my Subaru Outback onto Interstate-10, set the cruise control, and settled back for the long, empty ride to El Paso. It was August 2010, and my wife and I were midway through our Great 2010 Unplanned Battlefield Tour Road Trip Extravaganza. After visiting Shiloh, Vicksburg, San Jacinto and the Alamo, I acquiesced to my wife’s plea that we see the Grand Canyon since a) it was the Grand Canyon and b) it wasn’t a battlefield (frankly, the battlefield-centric part of the road trip was my idea). Anyway, we had 700 miles to go to our overnight destination in Silver City, and precious few radio stations to help us pass the time. (Though I contend that my vivid retelling of the slaughter at Goliad was worth at least an hour to an hour and a half). Thus, my wife put in an audio version of Simon Winchester’s A Crack in the Edge of the World: America and the Great California Earthquake of 1906 to bide the time.The first thing we noticed was that Simon narrated this himself, in his rich, Oxford-ian accent, which sounded suspiciously like an average American actor attempting to impersonate a snooty English butler. The second thing we noticed was that his narrative didn't seem to be going anywhere. If Simon wasn’t (putatively) reading from his own book, I would’ve sworn that he’d had a couple glasses of wine and started rambling like Grandpa Simpson.The audio book was so bad it was funny. But after awhile, it was just bad. Accordingly, my wife hit the eject button, and we settled for the tense silence that comes from driving 1,000 miles and visiting four separate battlefields in four days. (The Days Inn in Silver City was a fine cap to that day; before we went to sleep, we played a game called Guess How Many Drifters Were Murdered In This Hotel).I’m stubborn when it comes to books. I don’t like to leave things unfinished. Sometime after we’d returned home, vowing to never speak of my total and absolute meltdown on the Kansas Turnpike (I have to pay to drive across Kansas!? I wouldn’t go to Kansas if they paid me!), I purchased A Crack in the Edge of the World from a used book store. It was the same digressionary, drifting storytelling as before, except this time it was up to my brain to provide the British accent. (And unfortunately, my brain often confuses British and Scottish accents). The book description and the subtitle might lead you to believe it is about the Great San Francisco Earthquake. You wouldn’t be entirely wrong. It’s there, sort of, buried in the midst of a steam-of-conscious verbal ejaculation that mimics Kerouac at his most frenzied, except that Winchester is fueled by ego and snobbery rather than mescaline. Mostly, though, this book is about Simon Winchester, and how he is smarter than you, more well traveled than you, and generally better than you in every particular facet of life. A Crack at the Edge of the World begins with Simon conning his publisher to pay him to travel across the world on a geologic journey, visiting places of seismic importance. Never mind that this mainly consists of Simon driving across the United States making condescending remarks about middle-America, he sure seems to be having fun! (Maybe I’m a bit jealous… I mean, I’d certainly love the chance to get paid to drive around looking down my noses at people and reciting various arcane bits of trivia. Hell, I’d do that for free). Look, I’m not saying Simon isn’t smart. He is. He certainly, most definitely, is intelligent. I know, because he told me. He also has a strong background in geology, so he can articulately expound about all the complex business going on beneath our feet. He goes on and on with erudition and awe about the collisions of tectonic plates and magma and the supercontinent of Pangaea (which will be the foundation for the failed Fox drama I am currently scripting), all of which is illustrated with maps and drawings and a picture of the general store in Meers, Oklahoma, because it’s just so quaint and rustic to his classically trained mind. This is all well and good, except that geology is boring except for the earthquakes so get to the damn earthquake already! Simon gets to the earthquake, rest assured. It just takes 234 pages of meanders, digressions, and entirely useless footnotes about topics completely unrelated to anything remotely touched-upon in this book. The ceaseless introduction of know-it-all non sequiturs might not have been so annoying in a book of more elegance. And to be charitable, there are some nice sequences, including Simon’s description of a night solo-camping on Mount Diablo. The problem, though, is that these detours are interspersed with a lot of seismological jargon that requires slow, careful reading to make any sense. The geology lessons, combined with the anecdotal side-streets, combine to slow the story’s pace to that of the continental drift. This is a short book that feels long, and it feels long for all the wrong reasons. As my frustrations grew, I imagined myself driving a car with Simon Winchester and Jonathan Lipnicki (the little boy from Jerry Maguire) as passengers.JONATHAN: Did you know that the human head weighs eight pounds?SIMON: Did you know that Robert Wallace of the U.S. Geological Survey took a violin with him into the field to serenade coyotes?JONATHAN: Did you know that my next door neighbor has three rabbits?SIMON: Did you know that President Warren G. Harding and King Kalakaua of Hawaii both died in San Francisco’s Palace Hotel and that King Kalakaua’s real name was David Laamea Kamanakapuu Mahinulani Naloiaehuokalani Lumialani Kalakaua? ME: Did you know that I’m driving this car off a cliff right now? Because I am.The section of the earthquake is necessarily disappointing. It’s not bad; not at all. It just underwhelms. This is due to the book’s structure, which does not allow for any narrative momentum. By the time San Francisco gets shook, we have learned all about the San Andreas Fault, Simon’s time as a grad student in Iceland, and the history of the State of California. What we haven’t received is any reason why we should care about the people of San Francisco, who serve mainly as shadowy witnesses to an event that itself becomes a backdrop to the author’s dog-and-pony show. Interestingly, the thing you tend to take away from this account of the earthquake – and which is echoed in other sources – is that most of the death and damage came from the resulting fire. This tends to undercut Simon’s compulsive need to talk about and describe seismology. He keeps warning us that a super-earthquake is going to knock California into the sea; yet he never acknowledges that the story he just told is a cautionary tale of building codes and effective fire response. (To be sure, no one ever went broke warning of our impending doom. All Cassandras – like the original Cassandra – will eventually be right; tragedy is always right around the corner). Despite what I’ve written, I am predisposed to enjoy a book like this. I am fond of the small literary sub-genre of travelogue-histories, in which a writer goes on a personal journey to visit all the artifacts (and the curators watching over them) that combined to make a historical event. Sarah Vowell (Assassination Vacation, The Wordy Shipmates) is a delightful tour guide, and her books brim with chirpiness and humor. Tony Horowitz (Confederates in the Attic, A Voyage Long and Strange) brings a more sober, journalistic discipline to his work, finding unforgettable modern characters who are almost mystically connected to the past. Simon Winchester is just as talented as Vowell and Horowitz. But he’s also as likeable as the Harvard-Bar-grad-student in Good Will Hunting who smarmily recites the works of Gordon Wood to embarrass Ben Affleck. I would love to take a road trip with Sarah Vowell or Tony Horowitz. I tried to take a road trip with Simon Winchester. We heard his voice on the radio and quickly gave up. If he’d actually been with us, sitting in the middle of the backseat, drinking a Slurpee and extemporizing about every historical marker we zipped past, I would have tossed him from the car. I’m certain that Simon Winchester would survive being thrown from a moving vehicle. He is, after all, the smartest person alive. Also, I’m certain that – even alone on a deserted highway – he would’ve found a curious bunny to lecture.And that bunny would listen for awhile, hoping that this odd man with the refined accent would get to a point. Finally, the bunny would give up and bound away. And the night would go on, the stars would come out, and Simon Winchester would still be speaking into the void."
2,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,3,"This is a fascinating but also frustrating book about the devastating San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906. Simon Winchester has a passion for geology, which makes him a good person to write about this topic. However, his passion is such that he gets carried away on long tangents, and in truth, this book meandered so much that I nearly abandoned it in frustration. The meandering starts early, with a long prologue about Neil Armstrong and how his trip to the moon affected the way scientists think about the earth. There are also long passages on the history of geology and plate tectonics, along with the author's exploratory trips around the world. There is interesting stuff here, but the information could be have been streamlined.After several chapters, we finally focus more on the California earthquake of 1906, which was my favorite part of the book. Winchester describes the causes and effects of the quake, which was followed by a devastating fire that lasted several days and destroyed much of San Francisco. There is also a discussion about how a major earthquake is expected along the San Andreas fault sometime before 2032. (This section was truly alarming, as was the chapter talking about other fault lines expecting a major rupture in the coming decades, including the New Madrid fault line in my current state of Missouri, which could be devastating for a large chunk of the Midwest.) The last section of the book also meanders a bit, with sidenotes about the history of the insurance industry, and how certain businesses tried to downplay the damage of the Frisco earthquake There are interesting details about how the Chinese immigrants were treated both before and after the earthquake, with some city officials trying to drive them out of town. I also appreciated Winchester's description of how San Francisco was viewed in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and how the earthquake forever changed the city.Overall I liked this book, which includes good photographs and maps, but it seemed like Winchester tried to combine two subjects into one: the history of geology, and the 1906 disaster. The text of this runs more than 400 pages, and I liked most of it, but it needed more editing and revision. Simon Winchester is a prolific author, and I especially enjoyed his earlier work, The Professor and the Madman, which was about the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary. I would recommend A Crack in the Edge of the World to readers who like works about natural disasters or geology, but be prepared for a lot of roundabout discussion.Favorite Quotes""There is a tendency common to most of us to take the more modest of our landscapes for granted. We see a wide and fertile plain, and we drive across it, as fast as its flatness allows, rarely pondering what might have brought it into being. We come across a valley, and, though we might take pleasure in its appearance, we give it all too little thought, other than perhaps to assume there is probably a river somewhere within its folds, And, while we are generally awestruck by the more spectacular mountain ranges, it seems true to say that those hills that are simply hills, or those mountains that are simply mountains, rarely prompt us to ask: Just why are they there? What forces first made them and set them down here, in this particular place?""""This fragile, enchanting-looking place had also appeared, more than anything else, most terribly and fatally vulnerable. ""Despite the variety and gaiety and hyperbole, San Francisco in 1906 was also in fact a big, dirty, brawling, vulgar, smoggy, sooty, and corrupt town of rather less charm than myth and latter-day boosterism would have us believe.""""Trials of any kind — war, pestilence, natural or human violence, with wholesale death or total physical destruction, or both, being the harshest of all — may slow that growth or cause some other setback; but such things are just setbacks, and before long the original reasons for a city's existence reassert themselves. Life returns, buildings and roads are rebuilt, new monuments spring up or old ones are found and dusted off, and before long the city returns to its old self, ready to see what more fate can hurl at it, to challenge and strengthen and temper its will to survive. It may not always entirely regain its predisaster status — San Francisco had to cede much to Los Angeles, for example, But generally, so far as their respective quiddities are concerned, great cities always recover."""
3,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"I have to say that I really do like this man’s books. I think the only reason I would read a book on Krakatoa is because Winchester wrote it. It is also very likely that the only reason I would read a book on an earthquake is because Winchester wrote it.Let me tell you what there is to love about this book.Firstly, Winchester starts off by talking about the Gaia Theory – essentially that everything is related to everything else. He does this because talk of earthquakes has only begun to make sense since we learnt of plate tectonics – that the continents float about the world on huge plates and that these rub up against each other and cause volcanos and earthquakes. And one of the most fascinating things about plate tectonics is that this idea has only been around in science since the 1960s. Think about that for a moment – that we have only had any real idea about the how and the way of volcanos and earthquakes for a little over forty years.Prior to the 1960s we also had a very localised view of how these catastrophic events happened. We really didn’t have any notion that an earthquake in Tokyo might impact on a volcano in Hawaii. We still have only hints about how these two events might be related, but the fact we can even seriously ask the question now ought to send a shiver down your spine. “What a piece of work is Man… in apprehension how like a God…”Gaia theory holds that the whole of the world is linked up by a series of complex and remarkable interconnections. And just to celebrate, Winchester writes his books in a way that brings to the fore layer after layer of beautifully observed relationships between earthquakes and racism and artists leaving for the hills and architecture and religion.When people say things like, ‘everything is related to everything else’ I generally feel a little uncomfortable in that ‘let me get out of this conversation as quickly as I can’ kind of way. There is a scene in Douglas Adams’s Dirk Bogart’s Holistic Detective Agency where Dirk is at a complete loss what to do next and so, figuring that everything is connected to everything else, he follows a car at random, which, naturally enough, brings him to where he needs to go. This is fiction after all.Winchester’s paths are never random. His relationships never fail to delight. His keen eye for both the fascinating and the absurd never fail him. I really am very fond of his books and this one is no exception.There is a part of this book where he is describing the horrific fire that started as the earthquake ended. This was a city ready to burn, and the quake bursting both gas pipes and water pipes beneath the city did much to strike that particular match. There is a photo in this book taken from the top of a hill. In the distance you can see the smoke billowing and being blown into the background of the picture. How Winchester explains what you are looking at and what is about to happen in the world of this photograph is one of those moments in a book that is a pure joy. He starts off by stating what we all think – that fires move in the direction that the winds blow them. Clearly, in this photograph, the wind is blowing towards the back, so that will be the direction the fire will go. He then points out that what is in the distance behind the scene in the photograph is water and already burnt buildings. It is then that he says that city fires not only make their own winds, but that they move in the direction of the fuel that is available – not always in the direction of the wind.One of the more fascinating connections with this earthquake was the start of the Pentecostal movement. The pastor who started the Pentecostal movement said, a mere three days before the quake and fire, that God was preparing a sign – and when God prepares signs, he provides the entire Burma Shave experience. The most Godless city in the United States virtually wiped off the map in one go. God does seem to have learnt his lesson though, as this time there are no wives being turned into pillars of salt and the only good man in the town didn’t end up getting drunk and doing a Fritzl with his two daughters. At least, at the time it seemed they only spoke in tongues – I’ve no idea when Pentecostals started getting down and dirty, but I assume it was a long time prior to when the Swaggarts and Bakers did their stuff.I liked this one very much, but then, I’ve enjoyed every one of his books so far."
4,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/146952-grumpus,2,"This one was tough to rate. I loved  Simon Winchester’s books Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded: August 27, 1883 (P.S.) and The Professor and the Madman: A Tale of Murder, Insanity, and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary (P.S.) for their story-telling style. This one however, is written in a very scientific manner. Indeed, according to Amazon’s text stats, this book was written at 15.2 grade level as measured by Flesh-Kincaid readability—for comparison, Amazon indicates that only 9% of the books are at a higher level. Further, at an average of 30.7 words per sentence, the average sentence in this book has more words than 97% of Amazon’s books. Yeah, yeah, I'm a numbers geek.While I enjoy learning new words and usually have a dictionary nearby as I read, this book slowed me down with the number of times I had to stop and look up words. Here are a few examples from page 117 of the hardcover edition: gasconading lickspittles, gimcrack houses, panjandrum, and Spanish-speaking hobbledehoys. If you’re looking for a scientific explanation about the history of plate tectonics from when the first landmasses broke the surface of the water to the present day, this book is for you. The story of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake just gets lost in the scientific jargon."
5,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,1,"I am 150 pages from the end of this tome, and you know what? I am going to DNF hard. I just dont care about it anymore. I really tried, I really did, but Winchester hasnt even started talking about THE ACTUAL EARTHQUAKE YET. I just have too many other books to read before I due to continue on with this self-absorbed shit.This was my last attempt with Winchester. He simply isn't an engaging author. I find him pompous and his books horribly bloated and lacking in any energy, connection, or emotion. I've read state budgets that were more interesting."
6,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/615172-shawn,2,"Like a train wreck, I can't look away.The 1906 earthquake that most notably affected San Francisco is a fascinating topic, and I like books with a bit of Science in them, but oh my god! could this author be any more of a pain in the ass? I just have to prove it with a couple of examples, but truly sir: Mr. Winchester, I implore you, where are your trustworthy editors? Nowhere, mon frere. Example One in my hypothetical thesis entitled ""why Simon Winchester is a pain in the ass"": in one paragraph (pgs. 91 and 92, oh, it's a long-ass paragraph) Mr. Winchester makes use of the following words: panjandrum, lickspittle, gimcrack, gasconading. Now, I believe I have already more than proven my thesis, but two further examples for the sake of thoroughness: 2. in a book about the San Francisco quake, the quake happens in real time in the narrative on page 205; before that is background discussion of plate tectonics and other gimcrack subjects. Finally, example three has to be seen to be believed. I think I'll just put a sample paragraph here that shows the tedious, longggggg-winded, pretentious writing style (and mind you, the author seems like a good dude and all, no offense intended, he just needs a competent editor). The following paragraph, I'd hone down to five or six words if I were editing: ""I went to New Madrid, Missouri."" He uses 175 words:""To begin to answer that—and geologists have been grappling for years with the vexing problem of those earthquakes that occur where they ought not to—I first had to drive some 600 miles west, to the site of one of the most remarkable earthquakes that America has ever known—by some accounts the biggest ever experienced in the Lower Forty-Eight states. I then had to travel another 400 miles westward, to a village set deep in the Midwestern plains, where a seismograph is mounted inside the general store. My second destination was a somewhat obscure and all but forgotten place, though one of some importance in explaining why America suffers earthquakes so far from the edges of the plate on which it stands. My first intended stop, however, was at a town that suffered an event that took place over a series of weeks during the winter between 1811 and 1812—a hitherto unremarkable Mississippi riverside town that has since entered the lore and the lexicon of seismologists around the world: New Madrid, Missouri."" The End"
7,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1242165-schmacko,2,"Boy howdy, Simon Winchester sure knows his geology! And while he’s telling you about it, he’ll also throw in a long tangent about camping on Mount Diablo. And then he’ll tell you about the Gaia theory. And then he might get distracted by a story from his college days. And then he FINALLY arrives – 205 pages into this book – at the Great San Francisco Earthquake, the theme of this book. But then – and I want to strangle him for this - he’ll forsake all the human lives of the city and their stories for a lengthy explanation on how the broken gas pipes caused a massive fire.I am reminded of a joke about either Tolstoy or Michener – or both – that they take four chapters to tell us about how the earth formed. Winchester takes the whole book. The earthquake happened in a city…a city populated with people…yes, I get that there were buildings and gas pipes and other stuff there that got shook around in physically and scientifically fascinating ways, but all that stuff Winchester concentrates on was all put there by the humans that the author almost completely ignores.The person that Simon Winchester seems most interested in telling us about is Simon Winchester. He likes big words. He went to Oxford. He knows geology. He goes camping.I now know a lot more about geology. I should’ve read the flap more carefully, because I wasn’t looking for a self-possessed windbag’s explanation on plate tectonics. I was looking for the human heart of the disaster, like what Eric Larson did with the Galveston hurricane in Isaac’s Storm. I didn’t get that…"
8,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/545336-mike,5,"I hate these science books by Winchester, he wreaks havoc on my Book Challenge because I cannot zip through it. I have to slow down and really enjoy it. Yeah, giving A Crack in the Edge of the World: America and the Great California Earthquake of 1906 5 Stars for making plate tectonics interesting. Seriously. You don’t get to the San Francisco part of the story until page 230. The SF story is more interesting for the attempt by politicians and others to remake the 1906 event into a slight tremor that caused a big fire—didn’t want to make SF a dangerous place to invest and live. Fire can be prevented—earthquakes can’t. The 1906 earthquake released about 21 feet of movement along the San Andreas fault. According to Winchester in 2005, there was 17 feet of fault slippage stored up as of 2005. Scary sh*t, it only a matter of time until the next big one.What I find so interesting about the “new” geology, i.e., plate tectonics, is that it has been developed in my lifetime, essentially since 1970. An old science, completely remade in a generation. This may seem a little weird but when I read this passage, I had some dramatic music playing in my head, something like Holst’s The Planets…here is Winchester’s description of the very, very early life of our planet:(view spoiler)[
  It was at this point in the planet’s history that the earth’s eggshell-like crust, which was slowly forming on the surface from this cooling scum, began to stop doing what up to that point it was prone to do, and that is to keep on remelting itself. For eons it kept sinking back into the mantle just a few millennia after it had formed, utterly wrecking itself in the process—and then it would popup out of the molten ocean of lava and be reborn in a totally different guise Instead, all of a sudden, large chunks of crust were staying afloat, more or less permanently. In cooling, the crust was forming itself into rocks that would themselves be permanent— if only the external forces permitted them to remain at the surface and did not try to drag them or push them down toward the heat again.	As they slowly cooled, some of these rocks-to-be separated themselves out, according to perfectly understandable laws of physics: The lighter materials of the scum rose to the surface, the heavier ones passed downward in one enormous fractionating column—a little like the Skaergaard, though over infinitely longer periods of time and under very different physical conditions The lighter materials generally formed themselves into those rocks we now call granites—the course-grained rocks that tend to be prettily light in color as well as in constitution The heavier fractions created layers of rocks like basalt and diorite and gabbro, which were darker and tended to sag downward under the force of gravity forming sloughs, whereas the granites tended to form uplands. The darker and heavier slabs lay sluglike and low on the earth’s surface, and in time they began both to accumulate and to accommodate water that fell from the skies; over many millions of years, this resulted in the creation of oceans. Dark rocks underlay the seas; granites made up the new continents. And this law of basic igneous geology has remained a verifiable truth ever since.	The new crust, as it spread and wafted itself around the surface of the sphere, also became cracked, as cooling crusts of clinker and furnace slag are wont to do, and the plates, or rafts, or slabs of floating or sagging clinker that were then formed between the cracks began to swirl about, thanks to the currents of terrifyingly hot material that were(as they still are today) upwelling and sinking back underneath. No doubt the slaggy scum came under the influence of other forces. There was gravity, there were great gyrations in the planet’s magnetism, there was its spinning motion, the occasionally too-close-for comfort proximity of the moon and other planets, and the tilting and wobbling of the earth’s own axis of rotation. The third planet from sun, it must be remembered, is in geological terms a comparatively small ball of material, subject to all manner of kinetic and thermal influences; and the first continent-in-the making was turned this and that for millions of years, as it struggled gamely to get a grip on itself and remain more or less in place on the ever-changing molten mantle that underlay it.
(hide spoiler)]The book carries on in similar fashion through the various discoveries on our energetic little ball of earth. Winchester takes a circuitous route to 1906 San Fran but I just loved the journey. Not for everyone but worked for me. Good account of the earthquake and the aftermath. Oh, and he leaves us with a warning about the super-volcanic hot spot beneath Yellowstone, actually the cycle for this one to blow is due anytime. Winchester also casually points out that the earth’s faults are connected and often one earthquake sets off others all around the world.Just great fun reading!"
9,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1662632-richard,4,"This is a mostly delightful tour of geology, earthquakes and plate tectonics, with an emphasis on California's infamous San Andreas Fault and the 1906 earthquake that devastated San Francisco. I can highly recommend it.Much to the delight of info gluttons, Winchester as always ranges widely from the nominal focus of the book. Any reader looking for an in-depth history of the whys and wherefores of the earthquake and fire will be more than satisfied, as well anyone wondering about the broader surrounding topics.Of course, if you want your author to go straight to the heart of the matter, this isn't your book and, furthermore, you really should forego any of Winchester's books.By the way, this book was more personal to me than to most of you out there: I've lived in San Francisco for almost my entire adult life, and I'm a third-generation Californian (and almost a third-generation San Franciscan). I've backpacked for many years in the Sierras, thrown up millions of years ago by the mechanisms he describes in the book, and I felt connected to every scene he describes in the city.Still, my reaction to this book isn't unalloyed praise. I think there were several false notes. The more obvious one was the connection to Pentecostalism. I agree it was an important phenomena of the time — actually, I wouldn't be here if my mother's parents hadn't found each other while attending a Pentecostal church during the depression. But the movement almost certainly would have taken off with or without San Francisco's earthquake; that kind of exuberant religiosity seems to be a fundamental part of U.S. culture. Despite the specific anecdotes that tie the two stories together, I felt it was really a post hoc, ergo propter hoc kind of connection, and detrimental to the book's focus.The other significant annoyance was that several times the author referred to San Francisco and other places in close proximity to the fault as ""very dangerous"". Now, maybe when the Big One hits I'll change my tune, but substantially fewer than 1000 Californians have died in earthquakes in the past century. As I'm writing this at the end of April 2013, and the New York Times just reminded me that three years after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake (which killed 63 in the region), Los Angeles lived through the Rodney King riots, which killed 54. And, of course, at least 15 (and possibly many more) have just died in the explosion of a fertilizer company in Texas. Frankly, life is dangerous; everyone dies in the end. Living in an earthquake zone does slightly raise the likelihood of dying prematurely (or being seriously injured), but there are many, many other factors that affect mortality rates even more. Coastal California — right along the San Andeas Fault — has a famously benign climate, for example. I suspect the overall health of the locals is higher because of it, and probably lengthens their life expectancy more than the earthquake risk shortens it. Winchester even makes fun of the residents of Portola Valley, a town that lies directly upon the fault line — amused at how they argue endlessly about whether and where to move this building or that, only to go back to sipping their sauvignon blanc. He agrees that their ""way of life [is] quite unrivaled in its quality anywhere in the world"", yet still thinks that there can be ""no greater monument to hubris"" that the choose to live there.I suppose he really thinks they'd be better off somewhere else, but I think there's a lot of hubris in his assertion that he is right and several million residents of the San Francisco Bay Area are being irrational. Perhaps he should have asked the scientists at the Menlo Park's USGS — the same folks he thanks for helping in his studies. After all, their office is on alluvial soil about eight miles from Portola Valley, and they undoubtedly live in the area. It apparently did not occur to Winchester to ask them what they feel about that risk.I'll take the certitude of a quake and its consequent increase in my mortality over living elsewhere, thank you.Addendum: Stephen Colbert's bit on the earthquake is amusing: The San Francisco Earthquake: Was It Really That Bad?.­"
10,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/651974-james-peavler,3,"This book only gets a three from me because I felt it was falsely advertised. As a Bay Area native, earthquakes have always held a strong fascination for me. I experienced a fairly large one in 1989, and my memories are still as strong today as they were then. So when I pick up a book that gives me an impression that its about the year 1906, and the seismic activity that occurred all around the world that year, ending with the ultimate seismic event near the shores of San Francisco, it was disconcerting to read about the geologic history of the earth.As fascinating as that was, when over half the book is about the formation of the earth and the world as we now know it, and the Great Earthquake of 1906 seems to be almost an afterthought for the final 100 or so pages . . . well, needless to say, I was a bit disappointed. It's a time in California history that I find enthralling, and was nestled in my bed ready to read about how the ground rolled and the buildings fell and fires consumed, yet I had to dredge through why Iceland is where it is and why dirt in Japan is related to dirt in Africa. Believe me, it was interesting, but when you pick up a book expecting one thing and read another, it's a disappointing experience. By the time I actually reached the earthquake in San Francisco, I could have cared less at that point. I just wanted to be done with the book."
11,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/261544-jz-temple,5,"Now I'm surprised to see so many people who didn't like this book, but I'm guessing it's more a matter of style. Winchester certainly does take his time getting to the San Francisco part of this book but it is ""America and the Great California Earthquake..."", and like his previous book on Krakatoa he does like taking the discussion far afield. However, it's the kind of book I like, much more about ""why"" and ""how"" rather than ""who"" and ""when"". I would recommend it, especially if you liked ""Krakatoa""."
12,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16012-andrew,2,"It takes Winchester nearly 100 pages to get into the meat of the story -- the 1906 Earthquake that destroyed San Francisco. Until then, we have to wade through tales of his Oxford days and camping on Mt. Diablo. A tough read that brings little joy -- although he does capture the sense of magic we all feel when discovering, and re-discovering, San Francisco. Some exerpts:""There is a tendency common to most of us to take the more modest of our landscapes for granted. We see a wide and fertile plain and we drive across it, as fast as its flatness allows, rarely pondering what might have brought it into being. We come across a valley, and, though we might take pleasure in it appearance, we give it all too little thought...What forces first made them...?""""What I remember most about the city, which was spread out beyond the low hills and clustered like a jewel box of gleaming spires and glittering windows on its tiny thumbnail of a penninsula, was just how astonishingly delicate it all looked. It was quite unlike New York or Chicago or Boston. Those places were gray, massive, battelship-like cities, cities that were indelibly written into, and indestructibly welded onto, their landscapes... But not, it seemed to me, this preternaturally beautiful city of San Francisco... How tightly San Francisco appeared to cling on it its hillsides: One could imagine knuckles whitened, sinews straining, teeth gritted."""
13,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7788536-curtis-edmonds,2,"Let us suppose that you are to take a flight from New York to California. You book the flight, make time to head out to the West Coast, and make your way to JFK. Only when you arrive, you find that your flight had been cancelled. The only flight available is out of Newark Airport, and it routes through some airline hub out in the middle of the country – Houston or Dallas or Chicago or Cincinnati, take your pick. So you get on a shuttle bus and head for Newark, and board your new flight, and settle in for a long siege. You’ve seen the in-flight movie. You’ve finished your novel well before you reach your intermediate destination. And then there’s a long layover, and you get back on another plane, with the same in-flight magazine and discarded USA TODAY sections and nothing else to read. And somewhere, over Kansas, you speculate that you are still a long, long way from San Francisco. Readers of A Crack in the Edge of the World: America and the Great California Earthquake of 1906, can relate, and more than you know. Author Simon Winchester is (metaphorically speaking) headed for San Francisco, but it takes a damnably long time to get there, and there are more detours along that route than even the most unfortunate airline reader will ever encounter, much less countenance. To give you an idea – just an idea – of where A Crack in the Edge of the World is going, the book starts in Wapakoneta. Ohio, known primarily as the home of Neil Armstrong, who has nothing to do at all with the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 that anyone, even the multitalented Winchester, can reveal. This is in the prologue, which introduces the Gaia Hypothesis and the New Geology and the rest of the science stuff. After that, Winchester gets near San Francisco – interjecting himself into the narrative by means of a story about his a camping trip to a nearby mountain – but it doesn’t take him long to get back to plate tectonics all over again. About every other chapter in Winchester’s book is noted as a “Chronicle”, and these chapters hew to what a reasonable expectation of what a primarily historical book about the San Francisco earthquake would be about. These are the short chapters. The long chapters are long indeed. One of them, “From Plate to Shining Plate”, is a first-person disquisition of a lengthy, and largely pointless, tour of the North American Plate. Highlights of this include a trip to Iceland (where the North American Plate begins), New Madrid, Missouri (where a devastating earthquake took place in 1811), and the Wichita Mountains of Oklahoma (where another fault is to be found). None of this, except by comparison, has anything to do with San Francisco, or 1906, or anything much of anything else. And the travelogues (there’s another one in the vicinity of the San Andreas Fault, and yet another up to Alaska at the book’s close) are at least marginally interesting. The scientific disquisition of the geology that underlines San Francisco is explained with a degree of depth that is only surpassed by its complete lack of clarity. (Anyone who has read, and enjoyed, John McPhee’s Annals of the Former World will recognize the shortcomings in Winchester’s book.) Winchester covers ophiolites, and strike-slip faulting, and epicenters, all before telling us anything in-depth about San Francisco and 1906 and the human scope of the disaster. Eventually, Winchester does get his reader to San Francisco. The earthquake, when it happens – that’s on page 243 of my version – is arresting, and powerful, and has a human impact. Winchester introduces us to the famous figures in San Francisco – Enrico Caruso, and Jack London, and the young Ansel Adams – and the ordinary people displaced by the tragedy. He focuses, admirably, on the fate of San Francisco’s Chinatown, and the fight made by nativist Californians to relocate its residents elsewhere. Winchester handles the historical sections with a grace and aplomb that’s totally missing from the first half of the narrative – in part by the simple action of taking himself out of the story, but mostly to his skill as a storyteller. A Crack in the Edge of the World is a perfectly reasonable choice for any seasoned airline traveler to bring along – not least because the reader has the power to skip over the more impenetrable sections. Unfortunately, there’s still no easy and simple way to skip over long layovers at O’Hare. "
14,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13954899-kathleen,3,"This book is a bit slow and meandering, with more geological factoids than I needed to know, but still I enjoyed it.I lived in sparkling San Francisco for a summer, on beautiful Beach Street, which took a hit during the Loma Prieta quake of 1989. But that recent quake was nothing compared to the 1906 disaster Winchester portrays here. He bases his account on first-hand journal entries, letters, diaries, newspaper articles by James Hopper, and the bleak photographs that made Genthe famous. Winchester portrays the quake from a worldwide Pangea perspective, comparing fault lines and famous quakes, including Yellowstone National Park. He also portrays the after effects, including 26 aftershocks, water pipes bursting, cattle stampeding, and fire swallowing city blocks whole, while the mayor scrambled for water in a city surrounded by sea.I also recommend the docudrama movie THE GREAT SAN FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE, directed and written by Philip Smith. Unlike Winchester, Smith portrayed Mayor Eugene Schmitz as a villain. We see him as an avaricious, corrupt politician — and a fool who refused to allocate resources to prevent fire, ignoring his fire chief's warnings, despite the fact that the city had burned six times since the 1849 Gold Rush. Smith condemns the mayor for handing the city over to martial law, allowing soldiers to execute about 500 citizens, including some who were innocent of wrongdoing. Others saw Schmitz as a strong leader taking drastic measures when needed.I also enjoyed Simon Winchester's book depicting one insane soul who helped compile quotations for THE OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY: THE PROFESSOR AND THE MADMAN."
15,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3777762-j-s,4,"Simon Winchester can be a bit too much sometimes. This was my second attempt to read this book, the first one bogging down in so much detail and personal travelogue and not really reaching the actual earthquake until 200 pages in (aside from a teaser at the beginning, of course). Nevertheless, this time I persevered and am glad that I did.The 1906 San Francisco earthquake was devastating to the city. Not only did the shaking (7.9 or 8.3 depending on the estimates) of the earth destroy many poorly built buildings, but the fires that followed burned many more in a largely wooden city. But this is much more than just the event here. Winchester loves geology and dives in deep here, starting with a tour of the entire North American tectonic plate - which of course actually starts in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. So we get a tour of Iceland, and some history on large earthquakes that have occurred in the Eastern US. The San Andreas Fault gets a lot of attention as well as how we measure quakes. And of course there's abundant history on San Francisco. And if you don't mind a somewhat meandering and wide-ranging history full of science and travel, it's actually a rather entertaining book. "
16,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1400289-chana,5,"Great book!I bought it for my 9th grader to read as part of her homeschooling program, but I read it before her. At first I thought I would never get through it. His writing is stilted and boring at the beginning, even as he describes the miracles of our astounding planet. And because I am not a student of geology, I was falling asleep over the technical talk.Soon he picks up speed and his language starts to flow, I start using my dictionary to gain an understanding of his geology terms, and we reach a meeting of the minds. I understand what he is saying and he is enjoying what he is teaching.I grew up in Southern California and went through the San Fernando earthquake in 1971, and the Northridge earthquake in 1994. Now I live in Seattle and was here for the Nisqually earthquake in 2001. it amazes me to think that my youngest kiddo, at 15, has never been in an earthquake! She was born later in 2001 than the Nisqually earthquake. I keep thinking we must be in for another pretty soon. That is a little frightening!So I make it through tectonic plate history, placement and movement of; and the early history of quakes along the San Andreas and related faults in Northern California. Good, good. Now onto the history of San Francisco, which I found fascinating, and then the quake itself and the aftermath. Wow! Mind-boggling! I loved this section, it was so very, very interesting. After this, he brings us into the present with a road trip that even includes a trip to Alaska to see the trans-Alaska oil pipeline which crosses the Denali Fault!! The pipeline is very cleverly constructed with expansion curves and sliders and has so far survived an earth movement of eighteen feet to the right without a drop of oil spilled. Well hey for human ingenuity in this case. Recommended read!"
17,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1344256-kevin,3,"Wow, Mr. Winchester had a lot of time on his hands. I was expecting a different book, more concise regarding the earthquake in San Fran in the early 20th century. I wasn't expecting to learn about the Louisana purchase, and the myriad other little details that he discusses. It seemed as if in every CD the author goes off on a tangent. My wife listened in on a couple of CD's and without me prompting her, made the comment ""this guy is all over the place."" The last third really gets down to business. Otherwise, very informative. Plan to be bored several times."

20,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6158413-maria,5,"Though this book wasn't quite what I thought it would be, it was an excellent entree into the writing of Simon Winchester. I expected a social history of the events in San Francisco, instead this is a geological history of plate tectonics and earthquakes and its effects, specifically on April 18, 1906. I enjoyed the travelogue experience of accompanying him on his journey around the world and the U.S., exploring its beauty and its precariousness. Selected for my October book discussion group, I expect lively discourse."
21,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51813793-tara,1,"Okay. Read the blurb for this book and tell me--what do you think this book is about? The 1906 earthquake maybe?Well, we'll see. Let's check out the first sentence:Some while ago, when I was half-idly browsing my way around the Internet, I stumbled across the home page of an obscure small town in western Ohio with the arresting name of Wapakoneta. He goes on to paint the town as a quaint, worried old man or woman taking pride in their mechanical work and sucking their teeth with worry over ""such newfangled developments as"" outsourcing to Mexico and Asia. The town is just an old fuddy-duddy though. It has a cool side too. Once upon a time, Neil Armstrong lived there. Cue: Oooh, Aaah.Do you see any hint of an earthquake yet? Or even of just San Francisco or 1906? No? Well, here is the connection:Wapakoneta ---> Neil Armstrong ---> Space ---> Being able to see Earth (""And it was a view that in time compelled humankind to take stock."") ---> navel-gazing ---> geology? (""A Born-Again Science"" Seriously).Now, to be fair, this is only the prologue. The actual book must be more focused and better-written, yes?Heh.Chapter one (after 22 full pages of prologue) does indeed begin well. It starts off with a little known fact as icebreaker (""...1906 was a year of the Fire Horse..."") and then starts the subject matter, much, to be honest, like any high school paper-- broadly. You know the sort-- the paper that begins talking about the importance of Shakespeare's works, rather than simply getting down to business and writing the requested analysis of the word ""fear"" as used in Midsummer's Night Dream? In this case, Winchester talks about earthquakes in 1906 in general. Now, this is interesting information. It is a fine way to start the book.The chapter goes from page 23 to page 28. Five whole pages.Here is the beginning of chapter two: ""I first saw San Francisco in the early seventies, at the end of a long westward drive that had taken me clear across the North American continent.""From page 29 to page 32 is all about him seeing SF. Then we get the history of the mountain he camped upon when he saw SF. This is followed by a brief introduction to plate tectonics (again) and then the narrative returns to him.What I remember most about the city, which was spread out beyond the low hills and clustered like a jewel box of gleaming spires and glittering windows on its tiny thumbnail peninsula, was just how astonishingly delicate it all looked. [...] I squinted through a big brass telescope that been obligingly placed upon the parapet. My feeling was that this was a confection of untoward and only half-urban-looking delicacy was confirmed by the magnifying lenses. How tightly San Francisco appeared to cling on to its hillsides: One could imagine knuckles whitened, sinews straining, teeth gritted.He then walks us back to his campsite, down to his car, and lets us know that San Francisco is one of the most temporary cities ever built.We are now 48 pages in and still no sign of the earthquake. (Well, that is a lie, there were a couple pages in the prologue concerning the timing of the quake.)The next chapter is relevant again. Context history. Like the last relevant chapter, however, it is very short. 8 pages (front and back).Chapter four starts our plate tectonics lesson. This doesn't bother me. The fact that several pages of that chapter are spent on the author recounting the ever thrilling tale of his youth when he once stood on two plates at the same time does.(Back in 2009; I am no longer reading this book) I am currently mid-chapter four and am trying to decide whether or not I honestly want to finish this book. The author's writing style and tone are driving me mad. He does little things, like anthropomorphize the Earth or attempt to create false anxiety with 'cliffhangers' (Oh no! He has a word stuck in his head that alters his perception of SF forever! Whatever could it be and why won't he tell us? etc.), that I cannot stand.Also, this book is reading more like what I'd imagine Gilderoy Lockheart would create on the subject, than what I'd hoped for: an interesting account of the earthquake. I am learning about Winchester's youth and the tangents he finds interesting, but not so much about subject in the title and mentioned on the back cover. Every time I start to get interested in what is happening, he ruins it all by pulling the camera focus back to him. I don't mind the tangents and such so much. I like context information. I just don't care about Mr. Winchester. Not even a little bit and the more he tells me about himself, the less interested I am.I honestly cannot remember if I ever bothered to finish the book."
22,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/841692-maryanne,4,"This book is about more than the San Francisco Earthquake.

But Winchesters is a great teacher as well as story-teller. He repeats words, like 'right lateral strike slip fault' so that I can grasp it, even though I'm listening to the audio book. I would seek out more of Winchester's works. Just don't expect a quick discussion. "
23,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7542274-emorgan05,1,"Calling it quits. As an audio book, this was too rambling and wandering to keep track of. Winchester flits from topic to topic and most of it is not about the earthquake."
24,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1125315-colleen,1,"This book made me unexpectedly angry. For starters, the cover is a fucking lie--as is the flyleaf--all 6 paragraphs about the SF Earthquake with but one clue I see now for what was in store for me: ""But Winchester's achievement is even greater: he positions the quake's significance along the earth's geological timeline and shows the effect it had on the rest of twentieth-century California and American history.""--because yeah, he sure as hell tries to do that. For starters this book is NOT about the SF Earthquake, and if you pick it up thinking you are going to read a history delving into that day and the repercussions etc., you will be disappointed. If you wanted to read the pretentious musings of a self-indulgent Brit as he compulsively visits everything remotely connected to earthquakes in the Western hemisphere starting back to when the earth was just a little baby ball of molten lava, then you are in for a treat. You know, I've read a lot of non-fiction history books where the author plays a main role--everything by Sarah Vowell, and Betty Furness's Mabel is one of my all-time favorite books--and perhaps those two ladies had better editors or friends to tell them ""NO! YOU'VE EXPOUNDED ON PANGAEA LONG ENOUGH"" -- so it's not like I hate those kinds of books and have tons on my shelves, but dear god I hated this one. I wanted the author to fall into some crevice a 100 pages in. He never even gets to the topic of SF earthquake until like 250 pages in a 385 page book. I don't feel like I left this book knowing anything more really than when I started--other than the exact second it occurred, because there are multiple chapters about that, and just a few paragraphs it seems spared for the death count, which just seems to be ""dunno, no way to tell, 300 - 3,000."" If he wanted to write a book about tectonic plates and geology, he should write a book on that. But after hearing so much self-praise and hints to his delightful life of adventure and knowledge, it's also coupled with him conducting his ""research"" right after 9/11. I say research because it seems like it's mostly snotty observations on the towns he visits in the US--Americans are generally fat, slothish, freedom fry eating head-in-sand morons. Pithy passages like: ""There is worse, however: Someone suggested taking the road farther north still to Dawson City and being initiated into a drinking club that has its signature libation a whiskey in which is marinated some unfortunate frostbitten toe. It seemed almost a repellant an attraction as Wal-Mart.""I'm as rabid as a liberal as you can find, and I wanted to give him the finger after a few chapters of smirking. Tennessee described as ""tedious"" and ""too wide""? And I didn't bother to go through and mark previous passages to compare, but it seems like his descriptions of SF varied widely. Is it a beautiful city after all, unlike any other, or sorta ruined with meh houses with no plan and is only beautiful because a luck of nature? It seems he espouses to both views. Though...I do take it back, I did like finding out that the namesake of the Douglas fir, David Douglas, tripped and fell into a hole that had an angry bull (who had also previously fallen in hole) at the bottom, who gored him to death, but it wasn't worth reading all those pages to learn that fun fact."
25,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9889724-m,2,"I have to first start out by saying I'm not a science-y person by any means, so a lot of his book went over my head, even though it's written for a layman. On the positive side, it is chock full of information about earthquakes: what causes them, why and when they happen, what each of the waves feels like, and some of the worst historical earthquakes and the damage they wreaked on human beings, structures and geography. It's also full of very interesting details about the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 and the aftermath. In short, this book has A LOT of information! Mr. Winchester certainly knows what he's talking about. He makes a very interesting, and I'm sure entirely correct, assertion that the Earth is a finely balanced living organism, and a disturbance on one side of the world can cause a disturbance on the other side. Just 12 days before the great quake in San Francisco, Vesuvius erupted in Italy. 1906 was also the worst year seismically speaking, of the 20th century. 2004 is (so far) the worst year of the 21st century. I had two difficulties with this book which prevents me from giving a higher rating- first of all, much of it is very dry and dare I say, boring- granted, I'm no science aficiando so a lot of it is due to being new information for me. But it was also distracting that almost every page had a little footnote, which may or may not pertain much to the paragraph it's annotating. I found them to be very distracting, and I started to get the sense that the author simply knows too much, but doesn't know how to cut it down to a manageable level. Sometimes I found the footnotes to be interesting and other times they were simply confusing why they were included in the first place. I think this is more a criticism of the editing than the writing. My other reason for the lower star is I didn't realize how scared I would feel after reading this book! Living in the Bay area is certainly one reason why, and the more I see the modern world exploiting the natural resources and further unbalancing the delicate ecosystem of Planet Earth, the more seismic misadventures we are going to experience. "
26,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8706020-beth-cato,3,"I read this book for research purposes. While I did fill it with sticky notes and found the read overall quite rewarding, I was also left with a strong sense that it could have been a much better book.Winchester is a very knowledgeable fellow. The book is framed around his own travels to places like Iceland and then across North America, from Charleston, to New Madrid, and on westward to San Francisco. His goal is to explore tectonic theory and how the San Andreas Fault fits into the larger scheme of the living world. The data is quite interesting, but at the same time he rambles. It's like he came across too much good information and tried to squeeze it into one book. This creates a problem when a book about the 1906 earthquake doesn't get to the actual earthquake until page 241.This also creates the odd dilemma in that it felt like little of the book was on the actual quake. Information on the aftermath is interesting, such as the struggle to get insurance companies to pay up (especially German-based ones), and the plight of the Chinese and the ensuing wave of ""Paper People"" who tried to take advantage of or were genuinely lost because of the loss of immigration paperwork. He then, however, devotes too much space to how the ""wrath of God"" aspect of the earthquake inspired the Pentecostal church movement. Even his trip to Alaska to discuss the fascinating matter of how the pipeline has been created to withstand earthquakes is colored by derogatory comments on towns along the way, including a slam against Wal-mart that felt out of place in its arrogance.In all, its an interesting book that's diluted by too many tangents. Still worth reading, though, even if it caused me to roll my eyes or skim at times."
27,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/214234-dan,3,"Winchester's exhaustive look at the geology behind the 1906 San Francisco earthquake was quite edifying, but it was a bit short on the drama of the event itself and the aftermath. I've been looking for a good book on the disaster for a little while now, and when I came across A Crack in the Edge of the World I was thrilled. I'd read Winchester's Atlantic a couple of years ago and enjoyed it. However, the jacket copy is a bit misleading here. True, the book is about the 1906 earthquake, but I was expecting a good three hundred pages on the event and the aftermath, peopled with unforgettable characters. I was expecting something akin to Devil in the White City; instead, Winchester spent about 200 pages setting up the geology of the event. Yes, it was very informative, and I did enjoy it, but I would've enjoyed it had I been expecting it. The event itself takes up about 100 pages, most at the end, but with a teaser at the beginning as well. I learned some fun facts, and in the end I now feel like I have a good foundation on what happened on that fateful April day just over a century ago. I could've done with less geology and less of Winchester's overwrought prose. At least I anticipated the latter having read Atlantic. Recommended for history fans, and fans of natural disaster books.If you liked this, make sure to follow me on Goodreads for more reviews!"
28,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/899549-melissa,2,"I had really high hopes for this book. . .I loved his earlier book, The Professor and the MadmanGenerally speaking, I enjoy disaster history (Isaac's Storm, The Children's Blizzard, etc).But the science bits, explaining plate tetonics and exactly what kind of earthquake hit San Francisco in 1906 too far too long. I ended up skimming quite a bit of it, something I rarely do. His trip across the US, checking out fault lines, also got skimmed. The stuff about the actual disaster was good--there just wasn't enough of it. Not near enough about the aftermath and the human stories and the rebuilding. And then more pondering on other earthquakes and future earthquakes and. . .When I read in his bio that the author was trained as a geologist, it all made a lot more sense. It just wasn't what I was expecting, and I still don't feel like I have a good grip of the San Francisco disaster--unlike the masterful Isaac's Storm--where there's plenty of science, but also plenty of history. "
29,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1008236-bookmarks-magazine,0,"Winchester's latest work is a lesson in unfulfilled expectations. Though he presents the book as a history of the San Francisco quake, over the first 200 pages Winchester offers an abbreviated version of John McPhee's Annals of the Former World. Where McPhee made clear his intentions to write a comprehensive geological history of the North American continent, critics feel duped by Winchester, or by the publisher's marketing department. Many reviewers are dismayed to see him reusing information from Krakatoa (**** July/Aug 2003). Even more wish he'd return to the human elements that made The Professor and the Madman such a critical and commercial success. Here, exhaustive research begets a fault-filled book, with little human or thematic tension to bind it together.This is an excerpt from a review published in Bookmarks magazine."
30,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13181751-michael,1,"Ok.... this book is NOT about the San Francisco earthquake. Well... at least the first half isn't. That's as far as I made it. I put this book down 4 times to read others, so I gave it a go. The first half of this book is plate tectonics lesson along with a journal of the authors travels to plate tectonics related areas in western North America. NOT about the earthquake! This man is obviously very intelligent and should be a science professor if he isn't already. I bought this book to learn about the San Francisco earthquake.. i read 250 (of the 500 pages) and didn't learn a single thing about the quake. I had enough. It's a drawn out science lesson that I would imagine eventually discusses the event in the title. I was thoroughly disappointed and plan to try another book on the subject... that actually talks about THE EARTHQUAKE!"
31,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25032671-kris,3,"Sprawling. Long-winded. Full of rabbit trails, non-sequiturs, detours, ramblings, and tangents.Winchester talks about geology, the California gold rush, history in Iceland, insurance companies, immigration, even other earthquakes. Only more than half way through the book does he finally get around to talking about the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.His writing isn't engaging enough for me to happily wait for him to get around to the main point. As a result, I started tuning out sometimes, not caring about what I missed, and waiting for it to be over. His sentences are also far too long, so it made this audio book feel even longer than it was.I've no idea why Winchester would think this to be good nonfiction writing. He talks just to hear himself talk."
32,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/625444-diane,2,"Simon Winchester is such a pain. He selects wonderful topics to write about and as long as he keeps himself out of the book, it can be wonderful. This one is pretty bad. I almost quit listening (he reads the book which isn't good)but am glad I endured the first three chapters or so because the information on the earthquake itself and its aftermath is pretty interesting. There were at least three things I would like to learn more about: the cattle stampede during the earthquake, Angel Island, and Arnold Genthe's the photographs taken during/after the earthquake and of Chinatown before the earthquake. The book ends as it begins with long, self-absorbed ramblings by Winchester."
33,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5422600-kristi-thielen,5,"I've read Winchester's books on Krakatoa and geologist William Smith; both were excellent and this doesn't disappoint either. I've also read Philiip L. Fradkin's ""The Great Earthquake and Firestorms of 1906,"" which is much more about the people and politics of the event, rather than the geology, which is the focus of Winchester's book. Both books are well worth the read, if you are interested in this subject. Winchester's in-depth discussion of plate tectonics is engrossing - and it's delightful to learn about the brave and thoughtful post office official who decreed that victims would be able to send mail to worried loved ones elsewhere, even if they couldn't afford the stamp. "
34,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35136-sarah,4,"I LOVE Simon Winchester. The guy's voice is like audiobook crack: he's British and he's perfect. If you want to read his other works, definitely listen to them. Start with Krakatoa; it blew my mind.This book is almost as good as Krakatoa. I learned a lot and couldn't believe how my public school education failed to educate me on history. I did get a little bored on the 9th CD, but the 10th picked up when he recounted his trip to Alaska and then back to Yellowstone. Certainly a must-read... or better yet a ""must-listen-to."" "
35,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4380068-bill,3,"Like most of Simon Winchester's novels, I enjoyed this one. The focus is the San Francisco Earthquake and Fire of 1906. The earthquake, while the focus, is more an opportunity for Winchester to discuss fault lines, new geology, some history, sociology, etc. I like his meandering pace and always find the information he provides on his subject, accessible and interesting. Worth reading."
36,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3314747-denise,5,"Love it. Looked at the two and one star reviews to see if Mr. Winchester was being accused of presenting misinformation. Relieved to find that is not the case. As for the reasons that are given, bah humbug! Yes he has a hefty vocabulary and he does meander; my advice, get a friggin dictionary and enjoy the ride."
37,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35482263-gumble-s-yard,3,"A very similar book to Winchester's - ""Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded: August 27, 1883"". Like that book the actual disaster is really only covered well over half way through the book, with Winchester aiming to give background and context to the story. In the first book this included the evolution of the Dutch East India Company and its spice trade, Darwinism, and the development of underwater telegraph cables). In the second it includes the Gold Rush, and the history of San Francisco. Both books cover geological issues - particularly continental drift and plate tectonics, as well as the history of related geological events to the main one described. The latter book seems to have a sub-plot of Winchester's own travels around the edge of the North American plate - from Iceland at its eastern edge to the San Andreas Fault at its eastern edge and to Anchorage in the North, via areas of geological interest such as New Madrid (possible site of a future mid-plate rupture developing) - however in practice this makes the book unstructured and hard to follow. Both books have interesting detail but are too long to be fully engrossing - particularly the latter book. An interesting subtext is that he makes claims that the rise of militant Islam (an Indonesian uprising against the Dutch) was prompted by Krakatoa and that Pentecostalism was given the crucial boost to its credibility by San Francisco earthquake which was seen as God's judgement on evil."
38,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1136355-mary,3,"Everything you ever wanted to know or didn’t want to know about the geology of the North American plate meeting the Pacific plate... the San Andreas etc... this book is basically a geology book with not really that much about San Fran... I have to admit that the book is written well... not at all dry or much of a slog( a slog only because the topic is not for me) anyway.. I learned some very interesting tidbits...how will I ever hear the term Richter Scale without remembering dear eccentric nudist , vegetarian and sex maniac Charles Richter...or that Enrico Caruso drew a picture of himself in his pj’s and fur coat watching San Fran burn?? Or that Ansel Adams was 4 years old and while running to get his breakfast tripped when the second tremor hit and broke his nose and it was never fixed giving him the nose he was so famous for?? Anyway, I think I would not have picked this book up if I had thought it was really everything you want to know geologically speaking.. I feel rather annoyed by the title.... and the description.. but it was my fault and basically the book was interesting and informative... just not a “you must read this”... in fact if you live in California I think you should not read it.... unless you were thinking of moving...

39,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2985672-david-hill,4,"Winchester's telling of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake begins in Wapakoneta, Ohio and ends in Yellowstone National Park. He covers a fair amount of territory in between, and spans a time scale of hundreds of millions of years.If you're looking for four hundred pages of story about the earthquake and fire that took place in and around San Francisco in 1906, this isn't the book for you. This is a Simon Winchester book. He does tell the story of what happened the day the earth shook, and the days immediately after. But he takes his time getting there, and he wanders around quite a bit in the process. You not only get what happened, but why. I might say Simon Winchester is in the Dirk Gently school: ""Everything is connected."" But that overstates it. It may seem like Winchester is giving us everything, including the kitchen sink, but he does tie it all together. He tells the story, the whole story, and nothing but the story. And to tell the story of the earthquake, to understand the earthquake, you must cover a fair bit of geology.I enjoyed the book, but having read some of his other works I expected that he wouldn't restrict himself to the human story, the stories of the people affected, how they coped, and the tragedies they faced. I am interested in reading a book that is more focused on the people, and it looks like Winchester's bibliography suggests at least half a dozen candidates."
40,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54244616-krlb,3,"I have a friend who, when asked a question, will give a prolonged answer, making sure to include every possible tangential piece of quasi-related information, often losing track of the original question altogether. I was reminded of him when I read this book. Not that it's badly written, or uninteresting - to the contrary, the author has a very thorough understanding of the subject matter and all related topics. It's just that in order to get to San Francisco of 1906 the reader must plow through a very detailed explanation of the major faults throughout the world, understand the different types of tectonic plates and how they move, how seismographs operate, etc., maybe a bit more than is necessary. Some readers may find this background information useful and gripping; I kept checking to see how many pages were left to be read. This is a good book to have read if your dinner conversation revolves around earthquakes; otherwise, Wikipedia might be sufficient."

Winchester is an Oxford-trained geologist, so I learned a ton about plate tectonics and earthquakes as well as California and San Francisco history. My only issue with the book is that Winchester's vocabulary is bigger than mine, so I had to look up quite a few words, such as ""gallimaufry,"" as well as several French phrases that he assumes his reader will know. But it was good for me. I'm looking for a place to use that word. It means ""hodgepodge."" "

44,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309191-thewanderingjew,5,"Simon Winchester has elevated the language of science to the language of poetry. His eloquence will hold the attention of and also captivate the reader with his brilliant explanation of the formation of the earth, the ocean floor, the plates that shift and slide to wreak havoc or as he might say cause mischief in so many places. He describes such things as the molten lava “breathing” beneath our surface in such a way that you see the river of fire. He describes the movement of the faults so that you see them slipping and sliding under each other, layered irregularly atop each other, forming ridges like those in a carpet, as commonplace as a crease in a piece of fabric. He uses metaphors and similes to enlighten the reader and make the subject fluid rather than as arid as science can sometimes be for the layman. When Winchester likens the movements of the plates to a freight train stuck on the tracks with only the center moving outward, the reader can surely see the force of that pressure as it moves the front of the cars forward, finally, in a burst, resulting in the return of that bulge to the center, although in the front there may be concomitant damage; and when he describes the ripple that erupts in a carpet, sometimes, after walking on it repeatedly, the reader will see that “pleat”, as he calls it, forming a mountain one day as it continues to rise. When he describes the splitting water mains and the rupturing gas lines, the reader can feel the disaster in San Francisco approaching, along with the heat, strong tremors and fear, as well as the astonishment and wonderment also felt by some victims. Winchester brought the dry science behind an earthquake and other natural disasters to life. I could visualize the earth forming, the continents moving and the oceans spreading as the earth moved beneath me. With a vocabulary that has become obsolete in the pens of most writers, as they concentrate on sound bites and acronyms, he has mastered the art of prose, making often unfathomable subject matter less bone-dry with his use of language.Winchester speaks of Freud, Einstein, and Caruso in a casual manner as he creates the foundation for his story with vignettes that sometimes make the reader smile. He begins with the moon landing of Neil Armstong and tells the story of our magnificent planet. Viewing the earth from that bird’s eye view, he describes the inner core beneath the earth’s crust so well that you think you are listening to the secrets of a mystery novel that are slowly being fleshed out, when actually you are being presented with scientific facts. Traveling up and down the western coast of the United States, his explanations burst with information that are at once comprehensible rather than opaque. His research gleaned from journals, diaries and letters is impeccable and his knowledge coupled with his writing skill has made this a very enjoyable, informative read. I know that he placed me in San Francisco at the moment of the quake. I could almost feel the turmoil as the earth raged beneath its surface wreaking havoc above it.Today, the technology has improved so much that analysis is done by machines more often then people, but the first hand accounts did not contain the coldness of the machine, and therefore the story was connected to emotion. I learned of the reputation San Francisco had when it was born, I could see the cavalier attitude that prevailed, the indifference to any impending disaster, although there had already been some in the previous century. He even draws a relationship between the rise of radical faiths like Islam and Pentacostal Evangelists during catastrophic times, equating the catastrophes to a sign of G-d’s displeasure and a need for doubling down on their dogma. His analysis of the behavior of the insurance companies during the disaster is still relevant today! Although I cannot profess to have understood every word of this highly detailed and descriptive book, concentrating on the April, 17, 1906, San Francisco earthquake, I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this author read his own book with just the right tone and emotion to capture my ear completely. The book is both entertaining and informative."
45,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/644163-curtis,5,"Much of the discussion of tectonic theory and geology in Winchester's title on the Krakatoa eruption is not covered in this book for obvious reasons. I would recommend those with the interest to read that title at some point.A fair amount of this book covers not the actual aftermath of the earthquake which most people remember as the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906 but rather events leading up to it and the nature of American and world geology.I'm not going to write a spoiler here but I will touch on some points as to why this is an interesting read. To us 100 years seems a lifetime away but in geological times it's pretty much just a heartbeat. When you talk about the '06 event or the 1888 Krakatoa event it is sort of like discussing something that happened in political news just yesterday, or earlier today. It requires a perspective adjustment to see it's significance. The Earth is not on our schedule it has a timeline all it's own.There is a great deal of research in the area of studying earthquakes but as yet no real way to know when and where one will hit. This book however gives you an idea of how they work and of the different types. Not all earthquakes are the same and his focus is on those occurring along the faults in North America. The book delves into events on the East Coast, the Midwest, and of course the West Coast. It also discusses the role of volcanism in North America including the Super Volcano that is Yellowstone National Park.Again the Gaia theory of a world that is essentially a big ecosystem or machine is touched upon. Winchester is not an apostle of this hypothesis rather he lays out cooly for the reader. Interesting in 1906 there were a number of significant geological events that occurred ranging from volcanic eruptions to major earthquakes in South America. Is the result of the continual churning of the continents as pressure is released in one area and built up elsewhere? Movement in one region of the world perhaps leading to slippage in another? It is an hypothesis.Without writing a spoiler I'll provide one very contemporary observation he touches on. In 2002 there was a major earthquake in Alaska that thankfully didn't hurt too many people as it may have. Interestingly a change was observed in the geysers of Yellowstone some 1500+ miles away. Normally erupting in a very precise timetable it has apparently been shown that the timing change at precisely the time the shockwaves came in from Alaska. Of course it doesn't matter where on earth you are or if you feel them, earthquake vibrations can be recorded.Interesting in that Yellowstone is one of roughly ten volcanoes known by the new term Super Volcano (coined by the BBC in the late 1990s I believe). To perk you interest more? If you have ever been to Yellowstone it's not like other volcanoes with the crater on top of mountain peak. The crater there is essentially an indentation in the tectonic plate, that is the entire park roughly 40 miles wide is the crater. The lava chamber stretches under three states. If it goes you have to think about a nuclear ice age type of thing.Oh and it's a thousand years overdue :)So just when you thought it was crazy to live in California and that a 1906 earthquake was an interesting but irrelevant historical fact right?The gist: the big earthquake also due in California could conceivably effect the magma chamber etc of the largest volcano in the Western Hemisphere if not the world.Another interesting note. We are seeing some effects of global warming in the weather. About 7/8 of the worlds tectonic plate surface is underwater. What effect might the warming of the oceans have on a interrelated system per the Gaia hypothesis. The amount of energy the warming creates is astounding. That last isn't in Winchester's book, just an observation of my own. "
46,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43101325-michele,2,"I'm struggling with the rating, as so much of the book had nothing to do with the San Fran quake of 1906. I have to admit, I skimmed chunks of this book. It took nearly to the end for the author to finally get to the quake.Some people love this book, I am not among them. Ugh. "
47,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5624-john-adams,3,"It has been a while a few books since I have actually written a review, so lets see if I can make it interesting?Have ever had that thing where you hear about a disease, say like myocardial infarction, and then you look at a stick of butter and all of sudden you are biting your lip, sweating, and debating on whether or not you should call 911? It’s call hypochondria. After reading this book, I got that for earthquakes. I look at the ground. I look at the fault behind my house. I look at crack in my drywall, and all of a sudden I imagine the earth shaking and my house tipping over like a fat kid on a seesaw. Although, since I live in the Bay Area, it’s not a matter of will it happen, it’s a matter of when it will happen--and apparently that’s soon.I picked up A Crack in the Edge of the World because I wanted to read something on Bay Area History, but what I got, and what I didn’t expect, was to be so interested in geology. Winchester argues the synthesis and interconnectedness of the world’s ecology, geology, and environmental systems. In essence, if earthquake hits Jakarta then Old Faithful might skip a minute. It’s an argument that on the surface seems rather simple, but in reality proof is scarce (mostly as a result of the lack of measurable data). For about half the book Winchester adeptly walks the laymen through this complicated geological story. The other half of the book, Winchester takes the reader into 1906 San Francisco. He capably utilizes primary source material and vividly creates the world. He paints streets and shows falling buildings and burning stoves. Not to my surprise, the history of the event coincides with my imagination. The earthquake strikes and fire ravages the city. People are ill prepared and the religious blame the ‘sinners.’ When it’s all over they rebuild with very little concern of it ever happening again. In addition to telling the overall story, the book’s greatest strength is that it offers the lesser known details. For example, the queen of China exerted political influence on the United States in order keep Chinatown centrally located and the epicenter (which he details a long story of coming to consensus) is located in Daly City. Winchester is a good writer and the book is an easy informative read. I lack enthusiasm only as this book follows the pattern of “why I rarely read non-fiction.” I feel like if I wanted to digest the book I could have in about thirty minutes. It repeats itself and spends whole chapter to make a simple point. Personally, unless there is something exceptional or a compelling human story (see Jon Krakauer), I tend to lose interest in “non-fiction” after I understand the methodology and get the “point.” So admittedly I bumbled through the end. But overall, I did enjoy the book and I would recommend it to anyone interested in geology, San Francisco history, or earthquakes. "
48,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/870451-breanne,4,"While I was expecting this to be mainly about the events of the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, there are several other central topics in this book. There is a lengthy discussion and explanation of geology, including the history of many of the geological disturbances here in the United States, with background going as far back as the earliest discernible movements of the earth's plates (and I didn't realize that is a very, very, very long way back. Like, WAYY past Pangea). There is also a lengthy history of the surrounding area of San Francisco as well as the settlement and progression of the city up to the quake. There is, of course, a riveting description of the earthquake itself and illustration of the origins and movements of the fires that caused so much damage. And there is also some discussion of the aftermath, rebuilding, and current-day circumstances, not only for San Francisco, but other quite vulnerable cities along the San Andreas Fault (heck, along the entire edge of the Pacific plate).While the San Francisco quake seems to have provided the motivation for this book, the real star seems to be geology itself. It makes sense when you realize, after a quick Wikipedia search, that Winchester is a renowned geologist, and luckily quite an apt journalist and author.I feel that Simon Winchester makes some classic writing mistakes with this book. Run-on sentences, long tangents that are unnecessary to the main topics of the book, and some pretty dry subjects (there is a LOT of geology). And yet, he completely makes up for them with imaginative writing and an illustrative and evocative vocabulary that he twists to bring to life the movement of the earth in a way that makes it seem as though you are standing right on the brink as it rips apart. Also, as I listened to the audiobook, his lively and entertaining performance brought everything to life even more. He has a sonorous Oxford accent, and a drama and passion in his reading that I have never heard from a nonfiction narrator.I think it's a little tempting to complain about how this turned out to be more about Geology (and other tangential topics) than the SF earthquake itself. I think those complaints are justified, but for me personally, it was done in such an eloquent and fun-to-listen-to way, I really enjoyed it."
49,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1036072-david-evans,4,"A fascinating exploration of the 1906 earthquake in San Francisco, the underlying wonky geology and the social history of victims and heroes of the most catastrophic event to hit a major American city. Simon Winchester takes a journey across the North American Plate from its eastern border in central Iceland to the fragile western join against the Pacific Plate against which it is continually grinding. The build up of pressure miles under the earth at the fault line gives suddenly somewhere every few years and the side-slippage in 1906 led to a 21 foot re-alignment in places at the surface. Beautifully written in language the layman can easily understand it becomes all too clear that ""The Big One"" could happen at any time with consequences likely to dwarf the enormity of 1906 and the more recent Banda Aceh tsunami. Typically:No greater monument to hubris can be found than in a pretty little town forty miles south of San Francisco, where people have lately made untold millions from their work on designing computers and the vitals that make them work. The town is called Portola Valley...The weather is warm, the fields are green, the trees are noble. There are pleasant little shops selling exquisite and costly goods; Volvos hum quietly along winding country roads; there are bicycle trails and horse paths and golden retrievers, and when runners come out in the evening cool, all of them seem good looking and tanned with that peculiarly honey-coloured skin that will seem so well suited to a Brioni evening at the quiet cocktail parties held underneath the redwood glades and the star-filled skies.But all is in fact nowhere near so well as it looks. The town of Portola Valley, it turns out, has been built exactly astride two of the most active traces of the San Andeas Fault. It is a deeply dangerous place, liable to be destroyed at any moment.This is as far from a dry-as-dust factual account as it is possible to get; readable, thought-provoking, funny, and terrifying."
50,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4445120-janet-gardner,4,"I enjoyed this, rather a lot, though I have to confess I forgot a lot of what it contained within hours of reading it. I choose to blame the density and specificity of the information rather than my rapidly aging brain. Simon Winchester’s greatest gift as a writer is the same as his greatest weakness: he is so darn interested in just about every aspect of the world around him--geology, geography, politics, history, sociology, linguistics…you name it--that he tends to go off on rambling (though not uninteresting) digressions as he tells his tale. This long book, ostensibly about the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, was nearly 8/10ths over before the earth actually began to shake. Some of the many digressions along the way to the shaking included four hundred years of California history, a few hundred million years of plate tectonics, musings on what an earthquake would look like if viewed from the moon (answer: not much), and how Winchester got interested in geology during a visit to Iceland when he was an undergraduate in the 1960s. Interesting stuff, all, but a little mind boggling at times, esp. for an audiobook, which doesn’t allow you to slow your reading speed during dense passages. Still, listening to this book, as read by the author, made many miles running on the treadmill go by with a whole lot less tedium."

I hated the book for the first 50 pages or so until something the author wrote indicated he is British, and suddenly my anglophilia kicked in and I could tolerate his voice. After that, I quite enjoyed it.The book examines the 1906 San Francisco earthquake from all facets. It provides an interesting survey of geology from the formation of the earth, the scientific disputes surrounding the introduction of the plate tectonic theory, and brief information on other significant plate movement events. From there it moves into the history of California and San Francisco, and a minute description of the days leading up to the quake. By the time we got to the actual earthquake, it was almost anti-climactic.In the end, I really enjoyed this book, as evidenced by the four stars. It is a similar take on science as Bill Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything, with well-explained science and juicy historical tidbits to go along with, and nearly as well executed. I think the key is to take slow sips of it, rather than try to read all at once. I had it out from the library for 9 weeks and only finished it on the last day."
52,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/293178-caroline,3,"This book was not quite what I was expecting, or if I'm honest, hoping for. I was looking for a history of the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906. And this is that history, but only if you start about 150 million years ago. I suppose I was looking for a social history, and what I got was mostly a geological history!I learned more than I ever wanted to about New Geology, seismology, plate tectonics, fault lines, slip-strike lines, seismographs - but what I really wanted was the personal histories, the experiences of people who lived through the quake, the impact on the community, the rebuilding, the tragedies, the triumphs. There is some small element of this, but not enough for my tastes. The actual quake doesn't even hit until page 201!That Winchester managed to keep me reading that long, that I not only read this but read it in a matter of days and still enjoyed it, despite all the geology, is testament to his skills as a writer. I've read a number of his other books, and he is truly an excellent writer and historian - he manages to make what in other hands might be an immensely dull read relatively engaging, and that's a real gift."
53,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10717893-art,5,"I simply MUST recommend this book. It is by one of my favorite modern writers of books, and it wraps itself around the intersection of history and geology, two of my favorite intellectual pursuits.Now, I must confess, I did not actually READ this book. Instead, I had it read to me, by the author. I bought the set of CDs on sale at a geological convention I attended in Pittsburgh last year, wondering, ""When will I get around to listening to these hours upon hours of words?"" Well, despite the fact that I did drive quite a bit that trip, I was traveling down memory lane, in southeastern Ohio, around where I went to college back in the last 60s and early 70s, so I was listening to my own voices in my head. I only got around to the CDs during a solo drive out to west Texas and back a little later. Wonderful. Now, the question is, should I read the book as well? Hmm... so many books, so little time."
54,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/822417-danielle,4,"As a San Francisco resident, I was totally sucked in, as Winchester draws a geological landscape that extends from Iceland to Alaska and spans millenia before offering the satisfaction of completing the story of the SF Earthquake. From massive tectonic processes to recent sociological trends to second-by-second eye witness accounts, the story of the quake is especially gripping with the knowledge that another earthquake (or two, three, ...) _will_ hit. Our society is still relatively new to the California landscape; we probably have no idea what's in store! "
55,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45531997-terri-naughton,3,"I thought this book would be a history of the San Francisco earthquake and fire, and it was that, but it was also a bit overwhelming in its excess of geological detail...took me forever to wade through it and I confess that I skipped ahead through some of it. Probably an excellent book if you're a student of geology, but not so much to my taste. Did enjoy some of the discussions about San Francisco's history and society, as well as the blatant discrimination against the Chinese immigrants etc. "
56,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/156993-andrea,2,"Oh Simon Winchester – Why? Why can't I find another of your books as good as ""The Professor and the Madman""? This one was…interesting, but OMG too much geology for me. I only made it about ½ in but I am totally taking credit for reading this thing. Also, me thinks I will skip his other book about geologic natural disasters (Krakatoa) because 4 chapters of seismology and explanation about tectonic plates is more than I can bear."
57,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/199326-gail,4,"I struggled a bit with this. Parts were very technical, and although Winchester makes a valiant attempt to keep the geological explanations perky, they're still somewhat difficult to work through. The rest of the book is very good, told in Wincherser's breezy, tour-guide-cum-gossipy-friend style. Since I obught it in a hurry, thinking it was his book about Krakatoa, he'e obviousley a good enough author to hold on to an accidental reader."
58,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/327259-janis,4,"This book goes well beyond the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. I learned about plate tectonics, events including the New Madrid quake (watch out midwesterners!), the settlement of the Bay Area, the '06 quake itself and its aftermath, and -- a new reason to stay awake at night -- the pending apocalypse centered at Yellowstone. The author did a great job explaining these fascinating and unsettling topics."
59,0060572000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1857032-jen,3,"I ended up liking this a lot more in the final few chapters than I did during the middle stretch. Really interesting read about not only the 1906 earthquake in San Francisco, but how those events have shaped other places and historical events. There's a fair bit of scientific language scattered throughout, which at times made for slow going, but the anecdotal evidence of the author's journey proved very interesting! "
