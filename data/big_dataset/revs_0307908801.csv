But it is so fleeting, in the face of page after page on the cultural history of time capsules, or how various religions consider ""eternity."" I kept skimming to get to the good stuff, but skimmed my way to the end of the book. Clearly I had the wrong book in mind, which is largely my fault, and only partially the fault of the ad campaign. But I can't shake the feeling that Gleick threw this together on assignment, taking a breather after the profundity of The Information. I wanted an equally profound experience here -- but that experience will have to come from more of a nerd and less of a science historian. "

Why is it so difficult—so degradingly difficult—to bring the notion of Time into mental focus and keep it there for inspection? What an effort, what fumbling, what irritating fatigue! —Vladimir Nabokov (1969)
Time is a funny thing, everyone knows what it is and no one can (easily) explain it. But that doesn't stop Gleick from taking a crack at it. Marshaling the collective resources of literature, science, philosophy, cultural anthropology, and religion he walks us down the many side streets and cul-de-sacs of this essential and mysterious...thing.While ostensibly about Time Travel, this book is a much more comprehensive review of Time in general. He does, however, start off with THE time travel classis: The Time Machine by H.G. Wells, and puts it in its fascinating historical context:
Nowadays we voyage through time so easily and so well, in our dreams and in our art. Time travel feels like an ancient tradition, rooted in old mythologies, old as gods and dragons. It isn’t. Though the ancients imagined immortality and rebirth and lands of the dead time machines were beyond their ken. Time travel is a fantasy of the modern era. When Wells in his lamp-lit room imagined a time machine, he also invented a new mode of thought.
Strange to think such a pervasive idea in modern culture is so relatively young. Gleick walks the reader through some other noteworthy time travel stories and speaks about its place in the literary and popular culture landscape.Then he gets to the interesting stuff: just what is this time we are traveling though and what does it even mean to time travel. As The Doctor put it:
""People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but actually — from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint — it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff.""
It is a difficult concept to grasp because it is so fundamental to the human experience. Physics might offer some keys but its conception of time may no job with how we experience it:
Perceiving all the present, an omniscient observer would likewise perceive all the past and all the inevitable future at the same time. Indeed, present and past and future would be without meaning to such an observer: he would always perceive exactly the same thing. He would see, as it were, a Rigid Universe filling space and time—a Universe in which things were always the same.
That, itself, leads into the question of free will and the nature of God:
For God outside of time, God in eternity, time does not pass; events do not occur step by step; cause and effect are meaningless. He is not one-thing-after-another, but all-at-once. His “now” encompasses all time. Creation is a tapestry, or an Einsteinian block universe. Either way, one might believe that God sees it entire. For Him, the story does not have a beginning, middle, and end. But if you believe in an interventionist god, what does that leave for him to do? A changeless being is hard for us mortals to imagine. Does he act? Does he even think? Without sequential time, thought—a process—is hard to imagine. Consciousness requires time, it seems. It requires being in time.
Heavy stuff, let me tell you.Gleick also delves into the cultural aspects of time and offers fascinating contrasts to how different cultures grapple with this concept:
The language forces this upon us. Who was the first person to say that time “passes” or time “flows”? We are seldom conscious of the effect of language on our choice of metaphors, the effect of our metaphors on our sense of reality. Usually we give the words no thought at all. When we do, we may well wonder what we’re really saying...Other cultures have different geometries. Aymara speakers, in the Andes, point forward (where they can see) when talking about the past and gesture behind their backs when talking about the future...The cognitive scientist Lera Boroditsky, a student of spatiotemporal metaphors and conceptual schemas, notes that some Australian aboriginal communities orient themselves by cardinal direction (north, south, east, west) rather than relative direction (left, right) and think of time as running east to west. (They have a strongly developed sense of direction, compared to more urban and indoor cultures.) Mandarin speakers often use vertical metaphors for time: 上 (shàng) means both above and earlier; 下 (xià) means below and next.
The history and study of time is both mind bending, confusing, and fascinating. We take so much for granted when it comes to time, but the way to influences us, both in the physical sense and in the cultural sense, is rather neat. Gleick does a very good job of synthesizing these disparate ideas into a comprehensible set of chapters while providing a near overwhelming set of quotes and sources to augment the discussion. While it can get a bit dry at times, the exploration of time and time travel is as rewarding as it is profound."
2,0307908801,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5556452-ruth,2,"This was disappointing. Gleick's previous book, The Information, is one of the very few books I can actually say changed my view of the world, with its crystal clear explanations of diverse scientific and mathematical topics woven together into a compelling scientific whole. Time Travel, unfortunately, is neither clear nor coherent. In this case, Gleick weaves his way between the cultural history, scientific development, and philosophy of time. However, the book works neither as literary criticism nor as scientific explainer, with the cultural sections mostly being long, meandering plot summaries, and the scientific sections glossing over complex scientific concepts with only the most cursory attempt at making things understandable (if I didn't already have a degree in physics, I'm pretty sure I would just be confused by the strangely off-hand references to how the time weirdnesses in relativity and quantum mechanics work). The prose is strangely florid as well, and many of the chapters fail to gel into coherent themes, feeling more meandering than enlightening. There are some worthwhile parts: the chapter on time paradoxes in particular feels tighter and more immediately engaging than the rest of the book. Ultimately this book left me looking for a scientific or thematic clarity which never emerged."
3,0307908801,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31467977-tom-quinn,4,"I remember distinctly when my interest in time travel arose. I'd seen it in movies and Saturday morning cartoons before and played a little ""back to the time of the dinosaurs"" make-believe with the neighborhood kids already, but it wasn't until fourth grade that I had the legitimate thought: I should have done something differently. I wanted to go back and change one specific thing, one bad decision. Nevermind exactly what I did, but it resulted in a lot of time spent in my principal's office and a recurring weekly appointment with the school psychologist. If I'd had the means, I would have gone back in a heartbeat to not do what I'd done.My time travel fantasies only increased throughout high school. What if I'd asked out so-and-so? What if I'd gone to that cast get-together after the play? And then after college, disillusioned with my young adult life, things ramped up exponentially. What if I'd gone to a different school? What if I'd majored in some other subject? What if I'd dumped the girl who became my first wife before things got really bad? What if, what if, what if? Thankfully nowadays my overactive, overthinking mind has mostly settled all these ""what ifs"" and I'm content to stay in the here and now, looking backward on what has come before as productive character building. I rarely consider time travel for any prolonged daydreaming, trading those wistful fantasies of youth for the practical, long-term, day-by-day incremental grown-up version: taking steps now to build towards what will hopefully be a better future, doing my best daily to not screw up my kids, and saving for what I hope will eventually be a comfortable retirement. But those ""what if"" games are powerful stuff. That's got to be why time travel has a storied place in literature and film, and remains a fruitful topic of philosophy; it allows us to ask some fascinating questions. What is the self? If I were to go back and meet myself as a child, could I rewrite my personhood? What is free will? If I haven't met my future self so far, does that mean I will never go back even if time travel were to be invented someday? How is it that I can think paradoxically or conceive of impossible things in the first place?Enter James Gleick, to provide a walking tour of sorts through the history of time travel (and Time in general) in Western culture. The book is semi-serious and partly playful, and Gleick writes with a flair for the dramatic. He threads us through some of Physics' and Philosophy's shared minefields (what exactly IS time? How fast does it go? When is now? If there is a god, does he exist in time, outside of time, or somehow both at once?) and invites us to peer briefly into the depths of logical rabbit holes without descending too deeply ourselves. He is a cheeky rascal of a tour guide, though, and makes the trip plenty of fun, detours into the weeds notwithstanding. Along the way he stops to examine topics from the silly to the sublime, including the time capsule craze of the 1900s and everybody's obsession with killing Hitler.4.5 stars out of 5. Probably a 3 or 4 for the content, which focuses a lot less on pop culture and a lot more on theoretical physics than expected, but certainly a 5 for the style. I appreciate how Gleick never talks down or patronizes with oversimplification or spoon-feeding, but instead assumes a strong background from the reader and a quick mind that's able to keep up with his presentation. But he does a lot of excessive summarizing of other works of literature, especially in later chapters, and I'd rather hear more of his own intriguing analysis than the primary sources he mines."

I think I’ve forgotten this before.”). It's not really a book about time travel, but a book about time, a book that travels time –through history, philosophy, physics, storytelling, logic."
5,0307908801,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,3,"This book is really about the history of the idea of time travel. James Gleick traces the history of the idea of time travel, through literature and films. The earliest stories about time travel paved the way, for they first exposed people to the whole concept. Later stories expanded on the concept, showing the possibility for paradoxes. Gleick also explores the concept of time; it is actually rather difficult to define in a non-circular manner. What is time? This becomes a rather philosophical discussion.While I loved James Gleick's earlier books, this one just didn't seem to engage me. Much of the book simply recounted the plots of various books and films, and that didn't seem very interesting; if I had read the book or seen the movie, then the recap was not needed. If I hadn't read the book, then what is the point? And, the philosophical parts of the book just didn't keep my interest."

7,0307908801,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13430088-vipassana,2,"An interesting history on the idea of time travel and so, Time as well. What Gleick seems to suggest is that the idea of time travel has caused us to think about time with much more rigour. While, this history is intriguing, I couldn't help but think of a few other writers who could have tackled this subject better. His flow from one concept to the other seems disjointed at times. However, the ideas here about time in science, fiction and philosophy are a treat to read."
8,0307908801,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172572-lemar,5,"“Literature creates its own time, it mimics time” says James Gleick who uses the subject of time travel in literature as a jumping off point for a deep and fascinating examination of Time. He delves equally into physics, philosophy and literature to present a refreshing perspective that respects our common experience of time as something very real and not theoretical. Thought provoking quotations abound: “Time is a phantasm of motion” - Thomas Hobbes, and time is “a moving image of eternity” - Plato. Gleick challenges accepted conclusions about space-time. Are space and time inseparable? He asks great questions and is unafraid to contribute his own conclusions. This book prompted many excursions through great internet rabbit holes (always a looming temptation for me!) that began with references to a figures cited by this incredibly interesting and well read author. For example I had never heard of Robert Hooke who turns out to have been a polymath who had the bad luck to be an enemy of Isaac Newton who was not too busy to use his considerable standing to Hooke’s reputation. I was hoping for, and found, s lot of obscure and promising science fiction and science books in the text and in a Further Reading section. Gleick is funny and irreverent, a terrific guide who has found a perfect vantage point from which to examine our present. "
9,0307908801,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41690792-muthuvel,3,"A verbose history of Time Travel in Science Fiction (almost 85℅) and in culture.Book concentrates mostly on the perceptions of sci-fi authors on time, it's nature and possibility of Time travel, and the reality. Starting from H.G Wells, the book covers many works of authors like Asimov, Heinlein, Proust and many more. Also some glimpses on few physicists' and mathematicians' approach on paradoxes due time travel and possibilities of universes. Enjoyable at some level but not overwhelming.Most of the sci-fi works described in this anthology turned out to be spoilers for me as I planned to read some of those works prior to this. On the brighter side, have got some suggestions on short stories from the author's indefatigable witty literature research on time travel. The book could be useful for enhancing one's own imagination upon time travel through various uber ideas of sci-fi legends and its analyses felt worthy. Nothing more than that.Read at your own risk or interest, perhaps. "

11,0307908801,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26071992-nooilforpacifists,2,"Perhaps I read too much science fiction growing up, especially time travel stories. Perhaps I thought about the theories and paradoxes over-much on my own: see my review of ""Dark Matter"". It's true, I forgot to use, as the classic example of the ""impossibly theory"", Adolf Hitler--half the mediocre time travel stories try (unsuccessfully) to kill Hitler. Stephen Fry's (awful) ""Making History"" is one such; it's also been done under the ""multiple universes"" theory, most notably in Alfred Bester's tremendous short story ""The Man Who Murdered Mohammed"" (which I should have mentioned in the ""Dark Matter"" review) as a classic of the latter genre. And one quote (from a Rivka Galchen story) sums up impossibly nicely:""Science fiction writers have arrived at analogous solutions to the grandfather paradox: murderous grandchildren are inevitably stopped by something--faulty pistols, slippery banana peels, their own consciences--before the impossible deed can be carried out.""The sole epiphany--the only thing I hadn't thought of before--arrives at the end of the book:""Why do we need time travel? The answers come down to one: To elude death.""Good point. But especially given Gleick's other excellent work, hardly worth a 313 page slog."

Although technically unfinished, I'm marking this as ""read"" because I feel I received the entirety of the book's value in those first eight chapters (100 pages).

13,0307908801,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68982633-jersy,4,"This book is less about the history of time travel in fiction and more about the concept of time in mostly the 19th and 20th century : how it used to be perceived and the philosophical and scientific theories around it.I adored about the first third of the book, because it focused very much on the developements that caused the idea of time travel and the discussions this idea sparked. There was a lot of information I found to be fascinating and even mindblowing in relation to history and the science fiction genre. However, afterwards there was so much time dedicated to scientific time theories that felt dragging and repetitive after a while, and, while I wasn't entirely disinterested, it wasn't what I read the book for. Towards the end, it does pick up the topic of time travel media again, going into examples and paradoxes, I had just expected that the whole book was more focused on that.I thought it would discuss changes and differences in fiction dealing with time travel and what cultural and maybe scientific developments led to them, but instead it used the concept of time travel as an excuse to discuss ""what is time?"".I think this is a book interesting for people that are into the history of ideas, science and philosophy, and less for readers that want to learn about media or literature history. I wish I've known that, for I was primarily reading this as inspiration for what time travel books ro read next.Still, I learned a lot of fascinating stuff, the appendix lists a lot of works I can get into and it was an enjoyable read. If the first third wasn't as brilliant I wouldn't rate it as highly, though, since the majority of the book felt more like a 3 star read for me."

Time travel feels like an ancient tradition, rooted in old mythologies, old as gods and dragons. It isn't. Though the ancients imagined immortality and rebirth and lands of the dead, time machines were beyond their ken. Time travel is a fantasy of the modern era. When Wells in his lamp-lit room imagined a time machine, he also invented a new mode of thought.
Basically, Time Travel by James Gleick is a big circular overview of how the evolving scientific understanding of the nature of “time” in the nineteenth century affected the imaginations of that era's novelists, who then invented the concept of time travel, and how these novels then inspired philosophers to further explore the nature of time (which affected the scientists who then inspired the next generation of novelists who introduced new quandaries for the philosophers: can you go back and kill Hitler or your own grandfather?) As Gleick attempts to cover the evolution of all three fields as regards time travel – scientific, literary, philosophical – this is a book crammed with references, and no one idea is explored with any real depth. But as this exploration was perfectly suited to my interests – and as a nonscientist/philosopher I was sometimes stretched to the limits of my own understanding – it was, for me, a perfect overview of the connections between these fields that I hadn't considered before. I found this book to be both entertaining and enlightening.Despite Marcel Proust being mentally transported into the past by the scent of madeleines or Washington Irving's Rip Van Winkle sleeping his way into the future, Gleick picks H. G. Wells' The Time Machine as the first true exploration of the notion that humans could be physically moved through “time” as though it was a distinct fourth dimension; a truly radical idea for the era, but which we now accept as a given. Over the years we've allowed storytellers to invent the science behind time travel (from Wells' steampunk contraption to a DeLorean's flux capacitor), or let them get away with using magical devices, or since we now tend to blandly accept time travel as a trope, the process can be dismissed simply as wibbly wobbly timey wimey...stuff. Building on Einstein's Theory of Relativity, quantum physicists have proven that at a subatomic level, time can indeed be reversed and particles sent into the past (and described as easily as changing the “t” in an equation to “-t”), and to the layperson, this has had the effect of making time travel seem plausible, when a hundred years ago it was the most radical idea imaginable. Gleick makes the point that simply by writing about time, novelists, scientists, and philosophers have changed our notion of the nature of time:We have a tendency to take our words too seriously, which happens (paradoxically) when we are unconscious of them. Language offers a woefully meager set of choices for expressing what we need to express. Consider this sentence: “I haven't seen you for a [?] time.” Must the missing word be long? Then time is like a line or a distance – a measurable space. The language forces this upon us. Who was the first person to say that time “passes” or time “flows”? We are seldom conscious of the effect of language on our choice of metaphors, the effect of our metaphors on our sense of reality.By thinking of time as a line that runs infinitely behind and in front of us, this led to the rise of fatalism – the idea that the future is as fixed as the past, and therefore free will is an illusion – and in the mid-twentieth century, this was the model that the novelists, scientists, and philosophers were all working from. (And it took the novelists to imagine the forking and branching that led to the currently acceptable notion of multiverses.) Neither the math nor the literary imagination could disprove the idea of a fixed (if infinitely branching) timeline, and I found it especially interesting that it was David Foster Wallace, in his honors thesis in Philosophy, who ultimately refuted the notion of fatalism:Words represent things but the words are not the things. Fatalism is a philosophy built out of words, and ultimately its conclusions apply to words – not necessarily to reality.Again and again, it was Gleick's circling from literary plot to scientific theory to philosophical “proofs” that I found so interesting, and I can accept that this exploration and this format may not have widespread appeal. In particular, I really appreciated the following perspective on the nature of consciousness as a followup to what I recently read in Yuval Noah Harari's Homo Deus:
Physicists have developed a love-hate relationship with the problem of the self. On the one hand it's none of their business – leave it to the (mere) psychologists. On the other hand, trying to extricate the observer – the measurer, the accumulator of information – from the cool description of nature has turned out to be impossible. Our consciousness is not some magical onlooker; it is a part of the universe it tries to contemplate.The mind is what we experience most immediately and what does the experiencing. It is subject to the arrow of time. It creates memories as it goes. It models the world and continually compares these models to their predecessors. Whatever consciousness will turn out to be, it's not a moving flashlight illuminating successive slices of the four-dimensional space-time continuum. It is a dynamic system, occurring in time, evolving in time, able to absorb bits of information from the past and process them, and able as well to create anticipation for the future.
As I've written before, the nature of time has long been of particular interest to me, and Gleick's perspective – that it is the storytellers who both push the limits of the science and mold our understanding through the use of the words they use – was fascinating to me. As for the writing, it was satisfying enough for me to have ordered another book from Gleick."
16,0307908801,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79401637-edward-wendt,4,"This book could in many ways serve as a textbook, encompassing elements of literary history, philosophy and physics. It is a bit heavy at times, and is meant as an all-encompassing analysis of time travel, not just a recap of time travel in various media. There is lots of good information in here, just the manner in which it is presented is often a bit too convoluted, as though the author is trying to make sense of time by using too many quotes and literary obfuscations. A good read, but probably one better slowly digested."
17,0307908801,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1701553-carlos,3,"Very interesting book, but lacks cohesion and at some points tries to connect opposing point of views that don't end up coordinating. This book needs to be taken slow and with the previous understanding that all talk in it remains theoretical , no it's not going to tell you how to travel in time.... but it will give you all the mentions that time travel has had in the history of literature and media . Very interesting but a tad dry for a reader with no knowledge of theoretical physics."
18,0307908801,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16080726-sabin,3,"Gleick’s books are usually long narratives, taking an idea from its conception to its different applications and their effects on present-day society. They are big ideas which have had, and continue to have, a great impact. And so it is with time travel. True, he, on numerous occasions, reaches the conclusion that, as far as we know, time travel is impossible, but that does not preclude the idea from having an impact on today’s society and it also gives him space to explore hypothetical questions.For this reason, the book is as much a history of the early days of Science Fiction literature as of philosophical and scientific ideas related to the meaning of time and what it is. Pretty much everything is readily accessible, the science is mostly explained clearly inasmuch as it helps the reader get a general picture of the ideas under scrutiny, while avoiding a lot of information which could not be as readily explained without the underlying maths.Fortunately his review of literature is a lot more comprehensive. Starting with the literal conception of time travel by H.G. Wells he takes the reader through most time travel plot types in the SF literature, but also discusses other ways of time travel in literature, like Proust’s involuntary memory or Kate Atkinson’s many-lived protagonist in Life After Life or Bill Murray’s dilemmas in Groundhog Day.If you read Gleick before you know exactly what to expect from the book and you won’t be disappointed. If not, then expect a lot of interesting tidbits of information to open your appetite, if not for the science then at least for the literature."
19,0307908801,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,3,"Available as a well-read and entertaining 10-hour audio download.Although I enjoyed listening to this going to and from work, the bicycle repair shop, etc., I hesitate to recommend it outright. It had lots of interesting ideas and cool bits. I especially liked the reflections on the plain fact that, although time travel in a vehicle as a concept was surely conceivable from before the time of the invention of writing, apparently no one really thought of it until H.G. Wells, thousands of years later. It seems like you didn't need the existence of machines to think of vehicular time travel. So why didn't anybody think of it? It seems especially strange now that you can no longer swing a digital dead cat around Amazon's best-seller list without hitting an .epub file detailing the adventures taken in some sort of box hurtling through the eons. However, I also got the impression that the author got a decent-size advance, promised a book-length history of time travel, but then couldn't deliver. This is largely because, sorry kids, there is no time travel, no matter how appealing the possibility might appear to those of us who are finding the world as currently configured insufficiently rich in drama, justice, joy, adventure, or some combination of the preceding, but excessively rich in intimations of mortality.In the absence of the real time travel deal, the author is condemned to chronicle the back and forth where popular fiction influences real science and back again. This is interesting, but it's hard to squeeze a really book-length book out of this as a topic, especially as the author has apparently received strict orders from the oppressive patriarchy not to mention the entire oeuvre of Connie Willis, a creative and prolific distaff practitioner of the genre. But the back and forth where popular fiction etc is not quite enough to pad out a whole book, I fear, so I think the author got his friends over and, over a bottle of Knob Hill, asked them to wrack their brains for topics, however tangentially-related, that could be shoe-horned into this book. Hence, there is a long bit that says that flipping back and forth in a book is a type of time-travel, which is really isn't, sorry. Similarly, there is an especially ill-humored chapter where the sort of civic-minded boosters who propose, assemble, and bury time-capsules in the cornerstones of buildings come in for a sound tongue-lashing. Since most of these people are seemingly guilty of nothing worse than a sense of pride (justified or not) in where they are from and a human desire to preserve some small part of their personal experience from the oblivion which eventually engulfs all things, it seems simply mean-spirited to ridicule them just because their efforts are not particularly successful.Briefly noted in the New Yorker, 19/26 December 2016"
20,0307908801,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,3,"It's hard to imagine a topic that is more rife with paradoxes than time travel (or 'Time Trave' as this book's trying-too-hard cover design appears to call it), so it shouldn't be surprising that this book itself is a paradox. There are few subjects more dripping with potential for fun popular science than time travel - but this isn't a popular science book. It's true that there are few writers who can rival James Gleick when he's on form at writing a popular science title. But this isn't one. Quietly, without fuss, he announces that time travel is impossible. It's not real. It could be a very short book... but it isn't.Perhaps I should have got a clue from the amount of time Gleick spends in the first two chapters on The Time Machine. Of course, it makes sense now. He's going to give us a rollicking exploration of the science fiction that has made time travel a part of our everyday lives and tell us more about the writers who've made it happen. But the book doesn't do that either. Although Gleick gives us a spot of biographical information on H. G. Wells, we hear hardly anything about the other SF writers he references - and, in the end, this isn't much of a book about the science fiction of time travel either.Instead what we get is hand-waving philosophising, bringing together a pop-philosophy mix of time in our culture, pure philosophy and a spot of philosophy of science, considering whether physicists really do believe that time does not exist. It's verbose, waffly and hard work for little reward.If you are into the likes of Jorge Luis Borges, Marcel Proust and David Foster Wallace you will probably love this book. But if, like me, you find them overblown and unnecessary then it will be something of a penance. Here's a short extract to get a flavour of the style:These physical objects, worn or broken by the years, were like bottles containing messages written by our ancestors, to tell us who they were. 'Antiquities are Historie defaced, or some remnants of History, which have casually escaped the shipwrack [sic] of time,' Roger Bacon had said. By 1900, London had surpassed Paris, Rome, Venice and Amsterdam as the world's centre of trade in antiquities...If you read that and think, 'Wow, great prose,' this is the book for you. If, on the other hand, your pretentious twaddle detector goes off, avoid it. I'd also note that this is not the only example of something in the book that raised an eyebrow. Roger Bacon only wrote in Latin, so this is a translation, and why Gleick has used such an old fashioned one, other than to be quaint, is hard to understand.  This book will definitely divide readers - but as popular science I can't feel any love for it."

Likewise in Paris, is the BIPM, which also owns the international prototype of the kilogram.”“Free will cannot be easily dismissed because we experience it directly : we all make choices. No philosopher has yet sat down in a restaurant and told the waiter ‘Just bring me whatever the universe has preordained.’ ""“Steven Hawking… describes black holes as time machines, reminding us that gravitation slows the passage of time locally.”“The past has gone out of existence, the future has not yet been born, and time is made up of these things which do not exist… Time seems to be a consequence of change, or motion. It is the measure of change, earlier and later, faster and slower. These are words that are defined by time. ‘Fast’ is a lot of motion in a little time, and ‘slow’ is a little motion in a lot of time. As for time itself, time is not defined by time.” - Aristotle“We go back and forth being Time’s master and then its victim. Time is ours to use, and then we are at its mercy.”“The observer - physicist or philosopher - stands outside and looks in. The human experience of time is suspended for abstract observation… But the physicist notes that we are fallible organisms and not to be trusted. Our pre-scientific ancestors experienced a flat earth and traveling sun. Could our experience of time be equally naive?”“Shut up and calculate… Everything that can happen, does happen - if not here, then in another universe.”“I am because I die… We perceive time only because we know we have to die.”“… When a person dies, he only appears to die. He is still very much alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. It is just an illusion we have here on Earth, that one moment follows another one, like beads on a string, and that once a moment is gone, it is gone forever.” - Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse 5.“You live, you will always have lived. Death does not erase your life; it is mere punctuation. If only time could be seen whole, then you could see the past remaining intact, instead of vanishing in the rear view mirror. There is your immortality.”“Facebook announced procedures for continuing or memorializing accounts of its deceased customers… Evidently, corporeal death is no reason to stop posting… No wonder science fiction writers despair of writing about the future. Eternity isn't what it used to be. Heaven was better in the good old days.”“We say the present is real, yet it flows through our fingers like quicksilver. It slips away.” ."

And not through time travel, sadly.What it does cover is almost everything under the sun to do with time travel. It starts off by examining literature, then takes a step back to talk about the history leading up to when time travel is a concept coined by H.G. Wells. Then, it goes back to reviewing all of the literature, the changes and so on. Philosophy gets brought up. Science and how it differs from science fiction to the point where scientists say it's possible while authors say it's not really a thing. Television and other media.On and on.This book literally covers so much ground and does it so well. Each topic is logically examined by Gleick and each thing that feels like a tangent adds back in and really matters. It's very impressive and I'm glad that I listened to it.At times, it got a bit too long for me and too winding. As I said, there was a lot of territory covered, so that means there's a lot of information. It got too much at times. I could space out and feel like a simultaneously missed nothing and everything. I think that it would have worked better if it was organized into concepts. Such as, a section on science and then one on philosophy and then the bulk on literature. I think it would have been better to cover history, then science, then philosophy, and finally literature. That's what makes the most logical sense to me.However, the way it weaved everything together also worked. It made me have to pay attention at times, or I was going to miss the importance of why this was being explained."

Not only does he discuss the literary tools used to describe time, but the literary sources that created the construct of time travel itself! This is a science fiction/pop culture explorative paradise from H.G. Wells to Doctor Who to Jack Finney and even a slight nod to those two infamous time travelers, Bill and Ted.

Rambling, meandering and erudite, the book cites many authors on the nature of time, yet provides surprisingly little information. Specifically on time travel, it discusses mainly the ideas science fiction authors, many of them scientists themselves, came up with. It treats reading books as a form of time travel, and Gleick mentions somewhere in the course of his musings that books should be read twice.

33,0307908801,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4058800-stan-prager,5,"Review of: Time Travel: A History, by James Gleickby Stan Prager (6-9-18)	I love flying because it offers an extended uninterrupted opportunity to read—and there’s even a drink cart! On a recent trip out of town, I packed two books. One was a novel sent to me by its author with a request to review it; it proved unreadable. The other was a chronicle of siblings who were executed for resisting the Nazis, a fine account that was nevertheless too depressing to be my sole read for the duration. Thus, while waiting for a connecting flight at an airport in Atlanta, I spotted a bookstore and walked out with a copy of Time Travel: A History, by James Gleick, which literally consumed me for the rest of my journey. 	What if I had packed different books for my trip? What if I had the option to go back and make a different selection? Or, what if—prior to departure—I could have skipped ahead and evaluated how my choices turned out? Certainly, everyone at some point questions decisions made in life and yearns for that impossible opportunity for a do-over. Rarely, of course, would we muse over such mundane matters as to which book was plucked off a shelf. The choices revisited would more likely focus upon not having another drink before picking up the car keys, not sleeping with your wife’s best friend, or not taking the rent money to the casino. The flip side of looking back, naturally, is looking ahead to the consequences: the accident, the divorce, the eviction. But as we are reminded more than once in Gleick’s marvelous existential excursion into the scientific, philosophical and literary manifestations of the concept of time travel, our lives and choices are part of an even greater chaos system than the planet’s weather, and an authentic butterfly effect governs it all. So yeah, even your pick of a paperback could somehow end up changing everything, not only for you, but for those in your orbit, perhaps all of humanity. 	Of course, Gleick—who specializes in science and technology writing and is the author of Chaos: Making a New Science—is something of an expert on chaos theory, although Time Travel is far less concerned with science than it is with how notions of time run through every aspect of modern consciousness. That was not always the case, as Gleick notes in an especially fascinating focus on how that came to change, relatively recently in our history, when the advent of train transportation and by extension train schedules—together with the communications technology of the telegraph—brought standardization to clocks across a vast network. The long pre-industrial agricultural world governed almost entirely by sunrise and sunset and the phases of the moon was all at once turned upside down. Clocks were not new, of course, but until regular train travel came to depend upon rigid scheduling, there was little pressure for the universal standardization of time. It was perhaps this now omnipresent sense of time, Gleick’s account seems to suggest, that sparked the whimsy to wonder what it could be like to travel forward or backward in it.	 Time Travel opens with the guy who—it turns out—virtually invented the idea: H.G. Wells. While there were, Gleick recounts, prior random references to such a thing here and there, it was The Time Machine, Well’s 1895 novel—published at a time when the potential of science and technology seemed limitless—that conceived for a wide audience the very notion that travel through time might be plausible. The impact was immeasurable. For one thing, this slim work managed to generate a kind of massive cultural paradigm shift in the way those exposed to it perceived their past and future, riding Wells’ imaginary machine in their own minds-eyes: could it be possible to revisit the past or peer into the future? (Never mind that Wells himself believed it impossible.) For another, it spawned a whole cottage industry of science fiction tales in books—and later, in film—wrapped about this topic, the bulk of which are contained in this volume’s extensive bibliography. The reader suspects that Gleick has read or watched all of these, probably more than once, as throughout the narrative he skillfully employs these literary excursions to explore the philosophical and scientific ramifications of time travel. What if you went back in time and blocked Booth from shooting Lincoln, or killed your mother, or met yourself? These all seem like “timeless” themes now (pun fully intended!), but it looks like no one asked questions like these before Wells came along. And Wells didn’t ask them either: his time machine only went forward to a far distant future of Morlocks and Eloi, and beyond that, but not into the past. It was left to his literary descendants to tap those veins. 	Given Gleick’s resume, I expected more of a focus on science in this book than naval-gazing, but that’s not to say science is absent. We think of the elasticity of time in our perceptions of it—we indeed experience the same units of time quite differently during orgasm and root canal, for instance—but Einstein revealed with his theory of special relativity that in the nature of the universe time is indeed elastic. Wells may have invented the science fiction about time, but it was Einstein, just a decade later, who uncovered the science of it. In fact, Einstein shook the halls of science at its very foundation when his work showed that space and time are part of a single space-time continuum comprised of the coordinates of four dimensions. I’m hardly a physicist, but the way I usually explain this to the uninitiated is by asking the trick question: What would happen on the earth if the sun suddenly burned out? The answer, of course, is: nothing … for about 8 minutes! 	Time is, though, a tricky thing. On the macro level, there is something known as the “arrow of time” which proceeds in one direction, towards the future, along with the concomitant disorder known as entropy that is a component of the second law of thermodynamics, which accounts for the asymmetry between future and past. On the quantum level, on the other hand, we cannot be certain of that: underlying laws of physics work the same going forward in time as in reverse, meaning they are time-symmetric. Most of the physics beyond this are also beyond me, but Gleick does a competent job of summarizing the thinking about this attached to the best minds out there, from Einstein to Eddington to Feynman to Hawking—to the current cutting-edge science probed by the likes of Sean Carroll—from theories of relativity to those of the multiverse, in language fully accessible to the layman. So, does that mean time travel is possible, to the past or the future? Gleick himself seems agnostic; others not so much. Some scientists consider that hypothetical wormholes—predicted by the theory of general relativity—might create shortcuts through space-time and could thus be a potential mechanism for time travel to the future, but that remains very speculative. Few think that travel into the past, reversing the arrow of time, could ever be possible. Others believe, like Wells did, that time travel is an amusing idea, but simply impossible. And then there are those, like some champions of the multiverse, who suggest that time is passing differently but simultaneously in multiple parallel universes, which makes you wonder that if time travel was indeed a possibility, rather than moving backwards or forwards in time, might it be more interesting to instead go sideways? Perhaps the accident, the divorce, or the eviction have different outcomes elsewhere …There’s another kind of time travel that has a more secure scientific foundation. We know that Einstein was correct about special relativity, and although we cannot directly measure the space-time continuum, phenomena predicted by it have been confirmed. Einstein noted that the speed of light in a vacuum is always the same, regardless of the speed an observer travels, because the speed of light is absolute and invariable. This means that events might occur at the same time for one observer and at different times for another observer travelling at a different speed, because rates of time run differently based upon relative motion, something called time dilation. This is where the notion comes in of a hypothetical explorer on a space ship travelling near the speed of light who spends 100,000 light years in space on a voyage to a distant star and hardly ages at all. Our science is not nearly advanced enough to put that to a test, but recently astronaut Scott Kelly spent nearly a year in space at high-speed orbit while—as part of a focused NASA study—his twin brother Mark remained on earth, and it is believed that Scott returned to the planet 8.6 milliseconds younger than his twin. On a more sobering note, unexpected changes to Scott’s DNA have altered his gene expression so that it now appears to vary by seven percent from that of his twin, and some of these changes suggest potential harm to his biological processes, perhaps shortening his lifespan. Contrary to what was initially reported in the popular press, however, Scott and Mark are indeed still identical twins, and much further study lies ahead before definite conclusions can be reached. But it does make you think and make you wonder …If you are, like me, a person who delights in thinking and wondering, then Time Travel by James Gleick should be near the top of your “to-be-read” list. Whether your interest is in science fact or science fiction, this fascinating book—which truly defies genre—will make an outstanding contribution to your intellectual development.

To which I can only say, ""Then write your own!"" It's a small-format squarish book, which seems to suggest that it should be read in bits and used as a prompt for discussion or reflection. This book is not so much a history of time-travel science fiction (though it discusses quite a bit of it) as it is a history of our concept of time. Gleick holds that the idea of time travel, quite novel in the 19th century, was one of the seeds of our changing understanding of the nature of time. So the book looks at the intellectual history of time not only in science fiction, but in mainstream literary styles, in physics, and in the general popular world view. There are lots of intriguing ideas in here. "
40,0307908801,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59397846-cristian-g,5,"Personal Response:	I read Time Travel: A History by James Gleick. I really like this book because it talks about time travel and its impact and evolution in society. I also like this book because it expands on the ideas of time. The book goes in chronological order. It starts from when time travel was first introduced to when it becomes an idea in today's culture. This makes it really easy to comprehend the complex ideas in the book. Plot 	The book starts in the late 19th century. The young H.G. Wells is writing his first book that becomes a global sensation. This book popularized the idea of a time machine. In the book, he writes about a man who examines a machine. He is a time traveler. The time traveler rounds up his friends and begins with a science lesson. The time traveler explains that an object must have four dimensions: length, width, depth, and duration. He states that an instantaneous object cannot exist because it does not last for any time at all. Time, he states, is the fourth dimension. As the book progresses, and as time moves on, time travel has begun to evolve in literature, science, and everyday life. James Gleick explains that time travel begins to appear in pop songs and Tv commercials. Cartoons start to invent and reinvent time machines, gates, and portals that go with the ideas of time travel. At the end of the book, Gleick talks about the possibility of time travel being possible. He proposes that time travel is impossible because of the Grandfather Paradox, a well-known idea in the physics world. This Paradox states that if someone goes back in time and kills their grandfather, they wouldn't be born, in which case they couldn't go back in time to kill their grandfather because they wouldn't exist. This would create an infinite loop and that is why it’s a paradox and why time travel would not be possible. Characterization:This book does not have a main character because the book is not really about a character but more of a story of the evolution of time travel. The book is told through the first-person point of view of the author. The time traveler is the only character mentioned in the book. This was a character in one of the most famous books that brought about the ideas of time machines. Setting:Time Travel does not really have a proper setting or time period. Although the book starts in the 19th century, it expands to the present. This is because the book talks about the ideas of time travel throughout the 19th, 20th, and 21st century. There is a setting in the first chapter of the book, a drafty corridor. This is where the time traveler was examining his time machine. After that, the setting is unstable because it changes to places all throughout the world where time travel has been explored. Thematic Connection:	A theme in this book is to face the reality that although time travel is an idea, it seems to be impossible to do. This is evident when James Gleick states the problems with time travel and how they contradict the laws of classical physics.  Recommendation:	I recommend this book to any student who likes physics or is intrigued by the ideas of time and time travel. I would recommend this book to any high school student because middle school students would not be able to comprehend the complex ideas in this book. I would also recommend this book to any male or female that just enjoys science. "
41,0307908801,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"Why is there something rather than nothing? There is really no more fundamental question we ask ourselves as human beings. It might be a poorly formulated question but it gets at why we learn, why we listen to books at audible, and why we can believe Plato when he makes the statement ""an unexamined life is not worth living"". Sure we dance around with other variations of that question such as ""what is the meaning of life"", ""what's my purpose"" or ""what is truth""? All the kinds of questions we ask ourselves and gives us our purpose beyond ourselves. Time travel stories get at answering those kind of questions and this book connects the dots between that genre and those questions.Fictional authors who describe time travel often have insight about the real problems concerning our existence. For 2400 years there's been a debate concerning ""being"" first posed by the pre-Socratics Heraclitus (""no man ever steps in the same river twice"") and Parmenides (""there's only one substance in the universe"" and it ain't you!). That debate was on the nature of 'Being' v. 'Becoming'. But, it has modern implications on the nature of Time, the now, identity, truth, being and reality . Einstein takes Time out of the universe with his block universe and Bergson want to keep it in with his psychological time. (The book brings these points up, but it doesn't mention that even Einstein would speak of his self proclaimed 'original sin' of tying the speed of light to a physical clock, and Karl Popper will tie Parmenides' ""one"" to Einstein's block universe). Do we live in a deterministic universe or is there free will? That question gets at is there necessary existence or is there contingency around us, does cause always proceed effect or is there an Absolute Idea? As Hume is quoted to have said in this book, ""we see the effect but we never can see the cause"". What is the cause of the effect is not always obvious. Western thought and our science think in the terms of effect always is caused by something. Bertrand Russel, quoted in this book, is shown to have said that cause and effect are a convenient fiction of sorts, a way that science uses to explain the world but not necessarily understand the world. Eastern philosophical thought doesn't rely on cause and effect and the author will quote the Buddha and other Eastern thinkers to that effect. The East has a different perspective on the 'now' from the West. Time travel stories obviously delve into this and offer insights on how to think about the issues. The author connects the dots for the listener.The now is never known except through the memories of the past and the expectations of the future. The more we embrace the now the less we can know of the forever. The nature of Time is elusive. Einstein takes it out of the universe. Others (just as smart) try to put it back into the universe. They make it an 'emergent property' of the universe itself, but never quite defining what emerges. Various time travel works of fiction get discussed while talking about these kind of topics within this book. Time travel stories allow for different takes on the eternal and what outside of time and space could mean. The author will connect the dots for the listener. He'll even bring in Marcel Proust and relate his masterpiece to time travel stories. I think it's wrong when I see people call time travel books bunk because of the paradoxes. Absolute scientific knowledge about the real world is a fiction (science never proves anything it can just show something is not true). For example, force does not equal mass times acceleration. That was thought to be a bedrock, universal, necessary and certain statement until Einstein made his relativistic correction. There is a paradox at the core of understanding reality. One can even argue that the geocentric model is correct by constantly invoking auxiliary hypothesizes. The measurement problem in physics is real. The double slit experiment and Heisenberg uncertainty principal give us a violation of the second law of logic, the mutual exclusive law. Copenhagen Interpretation gives one resolution to the problem by making an observer necessary in order to collapse the wave function. Hugh Everret III takes it one step less by applying Ockham's Razor and eliminating an unnecessary entity, the observer, that leads to the Multi World Interpretation (MWI). There are other possible solutions, the book mentions a Bayesian solution, let your prior opinion of the past weigh your likelihood of the present and that determine your expectation of the future. All of these thoughts are in this book by way of explaining some time travel stories. I'm going to take it one thought further by stating why Bayesian is important. ""All crows are black"" is logically equivalent to ""if it is not black then it is not a crow"", so therefore, that non-black thing in front of you, say a white sheet of paper, is evidence in support of crows being black. Bayesian statistics is the only way I know how to discount that information appropriately. This book doesn't have that example, but it does speak about logic and necessity and contingency and possibility and impossibility and how we use paradoxes to get at truth and being.Paradoxes are at the core of reason. Kierkegaard gets quoted to that effect in one of the chapter headings in this book. For a full explication of that I would recommend his ""Fear and Trembling"" available at audible. He'll describe how the contradictions within the story of Abraham sacrificing his son Isaac only make sense if you understand the absurdities entwined within the story, and that our life itself has an absurd nature surrounding it. Some of the absurdity is explained by our knowing the ""now"" and also knowing our finite nature in order to understand the infinite. The particular defines the general. We say cigarettes cause cancer, but we never say that a certain cigarette caused a specific person's cancer. (That example is in this book). We are made up of instances of the now, but we think of ourselves as selfsame. Time travel stories allow us to peek into the absurdity, the identity (selfsameness), and particular verse universal nature of reality. Each of these problems are illustrated within this book by time travel stories. The book mentioned the movie ""Predestination"" (2015 with Ethan Hawke from a Robert Heinlein book). Of course, I ended up watching that film after I finished listening to this book. The movie really illustrates why time travel fiction can be so fun to indulge in. A lot of people reject time travel prima facie, they hate the grandfather paradox. They shouldn't. All models of the world will have the 'originary' problem. Some thing will always have to be the cause of itself. Aristotle pretty much just says that the universe was always there and will always be there, it is its own cause. Augustine (and St. Thomas Aquinas) will push the problem back and say the universe was created out of nothing ( 'ex nihilo') by a creator, but the creator was always there and always will be. The problem of something causing itself becomes obvious when we think about it in terms of our grandparents but when we consider 13.7 billion years ago we forget the problem is still there. In the end, for there to be a ground or foundation something will have to be a cause of itself, the 'ouroboros' (I think the author uses that word too) effect is present if you go back 13.7 billion years or 100 years. One just spots the paradox quicker when it happens to be their grandfather or themselves in the scenario. Literature,in general, usually gives us insights into 'human being'. Everybody understands what the human experience means in some way. We have different opinions and beliefs but we all have an experience of existing. Time travel stories give us insights into just plain old 'being', and it takes us towards the variation of the question ""why is there something rather than nothing"", or in other words what is 'being'. This book connects some of the dots between time travel fiction and how they relate to issues within philosophy and science and explained to me why I've always watched time travel movies and TV shows when they come on and how they can give us insights into 'being', time, identity, the now, truth, and reality, not a mean feat for any book. "
42,0307908801,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3056629-jenn-jr,4,"In shelving this book - I think ""philosophy"" is appropriate, despite the fact that the book reads like a bibliographic essay on popular media around time travel. The author covers so much territory and exceeds my rather humble expectations: I was hoping to get some comparison of the ""rules"" of time travel and how the tropes have developed and changed over time, along with some rather good ideas for things to read later.What I got was a rather in depth metaphysical analysis of physics and philosophy. And, you know what? I realize that despite physics having so much reputation for being intellectual and ""serious"" that it's just as much bullshit/malarkey as anything else we humans come up with. It's so much speculation and whether it's considered ""good"" or ""flawed"" seems so much to depend on the zeitgeist and trends of the time. The author does a great job of discussing various concepts that gain popularity at different points. I think there were plenty of other writers and ""big idea"" people he could have included (and, perhaps, more women). There's the whole ""boom"" of Latin American literature and the book ""Rayuela"" (or Hopscotch in English) which totally messes with the chronological events and puts it into the hands of the reader (much like Borges).Some of the ideas that I take away from this include the idea that ""space"" only exists because of interactions -- which may or may not be true. Is that interactions between humans? Does it require someone to be present and to remember for a space to be there? If so - cyberspace is a very rich space, indeed. Humans are really good at creating cultural artifacts and in the last several hundred years, we have developed and refined methods for doing so at an increasing rate. From cave paintings to the printing press to telegraph and cameras to mimeograph to internet ... we want to record our experiences and live outside our time and memory.And - what is memory, really? How are memories created? I really like the position that the past is gone and doesn't exist - our memory is only our mind's attempt to recreate that experience and it's always flawed. Also, I like the idea that we humans are fascinated with time travel because it helps us escape death. If you imagine that the past is always happening in the past - then those people are still there, living and doing things there. So many rich ideas to think about and analyze. As a modern Doctor Who fan, I was sad that there weren't more references to Doctor Who - but I'm happy that he included ""Blink."" And, there was mention of the story upon which ""Arrival"" is based -- but I'd like to have seen more analysis of all time happening all at once and why our brains only perceive it in a linear fashion. Though he did talk about four dimensional universe (ie, the big block of time and space) - I didn't feel like there was enough attention on how this concept of ""all time happening at once"" has been permeating time travel stories as a popular trope the last several years.As always, I made many notes and will possibly return to revise my review and add more details. But first, pizza."
43,0307908801,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2160536-marvin,4,"James Gleick starts off with a bombshell. One we should all already know but we don't want to admit. Time travel is impossible. At least the two-way type that we would all like to do. He does mention ""time travel"" as implied in speed of light travel but that isn't really time travel is it? That's more like a suspended animation that you stay awake for. . It is a Rip Van Winkle effect proven by experiments with atomic clocks. But the touristy version of time travel to the past and forward and back again? Fascinating. Tempting, However the sad fact is science and physics fights against the idea of that being a reality.So why write a book of time travel, especially a history of time travel? Because the concept is so embedded in our brain that it pretty much affects everything in our modern world. It is in our literature, our media, and even in physics as it grapple with the paradoxes set forward in the many thought exercises that time travel gives us. After all, If quantum physics isn't an exercise in the paradoxes of our reality, what is?Gleick starts his history with H. G. Wells and his novel The Time Machine. Pretty much everything we accept about the idea, including the idea of time as a fourth dimension, comes from Wells. From there he explores several ideas that continue to rise from the literature to come and how Physics chugs along right with them. Time Travel is basically a series of meanderings. It feels more like a continuing mind game, despite its chronological pattern, rather than a history of anything. That may offset a few people that want something really about time travel but for others, like myself, it is an almost poetic if challenging way to look at our perceptions. This is the kind of book more understood at a chapter at a time so you can absorb its idea. Definitely not a light read, it is still one that entertains while informing. If you like the topic, this is a must. "
44,0307908801,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4651295-jason-furman,3,"I had very high expectations for this book but it did not live up to them. The book is a history of human interest in time travel and the modern interest in time--from H.G. Wells' The Time Machine through a smidgeon of the modern physics debate on the topic. It combines history, cultural history, science, philosophy and literary criticism over a wide range but all pointed at a narrow--but elusive--topic. Some of the chapters work well, like the one about paradoxes in time travel. But others do not, like a few chapters that have substantial portions devoted to plot summary and light analysis of particular novels. And altogether it did not leave me with a strong or new view on the question.And a minor point, in the beginning Gleick points out that Wells invented both the idea of a ""time machine"" and also of a ""time traveller"". He then provides various earlier references to people traveling in time but doesn't have a fully satisfactory way to distinguish them from Wells other than his terminology. I think the difference might be control--Scrooge is taken to see visions of the past and future against his will while the Time Traveller in Wells deliberately creates a machine and chooses the date. But I'm sure there are many exceptions to that rule too."

Gleick writes well, but what he's saying in this book—mostly rehashes of the plots of time travel stories—just isn't that interesting. If you are looking for something that will do a good job of exploring either the science or philosophy of time travel, then look elsewhere; likewise if you already read enough time travel stories to be comfortable with the genres various tropes, you won't find Gleick's rehashing of stories particularly interesting.2-stars."
46,0307908801,http://goodreads.com/user/show/929592-jon,3,"This is my first James Gleick book, and many Goodreads reviewers found it inferior to its predecessor, The Information. It was a bit of a disappointment for me too. It was fascinating and amazingly clear when discussing spacetime, Einstein, Godel,--I think I understand all that a little better than before--but well over half the book is spent in dry, boring plot summaries of sci-fi novels, short stories, movies, and TV shows. Complete with many spoilers, if you were planning to read or watch any of them. He's quite good on Proust and time, and he opens the book by remarking that H.G. Wells was the first writer to entertain the idea of time travel as such. He remarks on how language determines how we think about it (in French, temps can mean both time and weather; but he doesn't mention the Greek difference between chronos and telos, or the Greek idea that we are backing into the future (since all we can see is the past). My overall impression is that he collected about every fact and quotation about time that he could find and then wandered around among them."
47,0307908801,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,2,"I admit this may be my own fault for not understanding what the telos of this volume is precisely, however, I genuinely didn't learn anything from this at all. Rather than a philosophical, scientific, and historical examination of the idea of time travel, this is essentially a rehashing of every mention of the concept in literature beginning with H.G. Wells. What little science there is ends up being hugely simplified - please don't let this be your only exposure to Albert Einstein, Freeman Dyson or Sean Carroll - and contributes little to Gleick's essay. I'm not sure who to recommend this to. Suffice it to say, if you've ever read any Wells, Asimov, Bradbury in the fiction area as well as any of the aforementioned physicists, there really is no need for this book. If you're looking for an introduction to the concept, go straight to these authors and skip this."
48,0307908801,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7360810-rick,4,"Time Travel, as a subject, can often be discussed in one of two ways: Either from a purely scientific viewpoint, which often gets bogged down in technical jargon; or in a purely science fictional way, which devolves into hand-waving the science altogether.Gleick, as the title suggests, looks at the idea of Time Travel from a historical perspective, with H.G. Wells' The Time Traveller serving as a jumping off point and as an anchor. He goes on to explore how physicists and philosophers, authors and academics, have all approached the idea of Time Travel. It's an interesting book and Gleick is a facile writer, making the journey pleasurable. While it's a relatively easy read, it is not without its challenges as well. You'll be confronted with challenging theories, both scientific and philosophical, from some of the greatest minds of the last hundred+ years."

We wind around a huge variety of concepts, theory, fiction, non-fiction, science and popular culture themes to try and get into the creamy center of what ""time travel"" is, isn't, could be, could never be, and probably never was. I felt like my brain was getting a very heavy workout as I tried to hold on and understand as much as I could. I listened to this in audio book form and I'm not sure that was the best way to let it all sink in (but the narrator, Rob Shapiro does an amazing job).

Gleick's History starts promisingly enough with HG Wells, but never seems to find any sort of rhythm, never seems to do anything more than bob around on a sea of quotes about the nature of time and the way philosophers, writers and scientists have spoken and argued about it.I have read many many time travel stories and understand a lot of the physics. I was hoping to be enlightened, but a hundred pages in and I had learned little more than how frustrating a poorly written book can be.This book is a waste of time."

Gleick not only writes beautifully, but he clearly loves this subject. Everything loops around The Time Machine and, to a smaller extent, the theory of relativity. There are summaries of time travel stories, explanations of paradoxes, grumpy philosophers, before-their-time physicists, time capsules, forays into social psychology, British jokes, and everything in between. It ends up being this wonderful, engaging whole packed full of things to learn, and where I stand now, I think it’s the best non-fiction book I’ve read this year.8/10"

It's safe to say James Gleick has become my favorite author of the past few years, and I intend to read everything by him. I've often wondered why it seems difficult to find science books that represent a lovely union of Apollonian and Dionysian styles, the way I am given to understand was most common in the original works of scientific giants from centuries gone by. Time is an evergreen mystical and metaphysical quantity that requires the soft melded touch of art and science, and with the stunning range of literature, plays, and philosophy that this book brings to its treatment of the evolving physics and mathematics of spacetime, it perfectly embodied the point it pushes of how science/art/philosophy have each played off each other in mankind's journey of understanding time. It is true I came for something else, I assumed from the previous James Gleick books I've read that this would be an exploration of the actual science behind time travel, details of theory both mainstream and fringe and how they relate to popular depictions in the arts. This is not that book. His knowledge of the arts is staggering, and the organization of ideas is as much a microcosm of the time-travel journeys it portrays, bound by an internal consistency yet branched in the multiplicity of flow sometimes linear sometimes circular, and multidimensional in its exploration of each thread. I continue to be fascinated by his biographical approach to scientists known to me only by their eponymous laws, expanding a zero-dimensional point of trivia floating about in my subconscious to a network of connected knowledge, bounded in time by the events and minds of the people responsible. Unfortunately, this book is so beautiful that it resists a cold absorption of its facts and insights, a rigid-universe in itself that asks to be experienced fully before analysis or reflection. If we lived in a simpler time, this book would instantly have been re-read, as per Nabokov's instructions, but we live in a time where (when) I've added 16 books onto my Kindle just from this book alone, and a couple more from elsewhere. So it is goodbye Time-Travel. Maybe we'll meet again, when we are slightly older and our minds less hectic, and I'll be right for you and you'll be right for me. But right now I am chaos to your thoughts and you are poison to my heart.NotesWhy before HG Wells we have zero works about time travel?

Similarly, literature the first time is presented in sequence and not appreciated fully. William Gibson coined ‘cyberspace’, but space here collapses like Aleph from Borges, a point that contains all the other points such that it is infinitesimal. Lee Smolin likened space to connection, but in billion-dimensional space, every element neigbours every other element, this is the internet. "
