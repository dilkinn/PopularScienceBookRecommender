1,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5293536-melki,4,"As long as they're not crawling on me, or glued to my bedroom ceiling eying me with evil intent, I am fairly tolerant of bugs. After all, we would be drowning in our own waste without them. They eat other bugs. And there's that whole pollination thing to consider. But....Insects cause billions of dollars worth of structural and agricultural damage each year. They spread disease and have caused the deaths of untold numbers. Basically, they are the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, crawling and winging their way in your direction. And many of them have a taste for blood.The bug profiles in this little volume read like the stuff of science fiction and nightmares. Frightening tales of giant centipedes catching and eating bats in midair! Swarms of millipedes that brought Tokyo's express trains to a halt! Six types of bugs that eat books! Horrors!!! When you're not busy cringing and slapping at the tickling sensations on your extremities, you'll find all sorts of nifty facts and info that will surely make you the know-it-all Cliff Clavin of your next cocktail party.They may be smaller than us, but we are vastly, vastly outnumbered. I am now fully convinced that bugs will one day rule this planet. Which reminds me of the final lines from a poem I liked when I was a kid -Metropolitan Nightmare by Stephen Vincent Benet: ""Say, buddy,"" he said,""You better look out for those ants. They eat wood, you know,They'll have your shack down in no time.""The watchman spat.""Oh, they've quit eating wood,"" he said, in a casual voice,""I thought everybody knew that.""-And, reaching down,He pried from the insect jaws the bright crumb of steel."
2,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019174-terence,3,"Wicked Bugs follows on Stewart's Wicked Plants: The Weed That Killed Lincoln's Mother & Other Botanical Atrocities and mirrors its format: short (2-3 page) essays about a variety of subjects - in this case, ""bugs."" And I don't fault her for defining ""bug"" loosely. As she writes, ""This is by no means a comprehensive field guide or medical reference.... Most of us use the word to describe any number of tiny slithering and crawling creatures."" (pp. xiii-xiv)The only fault I found in this book was the lack of photos. Sure, there are illustrations but when we're discussing Lactrodectus hesperus or xenopsylla cheopis or Theraphosa blondi, one expects and deserves glossy, hi-res, color photos of these ""monsters.""I correct that fault - to an extent - with the following list of my five favorites:#5: Body lice (Pediculus humanus humanus)The titular louse of the book's title. These little fellows have been with us since we started wearing clothes (c. 100,000 years ago), and under the right conditions (overcrowding, unwashed clothing, war) are happy to carry diseases like typhus and trench fever. It's they who stopped Napoleon's Grande Armee and sent it fleeing back to France (whatever Russian patriots might say).#4: Giant centipede (Scolopendra gigantea)These beauties can reach lengths of 30 cm (c. 10 inches). Centipede venom is rarely fatal and its power is related to size - the bigger the 'pede, the stronger the venom. The bite of the North American species (Scutigera coleoptera) is nearly painless, and the insect eats other pests like bed bugs, silverfish, carpet beetles and cockroaches.#3: Hairworm (Spinochordodes telinii)This parasite zombifies grasshoppers. Hairworm larvae hang around in water until an unsuspecting grasshopper takes a drink. Once inside the 'hopper, it grows into an adult. But in order to complete its life-cycle, the adult has to get back to the water so it takes over the insect's brain and forces it to commit suicide by jumping into the nearest waterhole to drown.#2: Asian giant hornet (Vespa mandarinia japonica)These insects are so large (5 cm, c. 2 inches) that they're mistaken for small birds, and their sting feels like ""a hot nail through my leg,"" as one man described it. (p. 9)Japanese scientists have based an energy drink on a liquid giant hornet larvae produce that has been shown to reduce fatigue and increase fat burning in mice and graduate students. Naoko Takahashi, Olympic gold-medalist marathoner, swears by the stuff.#1: Brazilian wandering spiderThis guy deserves two photos:I was torn between the wandering spider and the giant hornet but my fascination with arachnids won out to put this dangerous hombre in the #1 spot. This spider reminds me of the facehugger from ""Alien"" - fast and aggressive. If you don't kill it with the first blow, expect to go mano-a-mano with a seriously pissed off, seriously venomous spider (an unlucky British chef bitten by one hiding in a crate of bananas spent a week in the hospital).Bonus icky anecdote: There is a case of a woman who went into surgery for a suspected brain tumor. When the surgeon opened up her skull, however, he found that she was infested with tapeworms.Pork - the other white meat :-)Bonus lesson about interfering with Mother Nature: The lowly earthworm is generally considered a boon but this was not the case in Minnesota, where before the advent of the European nightcrawler (Lumbricus terrestris), the ecosystem had evolved without them. They devoured the layer of leaves that fell every autumn and the native flora began dying out. There's nothing to be done at this point except damage containment and hoping the ecosystem will recover. But it won't be the same environment that hosted Solomon's seal, large-flowered bellwort, wild sarsaparilla, meadow rue, sugar maples and red oak."
3,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1035783-jesse-broussard,4,"I feel like the wine taster at the wedding in Cana: the best was saved for last. The best, in this case, being zombie bugs, bugs that take over an unwilling host (such as a cockroach, grasshopper, snail, etc) and use it for their own nefarious purposes, such as turning its antennae iridescent colours and waving them around to attract the nearby Nazgul, or perhaps causing grasshoppers, drunk with vino del mar, to fall violently in love with a particular passing fish. Alas, leaping to the water like Jean Valjean does not preserve them from perishing in it like Agamemmnon: they can't swim, and die in a bliss of ardent, wet-gilled fervour, doubtlessly delivering poignant love poems with their last breaths. Of particular warm and fuzzy feelings for me, who have peeled back ceilings and watched them scurry away, opened ovens to the sight of cockroaches two inches deep, and found the scientific way (trial and error) that a roach's head is entirely unnecessary to the survival of the rest of the roach (for a few days: plenty of time to reproduce) is the delightful insect that stings a roach, then inserts its stinger into the temporarily immobilized roach's brain, and then, steering via the antennae, walks the now docile behemoth back to its own home like it was leading an elephant, where it lays its larvae on the roach's abdomen. They proceed to eat the roach from the inside out, turning it into a disposable incubator, and I applaud them.Other, more well-adjusted humans will probably loathe this book. But those of us that delight in the misery of others, or at least those who can find admiration for their creative methods of dying--seriously, how many autopsies come back with ""caterpillar"" filled in under ""cause of death?"" That's impressive--those humans like me, in other words, will greatly enjoy this book. In fact, we'll probably convince our roommates to bathe in raid and never leave the home (safe save for bedbugs, the lice that killed half of Napoleon's army, the black-widow's kiss of death, and numerous other delights). As it is a dictionary of types, it's not the smoothest read. But who cares? It's not a novel, it's a catalogue of ants whose bites resemble gunshot wounds, of black flies that kill animals by the tens of thousands, of parasites that through itching inspire suicide, of bugs that shoot acid at the rate of a heavy machine-gun, even of a super-society of Argentine ants stretching from San Diego to Eureka, Ca. And as such it is awesome. Enough to raise up a new generation of entomologists, who can then write more books like this one, inspiring the Jesse to heights of ecstasy as yet uninspired by aught but bugs."

5,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1072582-kaethe-douglas,5,"The publisher assumes this book is for adults, but if you know a plague or bug fan of tender years, they would probably love you for hooking them up. Lots of the diseases and infestations are described in gruesome detail, but Stewart is writing for a broad audience, so the text isn't dull, even though she provides the proper Latin names for everything. If anything, I would say Stewart uses a snarky tone that would particularly appeal to the young. The teen who wants to read this would have been just as eager in fifth grade, when she became fascinated by the CSI kind of science. Certainly she tolerated me reading short passages aloud with good grace.Two hours ago I was still reading this, stretched out on the sofa with a couple of cats, whilst the other teen is screening sci fi flicks for a friend at the other end of the house. Lots of explosions down there, with no noise but the whir of computer fans and purrs down here. Outside it's 88 and sunny with 35% humidity. I prefer to read in the coolth, unless I can actually be in a pool. So, a funny compendium of horrible pests is just the perfect thing to be in here reading.I'm having a good summer vacation so far.Library copy"
6,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2970379-manybooks,1,"Although Amy Stewart is of course quite correct pointing out that there are many insects which have been, can be and often still are massively destructive, her attitude in Wicked Bugs: The Louse That Conquered Napoleon’s Army and Other Diabolical Insects is in my opinion simply and at best massive ignorance personified. For she really does seem to think that insect pests are thus simply because they are personality wise and deliberately nasty and inherently evil, whereas any entomologist worth his or her salt could and hopefully would easily tell her that insects like all animals are struggling to successfully survive, to reproduce, to pass on their genes to further generations and yes, that often might mean being parasitical, being destructive (or rather what we would consider destructive). And no, Ms. Stewart, just because some insects and perhaps even a great many of them do tend to negatively affect humans and our projects, our lives, that does NOT automatically make insects as a whole evil and anthropomorphically nasty, it just makes them potentially annoying and sometimes also a legitimate threat. But furthermore, considering how deliberately and willfully destructive humans in general are, how we have with full knowledge and yes even with overt acceptance trashed the earth and many of its ecosystems, and often still continue to blithely and carelessly do so (and how indeed, even many so-called insect pests have been introduced by US, by humans, into erstwhile pristine natural areas and ecosystems), honestly, how dare Amy Stewart call insects diabolical when she really should at the very least also be condemning of humans and at least accept our own guilt here, that in many ways, destructive insects have thrived and proliferated due to our actions and behaviours. One star, and while I guess interestingly enough penned to an extent, I for one absolutely will not be recommending Wicked Bugs: The Louse that Conquered Napoleon’s Army and Other Diabolical Bugs (and really, Amy Stewart must be totally lacking in basic common sense if she considers the many insects that consume carrion and break down dead tissue as and I quote horrible creatures, because guess what, these insects, and just like any carrion consuming animals, while how they make their living, how they eat and reproduce, might well look disgusting and perhaps even smell disgusting, they do in fact provide to the earth, including to us humans, an important and essential service, namely cleaning up rotting flesh, vegetation etc. and thereby preventing the spread of disease)."
7,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/683792-jen,3,"Things you should not do while reading this book:-sleep in a hotel room-see a bug-get touched in the middle of the night in a dark room by something that is obviously going to lay its eggs beneath your skin...only it was only your catThis book gives me all new reasons to think bugs are both really really gross--and amazingly cool. Like the chigoe fleas who like to lay their eggs beneath toe nails, where the pain and itching get so bad, some of Columbus's soldiers when first landing in the Caribbean would cut off their toes. Or the giant caterpillar who will hang from the tops of caves and catch bats...mid flight. Or this kind of wasp that will sting a roach's brain, and use the roach as a living incubator for its larvae--until the larvae eats it.The book is pretty much a dictionary on this sort of thing. My calmness was aided that they didn't include photos, instead there are stunningly beautiful drawings. It's a fun romp filled with disgusting facts, scary creatures, and the power of nature. "
8,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4692637-fleurette,3,"I'm afraid of insects, so I wondered if this was a book for me. But it turned out to be a pretty good and funny book.It has this playful tone, which I like very much in non-fiction books. And which makes the book easy to read. Thanks to this, you don't feel like you are reading an academic textbook. This is a very nice book. Most of the time I didn't have any problems with my phobia. And I had a lot of fun.Examples of bugs are well-chosen and interesting. They are grouped by subject. There is usually one species of bugs that is described in more detail, followed by a short mention of other bugs that behave similarly or live in a similar environment. I liked this arrangement. I think it worked well. Distinctive parts are not too long so the topic does not tire you and does not bore you.Have I learned a lot of interesting things that I will remember for a long time? Not necessarily. There are some interesting things here that I may remember. There are also some things I haven't heard about before. But although I'm not particularly interested in insects or spiders, it turned out that I know quite a lot about them in fact. I knew many things I read about in this book before. It wasn't particularly bothersome, but I think I'd like to be surprised more often. Perhaps this is a book for people who have less knowledge in this topic than I do.Most of the examples and anecdotes given by the author refer to the United States. I am European and I think I sometimes missed some interesting examples from the Old World. It wasn't a big problem, but it's something I've noticed.All in all, this is a good book. Even for people who are generally afraid of insects."
9,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10326608-lindsay,4,"This is a second read of this catalogue of creepy crawlies and human misery for me. It's short and informative, focusing on the harm and mitigation around many ""bugs"" as well as dispelling quite a few myths."
10,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81718362-ann,4,"DRUGSTORE BEETLE Stegobium paniceum Entomologists call this a “cosmopolitan species” because of its wide-ranging and sophisticated preferences—it enjoys books and leather, antique furniture, chocolates, spices, and prescription medications, including opium. A tiny reddish beetle not much larger than a flea, this reviled creature is an enemy of rare book rooms, museums, and pharmacies. It once infested the Huntington Library in Southern California, requiring truckloads of books to be placed into a vacuum fumigator and gassed with a mixture of ethylene oxide and carbon dioxide, killing even its tiny eggs.Maybe a more apt title for this book could have been Creepy, Poisonous and Destructive Bugs as I don't know that any insect is capable of purposely being wicked. Their actions are likely more instinctively driven by a biological need to survive long enough to reproduce. Still, I get the idea the author was trying to get across with the title and it is a catchy one at that.Bugs generally do not freak me out. I am usually the person in charge of household bug removal and I think jumping spiders are cute. Bees don't bother me either and I don't mind if they crawl on me to get warm, but then I am not allergic to them. This book did create some ""eeeeew yuck"" worthy moments though and made me glad many of the critters included in the book aren't native to the US. I think the blood sucking insects bothered me the most, as it seems they often are capable of transmitting some type of disease. If you are a reader who generally is squeamish around spiders, worms and flying insects, I don't know if reading this will make you feel empowered by knowledge or feel even more fearful. I do wish the author had included photographs for easier bug identification, instead of black and white illustrations. Still it was an interesting book that I decided to use for my annual October creepy read. I think this book qualifies."
11,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1063661-woodge,4,"After reading Wicked Plants a couple years ago and gobbling it up, when this book appeared it was a foregone conclusion that it would be mine. This is a handsome book with many cool illustrations (if you're interested in bugs). I found it to be endlessly interesting and a little bit horrifying (screw-worm flies that burrow into you; foot-long centipedes with painful bites, a swarm of locusts bigger than the state of California, etc.) Also, I think the French must be a little weird. Their term for pubic lice is papillons d'amour (butterflies of love.) Ah, love. "
12,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1768003-sam,4,"This is another beautiful little book from Stewart that is packed with a devious collection of bugs, beetles, spiders and other crawlies that have made a name for themselves as a scurge to local humans (again mostly in the US but there are still some examples from elsewhere, not to mention a shout out to the Old World inverts taking on the New World) through poisons, toxins and good ol' fashioned destructive behaviour. Once again the short entries and chapters make this a great book to dip into as well as to read outright and the etchings and illustrations are as beautiful as ever, again adding a sense of Victoriana. Not a comprehensive guide by any means (nor does it set out to be) but it does cover the most common/famous species and even has a few surprises that will have you keeping a suspicious eye on every 'bug' that comes near you for days (possibly weeks) after. A great little read!"
13,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6401606-goldgato,4,"Do not read this book while using public transportation...I missed my train stop because the subject matter kept me completely engrossed. Needless to say, I will never eat pork again and I am slathering myself in mosquito repellent nightly. I have a whole new respect for these mighty bugs and the mayhem they produce. Certainly the chapter on the Brazilian Wandering Spider brought me to rapid attention when the author explains that a passenger almost boarded an international flight with hundreds of these aggressive creatures in his carry on bags. No more aisle seats for me. Book Season = Spring"
14,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1328950-judy,4,"This book is a surprisingly fun and engaging read. I will admit to a lot of grimacing and having to cover the drawing on the page a few times so I could concentrate on the text. Some of the drawings were so creepy, I felt like the bugs would crawl off the page and into my lap :) I loved the scary anecdotes and truly interesting historical bits. Amy Stewart really has the knack of conveying factual information in a conversation and engaging way. The descriptions and examples of how insects have been used in war were really amazing. The Japanese developed fleas with bubonic plague as a weapon during WWII and tested them by dropping them on two Chinese cities, Ningbo and Changde. There were outbreaks of plague in both places and approximately 200,000 Chinese people died. There was a plan to release them over California, but thankfully it never happened. Interestingly, the US granted immunity to the Japanese doctors who worked on that project in exchange for their research information. The information wasn't made public until the 1990's. The section on assassin bugs was gruesome also -- pits filled with these bloodsuckers were used as torture in Uzbekistan in the 1800's. There were also some extremely grisly chapters on bugs that lay their eggs inside other bugs, animals, or humans, bugs that kill their mates, bugs that take over another bug's brain... Wow!"

I skipped the parts about ticks and centipedes because I'm a coward and I'm not ashamed of it. 
16,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8035193-sarah,4,"This book is very pretty and nice to hold in your hands. My students were VERY impressed with how cool and ominous looking this book and its title are. I was sharing my current reading life with them and this was one of the books I was reading (to myself--not them) at the time. I used it to try to explain that animals that are harmful and predatorial aren't evil or mean-spirited but rather just made that way as a means of survival. That cute, fuzzy bunnies have their own means of survival--such as camouflage and the ability to stay still like the world. This type of conversation never works. When will I learn? I'm sure when I was their age, I thought wolves were mean and bunnies were nice and I would be angry at the lion and aching-hearted for the gazelle when I was accosted with a nature program against my will. Cartoons don't help, with their animal personification. Still I try, foolishly. I want to free them to be able to love the Bullet Ant, whose name comes from the pain its bite induces,a nd who I learned about in this book. It needs to give that painful of a bite so it and its family can continue to survive and keep its colony safe. It's like the U.S.A. and its tremendous arsenal of nuclear weapons. But I didn't get into that analogy with my students. They're not even ready to accept that a buzzard circling a dying, suffering creature in anticipation of its expiration isn't evil but rather living on instinct. And they're definitely not ready to accept the bugs, Stewart reports, that are living inside of us and on our eyelashes. So while I suggest you read it, (it's great for road trips!) I don't suggest that you read it to kids, unless they're the type who can handle it. I suppose Mike Reynolds' kid would like this book.And, a word of warning, goodreaders, from the section on bookworms, ""Books, to be saved from the worms, must be used.""Sarah Montambo Powell"
17,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6696296-paul,3,"It isn't a particularly extensive or in-depth examination of the insect world, but it isn't meant to be. It's the sort of book you keep in the bathroom or take with you on a plane flight: quick, entertaining, and light.Stewart partitions the book into numerous, short entries that blend narrative examples with general scientific information on the subject's life cycle, eating habits, and the like, and these are usually accompanied by artistic renderings. There are plenty of squeamish bits to make you itch, from parasites that lay eggs under the skin to ""zombies"" that burrow into the brain and control their host's actions. Not every insect discussed is as disturbing, but each inevitably has some characteristic that is like to make you wish you never encounter one, even if it is something as common as the earthworm.Ultimately, this book taught me that to best avoid these creatures, simply never live near any of the following:-ponds-lakes-swamps-rivers-oceans-long grass-short grass-trees-forests-deserts-citiesEasy enough."

Wicked Plants,
 this book is gorgeous. The drawings are gorgeous, and that's saying a lot for a book about bugs. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I love pretty books. Bugs (and other creepy-crawlies) are truly fascinating. I learned a lot! I liked this book better than Wicked Plants because ""bugs"" have so much more variety than plants. (Being more mobile than plants, I think they can simply be more creative.)CONSParasites. I hate parasites. No, seriously, an irrational fear. Can I say it again? I HATE PARASITES.Every time I have an itch now, I fear that I have some horrifying infestation. p.s. I know that bugs are technically only insects of the order Hemiptera, (thank you high school biology and wikipedia) and the author knows it, too, but it's easier to type than ""insects and arachnids, etc."""
19,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18850156-stewart-tame,4,"This book made me itch.As the jacket promises, this book is about bugs (no, it's not about what happens when a certain famous rabbit gets his hands on a copy of 50 Shades of Gray.) Stewart apologizes for her lack of scientific rigor in using the term. Ants, spiders, centipedes, lice, fleas, snails, scorpions, beetles, worms, and more lurk within these pages, so I think she can be pardoned for the catchall term.Honestly, this book is pretty review-proof. Just by looking at the cover and the description, you pretty much know whether you want to read it or not. Stewart has done her homework, and presents everything in readable, factual prose. She may not go into enough detail for hardcore entomologists, but for everyone else: recommended! "

I'd also never heard of bat bugs similar to bed bugs but more dangerous. I'm all this is an interesting book, and I assure you will learn things about many wicked bugs you probably don't know."

26,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1216935-nolan,4,"This is a short, highly readable, creepy book that fascinated me to the back page. Written in easy-to-understand English,the book details some of the insects that fight and bite us. I had a hard time putting this down. I was fascinated to red that Russians may have counted less in Napoleon's military defeat than the despicable louse. You'll read about bedbugs and their apparent ability to make those they bite anemic if there are enough of them biting. I found myself involuntarily scratching various itching spots as I read this just because of the subject matter, not because I was losing a blood-sucking war with some insect or other. I was deliciously creeped out and intrigued all at once, as you will be if you read this.I have yearned for a circumstance in which I am hermetically sealed from all things nature, especially bugs. This made me pine for such a condition even more. It brought back vivid memories of my young adulthood when I lived in a trailer in Columbia, South Carolina and experienced some kind of Biblical horrific ant plague. We had no ants one minute, then they were literally raining down from the ceilings mere minutes later. You could hear the putrid little bodies falling on my things. I was pretty much hysterical; a more levelheaded friend got rather adept with a vacuum cleaner and developed an unerring aim with a pesticide spray bottle. The ants were quickly disposed of; the memories never will be. And in spite of those memories, this was a pleasure to read. The audio narration was perfect, adding much to the book."
27,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76439836-migl,4,"As I was reading the ""Wicked Bugs"", I couldn't shake the feeling that it was more of a ""Coffee table book"" than a book that you just sit down and read.The facts are interesting and it has the appeal of the scary things, similarly to ""Horrrible Histories"", but the 241 (!) short stories about different bugs felt a bit fragmentary (which is not a bad thing for a coffee table book). Many of them start with some historical introduction, for example, how such and such disease was discovered, and goes on to link it to a responsible bug, which is then described a bit further. The illustrations are also beautiful and thorough, depicting only the animals, not the diseases. And there's some nice naturalist humor in there (I've been chuckling at the chapter name ""Fear No Weevils"" for a while now).Again, it's really lovely to open up and read a chaper or two (to start your day, like those meditation apps, for example!), but the lack of all-emcompassing structure or narrative makes it hard to hold attention for longer reading.Also, it should be noted that the term ""bug"" is used in a broad sense, as in ""small creature that crawls"", including not only insects, but also spiders, mites, scorpions, even some worms and an occasional slug.This reminded me of one of my all time favourite alignment charts: "
28,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2131722-kevin,1,"Reads like an encyclopedia. Short entries without much in the way of depth. Twas all superficial factoids. The most interesting thing about this book was not necessarily the information about the bugs, but the little sidebar facts.

However unpleasant these insects have been there’s one thing I can say with certainty after reading Wicked Bugs: The Louse That Conquered Napoleon's Army & Other Diabolical Insects … it could have been much, much worse. Wicked Bugs (a more accurate title would have been Wicked Arthropods) is basically just a laundry list of insects and arachnids that negatively affect humans (either through their bites or stings or through the damage they inflict on crops and trees). Here are a few fun facts:- Mosquitos are the most deadly species on the planet, killing approximately 725,000 people each year through disease transmission (followed distantly by snakes – 50,000 deaths, and dogs – 25,000 deaths).- Arthropods are the most numerous animals on the planet by numbers, number of species and bio-mass.- Assassin bugs can transmit Chagas disease, something I learned through research after being bitten but fortunately the bugs in the U.S. Southwest are not carriers. - Humans could not survive without insects. As to the book, it’s a quick interesting read, if a bit disgusting at times (I found the sections on parasitic worms particularly unpleasant). Although the scope is pretty narrow, the book will appeal to those with an interest in nature and evolution, and perhaps horror – because unlike an evil clown who lives in the sewer, these creatures actually exist."

Well, I read the entire title - ""The Louse that Conquered Napoleon's Army"" - and expected more history and less bug facts...if you are interested in insects, this is definitely a good read for you. The author is very readable and includes all kinds of information about bugs. But I don't like bugs! I have decided that I am an entomobibliophobic (I don't like reading about bugs). I feel like there is something crawling on me right now. Stewart is a very good writer; it was just the subject matter that bothered me - and the illustrations!

I expected a scientific ""whodunnit"" about insects and disease during Napoleon's invasion of Russia, and instead got a compendium of snippets on various ""bugs"" including spiders, centipedes, millipedes and other non-insect ""bugs"" --deemed ""wicked"" by the author. I spent many happy hours as a kid reading encyclopedia volumes but this book wouldn't have even made the grade. It is not badly written, just incredibly brief and incoherent. The book is very handsome, and has lovely prints of the bugs (although in black and white, so not illustrative for the consumer). Sections of the book are printed in a hard-to-read brown/sepia tone. I find it hard to believe that the Ms. Stewart got this book published, and if her first book, on nasty plants, is similar, I will avoid it like the plague. which also comes from wicked bugs!"

Because I like to, because I find tons (literally) of scrap wood that is perfect for this purpose, and -- especially -- because Birds eat Bugs. By the pound. By the thousand. By using all the skills nature has created for them to be extremely good at this.Bugs are grotesque. I hate 'em. But they are part of the ecological system, they are essential, and they evolved to fill a niche, same as everything else that is living. The illustrations in this book are excellent, the writing is clear and to the point, the facts are straight, and I learned a great deal from this. This book did help me understand insects far more, and made me like insects even less.So I will keep building bird houses."

While some of the misnomers we have about insects/arachnids are put to rest, lesser known and very deadly ones are discussed. One of the most interesting insects I learned about was a caterpillar that if touched, will kill a person by mass organ shut-down. More than anything, this book taught me to be cautious about my own back yard, respecting the ""bugs"" that live there, and to never under any circumstances go to Brazil: Yikes, they have a lot of scary/dangerous critters!

However, after reading this, I think I'll be a little more careful about what I pick up...The only thing I didn't like, (why there's four stars instead of five), is the fact it just ended!

Very informative, alarming and thrilling all the way. With amazing illustrations by Briony Morrow-Cribbs. Warmly recommend it to anyone with a touch of bug addiction."
90,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3," As someone who has spent quite a bit of time outdoors, I’ve had my share of insect encounters. I’ve been bitten or stung by wasps, bees, fire ants, midges (a generic term for any number of black flies), deer flies, fleas, ticks, mosquitos, and in one unpleasant instance an assassin bug (also known as a kissing bug). However unpleasant these insects have been there’s one thing I can say with certainty after reading Wicked Bugs: The Louse That Conquered Napoleon's Army & Other Diabolical Insects … it could have been much, much worse. Wicked Bugs (a more accurate title would have been Wicked Arthropods) is basically just a laundry list of insects and arachnids that negatively affect humans (either through their bites or stings or through the damage they inflict on crops and trees). Here are a few fun facts:- Mosquitos are the most deadly species on the planet, killing approximately 725,000 people each year through disease transmission (followed distantly by snakes – 50,000 deaths, and dogs – 25,000 deaths).- Arthropods are the most numerous animals on the planet by numbers, number of species and bio-mass.- Assassin bugs can transmit Chagas disease, something I learned through research after being bitten but fortunately the bugs in the U.S. Southwest are not carriers. - Humans could not survive without insects. As to the book, it’s a quick interesting read, if a bit disgusting at times (I found the sections on parasitic worms particularly unpleasant). Although the scope is pretty narrow, the book will appeal to those with an interest in nature and evolution, and perhaps horror – because unlike an evil clown who lives in the sewer, these creatures actually exist."
91,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14046991-ben-rogers,4,"Outstanding book. This book will make you rethink nature and insects!Really scary book about terrifying insects. There's worms and beetles and creepy crawlies out there that will make your skin curl - literally. Some of the chapters of this book were really hard to get through - see Brown Recluse Spider or Guinea Worm. Highly recommended if you like nature, as some insects (Bombardier Beetle) are absolutely wonders of nature. This book makes you appreciate nature in a more-intimate and awe-inspiring view, albeit terrifying in the tactics of survival. 4.6/5"

95,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23785775-julia,3,"This has been a book that was long recommended to me via person instead of GR and one that seems to be as present as the creepy crawlies found within it. Every time I was at a museum it has made its presence known, quietly taunting the reader to pick it up and test the pages within.  First, though, a warning this isn't a book for those who are easily squeamish, fear or find insects a trigger to their deepest fears. Although there are some beneficial members found within the author is specifically tracking down the dangerous, the destructive and the painful while some of the introductory stories and their following paragraphs will bring you to attention fast. I truly appreciated the fact that the author introduced the reader to the wrong usage of the term bug and that she was going to wrongly use it as well. Although many would say this isn't that important, to me it shows that the author has truly set out to learn before sharing the information.  I liked the presentation of the information as there was a picture of the topic in question followed on the next page by its name and scientific name. This was followed by a small box to the side with some quick scientific info in it for those who may be wanting to learn more. From there a story from a historical event mainly or even some contemporary events would lead off the exploration of the next few pages. To break-up the reading further the reader is treated with occasional group breaks that further study a specific shared trait such as corpse-eating, ant stings, zombies, etc. The section offers a quick introduction then does a quick and least formal presentation than other main subjects in the book of other would have been overlooked species. What I didn't like was that though the illustrations were detailed and a bit humorous at times like with the one with a saw they weren't in color. It would have been great to see these insects as they look in real life, especially since Amy would mention colors in her entries. My other dislike was the lack of organization even with organization. What I mean by this is that each entry had a tab that explained to the reader what its dark side was in one word but even though given in alphabetical order these designated tabs weren't so the reader was bounced from destructive to dangerous, etc. quite frequently.  In the end this was a good and informative read that insect-lovers may enjoy if they like the dark sides of these animals. Otherwise if you may be the mischievous one you will have enough information at your finger tips to disturb the squemish at your next get-together, especially if if tends to be outside."
96,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5886420-alicia-farmer,1,"If you find DK Eyewitness Books engaging reading, you may like this sensationalist look at insects. I didn't. As an audiobook it was boring, confusing (""Meet the Family"" sections must be sidebars in the book, but just made for weird insertions in the narrative) and poorly written and researched: scorpions sting, not bite; sentences like ""Their range extends as far west as Michigan, Minnesota, North and South Dakota and Oregon and Washington"" just don't make sense. I can't keep going."
97,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71662697-pattee,4,"This easy to read and engaging book is chock full of history and geography of a sample of the most dangerous, destructive, painful, and economically and environmentally debilitating insects. The author is clear to assert her book is a very limited sample of this universe and represents those insects she found most intriguing. 	This book is cleverly illustrated with detailed pencil sketches. The bugs are classified as either Horrible; Painful; Dangerous; Destructive; or Deadly. These headings alone suggest an intriguing read. 	Just a sample of the content includes the Death Watch Beetle – Destructive. This infamous insect provided the dramatic dirge of Edgar Allen Poe’s “The Tell-Tale Heart.” It sits in the rafters of a house, munching at the beams as it tick-ticks the wood, calling to its mate. Its reputation goes back to 18th century when it was labeled as an omen portending death.			A common household nuisance, the Bed Bug, is a tenacious and painful member of the Cimicidae family. Traveling at night, the bed bug gets ahold of its dinner by gently attaching its stylets into the skin as it releases an anticoagulant insuring a good feed. The bites of this night visitor can cause allergic reactions, secondary infections, anemia, swelling, and rashes. The author makes suggestions for besting the bed bug, but also makes it clear that this is no easy task. 	Stewart provides some basic facts about each of the 36 bugs mentioned in her book. Size, family, habitat, and distribution data are provided for each. A list of recommended reading and resources is also provided by the author. She further makes apologies for her misuse of the term “bug.” She bows to the distinctions between a bug and an insect, but then, proceeds to use the word “bug” throughout. If you can abide this misnomer, you should find “Wicked Bugs” a delightful and educational read. "

I’ve been bitten or stung by wasps, bees, fire ants, midges (a generic term for any number of black flies), deer flies, fleas, ticks, mosquitos, and in one unpleasant instance an assassin bug (also known as a kissing bug). However unpleasant these insects have been there’s one thing I can say with certainty after reading Wicked Bugs: The Louse That Conquered Napoleon's Army & Other Diabolical Insects … it could have been much, much worse. Wicked Bugs (a more accurate title would have been Wicked Arthropods) is basically just a laundry list of insects and arachnids that negatively affect humans (either through their bites or stings or through the damage they inflict on crops and trees). Here are a few fun facts:- Mosquitos are the most deadly species on the planet, killing approximately 725,000 people each year through disease transmission (followed distantly by snakes – 50,000 deaths, and dogs – 25,000 deaths).- Arthropods are the most numerous animals on the planet by numbers, number of species and bio-mass.- Assassin bugs can transmit Chagas disease, something I learned through research after being bitten but fortunately the bugs in the U.S. Southwest are not carriers. - Humans could not survive without insects. As to the book, it’s a quick interesting read, if a bit disgusting at times (I found the sections on parasitic worms particularly unpleasant). Although the scope is pretty narrow, the book will appeal to those with an interest in nature and evolution, and perhaps horror – because unlike an evil clown who lives in the sewer, these creatures actually exist."

First, though, a warning this isn't a book for those who are easily squeamish, fear or find insects a trigger to their deepest fears. Although there are some beneficial members found within the author is specifically tracking down the dangerous, the destructive and the painful while some of the introductory stories and their following paragraphs will bring you to attention fast. I truly appreciated the fact that the author introduced the reader to the wrong usage of the term bug and that she was going to wrongly use it as well. Although many would say this isn't that important, to me it shows that the author has truly set out to learn before sharing the information.  I liked the presentation of the information as there was a picture of the topic in question followed on the next page by its name and scientific name. This was followed by a small box to the side with some quick scientific info in it for those who may be wanting to learn more. From there a story from a historical event mainly or even some contemporary events would lead off the exploration of the next few pages. To break-up the reading further the reader is treated with occasional group breaks that further study a specific shared trait such as corpse-eating, ant stings, zombies, etc. The section offers a quick introduction then does a quick and least formal presentation than other main subjects in the book of other would have been overlooked species. What I didn't like was that though the illustrations were detailed and a bit humorous at times like with the one with a saw they weren't in color. It would have been great to see these insects as they look in real life, especially since Amy would mention colors in her entries. My other dislike was the lack of organization even with organization. What I mean by this is that each entry had a tab that explained to the reader what its dark side was in one word but even though given in alphabetical order these designated tabs weren't so the reader was bounced from destructive to dangerous, etc. quite frequently.  In the end this was a good and informative read that insect-lovers may enjoy if they like the dark sides of these animals.

This book is cleverly illustrated with detailed pencil sketches. The bugs are classified as either Horrible; Painful; Dangerous; Destructive; or Deadly.

128,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51634731-karen-d-annecy,5,Loved this book! I listened to it on Audible on the second leg of a long drive. (I listened to Wicked Plants on the first leg.) It kept my interest as the narrator described some pretty terrible things bugs are capable of. I am amazed and a little grossed out! Love the feeling! 
129,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019021-dolly,4,"I recently read Wicked Plants: The Weed That Killed Lincoln's Mother and Other Botanical Atrocities by Amy Stewart and I enjoyed it so much that I was sure to put this book on hold at my local library, too. The two books are identical in format and both serve to educate, entertain and also to make me second-guess my more wild thoughts about world travel. The illustrations and etchings are gorgeous and worthy of any field manual. The entries are short and very interesting to read and it was the perfect book for me to read during my business trip this week. interesting quotes:""Malaria is believed to have killed more people than all wars combined.""

But I'm not even slightly afraid of bees (except the Asian Giant Hornet), and roaches and beetles and moths just don't bother me. (My son and I got to pet a Madagascar Hissing Cockroach at the Oregon Zoo. But I'm not sure I'd hold one…)My weird brother-in-law, I mean one of my weird brothers-in-law, will march right up to a spider web and pet the spider. Am I wrong that that's just, er, wrong? I think not.But yeah, I think bugs are fairly cool. And I'm also glad I live in Northern America, because as Amy Stewart points out in Wicked Bugs: The Louse That Conquered Napolean's Army & Other Diabolical Insects, humans are vastly outnumbered by bugs, and so many of the nasties are Tropical.The subtitle of the book is a bit misleading, as several spiders and worms make the list, but ""diabolical insects"" has such a nice ring to it that I'm inclined to let it pass.Full Review on my blog."
131,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13040394-tomi,1,"I had to force myself to read this book - not because it isn't well-written and informative, because it is. But it was about bugs! Okay, so that's the title of it - shouldn't I have known? Well, I read the entire title - ""The Louse that Conquered Napoleon's Army"" - and expected more history and less bug facts...if you are interested in insects, this is definitely a good read for you. The author is very readable and includes all kinds of information about bugs. But I don't like bugs! I have decided that I am an entomobibliophobic (I don't like reading about bugs). I feel like there is something crawling on me right now. Stewart is a very good writer; it was just the subject matter that bothered me - and the illustrations! Very accurate - I will be seeing them in my dreams...I would recommend this book to someone who is interested in bugs and I think Stewart deserves credit for her work. It just wasn't what I expected, and - did I mention that I don't like bugs? 'Scuse me while I go take a shower in Off..."
132,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1854978-monical,1,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I expected a scientific ""whodunnit"" about insects and disease during Napoleon's invasion of Russia, and instead got a compendium of snippets on various ""bugs"" including spiders, centipedes, millipedes and other non-insect ""bugs"" --deemed ""wicked"" by the author. I spent many happy hours as a kid reading encyclopedia volumes but this book wouldn't have even made the grade. It is not badly written, just incredibly brief and incoherent. The book is very handsome, and has lovely prints of the bugs (although in black and white, so not illustrative for the consumer). Sections of the book are printed in a hard-to-read brown/sepia tone. I find it hard to believe that the Ms. Stewart got this book published, and if her first book, on nasty plants, is similar, I will avoid it like the plague. which also comes from wicked bugs!"
133,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3189888-bob,5,"Besides reading, I build bird houses. Lots of them, often well over a hundred each year. Why? Because I like to, because I find tons (literally) of scrap wood that is perfect for this purpose, and -- especially -- because Birds eat Bugs. By the pound. By the thousand. By using all the skills nature has created for them to be extremely good at this.Bugs are grotesque. I hate 'em. But they are part of the ecological system, they are essential, and they evolved to fill a niche, same as everything else that is living. The illustrations in this book are excellent, the writing is clear and to the point, the facts are straight, and I learned a great deal from this. This book did help me understand insects far more, and made me like insects even less.So I will keep building bird houses."

While some of the misnomers we have about insects/arachnids are put to rest, lesser known and very deadly ones are discussed. One of the most interesting insects I learned about was a caterpillar that if touched, will kill a person by mass organ shut-down. More than anything, this book taught me to be cautious about my own back yard, respecting the ""bugs"" that live there, and to never under any circumstances go to Brazil: Yikes, they have a lot of scary/dangerous critters!

Even imagining them enlarging to the size of a small dog, (say, a yorkie), creeps me out! Not to say I'm scared of bugs, not at all. But I do respect them. However, after reading this, I think I'll be a little more careful about what I pick up...The only thing I didn't like, (why there's four stars instead of five), is the fact it just ended! What the heck. No closing chapter? No summary? Not even a concluding sentence. No me gusta.But other than that, very good! And interesting. And creepy."

It's a little too overly dramatisized, a little too sparse on details, a little too focused on being shocking, just a little too much of things it could use a little less of.

The woman had snorted cocaine shortly before she died, and the maggots near her nose and mouth ingested some of the cocaine and grew huge from overeating."

Very informative, alarming and thrilling all the way. With amazing illustrations by Briony Morrow-Cribbs. Warmly recommend it to anyone with a touch of bug addiction."
180,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3," As someone who has spent quite a bit of time outdoors, I’ve had my share of insect encounters. I’ve been bitten or stung by wasps, bees, fire ants, midges (a generic term for any number of black flies), deer flies, fleas, ticks, mosquitos, and in one unpleasant instance an assassin bug (also known as a kissing bug). However unpleasant these insects have been there’s one thing I can say with certainty after reading Wicked Bugs: The Louse That Conquered Napoleon's Army & Other Diabolical Insects … it could have been much, much worse. Wicked Bugs (a more accurate title would have been Wicked Arthropods) is basically just a laundry list of insects and arachnids that negatively affect humans (either through their bites or stings or through the damage they inflict on crops and trees). Here are a few fun facts:- Mosquitos are the most deadly species on the planet, killing approximately 725,000 people each year through disease transmission (followed distantly by snakes – 50,000 deaths, and dogs – 25,000 deaths).- Arthropods are the most numerous animals on the planet by numbers, number of species and bio-mass.- Assassin bugs can transmit Chagas disease, something I learned through research after being bitten but fortunately the bugs in the U.S. Southwest are not carriers. - Humans could not survive without insects. As to the book, it’s a quick interesting read, if a bit disgusting at times (I found the sections on parasitic worms particularly unpleasant). Although the scope is pretty narrow, the book will appeal to those with an interest in nature and evolution, and perhaps horror – because unlike an evil clown who lives in the sewer, these creatures actually exist."
181,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14046991-ben-rogers,4,"Outstanding book. This book will make you rethink nature and insects!Really scary book about terrifying insects. There's worms and beetles and creepy crawlies out there that will make your skin curl - literally. Some of the chapters of this book were really hard to get through - see Brown Recluse Spider or Guinea Worm. Highly recommended if you like nature, as some insects (Bombardier Beetle) are absolutely wonders of nature. This book makes you appreciate nature in a more-intimate and awe-inspiring view, albeit terrifying in the tactics of survival. 4.6/5"

185,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23785775-julia,3,"This has been a book that was long recommended to me via person instead of GR and one that seems to be as present as the creepy crawlies found within it. Every time I was at a museum it has made its presence known, quietly taunting the reader to pick it up and test the pages within.  First, though, a warning this isn't a book for those who are easily squeamish, fear or find insects a trigger to their deepest fears. Although there are some beneficial members found within the author is specifically tracking down the dangerous, the destructive and the painful while some of the introductory stories and their following paragraphs will bring you to attention fast. I truly appreciated the fact that the author introduced the reader to the wrong usage of the term bug and that she was going to wrongly use it as well. Although many would say this isn't that important, to me it shows that the author has truly set out to learn before sharing the information.  I liked the presentation of the information as there was a picture of the topic in question followed on the next page by its name and scientific name. This was followed by a small box to the side with some quick scientific info in it for those who may be wanting to learn more. From there a story from a historical event mainly or even some contemporary events would lead off the exploration of the next few pages. To break-up the reading further the reader is treated with occasional group breaks that further study a specific shared trait such as corpse-eating, ant stings, zombies, etc. The section offers a quick introduction then does a quick and least formal presentation than other main subjects in the book of other would have been overlooked species. What I didn't like was that though the illustrations were detailed and a bit humorous at times like with the one with a saw they weren't in color. It would have been great to see these insects as they look in real life, especially since Amy would mention colors in her entries. My other dislike was the lack of organization even with organization. What I mean by this is that each entry had a tab that explained to the reader what its dark side was in one word but even though given in alphabetical order these designated tabs weren't so the reader was bounced from destructive to dangerous, etc. quite frequently.  In the end this was a good and informative read that insect-lovers may enjoy if they like the dark sides of these animals. Otherwise if you may be the mischievous one you will have enough information at your finger tips to disturb the squemish at your next get-together, especially if if tends to be outside."
186,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5886420-alicia-farmer,1,"If you find DK Eyewitness Books engaging reading, you may like this sensationalist look at insects. I didn't. As an audiobook it was boring, confusing (""Meet the Family"" sections must be sidebars in the book, but just made for weird insertions in the narrative) and poorly written and researched: scorpions sting, not bite; sentences like ""Their range extends as far west as Michigan, Minnesota, North and South Dakota and Oregon and Washington"" just don't make sense. I can't keep going."
187,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71662697-pattee,4,"This easy to read and engaging book is chock full of history and geography of a sample of the most dangerous, destructive, painful, and economically and environmentally debilitating insects. The author is clear to assert her book is a very limited sample of this universe and represents those insects she found most intriguing. 	This book is cleverly illustrated with detailed pencil sketches. The bugs are classified as either Horrible; Painful; Dangerous; Destructive; or Deadly. These headings alone suggest an intriguing read. 	Just a sample of the content includes the Death Watch Beetle – Destructive. This infamous insect provided the dramatic dirge of Edgar Allen Poe’s “The Tell-Tale Heart.” It sits in the rafters of a house, munching at the beams as it tick-ticks the wood, calling to its mate. Its reputation goes back to 18th century when it was labeled as an omen portending death.			A common household nuisance, the Bed Bug, is a tenacious and painful member of the Cimicidae family. Traveling at night, the bed bug gets ahold of its dinner by gently attaching its stylets into the skin as it releases an anticoagulant insuring a good feed. The bites of this night visitor can cause allergic reactions, secondary infections, anemia, swelling, and rashes. The author makes suggestions for besting the bed bug, but also makes it clear that this is no easy task. 	Stewart provides some basic facts about each of the 36 bugs mentioned in her book. Size, family, habitat, and distribution data are provided for each. A list of recommended reading and resources is also provided by the author. She further makes apologies for her misuse of the term “bug.” She bows to the distinctions between a bug and an insect, but then, proceeds to use the word “bug” throughout. If you can abide this misnomer, you should find “Wicked Bugs” a delightful and educational read. "

I’ve been bitten or stung by wasps, bees, fire ants, midges (a generic term for any number of black flies), deer flies, fleas, ticks, mosquitos, and in one unpleasant instance an assassin bug (also known as a kissing bug). However unpleasant these insects have been there’s one thing I can say with certainty after reading Wicked Bugs: The Louse That Conquered Napoleon's Army & Other Diabolical Insects … it could have been much, much worse. Wicked Bugs (a more accurate title would have been Wicked Arthropods) is basically just a laundry list of insects and arachnids that negatively affect humans (either through their bites or stings or through the damage they inflict on crops and trees). Here are a few fun facts:- Mosquitos are the most deadly species on the planet, killing approximately 725,000 people each year through disease transmission (followed distantly by snakes – 50,000 deaths, and dogs – 25,000 deaths).- Arthropods are the most numerous animals on the planet by numbers, number of species and bio-mass.- Assassin bugs can transmit Chagas disease, something I learned through research after being bitten but fortunately the bugs in the U.S. Southwest are not carriers. - Humans could not survive without insects. As to the book, it’s a quick interesting read, if a bit disgusting at times (I found the sections on parasitic worms particularly unpleasant). Although the scope is pretty narrow, the book will appeal to those with an interest in nature and evolution, and perhaps horror – because unlike an evil clown who lives in the sewer, these creatures actually exist."

215,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23785775-julia,3,"This has been a book that was long recommended to me via person instead of GR and one that seems to be as present as the creepy crawlies found within it. Every time I was at a museum it has made its presence known, quietly taunting the reader to pick it up and test the pages within.  First, though, a warning this isn't a book for those who are easily squeamish, fear or find insects a trigger to their deepest fears. Although there are some beneficial members found within the author is specifically tracking down the dangerous, the destructive and the painful while some of the introductory stories and their following paragraphs will bring you to attention fast. I truly appreciated the fact that the author introduced the reader to the wrong usage of the term bug and that she was going to wrongly use it as well. Although many would say this isn't that important, to me it shows that the author has truly set out to learn before sharing the information.  I liked the presentation of the information as there was a picture of the topic in question followed on the next page by its name and scientific name. This was followed by a small box to the side with some quick scientific info in it for those who may be wanting to learn more. From there a story from a historical event mainly or even some contemporary events would lead off the exploration of the next few pages. To break-up the reading further the reader is treated with occasional group breaks that further study a specific shared trait such as corpse-eating, ant stings, zombies, etc. The section offers a quick introduction then does a quick and least formal presentation than other main subjects in the book of other would have been overlooked species. What I didn't like was that though the illustrations were detailed and a bit humorous at times like with the one with a saw they weren't in color. It would have been great to see these insects as they look in real life, especially since Amy would mention colors in her entries. My other dislike was the lack of organization even with organization. What I mean by this is that each entry had a tab that explained to the reader what its dark side was in one word but even though given in alphabetical order these designated tabs weren't so the reader was bounced from destructive to dangerous, etc. quite frequently.  In the end this was a good and informative read that insect-lovers may enjoy if they like the dark sides of these animals. Otherwise if you may be the mischievous one you will have enough information at your finger tips to disturb the squemish at your next get-together, especially if if tends to be outside."

As an audiobook it was boring, confusing (""Meet the Family"" sections must be sidebars in the book, but just made for weird insertions in the narrative) and poorly written and researched: scorpions sting, not bite; sentences like ""Their range extends as far west as Michigan, Minnesota, North and South Dakota and Oregon and Washington"" just don't make sense. I can't keep going."
217,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71662697-pattee,4,"This easy to read and engaging book is chock full of history and geography of a sample of the most dangerous, destructive, painful, and economically and environmentally debilitating insects. The author is clear to assert her book is a very limited sample of this universe and represents those insects she found most intriguing. 	This book is cleverly illustrated with detailed pencil sketches. The bugs are classified as either Horrible; Painful; Dangerous; Destructive; or Deadly. These headings alone suggest an intriguing read. 	Just a sample of the content includes the Death Watch Beetle – Destructive. This infamous insect provided the dramatic dirge of Edgar Allen Poe’s “The Tell-Tale Heart.” It sits in the rafters of a house, munching at the beams as it tick-ticks the wood, calling to its mate. Its reputation goes back to 18th century when it was labeled as an omen portending death.			A common household nuisance, the Bed Bug, is a tenacious and painful member of the Cimicidae family. Traveling at night, the bed bug gets ahold of its dinner by gently attaching its stylets into the skin as it releases an anticoagulant insuring a good feed. The bites of this night visitor can cause allergic reactions, secondary infections, anemia, swelling, and rashes. The author makes suggestions for besting the bed bug, but also makes it clear that this is no easy task. 	Stewart provides some basic facts about each of the 36 bugs mentioned in her book. Size, family, habitat, and distribution data are provided for each. A list of recommended reading and resources is also provided by the author. She further makes apologies for her misuse of the term “bug.” She bows to the distinctions between a bug and an insect, but then, proceeds to use the word “bug” throughout. If you can abide this misnomer, you should find “Wicked Bugs” a delightful and educational read. "
218,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51634731-karen-d-annecy,5,Loved this book! I listened to it on Audible on the second leg of a long drive. (I listened to Wicked Plants on the first leg.)

219,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019021-dolly,4,"I recently read Wicked Plants: The Weed That Killed Lincoln's Mother and Other Botanical Atrocities by Amy Stewart and I enjoyed it so much that I was sure to put this book on hold at my local library, too. The two books are identical in format and both serve to educate, entertain and also to make me second-guess my more wild thoughts about world travel. The illustrations and etchings are gorgeous and worthy of any field manual. The entries are short and very interesting to read and it was the perfect book for me to read during my business trip this week. interesting quotes:""Malaria is believed to have killed more people than all wars combined.""

But I'm not even slightly afraid of bees (except the Asian Giant Hornet), and roaches and beetles and moths just don't bother me. (My son and I got to pet a Madagascar Hissing Cockroach at the Oregon Zoo. But I'm not sure I'd hold one…)My weird brother-in-law, I mean one of my weird brothers-in-law, will march right up to a spider web and pet the spider. Am I wrong that that's just, er, wrong? I think not.But yeah, I think bugs are fairly cool. And I'm also glad I live in Northern America, because as Amy Stewart points out in Wicked Bugs: The Louse That Conquered Napolean's Army & Other Diabolical Insects, humans are vastly outnumbered by bugs, and so many of the nasties are Tropical.The subtitle of the book is a bit misleading, as several spiders and worms make the list, but ""diabolical insects"" has such a nice ring to it that I'm inclined to let it pass.Full Review on my blog."
221,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13040394-tomi,1,"I had to force myself to read this book - not because it isn't well-written and informative, because it is. But it was about bugs! Okay, so that's the title of it - shouldn't I have known? Well, I read the entire title - ""The Louse that Conquered Napoleon's Army"" - and expected more history and less bug facts...if you are interested in insects, this is definitely a good read for you. The author is very readable and includes all kinds of information about bugs. But I don't like bugs! I have decided that I am an entomobibliophobic (I don't like reading about bugs). I feel like there is something crawling on me right now. Stewart is a very good writer; it was just the subject matter that bothered me - and the illustrations! Very accurate - I will be seeing them in my dreams...I would recommend this book to someone who is interested in bugs and I think Stewart deserves credit for her work. It just wasn't what I expected, and - did I mention that I don't like bugs? 'Scuse me while I go take a shower in Off..."
222,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1854978-monical,1,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I expected a scientific ""whodunnit"" about insects and disease during Napoleon's invasion of Russia, and instead got a compendium of snippets on various ""bugs"" including spiders, centipedes, millipedes and other non-insect ""bugs"" --deemed ""wicked"" by the author. I spent many happy hours as a kid reading encyclopedia volumes but this book wouldn't have even made the grade. It is not badly written, just incredibly brief and incoherent. The book is very handsome, and has lovely prints of the bugs (although in black and white, so not illustrative for the consumer). Sections of the book are printed in a hard-to-read brown/sepia tone. I find it hard to believe that the Ms. Stewart got this book published, and if her first book, on nasty plants, is similar, I will avoid it like the plague. which also comes from wicked bugs!"
223,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3189888-bob,5,"Besides reading, I build bird houses. Lots of them, often well over a hundred each year. Why? Because I like to, because I find tons (literally) of scrap wood that is perfect for this purpose, and -- especially -- because Birds eat Bugs. By the pound. By the thousand. By using all the skills nature has created for them to be extremely good at this.Bugs are grotesque. I hate 'em. But they are part of the ecological system, they are essential, and they evolved to fill a niche, same as everything else that is living. The illustrations in this book are excellent, the writing is clear and to the point, the facts are straight, and I learned a great deal from this. This book did help me understand insects far more, and made me like insects even less.So I will keep building bird houses."

While some of the misnomers we have about insects/arachnids are put to rest, lesser known and very deadly ones are discussed. One of the most interesting insects I learned about was a caterpillar that if touched, will kill a person by mass organ shut-down. More than anything, this book taught me to be cautious about my own back yard, respecting the ""bugs"" that live there, and to never under any circumstances go to Brazil: Yikes, they have a lot of scary/dangerous critters!

Even imagining them enlarging to the size of a small dog, (say, a yorkie), creeps me out! Not to say I'm scared of bugs, not at all. But I do respect them. However, after reading this, I think I'll be a little more careful about what I pick up...The only thing I didn't like, (why there's four stars instead of five), is the fact it just ended! What the heck. No closing chapter? No summary? Not even a concluding sentence. No me gusta.But other than that, very good! And interesting. And creepy."

It's a little too overly dramatisized, a little too sparse on details, a little too focused on being shocking, just a little too much of things it could use a little less of.

Traveling at night, the bed bug gets ahold of its dinner by gently attaching its stylets into the skin as it releases an anticoagulant insuring a good feed.

Very informative, alarming and thrilling all the way. With amazing illustrations by Briony Morrow-Cribbs. Warmly recommend it to anyone with a touch of bug addiction."
270,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3," As someone who has spent quite a bit of time outdoors, I’ve had my share of insect encounters. I’ve been bitten or stung by wasps, bees, fire ants, midges (a generic term for any number of black flies), deer flies, fleas, ticks, mosquitos, and in one unpleasant instance an assassin bug (also known as a kissing bug). However unpleasant these insects have been there’s one thing I can say with certainty after reading Wicked Bugs: The Louse That Conquered Napoleon's Army & Other Diabolical Insects … it could have been much, much worse. Wicked Bugs (a more accurate title would have been Wicked Arthropods) is basically just a laundry list of insects and arachnids that negatively affect humans (either through their bites or stings or through the damage they inflict on crops and trees). Here are a few fun facts:- Mosquitos are the most deadly species on the planet, killing approximately 725,000 people each year through disease transmission (followed distantly by snakes – 50,000 deaths, and dogs – 25,000 deaths).- Arthropods are the most numerous animals on the planet by numbers, number of species and bio-mass.- Assassin bugs can transmit Chagas disease, something I learned through research after being bitten but fortunately the bugs in the U.S. Southwest are not carriers. - Humans could not survive without insects. As to the book, it’s a quick interesting read, if a bit disgusting at times (I found the sections on parasitic worms particularly unpleasant). Although the scope is pretty narrow, the book will appeal to those with an interest in nature and evolution, and perhaps horror – because unlike an evil clown who lives in the sewer, these creatures actually exist."

There's worms and beetles and creepy crawlies out there that will make your skin curl - literally. Some of the chapters of this book were really hard to get through - see Brown Recluse Spider or Guinea Worm. Highly recommended if you like nature, as some insects (Bombardier Beetle) are absolutely wonders of nature. This book makes you appreciate nature in a more-intimate and awe-inspiring view, albeit terrifying in the tactics of survival. 4.6/5"

275,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23785775-julia,3,"This has been a book that was long recommended to me via person instead of GR and one that seems to be as present as the creepy crawlies found within it. Every time I was at a museum it has made its presence known, quietly taunting the reader to pick it up and test the pages within.  First, though, a warning this isn't a book for those who are easily squeamish, fear or find insects a trigger to their deepest fears. Although there are some beneficial members found within the author is specifically tracking down the dangerous, the destructive and the painful while some of the introductory stories and their following paragraphs will bring you to attention fast. I truly appreciated the fact that the author introduced the reader to the wrong usage of the term bug and that she was going to wrongly use it as well. Although many would say this isn't that important, to me it shows that the author has truly set out to learn before sharing the information.  I liked the presentation of the information as there was a picture of the topic in question followed on the next page by its name and scientific name. This was followed by a small box to the side with some quick scientific info in it for those who may be wanting to learn more. From there a story from a historical event mainly or even some contemporary events would lead off the exploration of the next few pages. To break-up the reading further the reader is treated with occasional group breaks that further study a specific shared trait such as corpse-eating, ant stings, zombies, etc. The section offers a quick introduction then does a quick and least formal presentation than other main subjects in the book of other would have been overlooked species. What I didn't like was that though the illustrations were detailed and a bit humorous at times like with the one with a saw they weren't in color. It would have been great to see these insects as they look in real life, especially since Amy would mention colors in her entries. My other dislike was the lack of organization even with organization. What I mean by this is that each entry had a tab that explained to the reader what its dark side was in one word but even though given in alphabetical order these designated tabs weren't so the reader was bounced from destructive to dangerous, etc. quite frequently.  In the end this was a good and informative read that insect-lovers may enjoy if they like the dark sides of these animals. Otherwise if you may be the mischievous one you will have enough information at your finger tips to disturb the squemish at your next get-together, especially if if tends to be outside."

It's a little too overly dramatisized, a little too sparse on details, a little too focused on being shocking, just a little too much of things it could use a little less of. There are far better books on this subject, but for a quick read without engaging your brain, it's okay. Meh."

I made the mistake of reading this with The Poisonwood Bible and I was strongly considering living in a plastic bubble. A fun, if a bit scary read.I also didn't know that European earthworms were an invasive and destructive species."

Lots of stuff you shouldn't discuss over dinner, such as: Recently a medical examiner had difficulty estimating a time of death because some of the maggots in the body looked like they were two days old and others looked like they were three weeks old. The woman had snorted cocaine shortly before she died, and the maggots near her nose and mouth ingested some of the cocaine and grew huge from overeating."

For me the most interesting was the common earthworm which is reeking havoc on the forests on northern Minnesota. Where I grew up in Minnesota earthworms were common and people viewed them as beneficial, but in the wrong place they can be quite destructive. "

I'm never more grateful to live in the non-tropics in a first world country so I'm less likely to have to worry about a lot of these. Not all of them though. I may start walking around in a bubble suit, but it was a fantastic read."

Amy Stewart vividly describes what many of the world's pests do, making my DH insist that I stop reading sections out loud to him as they were really too disgusting. But if you like nature, or any interest in entomology, this book is a fascinating, entertaining read."
293,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6192686-valerie,5,"I simply adore Amy Stewert as an author. She writes fascinating books that you want to keep and reference again in the future. If you are afraid of bugs, you might want to skip this one - it is not for the faint of heart. However, if you are fascinated by nature, and wish to learn more about how bugs have helped shaped history, I highly recommend this book!"
294,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7408040-mark-hartzer,4,I picked this up for 2 reasons: 1.) I was intrigued by the title because I generally find vermin to be an interesting topic; and 2.) The author has the same name as the charming and witty woman who introduced me to Goodreads. Thanks Amy!The illustrations are quite good as well. A good read if you've got a strong stomach. 
295,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3241411-athena-rehorst,5,"If you are at all interested in bugs, this book is fantastic. If you're bug phobic, don't read it....it will definitely make you paranoid. However, did you know there have been NO confirmed cases on brown recluse bites in colorado? That is reassuring. :) "
296,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376410-lisa,4,"This was a very interesting read, but I had a hard time finishing it because I would start itching and imagining all of these bugs crawling on me and had to stop. Do not read this if you are afraid of insects!"
297,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/182586-ashley,4,"Ew, gross, ick, I hate creepy crawlies! This didn't help me not hate bugs. But at least it was funny! And the pictures were very cool. At the very least I have an appreciation for how diabolical these lil buggers can be!"
298,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76115-heather,4,"That was icky but awesome. I'm itchy all over....fascinating stuff though. I love how many insects there are where the female eats the male during or after mating. DURING Y'ALL. Hilarious. And the males are like ""cool, cool, whatever..."""
299,1565129601,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60468364-hildegunn,5,"A fantastic tour of painful, deadly, horrible, dangerous and destructive bugs. Chock full of examples from history. Very informative, alarming and thrilling all the way. With amazing illustrations by Briony Morrow-Cribbs. Warmly recommend it to anyone with a touch of bug addiction."
