0,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12830647-saman,3,"As the name suggests the book tries to tell a non-mathematician but interested person, what is Math about, what is it's goals, how mathematicians think and some techniques and results of modern and classical Math.But for someone who is not very familiar with mathematics, it won't make any sense, for such a person this book can be hard, confusing and boring. Math was never an easy thing to understand.Actually I think the book can be very enlightening for math undergraduate students, especially for math teachers.The book is short, warm, rigid and has good points about how to do Math."
1,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11953263-dimitrios,5," Absolutely great. Let me explain. Firstly about the level of the book. It is elementary but not basic. There are some concepts and especially some proofs that require some focus to grasp. The amount of equations is minimal, but still some maturity is required to fully appreciate the contents. I would say that the best audience of the book is a beginning undergrad in a stem program, a motivated and mature high school students with a keen interest on maths or a layman with some maturity of mathematical concepts. I was searching for books to recommend to my students and after finishing that i would highly recommend it. What the book does, is to introduce us to the world of mathematics, what it isall about and how mathematicians approach different ideas and the way Timothy does that is by explaining an array of different ideas from model building, basic arithmetic, formal proofs, complex numbers, number theory, coordinate systems, infinity, higher dimensions, non Eucledian geometries, approximations etc. In the final chapter there are some comments on common misconceptions about mathematics. There are so many gems in every chapter and the way they are connected makes you understand why mathematicians treat them in that way. From the geometric(!) proof of the irrationality of φ, to ''visualizing'' objects in higher dimensions and being able to grasp some of their properties, to how the curvature of different geometries affects the shortest path. The reason of 5 stars is all of the above plus finally understanding why airplanes tend to move towards the poles (had to finish my bachelor in physics without ever anyone touching that concept...) plus the 2 most basic ideas of the book, that the meaning of a mathematical object is the rules it obeys and how it is related to other objects and how to extend familiar ideas to unfamiliar territory. These two concepts and how the are used in what Timothy calls the ''abstract method'' are the spine of the book and worth buying just for those two only. True gem."
2,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26803626-nilesh-trivedi,4,"Careful with that title. This book is NOT a tour of current body of mathematical knowledge but instead talks about the way math is done. It talks about abstraction, generalization, proofs with examples of arithmetic, infinity, higher dimensional geometry etc. Some delightful examples are given which I hadn't come across.I would have loved to read this in school to put the textbook content in the proper context."
3,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29339-meg,2,"I generally find the ""A Very Short Introduction"" series to actually be quite good, with most of the volumes accomplishing exactly what they intend to by giving a good overall sense of a field of inquiry and its methods, or of the important elements of a given topic. Unfortunately, this volume did none of this very well. Many of the examples used to introduce to the reader to mathematical thinking are explained more clearly (and in a more engaging fashion) in Fermat's Enigma by Simon Singh. In general, the latter is probably a better overall introduction to the world of mathematics (both the subject as well as the academic practice) than this Very Short Introduction managed to be."
4,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,2,"Long story short, I didn't really like this one. Gowers isn't a bad writer, but when all is said and done, this 'Introducution' is rather boring. It doesn't capture the imagination, and as far as math books are concerned, this quite simply isn't allowed. Don't bother with this one; if you want an engaging an accessible overview of mathematics, go pick up the far more interesting 'Language of Mathematics,' by Kieth Devlin."
5,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1836306-isk,1,"Surprisingly disappointing. I can't imagine who this book is written for. Nothing new to people who knew anything about math, and not terribly interesting to people trying to learn something about math."
6,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42732326-bijay-gurung,3,"Has the potential to change how we look at Mathematics, or at least us non-mathematicians, especially in regard to the use of the abstract method and fundamental concepts such as: ""A mathematical object is what it does."" Wish I had read it sooner."
7,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43451865-bishnu-bhatta-buttowski,3,"This book has vividly elaborated how the complex set of theorems or proofs arise from the basics axioms. The writer starts from the evolution of number system and how the modelling and abstracting plays vital role in developing certain theorem.Concepts of limits and infinity are great. The most impressive thing that the book tells you about is of the concept of infinity. Texts on these book would certainly clear up the concept of infinity in reader's mind. This approach is made by explaining the square root of two(2).Moreover, the text of this evolves from the simple Euclidean geometry, leading up to spherical geometry and then hyperbolic. The author has beautifully explained why latter types are needed. Finally, the author talks about the importance of estimates and approximation and their importance in different fields like A Prime Number theory, Theoretical computer science and several others.Thing I liked about this book was, superficially, the writers has vividly explained topics. But when he goes little deeper like the concepts of hyperbolic geometry, I found the explanation little hard to comprehend.Nevertheless this OK read!"
8,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24299015-jdr,0,"As an undergraduate mathematics student finishing up Calculus, this timely entry in ""Very Short Introduction"" catalog refined my knowledge of the essential concepts that any mathematician oughta be ready to be equipped with. Gowers reviews proofs, the type of mentality and abstraction necessary in the course of mathematics studies, and a short tour through subjects like limits and the idea of infinity among other things. Personally, I liked it. It is a good, basic primer and I am interested in reading the other texts that Gowers added in the ""Further Reading"" section such as  Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times . "
9,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8934567-c,5,"I enjoyed this book so much, and because of its length, I finished it in one ""seating"" :-) The most important idea that I learned is to think about what a mathematical object DOES rather what it IS. This is the way mathematicians learn math, do math, and teach math. I plan to do the same in my mathematical endeavors."
10,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7221162-sch,3,"Good, not great. I had high hopes for Chapter 2 (on abstraction), but it is too difficult for me. I'm more interested in math than I was a student. I'll need to become a student again if I want to go any further in the subject."
11,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1017541-jessica,4,"I like the Very Short Introductions, even though I knew most of this stuff anyway."
12,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14643850-sundararaman-r,4,"Pretty good considering the job it takes upon itself - to convey not the process of mathematical computation, but the mindset behind it and the type of thinking that goes into defining it. It answers several conceptual/philosophical questions I've had over the years, in trying to learn maths. This book can be a great aid to a student curious about the inner workings of maths, even if he/she might have to work on understanding it slowly over several weeks, chapter by chapter, even sentence by sentence in the latter half of the book. However: though much of the difficulty in the book comes from the subject matter itself, the book misses many opportunities where a single added sentence or a small restructuring of prose would have made the topic at hand quite easier to understand. The book comes so close to 5-star perfection, but misses out mainly because of this. The FAQ section of the book is unnecessarily wordy, of questionable utility, and takes up valuable space that could have been used to better the educational value of the other chapters. Another rather troubling issue with the book is that it goes out of its way to credit European mathematicians - whether ancient or relatively recent - for their discoveries and ideas, whereas mathematicians from virtually all the rest of the world are ignored. Even when ideas originally from a non-European source are mentioned, there's no attempt made to place it in its historical context, no attribution given, the way the book does for Greek or other European sources. Even assuming this is due to ignorance rather than malice, it should have been seen and rectified at some stage in the publishing process - an Oxford University Press publication should be able to do better than this in the 21st century. "
13,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7741758-stefan,4,"An excellent short tour of some key areas of math. This is not an ""introduction"" in terms of being a book for beginners but an introduction to a key component of the mindset of mathematics - the abstract method. Gowers leads the reader through several subtopics in math all with an eye to explaining the power of abstraction. The abstraction of math is covered in 3-key senses of the word ""abstract."" Firstly mathematical objects are abstract in that they are not physically observable. Secondly they are often derived by ""abstracting"" properties of interest from real-world objects analogically. Third, and most important for the treatment here is that the properties, thus abstracted can be used without regard to any particular assignment of a ""real-world meaning."" Thus they have a generality that is the basis of the power of mathematics."
14,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54890518-anton-mies,4,"Red it and picked up a few things which I could reason with my ""layman"" math. Another aspect, the author even if not intentionally passes on the beauty of the math or at least the perspective of mathematicians who are mesmerized by math's beauty. (Really discreet) As previous reviews have described the book deals with the concepts and the reasoning of concepts and proof derivation. It is pretty scarce on equations rather full of well written but still hard to understand concepts, perhaps more numbers would be even better for the understanding. This book requires a bit more understanding and if you are not too familiar with the topic of the book be ready to either leave it as it is, or surf the wide's of the internet for further explanation."
15,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1118900-shuby-deshpande,5,"The book places a refreshing emphasis on abstraction in mathematics. As it would do injustice to cover a large array of mathematical topics within such a concise book, the author instead chooses to convey the basic principles of mathematical thought. This is done through techniques such as logically introducing Euclidean geometry axioms, and then logically deriving their subsequent falsification within the regimes of hyperbolic/spherical geometry (namely the axiom for parallel lines). This among many other examples introduces readers to different paradigms of thought and reinforces the principle of thinking abstractly. In summary, I'd highly recommend this book to anyone interested in a brief glimpse into the beauty of higher mathematics."
16,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18439207-venkatesh-prasad,4,"The book provides a brisk sampling of few topics in math -- models, proofs, numbers/abstractions, limits/infinity, dimension, geometry, and approximation. I think the earlier chapters on models, proofs, and numbers as they are easy to grasp. Later chapters are interesting but more abstract as well; hence, they will need more effort to appreciate. All said, as the title says, the book provides a short introduction to Math. I think it is a perfect gift for high school students who are inclined towards Math but are unsure of what to explore in Math. "
17,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47658110-christian,4,"This book is meant as an introduction to mathematics in the sense of what mathematical thinking is, what kinds of questions mathematics asks, and why they are motivated. The target audience seems to be laymen (e.g. if you want to convey to your family/friends what it is that you do). I think it does a good job at that, though it is hard to tell from the inside whether it succeeds. It has a number of fun examples of math problems that made it a reasonable read if one is looking for some nonrigorous mathematics reading."
18,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8709909-natasha-holme,4,"Impressively clear and enjoyable, given the potentially dry subject matter. Fourth science book I've read in this series, and this one stood out. The author has a passion for his subject and is able to educate, illuminate, and entertain effortlessly.There were parts, naturally, that I did not understand. But the information was constructed in such a way that this did not ever hinder understanding of subsequent information.I felt that the author cared about his remit, his subject, and his reader's experience."
19,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56383613-anna,5,"This book was very different to a lot of mathematics books I’ve read in a positive way. Many maths books focus on the history of mathematics whereas this book focused on seemingly basic mathematical concepts in more depth. I can imagine the content of this book would be more useful in university interviews because it can be easily applied to various aspects of maths. I’d definitely recommend this book as wider reading or if you’re generally interested in maths. Also, it is “short”, so it’s an easy read if you’re short on time!"
20,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78272293-steven-chew,3,"Overall, it is acceptable. But it's probably too dry for like how the author would put it. Also makes me realise what i have missed as a young student. I was proud that i was good in math, not Einstein good but still. Mathematics is a vast topics. This book in not about teaching you how to do maths but teach you how to look at things mathematically (which is not arithmetic and algebra). The author tried hard to teach reader about thinking abstractly, but the language is not effective as i would like. But it's still worth reading. "
21,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87565665-joshua-snyder,3,"This was an interesting and concise introduction to mathematics, which would be accessible to a wide audience of readers. I found it interesting, but thought it could have gone into some more mathematical details, but I suppose this is to be expected of a very short introduction. Overall a good read, definitely worth it for a GCSE or A-Level student wanting to develop their interest in mathematics."
22,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69938494-lana-street,4,"I had never read a book on mathematics before, however I have been studying it for a few years and so decided to read more into the philosophy behind mathematics. It was an amazing book to start with and once I had start it I couldn't put it down. A couple of the sections were a bit hard to wrap my head around and took me a bit longer to understand, however on the whole it was easy to understand and very easy and intriguing to read."
23,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14734538-roberto-rigolin-f-lopes,3,"Oh, Mathematics! Your elegant but sometimes tricky curves looked very sexy to many smart people over the centuries. As a result, you are now a magnificent human endeavour with so many ramifications and still growing fast. Here we have a quick look at your foundations starting with models, passing through proofs and geometry, to end up on estimations/approximations. What a beauty."
24,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/215934-harriet-m,4,"A book that pokes at the basic mathematical concepts most of us take for granted and looks at the assumptions behind them. I found most interesting -- and helpful -- the discussion of modeling and the case the author makes for abstract math. It merits reading slowly with time to digest, but it's engagingly written and very accessible to nonmathematicians."
25,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12008465-justin,5,"This is a fast introduction to quite a broad range of topics in mathematics. I strongly recommend this for anyone who is interested in learning more about mathematics as a whole. It is not necessarily a book that's going to help you with your school or university-level work, but it could inspire you to study more."

28,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16273516-ryan-hoyle,5,This is a particularly challenging book in the series and forced me to think hard. I found it enlightening to finally get some idea of what mathematics actually is and why people find it interesting.

54,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1538729-aaron,5,"No contest: the best Mathematics book I've read. It was a welcome introduction to the Very Short Introduction series. This book was a real masterpiece, and perhaps set the bar a little too high; the other VSI books I've read so far are okay, but not quite on this level (each book done by different authors, each an expert in the topic). Timothy Gowers proves himself a master of two distinct but related topics: 1) Mathematics; and 2) The kinds of things that people don't understand about mathematics, or get easily confused by, or just wanted to know more about and don't know where to start, or tried to learn about on their own from a hodgepodge of sources and authorities, and were perhaps one book away from cursing any interest in math forevermore. Phew. Well, hopefully it wasn't quite all that dramatic. But so many, many people get anxious about math, sometimes due to a thousand frustrations and embarrassments from school days, but also for fear that not making some hidden connection means that deep down you're really a dunce. Well, have no fear! Gowers starts small and takes it slow. He doesn't take the typical text book approach of half-baked explanations (those very explanations assuming you already understand) followed by problem sets. Instead, he offers alternative examples and ideas - alternative from anything I was every taught. It's at once shocking and a little embarrassing to think, ""Oh really, that's all that is? How did that trip me up for so long?"" There's no substitute for a good teacher. I should also add that for a math book, it is deliberately very light on the numbers. You won't have to count or calculate anything to follow along. Also, unlike most math books, each chapter was written as a stand-alone lesson, so feel free to skip the parts you struggle with, or just have no interest in. Hopefully that alleviates some pressure for readers who fear they'll fail the quest at chapter 4. So there. If you're anything like me, and you know there's so much you just don't get, but have faith enough in your thinking that you can get it, then this one's for you. Good luck! "
55,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4331887-steve,5,"It's well known that some concepts in mathematics can be utterly mind-bending - concepts such as curved space, higher dimensional geometry, infinity, and more besides. To be able to work with any of these, you often need to let go of the urge to visualise something and instead settle for merely conceptualising it. You need, in other words, to feel comfortable thinking in a thoroughly abstract way. This book is an introduction to that way of thinking. It's not one of those books that joyously recaps all the rules and syntax you'd forgotten since leaving school. Rather, its aim is simply to give you the means to grapple with core aspects of advanced mathematics. While this book doesn't overwhelm with technicalities (a British GCSE or equivalent in the subject should be sufficient prior knowledge for most readers), the rules and processes are not ignored, and there are brief introductions/reminders of topics such as Euclidean geometry, irrational numbers and so on. However the author's aims and emphasis are decidedly more psychological and philosophical. Why should we accept the axioms proposed by mathematicians? What exactly is a number? What does mathematical proof actually mean? These questions first need to be explored before embarking on the path to more esoteric concepts such as multi-dimensional geometry and manifolds (incidentally, useful for anyone interested in string theory). The chapters are sensibly structured and Gowers's enthusiasm for the subject radiates from each page without ever sinking into that patronising ""Hey kids, maths is fun!"" style of writing. The last chapter contains a selection of genuinely interesting FAQs, including some good suggestions as to why so many people seem to strongly dislike mathematics, compared with say biology or English literature (about which the non-enthusiast may just feel indifferent). Overall I found this more interesting that expected; a useful take on the subject that lays the groundwork for some of the more advanced areas of mathematics."

On the contrary, it was largely concerned with rather fundamental aspects of maths, such as what is meant by numbers, the concept of infinity, how to handle multiple dimensions, geometry, etc. I found this unexpected approach to be quite refreshing and informative. It gave me a feel for how mathematicians think, and how they approach problems. Of particular interest were explanations on how mathematicians set about proving a theory, such as a confirming that the square root of two is an irrational number. Mathematicians take nothing for granted, and everything has to be proved, step by step, all the way back to first principles. Some insight was also provided on solutions that mathematicians regard as being elegant, or even beautiful, these being seen as a cut above more ""ugly"" proofs.Admittedly, significant chunks of the book were beyond me and I was unable to follow the reasoning used, such as was the case with much of the chapter on geometry. Nevertheless, it has to be said that no advanced maths were needed to understand these sections but what would have come in handy was to have read the book with a pen and pad of paper at my side so that I could have jotted some points down to help reinforce the arguments being presented. In mitigation, I should point out that I read the Kindle version and flipping from one page to another, which was essential for following some points, is not so easy on a Kindle as with a conventional book. All the same, it is certainly a book that requires effort on the part of the reader to fully digest its contents.Other than school text books, this is the first book I've read on maths. Whilst I found it interesting, I don't feel driven to read any further books on this subject. So it could be said that the book has failed spark a desire to find out more which should be the hallmark of an outstanding book."

He did a great job of keeping the examples nice and simple (""How to throw a ball"" etc.), and I started out being made to feel confident about my ability to comprehend this stuff - so it did the psychological work very well. I think the problem was that having said ""it's easy!"" he proceeded too quickly to mathematical notation (which he assumes the reader understands) instead of arguments in a verbal format, step by step. A lot of the equations given as examples are intimidatingly long, too, for all the simplicity of the ideas they express. I had to look up on my dance card, as it were, the square root symbol which appeared with no formal introduction from Gowers. And he confused me on page 6 with the following:""...let us imagine we wish to predict the population of a country in 20 years' time. One very simple model [you know you're in trouble when they say ""very simple""] we might use represents the entire country as a pair of numbers (t, P(t)). Here, t represents the time and P(t) stands for the size of the population at time t.But I learned that if you have something like P(t), that means you're supposed to multiply P by t (and how can you multiply a population by a date - it doesn't mean anything) It turns out you're supposed to do no such thing - wish he'd said that straight off. On page 34 he assumes I know what a logarithm is (I don't). He also gives a foggy view of what a ""natural"" number is. I will probably try again with it, but it's kind of intimidating to think I would need to go on a short taught course simply to understand the ""introduction"" book. :/ "
58,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5226097-bojan-tunguz,5,"The world of mathematics elicits many different emotions, from fear to reverence, from apprehension to fascination. On a surface this may seem surprising, since mathematics is supposed to deal rational thought, and should be as removed from emotional considerations as it gets. And yet, it is precisely this dispassionate rationality that makes those unaccustomed to mathematical thinking recoil, and those with a mathematical bend of mind rub their hands in glee. For the truth is, mathematical thought relies heavily on emotions, and mathematicians are fascinated with beauty and elegance of mathematical creations. In the book ""Mathematics: A Very Short Introduction"" the author Timothy Gowers tries to convey some of this beauty. This is a very readable and intelligent short introduction, and probably the best short introduction to mathematics out there. It takes reader through some basic mathematical problems, and showcases the methods and procedures that mathematicians use in their work. If you are math-phobic, you will not have to deal with any complicated mathematical equations, and all of the problems and proofs that are offered in the book are straightforward and intuitive, and require a very minimal level of mathematical knowledge. The fact that the book attempts to ""do"" mathematics, as opposed to just tell about it, is one of its more rewarding aspects. It makes this an intelligent read, and rewarding no matter whether you are a complete mathematical ""outsider"" or someone with an advanced degree in a math-intensive field. "
59,0192853619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23417915-clint,3,"This was a very helpful book. Of most interest to me were his discussions regarding abstraction: think less about the essence of the numbers/operations,focus instead on what and why they are operating the way they are. Thinking abstractly allows for an easier grasp of mathematical concepts and operations. Understanding this has already helped me tremendously, but it also distresses when I look back on my mathematical development: it seems to me that the most common method of training attempts to connect every number and every concept to some concrete 'visualization' at every step in our education. This might be why upon completion of basic arithmetic, so many people struggle on in math until they are no longer forced to take it. At higher levels, mathematical laws, theorems, and concepts aren't very easy to visualize, so a student fixated visualizing logarithms isn't going to really understand what logarithms are doing--let alone why it's important to know for all subsequent courses in math.I enjoyed Dr. Gower's writing, but will definitely need a second, and third, look at a few sections."
