0,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1720620-anne,4,"So, this isn't really a humorous book about Aziz Ansari's dating experiences, it's more like a book about dating in the modern world, written by the very humorous Aziz Ansari. I was introduced to Aziz's stand-up by my oldest son, and I've been hooked on him ever since. He's hilarious, and if you haven't seen him perform you're missing out. Which makes me wish I'd listened to this as an audiobook... Turns out, Aziz and his partner, Eric Klinenberg, did quite a bit of research for this book. Now, is it the best book out there on this subject? The most detailed investigation with the most clinical data?Probably not. But there was waaay more research-y stuff in here than I was expecting from a book written by a stand-up comedian & actor. Between the two of them, they did focus groups, had pie charts, and looked at how people dated in a few different cultures. Not a ton, but a few!Japan (Tokyo, in particular) was interesting! I'd heard about their lack of interest in sex, but I didn't realize it was now such a big deal that the government was stepping in to help out. You'd think Tokyo would be a hopping place for singles, but evidently...not so much.Even so, it sounds like a fabulous place to visit!  They looked at Paris to see what a more laid-back culture thought about monogamy, and the results were...less surprising. More Parisians were cool with (a bit of) cheating than other countries.That's Hot!Sorry, wrong Paris.They also looked at Buenos Aries, which is (supposedly) a more aggressive city for dating. As in, the guys are aggressive and take catcalling to a whole new level. Or maybe it's a game both genders play in that culture?Either way, catcalling is gross, disrespectful, and not the way to meet your soul mate. <--just my opinion. Now, if you've ever seen Ansari's stand-up, you've probably seen him get someone out of the audience and scroll through their texts. This is like Aziz scrolling through thousands of personal texts to see what people are saying to each other. What's dating like for singles when there are so many ways to communicate? When everything is instantaneous? When you can swipe a face to connect, or send out mass generic messages on a dating site?How do you connect without being a needy dork or a creeper? What is the correct etiquette?Can you break up via text? Or ask someone to the prom in an IM?Are those, in fact, preferred methods of communications?!Oh my God, I'm so old!Is love in the digital age easier or harder? Are singles making rookie mistakes that knock them out of them out of the game, or is the game itself a tad more full of potential landmines than it was when I was single?I'm looking at you, dick pics!As Aziz points out, these stupid blunders just couldn't have happened 20 years ago.The point he makes is that the landscape for dating has changed...again. And I'm sure it will continue to morph and alter into something unrecognizable in another 20 years. That's not necessarily a bad thing, at all. In fact, there are upsides (searching for someone you connect with on a deep level, instead of settling) and downsides (expecting too much from one person, and not being satisfied) when it comes to Modern Romance. Admittedly, I had no real reason to want to read a book about dating. I'm not looking for love because I already had my very Unmodern Romance.We met at work, and talked on landline phones for hours!I simply wanted to take a peek at how the other half lives. And it was pretty enlightening! No, I don't feel sorry for the singles out there today. I don't think it's any harder, but it's definitely different for them than it was for me. Every era has its own pitfalls, but in the end, I think we all want the same thing. "

Modern Romance went on my TBR as soon as I heard rumors of its existence. We’re talking about waiting months for this damn thing (and also never being able to track down an ARC) . . . 

Quick confession – I never bothered reading the synopsis for this book. I saw Aziz Ansari had a “romance” book coming out and my brain immediately thought it would be something like “Tom Haverford’s Guide to Dating” . . . 

If I would have bothered reading the blurb, I would have realized that:
“Ansari combines his irreverent humor with cutting-edge social science to give us an unforgettable tour of our new romantic world.”
This book was seriously science-y. And not in a bad way either. It was an exploration of how finding a match has morphed from the 1950s to the present – but with an Ansari twist that brought the LOLz:
“Aron published another study, title “Couples’ Shared Participation in Novel and Arousing Activities and Experienced Relationship Quality” (damn, dude, shorten the names or your studies!)”
Modern Romance begins with Ansari admitting that he’s totally a girl. (HA! Just kidding. Bet that got some of you who have accused Mitchell and I of being women haters here on Goodreads all worked up.) Seriously though, Ansari’s introduction includes him picturing his future with a woman he made out with one night, questioning whether a text message came off too desperate or needy, wondering whether the lack of response to said text message is because of him or because some horrible accident befell his potential soulmate, etc. Basically, he proves in three pages that chicks and dudes are TOTALLY THE SAME when it comes to modern day relationships. Then there was a brief trip on the waybackmachine a lá When Harry Met Sally which included interviews of nursing home residents regarding how/when/where they met their spouse (there was also a lot of talk about how delicious donuts are in this segment. Mmmmmmm, donuts). I confirmed that I could easily be transplanted to the 1950s since I got married when I was a fetus instead of waiting until I was pushing 30 like modern-day women tend to do. *shrug*The book then fast-forwards through the ages to today and the land of terrifying technology . . . 

It covered everything from the mind games of not immediately responding to text messages in order to not appear desperate, to how modern romance works in countries other than ‘Murica, to online dating (I’m telling you, if it gets any easier than Tinder y’all single folks might as well just buy sex robots and save yourself the time and effort of leaving the house), to cyberstalking snooping on your significant other . . . 

and reminded readers that you might not always get a boner every time you touch your beloved’s hair, but that doesn’t mean you’re “settling.”If you’re looking for a laugh a second book of Ansari’s hits and misses when it comes to the romance game, this probably isn’t the choice for you. However, if you’re interested in a sociological study of how dating has evolved over time with some humor added in to the mix, this one’s a winner. And really – who can pass up getting to know a little more about Aziz Ansari’s outlook on love . . . 

Note: I am still holding out hope that Aziz will write a straight-up hilarious autobiography . . .

2,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma,3,"I got married in 1989. In India in those days, ""love"" marriages were still exceptions rather than the norm: when you had to look at the religion, caste, family background, and age of a possible partner who was to share your life (divorces were absolute stigma!) before hitching up, falling in love was like solving a mathematical equation with too many constraints. For a nerdy, uncouth, shy and bookish youngster who got tongue-tied in presence of a halfway-pretty girl, this was even more of a nightmare.Fortunately, as an educated young man from an aristocratic family, with a good job to boot, my prospects on the marriage market were bright. In the world of arranged marriages, I was “hot property”. Like Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice, mothers with daughters of marriageable age who knew my mother or father considered me as the rightful property of their daughters. Discussions of “possible alliances” were rife, and my mother was having to fend off quite a few of her more aggressive friends.Even though it gave my ego a sort of boost to be so sought after, in my heart of hearts I was intimidated by the thought of marriage. On the one hand, I was an incurable romantic, always falling in love with a pretty girl and writing bad poetry; on the other, my cynical and sarcastic self continuously mocked me. Also, as a rebellious liberal, I was against the whole concept of “arranged” marriages. So I shied away from all the proposals, giving the excuse that I was not ready.One day in February 1989, I went into my favourite bookshop and came across an unbelievable book sale where I picked up a bunch of absolutely awesome books for a pittance. I came home, drunk on my luck, when my mother told me that a marriage proposal had come from her classmate and close friend, for her daughter. In the euphoria of getting all those cool tomes, I agreed to see the girl’s photo.I got it a couple of days later, just took one look at it, and fell head over heels in love. A meeting was arranged the coming week; we talked to each other for around 20 minutes and hey presto! I was engaged. We got married that December.We have been together ever since. So I always wonder: is romance all it’s cracked up to be?---------------Pardon this lengthy episode about my marital journey. I was continuously reminded of the “good old days” while reading this book, especially when I read this:People in arranged marriages start off lukewarm, but over time they really invest in each other and in general have more successful relationships. They are more invested in the deep commitment to the relationship, rather than being personally invested in finding a soul mate, which can tend to lead to the “Is there something better out there for me?” mentality. In the current world of internet dating, I would still probably be “swiping right” on a dating app, looking for that perfect girl waiting out there for me.Aziz Ansari has done a wonderful job of explaining how the digital world has invaded the romantic arena. In olden days, the only hope of meeting a possible partner was out in the real world. If you were a caveman, you just banged the nearest attractive female on the head and dragged her into your cave: in more modern times, you met her in family gatherings, at the workplace and later on, in singles bars. However, since you were geographically limited, there was a limit to your romantic territory. The upside? People got married with someone they found reasonably attractive and settled down.Now, with the advent of the internet, the sky is literally the limit. People can visit dating sites; with dating apps like Tinder, just swiping right on an attractive picture is enough. If the other person also swipes right, you are practically hitched.(This is happening a lot in India too. We have marriage sites where you can filter down the choices caste and state-wise, and pick up a romance which will be easily approved by family. People have started calling them “arranged” love marriages. Talk about oxymorons!)However, the downside of this infinite choice that one keeps on window-shopping. Less and less people settle down – they remain digital Casanovas throughout their life. The relative anonymity provided by computers have a helped a lot of nerdy types get in on the act: so while romance has flourished, marriage has taken a hit. And it does not help that even adultery has become easier with the advent of sexting!My main problem with this book is that Ansari continuously tries to do his stand-up comedy act. It is not needed – the subject is fascinating by itself. And the jokes fall rather flat in the print medium, I must say.---------------Oh, one last thing – if I had started my romantic life after the advent of goodreads, I would hazard a guess and say that I’d still be single. I am so hopelessly in love with most of the wonderful ladies out here, that I’d still be debating on whom to bang on the head and drag into my cave. :D"
3,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21493936-clumsy-storyteller,5,"As a single woman I feel like Aziz Ansari knows my pain. Yes I am single by choice ( not my choice, but still a choice) , He knows how unpleasant it is to stare impotently at a screen waiting for a message that never arrives “we all have Tanya on our phones” 
The hours slouched by. “I’m so stupid!” he writes. “I should have typed ‘Hey’ with two y’s, not just one!” Later: “Did Tanya’s phone fall into a river/trash compactor/volcano? Did Tanya fall into a river/trash compactor/volcano?? Oh no, Tanya has died.”
  the author teamed up with sociologist Klinenberg to design and conduct a research project to better understand the dating game as it's played today. Their research program included focus groups and interviews with hundreds of people in big and small cities , They set up a discussion forum on the social networking websites, interviewed experts, consulted books on sociology, psychology and human behavior.the book deals with online dating 
""As a public figure, I have never considered doing any online dating. I always figured there was a chance someone who was a stalker type would use it as an opportunity to kidnap and murder me.I’m not sure how the scenario would go. Maybe my stalker (probably an Indian dude) sees my profile and thinks, Oh, here’s that comedian guy on OkCupid. FINALLY, I have a way to reach out to him and slowly plot his murder. He sends me a message pretending to be a woman. I see the profile. “She” likes tacos and Game of Thrones. I’m very excited.""
 * LMAO* :D Also the books deals with the struggle of finding your soul mate ,Asking them out, dumping, sexting cheating and snooping on your partner. And the differences between marriages now and then, Emerging adulthood, and lots interesting things about dating in our technology-saturated age. I loved every second of this audiobook, Aziz is such a funny actor/comedian"
4,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1085121-stephanie-extremely-stable-genius,4,"I am a satisfied single.I did not coin that term, I did hear it from somewhere, but I don’t remember who said it. Sorry person who said it. Anyway.....what this means to me is that I’m fine with being on my own. It’s easy. Would I like to meet ‘the love of my life’ or ‘the man of my dreams’ my 'soul mate' if you will? Sure, I’d be alright with that, in fact it would be great. But I'm not holding my breath.Am I willing to spend hours and hours poring over profiles, reading messages from guys that put little to no effort into writing them? Nope. I have better things to do. But if I stumble upon my prince charming by chance? Cool.“The world is available to us, but that may be the problem.” Truth. It’s exhausting.In Modern Romance, Aziz explorers and compares how people once found one another to how we painstakingly do today and he does a damn fine job of it. And he’s really funny too. “People who own iPhones are twice as likely to sext as people who use Androids.” Huh…who knew?“The most popular time to sext is Tuesday between 10:00 A.M. and noon. Yes, we looked this up twice. Strange!” Again……huh.“We have two selves: a real-world self and a phone self, and the nonsense our phone selves do can make our real-world selves look like idiots. Our real-world selves and our phone selves go hand in hand. Act like a dummy with your phone self and send some thoughtless message full of spelling errors, and the real-world self will pay the price. The person on the other end sees no difference between your two selves. They never think, Oh, I’m sure he’s much more intelligent and thoughtful in person. This is just his “lazy phone persona.” I have the best example of this from some guy who was trying to ‘git wit me’. Seriously. Trying to impress me and this is what he put forth…..never mind that he never, not once, asked me a question about myself. There was a bunch of attempts before this but this is where I was trying to get him to have a conversation….ask something…anything.“Guy: Just dont wanna be a pest. Juzy tell me to go away. HshaMe: You’re a nice enough guy [name redacted], I’m just confused on why you’re interested in me. I have no idea if we have anything in common….what do you think we might have in common? What are your interests….your views? Guy: Juzt looking for someone to someone to hang with. Nothing huge. Conversaytion share interest. Love the fsct ur artsy. U seem passionste bout what u do. And easy to look at. Im harmless. I dint biteI said something, then he sent this gem.Guy: I work afternoons during thr week. Love to do an art walk in lakrwood or something. Then walk the state park thete. Just a thoygjt”WHAT THE HELL? Needless to say I did not go out with this guy who ‘dint’ bite and have a ‘conversaytion’ with him…..I wasn’t sure I’d understand him. Look, I suck at spelling, but I know for a fact that devices today help a person out with that problem. In fact you would have to try pretty hard to screw up that bad. AND I hate, hate, hate, the ‘ur’ and ‘u’…..people, you’re phone will helpfully put the word ‘you’ up on the top there for you if typing three letters is too much work for you!Huff…..huff….huff…. why even try at all sir if that is the best you can do? I’m 99.9% sure this guy will never read this review. At least I hope so.I’ll end this with one last quote:“Marriage was an economic institution in which you were given a partnership for life in terms of children and social status and succession and companionship. But now we want our partner to still give us all these things, but in addition I want you to be my best friend and my trusted confidant and my passionate lover to boot, and we live twice as long. So we come to one person, and we basically are asking them to give us what once an entire village used to provide: Give me belonging, give me identity, give me continuity, but give me transcendence and mystery and awe all in one. Give me comfort, give me edge. Give me novelty, give me familiarity. Give me predictability, give me surprise. And we think it’s a given, and toys and lingerie are going to save us with that. Ideally, though, we’re lucky, and we find our soul mate and enjoy that life-changing mother lode of happiness. But a soul mate is a very hard thing to find.”That’s a lot to ask. I was pleasantly surprised by how good this book was. Enjoy."
5,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37906381-snoon-mcwilliams,2,"Startlingly inessential.Early on, Ansari makes a somewhat baffling statement that he felt compelled to write this book because there wasn't any other literature on modern dating culture-- a topic explored ad nauseum in newspaper thinkpieces, podcasts, and other disposable pop science bestsellers (many of which he goes on to reference throughout the book). He also mentions that he rejected the idea of writing a strictly humorous book because he feels like his stand-up is a more comfortable medium for his comedy ideas and only agreed to do the project if he could center it on serious sociological inquiry.What results is a broad roundup of research studies on shifting attitudes toward marriage and dating, some case studies done through focus groups and Reddit, and a few interviews with social scientists. Unfortunately, the most acute problem with the book is that it's wholly free of any sort of insight or critique. Have you ever thought about the fact that previous generations lived, loved, and died within a narrow geographic and cultural range while today technology allows us to learn about and connect with an almost limitless array of other people and ideas? Would it surprise you to learn that some people in bygone eras felt stifled by limited options while others were content with what was available to them, while some in the current generation feel liberated and others feel paralyzed by choice? It wouldn't?The flatness of the science could be forgiven if the book was funny, but it isn't. Ansari mostly limits himself to joking asides (and even follows most of those up with qualifying statements that they're not meant to be construed as part of the research, as if he or co-author Eric Klinenberg were deathly afraid of being discredited by satirical factoids like saying 0.8% of all couples met on the set of the Nicolas Cage movie Snake Eyes), which seldom rise above observations at the level of ""Have you ever texted someone and then they don't text back right away? What is the deal with that??"". On the whole, his efforts to ground the book in sociological exploration torpedo the humor and the book ultimately doesn't succeed as science or satire.I suppose this would be easy to dismiss as the latest in a long tradition of disposable novelty bathroom reading written by comedians, but knowing that Ansari was given a $3.5 MILLION book deal to produce it can't help but rankle. Save your time-- there's nothing insightful or memorable here at all."
6,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,5,"At the beginning of the audiobook, Aziz joked with 'us listeners', about being ""Lazy People""......too lazy to sit down and read a book. He not only had to write the book, but now he 'had' to read it us us too! Aziz is entertaining and hilarious no questions about it. Love the guy! By the end of my 'lazy- listening'... I came to the conclusion that Aziz brought playfulness and lightness to the game called ""Modern Dating"". However ...'everyone' could benefit listening to this audio tape if you plan to continue living in 2016 and years after. Listening to the different ways people interact through 'texting', opened up my eyes to the generation gap between - me, and my younger generation. I grew up talking on the telephone -- hours a night as a teenager. Every teenage girls dream was to own a princess phone of their own - next to their bed in the mid 60's. I talked with boys, girls, ( one on one), regularly. If a boy had interest in me ...he didn't send a text and say, ""hey""or ""hey, what's hanging?"" or ""you want to hang out."" Guys had to speak .. be more direct ...such as, ""hi, would you like to go to a movie with me on Friday night?"" Point is... Social connecting was either in person or on the phone. We didn't have instant messages- text messages to hide behind. I was almost 'shocked' ( but not really), that Aziz was actually TEACHING basic appropriate communication -social skills 101 of how to communicate just sending a text message without sounding like a jerk. (He was doing a great job with many terrific real- examples showing what worked and what didn't work). It's somewhat mind blowing to me that basic common sense skills need to be taught to young single men and women at all! ( AZIZ's refresher course is needed, no question about it). He also made it fun! Nobody gets called out -- this isn't a live seminar. When Aziz explored the changes of dating, romance , and marriage with the previous 50 years...a couple of things stood out as interesting to me. 1. There was a high statistic of people marrying a person who lived in their neighborhood. It was common to marry a person less than 5 minutes from where you grew up. 2. When asked ""why did you marry your wife?"" ...years ago: many of the answers were similar: ""She was nice, we liked each other, and had common values"". Today: when asked ...""""why did you marry your spouse?""...we hear answers like1. He's the other half of me.., and, 2. She's my soulmate.At the start of this book, I said to myself ...""This book is fun, & informative ...I can talk to my daughters about these issues...ask them questions.. etc..,yet, I'm soooo happy that I AM MARRIED.. ( and happy) In the middle of the book...still enjoying this clever-wise-comedian, and his heterosexual pairing with graphs to boot...I quietly said to myself ...YEP, STILL GLAD I'M MARRIED!!At the end of the audiobook...Having enjoyed a discussion about the beginning's attraction of a great relationship with lust and passion...then moving into the companion phase ----which is next to follow if the couple stays together...Or?might a person move on to another person? Keep that 'Rush' and 'fire' hot? Science makes a good argument for the companion phase. To me, the dating world seems over- stimulating -- too many choices -to the point of maybe not really knowing anyone. Boy next door doesn't look so bad! I'M 'still' happy TO BE MARRIED... ( yet, I suppose there would be nothing worse if a person wished they weren't). I'm blessed in the marriage dept. and I'll be the first to say it. We are both independent - individual - complete whole healthy- soulful human beings ... yet we are emotionally connected with each other in the important areas of life. I enjoyed my lazy time with Aziz. ( THANKS for reading your book to me Aziz). Aziz is a great walking buddy! You don't even need to text him for a date. Aziz's TV show ""MASTER OF NONE"", is funny, truthful as hell, with a great cast! "
7,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26876584-joe-valdez,4,"Like every successful standup comedian today, Aziz Ansari was offered a book deal. Though Patton Oswalt did turn his offer into Silver Screen Fiend: Learning About Life from an Addiction to Film, Ansari's peers have largely released memoirs or joke books; even George Carlin wasn't above taking money that a publishing house was giving away and adding ""New York Times bestselling author"" to his accomplishments. Winning the award for original thought, Ansari turned his offer into Modern Romance, a seriously amusing and documented sociological look at why with more options than ever, people feel more frustrated searching for a partner than ever. In collaboration with sociologist and author Eric Klinenberg as well as a football team of sociologists, research assistants and dating experts who consulted on data or organized focus groups, Ansari--born and raised in Bennettsville, South Carolina and at the time of his book's 2015 publication was 32, single, no children--is of course writing about himself just as much as his peers have in their books, but in analyzing why huge strides in civil rights and technology seem to have made the process of finding a mate more stressful, he's also writing about his audience. Like me!-- It was remarkable. In total, fourteen of the thirty-six seniors I spoke with had ended up marrying someone who lived within walking distance of their childhood home. People were marrying neighbors who lived on the same street, in the same neighborhood, and even in the same building. It seemed a bit bizarre. ""Guys,"" I said. ""You're in New York City. Did you ever think, Oh, maybe there's some people outside of my building? Why limit yourself so much? Why not expand your horizons?""They just shrugged and said that it wasn't what was done.-- When I talked to people about dating back in the day, they said they'd go to one bar or a mixer, which was like a community dance, usually put on by a church or college or other local institution, where young people could talk and meet. They'd stay there the whole night and have one or two drinks. That seems more pleasant than what I see out in bars today, which is usually a bunch of people staring at their phones trying to find someone or something more exciting than where they are.-- The interesting thing about text is that, as a medium, it separates you from the person you are speaking with, so you can act differently from how you would in person or even on the phone. In Alone Together Sherry Turkle tells the story of a young boy who had a standing appointment for a Sunday dinner with his grandparents. Every week, he'd want to cancel and his mom would tell him to call his grandparents and tell them he wasn't coming. However, he never would, because he couldn't bear to hear the disappointment in their voices. If it were text, though, he'd probably wouldn't have thought twice about it. As a medium, it's safe to say, texting facilitates flakiness and rudeness and many other personality traits that would not be expressed in a phone call or an in-person interaction.--At our focus group on online dating in Manhattan, Derek got on OKCupid and let us watch as he went through his options. These were women whom OKCupid had selected as potential matches for him based on his profile and the site's algorithm. The first woman he clicked on was very beautiful, with a witty profile page, a good job, and lots of shared interests, including a love of sports. After looking it over for a minute or so, Derek said: ""Well, she looks okay. I'm just gonna keep looking for a while.""I asked what was wrong, and he replied, ""She likes the Red Sox.""I was completely shocked. I couldn't believe how quickly he just moved on. Imagine Derek of twenty years ago, finding out that this beautiful, charming woman wanted to date him. If she was in a bar and smiled at him, Derek of 1993 would have melted. He wouldn't have walked up and said, ""Oh, wait, you like the Red Sox? No thank you!"" and put his hand in her face and turned away. But Derek of 2013 just clicked an X on a Web browser tab and deleted her without thinking twice, like a J. Crew sweatshirt that didn't live up to his expectations upon seeing a larger picture.-- On one of our subreddit threads we asked people to tell us about their best first dates, and it was amazing to see how many involved doing things that are easy and accessible but require just a bit more creativity than dinner and a movie.His parents both work in media, and every year he goes to the Westminster Dog Show at Madison Square Garden and finds his way backstage through a combination of walking with a purpose and flashing media credentials his parents help with. Talk about impressing a first date! We then bought wine, which they served out of sippy cups, and made a drinking game out of the dog show. (Take a drink every time a dog jumps when it's not supposed to, and so on).Dating aside, I'm definitely playing a Westminster dog show drinking game ASAP. That sounds fun!-- Ending things by changing their status on social media without telling their partner is another way people break up these days. One woman told us: ""In college, my boyfriend broke up with me by changing his Facebook status to single. We got back together six years later, and then he broke up with me over text message. I should probably stop dating him."" If you start dating him again and he says he needs to stop by the 'blimp place,"" maybe brace yourself to read bad news in the sky.Aziz Ansari reminds me of a bright younger brother, or perhaps energetic cousin, who you enjoy having around but at some point--maybe every hour, depending on what he's drinking or ingesting--you feel like telling, ""All right, settle down, settle down."" Not that I was expecting a dry sociological study of dating trends or even wanted to read one, but Ansari's book concept, his research and his energy are the chief reasons to read Modern Romance, not the jokes he slips in (I'll give him props for dropping a reference to the action movie Speed and what Jack Traven & Annie Porter can tell us about relationships forged from intense circumstances).In addition to traveling to Tokyo and Buenos Aires for a look at two of the most extreme dating climates in the world--one where men have their libidos set to 1 and another where masculinity is cranked up to 11--I got the most value from the focus groups with senior citizens. I could easily see this book being expanded into a television program, where Ansari meets people of different groups in different cities to talk about romance. It's colorful, analytical and thought provoking, whether you're single like me, or in a committed relationship and curious what's going on out there, the same way I enjoy watching nature programs though I'm uninterested in hunting game on the plains.My experience with modern romance is we do have so many choices and are in such a hurry to find the One but that the relationships that have been most memorable for me were those where I took the time to get to know someone in spite of ourselves. The Internet can so easily reduce the process of meeting people to ordering patio furniture, but people are not products, and my most meaningful relationships have been with women who weren't my ""type"" and vice-versa. Somehow we unplugged ourselves from the matrix and made a connection, but it's not easy. It makes me appreciate those relationships I've had so much more. This thoughtful and fun book reinforced that.Length: 59,712 words "
8,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"Aziz Ansari is a funny guy. I've enjoyed his work as an actor and a comedian, so I shouldn't have been surprised when I really liked his book. But I was surprised, especially when I learned that he had teamed up with a sociologist and did actual research on modern romance. Aziz was interested in how technology has changed dating culture, and he opens the book with a funny story about a girl, Tanya, who didn't text him back after he had asked her out. He realizes that texting and social media and dating apps and emojis have become increasingly important in dating and relationships, and he and a sociologist set out to research the subject. For example, they conducted interviews with people from a wide variety of ages and backgrounds, and they even traveled to other countries to get some international data on romance. One aspect of their research I found especially interesting was that online dating sites and apps, such as Match.com and Tinder, have dramatically increased the number of options for people, but having so many choices can be overwhelming. It makes it harder for some people to choose someone, because there are always more profiles to check. One woman told the story of how she would check Tinder before going a date, just in case she saw someone more interesting than the guy she was supposed to meet.I also liked the perspective of elderly folks who were interviewed. Overwhelmingly, the women who got married young wished they hadn't been pressured to find a husband so quickly. Even in cases where the women had relatively happy marriages, they felt a sense of loss because they didn't get a chance to experience being single in their 20s, or have time to live independently, without relying on a parent or a husband to support them.I love sociology, and I thought this book was a delightful blend of Aziz's humor and sociological insights. I listened to this on audio, and Aziz was a very funny performer. He had me laughing within the first minute, and this book made a long road trip seem very short. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the sociology of dating, or who also wants a good laugh."

10,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32879029-emma,4,"i posted, i posted, i posted! plz be proud of me. link here: https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...------------Disclaimer: I have the biggest crush on Aziz Ansari. Can anyone blame me? He’s like a humor magician. Parks & Rec, flawless standup specials, MASTER OF NONE, and this book. What a track record.Anyway. I could never claim to be unbiased on this subject. It’s now clear that what I thought was a post-season 2 Master of None hangover is just...part of me now. I am destined for an existence of crushin’ on Aziz.Okay. So now that you know I cannot be trusted, we can get into this. (This is, by the way, contrary to my typical off-the-charts levels of trustworthiness. I am often called Emma “Very Accurate and Fair Reviews” Insertmylastnamehere. That’s the level of dependability I’m rockin’.)First: GO WITH THE AUDIOBOOK.Now, you may be thinking, Emma, despite your claims of general trustworthiness, I do not trust you. I do not listen to audiobooks; I prefer Books with Pages. That is why I am here, on this site, generally dedicated to Books. With Pages.And I hear ya, voice-of-an-imaginary-reader-that-is-becoming-a-motif-in-my-reviews. Previously, I was just like you. (Insert gasp from the crowd here.)Recently, you may have seen, I discovered that I had seven (count ’em!) audiobook credits to my name. And that they would be expiring shortly. And so I lived my best extreme-couponer life, and posted a status asking for recommendations.Sofi came THRU.She suggested I check out the audiobook version of Modern Romance - that’s this book! - and because a) I am Aziz Ansari trash and b) I had lightly planned on rereading this during my 2017 Reread Extravaganza, I enthusiastically concurred.WHICH WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE. (Thanks again, Sofi. You’re the goods.)In my initial review, I gave this book three-ish stars. That’s because, while the book was interesting, it could get very nonfiction-y. (I’m not that big into nonfiction. How’d you guess?) It generally lacked for Aziz’s voice.Guess what’s not a problem in the audiobook version?IT’S AZIZ ANSARI’S VOICE. Because he reads it. And riffs. And jokes about the laziness of audiobook listeners. (This is particularly fabulous for me, as someone who read the book first, because I get to laugh pretentiously and condescendingly - which is my favorite kind of laughter.) The whole thing is great and I love it so much. Honestly, it’s like a six-hour podcast about love hosted by Aziz Ansari. And that’s a dream I never knew I had.This book isn’t perfect, but think about the impossibility of the task. Ansari and his co-author, Eric Klinenberg, set about to write a book that encapsulates and explains ALL OF MODERN ROMANCE, EVERYWHERE. And on TOP of it, discuss the history of romance and the changes that led us here. They had to place some limits on it.Unfortunately, these limits mean we mostly hear about the Tinder-esque romances formed by straight American twentysomethings. I’d love to hear more about non-straight relationships, or even non-online relationships. But I understand the need to focus on a niche.One AMAZING thing about this book is that it isn’t entirely American. Klinenberg and Ansari visited several other countries to try to get a more global concept, and IT. IS. FASCINATING. Honestly I want the two of them to write a million books like this. Just explain every aspect of society and culture to me via six-hour audiobook, Aziz.The only other downside is that this has a loooot of material from Aziz Ansari’s most-recent-and-still-fairly-old standup special, which I had just watched (okay, rewatched) like a week before starting the audiobook. So that was a lil upsetting. Like John Mulaney’s tragically short-lived self-titled TV show - I’d be so much more on board if I hadn’t heard half of it before.Bottom line: THIS IS SO FUN, but you gotta try the audiobook. 200% more Aziz, and trust me when I say you want as much Aziz as you can get.----------ORIGINAL REVIEW----------3/5the topic of this book was so interesting! i don't think i was alone, however, in expecting a little more aziz in it. it was definitely funnier/an easier read than your typical sociological study but it definitely had its dry portions. all in all worth it, though!"
11,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30863291-philip,4,"4ish stars.Disclaimer: This review contains my life story/abridged relationship history. Do not feel obligated to read it in its entirety, but c'mon it's kind of entertaining. Surprisingly not as funny, but much more insightful than I expected. I guess I figured this would be Master of None in book form with Ansari chronicling specific experiences he's had that reflect dating culture today. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of humor, and Ansari does throw in a few auto-biographical accounts, but it ends up being more of an impressive examination, complete with sociologists, research studies, etc., of the many ways we begin, build, and maintain relationships today. This is compared with norms of the past, showing the way changes in society and technology have shaped the evolution of modern romance. It also let me reflect on my own relationships, including my ongoing marriage of almost three years, and compare them to the experiences of those who were interviewed or otherwise participated in studies/conversations for this book, some of which are very foreign to mine. I'll give you a little glimpse into my humdrum relationship history as I detail my exploits as they apply to some of the points made in this book, and you can compare with your own. :) Names have been changed to protect the innocent.----------1) Barb - circa 2005 - age 16: During high school (and for long after) there was only one girl who could be considered my ""girlfriend"" (even if I have always refused to use that term because it feels cheesy and immature and ugly in my mouth, something about all those consonants mushing together - girlfriend). This was at the end of my junior year of high school - we were in volleyball class together, she asked me to the ""girls pref"" dance, we held hands, and after a few weeks of hanging out, during which time we made it ""official,"" I had my first kiss at 16. It took me 30 minutes of awkwardly lying silently next to her at a park knowing full well she expected me to kiss her, but being too scared to dive in, before I finally bucked up the courage and gave her a fairly chaste kiss. Having gotten the hard part out of the way, I went in for a second, at which point she sucked me in, tongue and all. Her first words afterward were ""you should open your mouth more."" Not exactly inspiring. When asked how many girls I had kissed, I replied ""just a few."" 😬 After a month or two I kind of got bored, so I started ghosting her, blowing her off for Harry Potter movie marathons, until she confronted me and I was forced to tell her I wanted to be ""free"" for the summer and my senior year. After a brief period of bitterness, we remained good friends. A few years later, her boyfriend at the time left the country for a while, and since we were good friends, we would hang out together. Alone. In her bed. Until after watching a particularly emotional episode of One Tree Hill we ended up having a NCMO (non-committal make out) until she started crying. Our tryst ended shortly after.Relevant points: - This was 2005. Mobile phones and texting had just started becoming accessible and prevalent among younger common folk like myself. Texting was T9 and I had to monitor my activity because unlimited texting wasn't an option for anyone but the high class. I remember texting being so cool at the time. It hadn't yet taken over lives and transformed communication but it was novel and exciting chatting with friends even if there wasn't much substance beyond ""hey wassup"" ""im good u?"" ""ugh 3rd period english with petersen life sux"" etc. So I never actually experienced dating without cell phones and texting. - It was all about MSN, AIM, and/or Yahoo messenger, which I used and abused. A couple years earlier, right before starting high school, I moved to a different state and these were the only easy ways to keep in contact with old friends. AIM chat rooms could also be utilized as cesspools for carnal desire, internet sex, and the dawn of catfishing, but that wasn't my style.- Social media as we now recognize it was fairly new. Myspace was a serious thing and I seem to remember it as being considered kind of edgy at first. My parents refused to let me get a Myspace so I had to keep mine secret. Again, it was fun to connect with friends, post comments, expect replies, and cause scandals based on who was selected as a ""top eight friend"" or whatever it was. It was also used by some as a way to hook up.-As is common today, guys were overwhelmingly expected to initiate relationships, but I was awkward and shy and it just wasn't me, so it's a good thing Barb had an excuse to ask me out because I wouldn't have made a move otherwise. Similarly, I eventually didn't want to be with her anymore, but didn't have the guts to say so (and breaking up over text would have been seriously uncool). So I ignored her texts until she forced my hand. I am not proud of myself. I also couldn't decide whether I should have felt guilty about making out with her while her kind-of boyfriend was in another country.- I was thereafter notorious for my many flirtationships, but nothing serious happened for a long time until...----------2) Mildred - circa 2011 - age 22: I ended up meeting Mildred after moving in with a buddy who was very social and outgoing. So the opposite of me. But I kind of became social by association? We had people over all the time and somehow I became kind of cool because my house was the cool place to be. I had a fairly wide circle of friends and Mildred somehow entered that circle despite her being way out of the circle's league. She was not even on my radar until I realized we were flirting a lot and she was giving me a lot of signs and making it really easy for me to ask her out. I was a giant dork, and ridiculously immature, while she had poise and beauty and confidence, so it was inevitable that things wouldn't last long. I tried so hard to be ""romantic"" and to make things special, so even after we were ""official,"" I didn't even kiss her for a long time because I was waiting for the perfect Hallmark moment. In hindsight this was stupid and naive and I wish I would have moved things a lot faster. After three months (my longest relationship until marriage), she ended things very maturely, in person, while I was completely oblivious to the fact that our relationship had been gradually declining for a while. She gave an excuse that I could never determine the legitimacy of, and let me down gently by suggesting that we ""take a break,"" leaving a hypothetical door open, even though we both knew the door would never be used again. We remained friends and continued to hang out in the same crowd.Relevant points: - Of course smartphones were a thing at this point. Social media could be accessed at any second and the obsessiveness with likes and comments began. Texting had become my preferred mode of communication; I had conversations of increasing depth and took my time crafting the perfect messages. I also started playing the game of not texting back for the same amount of time it took to receive my last reply. I never answered calls unless it was family, or I was expecting a call, and even then preferred to ignore calls and text back instead. Basically I became a much better texter/writer than talker. It all went downhill from there.- Myspace was dead and Facebook was king. Friend invites were sent to even the most distant acquaintances because it didn’t require asking for phone numbers, and it was considered the greatest offense to ""unfriend"" someone. An acquaintance/emerging friend of mine had previously told me that he had a giant crush on Mildred, and after I broke ""bro code"" and started dating her he unfriended me. Everyone I told this to was shocked that he had taken things so far. I remember posting things on other people's Facebook walls that I never would have in person, or even through text. Something about it being open and public made it easier, less intimate.- I opened an Instagram account which, at the time, seemed like a simpler, less social platform than Facebook, not a way to connect or meet people. Snapchat was the newest thing and word on the street was that it was used mainly to send dick pics.- Dating websites were big, and I tinkered with them a bit. Of course, they all cost money and I was a starving college student, so this never went anywhere. I had a legitimate conversation with maybe one person but it ended quickly. I didn't understand how dating sites could be successful for so many people. - I went to community college but was too shy to talk to anyone so I came and went without ever making a single friend. I decided that I could probably only ever date someone with whom I was already friends. Blind dates were all duds so I felt like I would need to have some kind of existing relationship in order for things to progress to a relationship. I lucked out by having such a social roommate through whom I became friends with so many people.  ----------3) Betty- circa 2013 - age 24: One word. Tinder. Game changer. I ended up going on a ton of Tinder dates around this time. While simultaneously being embarrassed that I was going on a ton of Tinder dates, and making up creative alternative meet-cutes. I only ended up going on multiple dates with a handful of girls, and only one or two matches in particular turned into relationships but they were fairly solid by my standards. Betty came about during a time when I was trying hard to go on second dates with these Tinder girls. I figured I had to give them second chances because it's hard to get to know a person in an hour or two, especially when the only thing you know you have in common is that you both liked the other person's idealized presentation of themselves. Betty evolved from a typical Tinder girl that I didn't feel much chemistry with, to a full-blown relationship. I'm almost ashamed to admit that one of the biggest factors that led to our breakup was that she lived like 30 minutes away and I didn't want to drive out to see her. We'd switch off driving to see the other person so I only had to drive down once a week or so but I decided it wasn't worth it. Apparently the most attractive quality in a woman for me was close proximity? In other news I finally had the guts to break up with her myself, in person even, at a Cafe Zupas.Relevant points: - Up until Tinder, I relied on my friends to set me up on dates or to bring new people into our social circles that I could get to know. I felt like I burned through all of those options pretty quickly and didn't know how to meet new people. Through Tinder I connected with a lot of girls. It was brilliant. Look at someone's picture and a short blurb of how they describe themselves and make a snap judgment about whether you're interested or not. Basically the dating equivalent of Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking. The beauty was that so many people were using it that I could never run out of people to swipe through. The downside was that all of the girls who I matched with (who I thought were my type) lived in the college town 30 minutes away with Betty. - Of all the girls I followed up with after a date via text, only a fraction ever responded, the others deciding to pretend I didn't exist. I still felt obligated as the dude to initiate the follow-up, but unless I was feeling it I wouldn't contact the girl again and that was that. On the rare occasion a girl texted me after a date and I wasn't interested, I told them so, but otherwise never talked to the girls I didn't connect with again. - Betty wasn't pleased with our breakup and told me that I needed to let myself give our relationship a fair chance. That I would never have a healthy relationship until I opened up and allowed a legitimate connection to develop. Wise words. We never talked again but never actually deleted each other from social media, and I occasionally stalked her to see how she was getting on. She's now married with a kid whose face I would occasionally see on Facebook. Weird?----------4) Stacia - circa 2014-present - age 26-29: I ended up meeting my wife at church. Isn't that so lame and old-fashioned? My church does this thing where they set up congregations entirely composed of young, single adults, seemingly in an effort to get us to marry each other. I always thought it was ridiculous and incestuous to date people in my surrounding neighborhood, who I would otherwise see on a regular basis. Not to mention how dated and close-minded I thought it was to only go out with people of my own religion. I had a strict policy against dating people from church. I attended for the religious aspect and because my friends went. Also, Stacia and I did not have good first impressions of each other. I was still living with my social friend and we still had regular gatherings that led her to believe that I was a cocky douchebag who had girls fawning over me. For my part, I had a few friends/acquaintances who all claimed to have gone out with Stacia and who were then given the cold shoulder by her because she was stuck up/promiscuous. Eventually our circles of church friends overlapped and we became comfortable with each other. She realized I was a doofus, not a playboy, and in turn assured me that those guys who claimed to have hooked up with her only wished they could have, that she would never have actually given them the time of day. We grew to greet each other, tease each other, give each other dating advice, and set each other up with our friends. Then it was like a switch flipped. All of a sudden I realized I was in love with her, and as luck would have it, she had the same epiphany at the same time. We dated for six months before I proposed and were married six months after that. Almost three years on, I love her now more than ever.Final thoughts: - Obviously I ended up marrying someone I met IRL. We would text each other occasionally while we were dating but it was mostly to figure out when we'd see each other next. Maybe phone/internet dating would have worked for me eventually, as it has for many of my friends, but I had a lot more success meeting people organically. - Not gonna lie, I was always kind of a prude. I never really dated for fun, I dated to get into relationships. I never even kissed girls until I felt like we were sufficiently serious. I'm pretty sure I'm quite anomalous in that regard. Looking back would I have done anything different? Oh yeah. I would have had way many more NCMOs. Seriously. I think I missed out on a lot during my single years by being so rigid. Call it gentlemanly, but I now look back and realize there's nothing wrong with being emotional/passionate/affectionate with a lot of people just for the fun of it. I still can't bring myself to accept the idea of being in serious relationships with multiple people at the same time, but I feel like there's no harm in going on dates with lots of people until someone special emerges. - I'm also fully aware that I kept my romantic life in a very traditional bubble, even while I was watching all of my friends engage in much more progressive, open experiences consistent with current, common dating culture in the US. I'm fine with it, and luckily, it ended up working for me. It's interesting looking back, pondering these things, and comparing my ideas (then and now) to the ideas expressed by people in this book. If nothing else, it's insightful in that regard and makes me want to force it on my single friends. :)Posted in Mr. Philip's Library"
12,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28854579-glenn-sumi,3,"Bravo to comic and actor Aziz Ansari for not writing just another memoir-by-someone-who’s-sorta-famous-but-hasn’t-lived-long-enough-to-really-warrant-one. I’ve read a number of them (good: Bossypants; okay: Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?; abandoned: sorry, Lena Dunham).Modern Romance is about dating in the digital age. Getting to know people has evolved significantly even over the past few years. Dating sites, swipe apps like Tinder and sexting are a far cry from how people used to meet – you know, through friends and family; answering personal ads; video dating, where you watch potential partners' VHS tapes (!); braving noisy, crowded bars….Ansari has teamed up with NYU sociology professor Eric Klinenberg for the book, so there are many quotes from experts and plenty of facts, figures and even some graphs. There are also lots of jokey elements, like dorky photos (Ansari imagines what his online stalker looks like) and fake footnotes (okay, I laughed at a silly Betty Friedan footnote). The two also drew on lots of research from SubReddit, focus groups and Ansari’s stand-up. A few years ago I saw Ansari perform live, during the time he was doing research. One of the highlights was when he asked audience members if they’d recently met someone and, if so, if he could read out recent text exchanges involving that person. He draws on some of those exchanges from that tour in the book.If, like me, you’re single, you probably already know a lot of what's in this book. The whole project feels a tad lightweight, like an extended magazine article you skim in the waiting room of the doctor’s office.But there are a few fascinating revelations, like the difference between successful women’s and men’s online dating profile pictures (apparently women should look directly at the camera, while men should look away) and how if someone’s “undecided” about liking your pic and profile you’ll think about them a lot more than if someone downright likes it. (Note: Aziz admits at the outset that the book is primarily about heterosexual relationships and most of the research was done with middle-class people.)But by far the most fascinating sections in the book are about dating practices in other countries: Qatar, Japan, France. Aziz jokes that he chose many of these cultures for their culinary offerings, but there are some sharp observations here. People in Japan are so private they often use a pet – or an inanimate object, like their RICE COOKER! – for their profile pics.And the section on France opens up a big issue about monogamy and open relationships. You know who also weighs in on open relationships? The hip-hop star Pitbull. And he’s pretty articulate. Ansari also chronicles his own relationship history, which has gone from single to dating to seriously dating. He’s candid about it all, even letting us see actual text exchanges between him and his lady friend to illustrate how some digital communication can be misinterpreted. And while there are jaw-dropping revelations about the idiots out there in cyberspace's scary single’s world – adolescent males come under fire for their less than original texts – there are lots of success stories, too. So there are plenty of happy endings. (Um, you know what I mean.)"
13,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,4,"CALLING VS. TEXTING""A phone call? The WORST."" - Female Focus Group Participant""If you want to talk to me, you're going to have to call me."" - Another Female Focus Group Participant[Dumbfounded]- Every Guy in That Focus GroupThe issue of calling versus texting generated a wide variety of responses in our focus groups. Generally, younger dudes were FUCKING TERRIFIED of calling someone on a phone. This didn't surprise me that much, but I was surprised that younger women also expressed terror at the thought of a traditional phone call. ""Phone calls suck and they give me anxiety,"" said one twenty-four-year-old woman. ""Since texting started, an actual phone call feels like an emergency,"" said another. Other girls thought it was just too forward for someone to call as the first move and said that a text would be more appropriate in general.However, other women said receiving a phone call from a guy showed he had confidence and helped separate those men from the pack of generic ""Hey wsup"" texts that normally flood their messaging programs. To these women, the guys who call seem brave and mature. The phone conversations helped create a rapport that made them feel comfortable and safe enough to go out with a person they didn't know all that well.A woman who came to one of our focus groups discussed how she got so fed up with text messaging that she cut of her texting service and could only be reached by phone calls. This woman never went on a date with a man again. No, she actually started dating someone soon afterward. She also claimed the guys who did work up the courage to call her were a better caliber of man and that she was, in effect, able to weed out a lot of the bozos.But with some women who loved phone calls, things weren't that simple. In a rather inconvenient twist for would-be suitors, many said they loved phone calls - but had no interest in answering. ""I often don't answer, but I like receiving them,"" said one woman, who seemed oblivious to how ridiculous this statement sounded.For this group, voice mails provided a screening system of sorts. When they explained this, it made sense to me. If the message was from someone they'd met briefly at a bar, it let them hear the guy's voice and made it easier to sort out the creeps. One girl raved about a nice voice mail a guy had recently left her. I kindly requested she play it and heard this gem: ""Hey, Lydia. It's Sam. Just calling to say what's up. Gimme a ring when you get a chance.""THAT WAS IT.I pleaded to know what was so great about this. She sweetly recalled that ""he remembered my name, he said hi, and he told me to call him back.""Never mind the fact that what she described was the content of LITERALLY EVERY VOICE MAIL IN HISTORY. Name, hello, please call back. Not really a boatload of charm on display. To fail this test, a guy would have to leave a message that said: ""No greeting. This is a man. I don't remember you. End communication."" pg. 40 Okay, first things first. I'm not here to judge Ansari as a human being, just review his book. It's not my place to judge the living and the dead. That being said, I want to state that I can't think of Ansari without being mildly sick to my stomach. Before I had absolutely zero feelings about Ansari whether positive or negative, and now thinking about him makes me slightly nauseous. I don't want to get in an argument with anyone, but let's just say I believe “Grace” 100%. Whether you think “Grace” was right or wrong to tell babe what happened, whether you think babe was right or wrong in pursuing the story, whether you think what Ansari did was just “a bad date” or “being a cad” and it doesn't bug you that much, or if – like me – it makes you sick – doesn't matter. I simply want to make it clear that although I would love to say I completely was able to separate Ansari's actions from his book, I was not able to do so.I think especially jarring in the case with Ansari is that he seemed (in the book) to be sympathetic to women and understanding of women and not like someone who would pressure you into giving him a blowjob and shove his fingers in your mouth. I mean, he LITERALLY wrote a book on dating in which he explains to men that they should be kind to women. It's not like he wrote a detective novel, or something.On to the book.The book is surprisingly sociological and based on some form of research. I thought it would merely be a comedic observation on modern dating life. But no, Ansari involved scientists and researchers and did some studies. One might have to put the word studies in quotes, but nevertheless. The book is also beautiful with full color illustrations and great use of charts, graphs, and other fun colorful additions to the book. Very lovely book visually. Stunning. Ansari was pretty funny. I would say about half of his jokes landed. Since he makes a ton of jokes, that is a pretty good ratio. I laughed out loud a lot. This is a genuinely funny book.This also made me realize: The only thing sadder than holding the record for longest masturbation is realizing you lost it to someone else.""Sorry, man, he just jerked off for a few minutes longer. Better luck next year.""None of the news articles that described the lack of interest in sex in Japan really delved into this whole world of strange sexual alternatives, and when you learn about it, it does kind of explain the alleged ""lack of interest"" in sex. The herbivore sector is interested in sexual pleasure but just not interested in achieving it through traditional routes. In their eyes, it seems, if you're so mortified at the thought of rejection by a woman, why not just jerk off in an egg and call it a day?At this point you are probably wondering: What was my top meal in Tokyo? Well, it's tough to say. I really enjoyed Sushisho Masa, a high-end sushi restaurant. However, I also really enjoyed the tasty tempura I had from the working-class vendors in Tsukiji Market. And of course there was the ramen.To be honest, the food scene in Tokyo was way easier to understand than the singles scene. It's hard to figure out why sex and relationships have changed so dramatically, so quickly, and why so many people have turned inward - staying home alone, playing video games, or hanging out in cat cafés - rather than reaching out for one another.On my last night in Tokyo, I decided to keep an open mind and buy a Tenga. Every stage of it was a bummer. I went into a convenience store and had to say, ""Do you guys have Tengas?"" The lady gave me a sad look and pointed me in the right direction. As I paid, I smiled and said, ""Research for a book project!"" It didn't seem to convince her that I was cool. Instead, she's probably convinced I'm doing some very bizarre book called Masturbating Across the Globe: One Man's Journey to Find Himself.When I got back to my hotel room, I opened the thing up and gave it a go. I was kind of excited to see if it really was masturbation taken to the next level. Masturbation at the current level feels pretty good, so maybe this wouldn't be bad? Again, no. The experience of using an egg-shaped masturbation device was both odd and uncomfortable. The thing you put your thing into was cold and weird. It felt like I was masturbating with a thick, cold condom on, and I didn't understand the appeal. pg. 170I've never been on a dating site or had a dating app on my phone, so I can't relate to some of the scenarios Ansari is talking about. I think Ansari makes some wonderful points. I especially like his examination of dating cultures in different generations in the U.S. and his analysis of dating in different cultures (French, Japanese, etc.). He talks a lot about technology and how it has affected the dating scene.GRAMMAR/SPELLINGIn any interviews we did, whenever bad grammar or spelling popped up, it was an immediate and major turn-off. Women seemed to view it as a clear indicator that a dude was a bozo. Let's say you are a handsome, charming stud who really made a great first impression. If your first text is ""Hey we shud hang out sumtimez,"" you may just destroy any goodwill you have built up.On our subreddit we were told a story about a man who was dating a spectacular woman but eventually broke up with her. He said it went downhill once he texted her asking if she had heard about a party at a mutual friend's house. Her response was ""Hoo?"" Not ""Who,"" but ""Hoo."" He kept trying to force the word ""who"" into conversation to make sure this beautiful woman could spell a simple three-letter word. Every time, she spelled it ""hoo."" He said it ruined everything. (NOTE: We did confirm that this was a woman and not an owl.) pg. 53As a book I would rate this as a four or a five. The last half of the book was particularly stellar. I found Ansari to be funny and insightful. The only points I would take off FOR THE BOOK is that it is pretty male-centered and focuses on male thoughts and actions. I understand, Ansari is a male, but as a woman reading it I was wondering where the women fit in as agents and self-realized people. Women are presented as pretty passive. Men are agents. Men perform actions. Women respond to the actions, either negatively or positively. Ansari doesn't seem to understand or account for women who are acting as agents. Men approach women. Men call/text/message women. Men ask women on dates. Women respond favorably or unfavorably. Men try to get women into bed. Men try to get laid. Sometimes they are successful, sometimes they aren't. Women are presented in this book as being recipients. Or objects which forces (men) act upon. While Ansari is presenting men with a positive message of ""be kind to women, treat women as human, treat women as humans first and sexual conquests second"" - my main point here is that he seems unable to fathom or grasp that women might be the forces acting upon (male) objects. This never comes up because it honestly never occurs to Ansari.Whether or not you take issue with this is your own concern. I'm merely pointing out that this is how the book is written. There's also some mild, minor fat-shaming in the book. It's not OVERARCHING, but it's there.One other thing the book does brilliantly IMO is present men as flawed, real, insecure and anxious people who care about romantic relationships and worry about their interactions with women. The media tries to brainwash you into thinking men are slavering beasts only interested in one thing - sexual satisfaction for themselves. The media allows little room for stuff like ""men would like to have a long-term partner they are loyal to"" or ""men would like to get married and have a wife they are loyal to"" or ""men would like to raise a family"" or ""men can be hurt by women in an emotional or psychological way."" Instead, men are presented as some sort of unfeeling beasts who seek rutting above all else. Needless to say this is doing neither men nor women any favors. Ansari talks about men as people with feelings and emotions and human desires. It's refreshing.TL;DRIN CONTEXT, some of this book is violently jarring. Hearing Ansari spout off against “douche monsters” and talk about how men should act (respectful of women, not like 'bozos,' aware of women's needs, fears, and wants) is wildly ironic when you think about the babe article. I wish I could tell you that I was able to completely divorce what Ansari was writing from revelations of how he acted with “Grace” behind closed doors, but I cannot. Given the subject material it is especially hard. YMMV. I don't know who you are or what you think about the babe article, perhaps it will make no difference to you. To me, it makes a big impact on reading his work and thinking about him as a person.The book was a great book and made me laugh a lot. I have never seen Ansari on screen, I have never seen his stand-up in any form, this and the babe article (and the dozens of analyses of said article) are my only exposure to this author.I'm sure a lot of people wish I had reviewed the book with no reference or mention to the babe article, but to me that is just not a possibility. If you know me, you know I can't ignore it. Feel free to hash anything out in the comments. Like I said, it's not my place to judge the living and the dead but I can't pretend I have no idea what's going on. He wrote a non-fiction book about dating, for fuck's sake.Unrelated to the babe article, Ansari is obviously super-interested in dating, women, and the singles scene. He also has a kind of childish, baby-talk thing going on that I'm sure IRL might annoy some people. He's funny enough that you almost don't notice it, but it's there.Hesitated to read the book. Hesitated to write a review on it. But here it is. *shrug*At certain times, though, this ""I need the best"" mentality can be debilitating. I wish I could just eat somewhere that looks good and be happy with my choice. But I can't. The problem is that I know somewhere there is a perfect meal for me and I have to do however much research I can to find it.That's the thing about the Internet: It doesn't simply help us find the best thing out there; it has helped to produce the idea that there IS a best thing and, if we search hard enough, we can find it. And in turn there are a whole bunch of inferior things that we'd be foolish to choose.Here's a quick list of things I can think of that I've spent at least five to ten minutes researching: - Electric citrus juicer (Waiting on this one to arrive in the mail. Hope I didn't fuck it up. Don't want too much pulp in my juice!) - Taxidermy (I started off looking for a deer or bear, but I ended up finding a beautiful penguin in Paris. His name is Winston.) - Which prestigious TV drama to binge-watch next (The Americans, House of Cards, or Orphan Black? The answer: I watched all of them while telling my publisher I was writing this book.) - Bag for my laptop - Protective case for my laptop- Internet-blocking program so I can stop using my laptop so much - Museums (Gotta peep the exhibits online before I commit to driving all the way out there, right?) - Coasters (If you dig deep, you can find some dope coasters with dinosaurs on them!)- Vanilla ice cream (Had to step it up from Breyers, and there's a LOT of debate in the ice cream fan community - there are fierce debates on those message boards.)It's not just me, though. I may take things to extremes sometimes, but we live in a culture that tells us we want and deserve the overwhelming popularity of websites that are dedicated to our pursuit of the best things available. Yelp for restaurants. TripAdvisor for travel. Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic for movies.A few decades ago, if I wanted to research vanilla ice cream, what would I have even done? Cold-approach chubby guys and then slowly steer the convo toward ice cream to get their take? No, thanks.Nowadays the Internet is my chubby friend. It is the whole world's chubby friend. pg. 126"

15,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11021258-chihoe-ho,2,"""Modern Romance"" straddles the line of being funny and serious. It doesn't commit (get the pun?) one way or the other, and so, falls flat on both fronts. This is especially unsatisfying as I love Aziz and his work. Perhaps it's with this high expectation and skewed notion of what this book could have been that made it all the more disheartening. The quicker you accept the fact that ""Modern Romance"" isn't what you wished it was, the easier you'll find yourself enjoying it a little more.It isn't a laugh-out-loud humourous kind of book, even though I did chuckle at bits here and there; it isn't a scholarly body of sociological work that expounds new facts, even though I did relate to the online dating experiences recounted in ""Modern Romance"". In this itself, I suppose, I found the humour and comfort knowing that this digital age of romance is as wacked up as I find it to be from my own familiarity of it. What further makes ""Modern Romance"" a passable book for me was Aziz Ansari himself - the narrator was undeniably of the voice of Ansari and the jokes were unmistakably in the tone of his humour. So if you're a fan of him, great, you're likely going to enjoy ""Modern Romance"". Otherwise, like a text conversation that dies off or a forgettable date, there's nothing you're missing here that you didn't already know about digital dating if you skipped this book."
16,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23381142-nat,3,"In Modern Romance, Ansari combines his irreverent humor with cutting-edge social science to give us an unforgettable tour of our new romantic world.“The world is available to us, but that may be the problem.”Fun fact: I actually started 2017 with this read, but at the time it didn't feel relevant enough for me to get the most out of it, so I put the book down. Fast forward to November, when I discovered the wonder that is the Hidden Brain podcast, where it featured an episode with Aziz Ansari sharing laugh-out-loud funny excerpts from Modern Romance. After having a genuinely good time listening to his voice on the podcast, I was convinced to take another shot with the audiobook.And having watched and completely loved Ansari's Netflix show Master of None back in  May when the second season was released (check out my May 2017 Reading Wrap Up to read more of my ravings on that), I was more than ready to dive back into his world. Plus, I'm glad I got to read the book a while after having watched the show because the many parallels of my favorite scenes from the show being present in here were beyond gratifying to experience again.




 SourceModern Romance interweaves stream of consciousness storytelling with scientific research that will ultimately make you see your own life through a different lens. Thankfully, though, the book has a generous mix of absurdity and depth. Aziz Ansari tackles head-on the subject of culture and technology and the ways they've shaken romance, and he provides us with “a much richer understanding of the new romantic landscape.” But Ansari never fails to include a much-needed comical anecdote or food reference to lighten up the text. Speaking of which, here's a passage from the first chapter that sealed the deal for me:“To be honest, I tend to romanticize the past, and though I appreciate all the conveniences of modern life, sometimes I yearn for simpler times. Wouldn’t it be cool to be single in a bygone era? I take a girl to a drive-in movie, we go have a cheeseburger and a malt at the diner, and then we make out under the stars in my old-timey convertible. Granted, this might have been tough in the fifties given my brown skin tone and racial tensions at the time, but in my fantasy, racial harmony is also part of the deal.”That’s my exact thought process with people who tend to romanticize the past.The only downfall to this book was that, though it highlights a vast set of issues related to modern romance and emerging adulthood, it does so in a very narrowed down look, specifically centered around American middle-class straight couples. But to give credit where credit is due, there are a couple of chapters dedicated to exploring romance in other parts of the world, such as Buenos Aires, Tokyo, Paris, and Doha.All in all: I'm just glad I finally got around to reading Aziz Ansari's Modern Romance with the end of the year in sight.

One firm takeaway from all our interviews with women is that most dudes out there are straight-up bozos.
My introduction to modern romance was abrupt and unexpected. I was back in New York for the holidays, drinking with a few friends, sipping and gulping the wonderful IPAs that I miss when I’m here in Spain. Sometime deep into the night, one of my friends, who is a gay man—this is relevant to the story; you should also know that I’m a straight guy—asked if anyone wanted to go on his Tinder. “I do!” I said, and soon found myself face to face with the infamous app for the first time in my life. Now, for the three remaining people who don’t know how Tinder works, it’s very simple: You look at pictures of people, and swipe left if you don’t want to talk to them, right if you do. (In this respect it's like the Last Judgment.) If someone you’ve approved of also approves of you, then you are both given the option to send messages.My friend was obviously a stud, because I was getting matches left and right (well, only right). One of these matches was a young man who I’ll call Woodrow Wilson. With permission from my friend, I sent Woodrow a message. The conversation went something like this:Me: What’s your favorite tree?Woodrow Wilson: Uh, White Pines are pretty cool I guess.Me: White Pines? So cliché.Woodrow Wilson: You’re right, I was only testing the waters. I’m really fond of Quaking Aspens. You?Me: Now we’re talking. I’ve always been fond of the Shagbark Hickory. The conversation proceeded like this for about four days, by which time it was clear that I had found my soul mate through my gay friend’s Tinder. Unfortunately, many barriers stood in the way—I’m straight, I was going back to Spain, and I was basically deceiving him—so I didn’t meet Woodrow Wilson. (If you ever read this—hello, and sorry!) But the experience was enough to make me curious about the opportunities and hazards of romance in the modern world.Being a reluctant single, a very reluctant millennial, and a very, very reluctant member of the modern world, you can imagine I was, well, reluctant to tackle this topic. This book enticed me, not because it was written by Aziz Ansari—I didn’t consider myself a fan, and in college I even passed up the opportunity to see him live on campus—but because he teamed up with a sociologist, Eric Klinenberg, to write it. I listened to the audiobook, nasally narrated by Aziz.The most striking thing about this book is that, despite its lighthearted tone and frequent funny asides, it is basically a serious and even an earnest book. Sociological statistics, psychological studies, and anthropological analyses are mixed with anecdotes and interviews and a bit of humor to give a quick but surprisingly thorough tour of romance in the contemporary world.Aziz begins by pointing out that dating in today’s world is strikingly different from dating in my grandparents’ or even my parents’ generation. This is not only because of advances in technology but, more importantly, because of shifts in values. We now have developed what you might call a perfectionistic attitude towards finding a partner. We want to find a “soul mate,” “the one,” somebody who fulfills us and thrills us. Aziz contrasts this with what he calls the “good enough” marriages of yesteryears—finding a partner that satisfies some basic criteria, like having a job and a shiny pocket watchI myself have noticed this shift from studying anthropology and history. In cultures all around the world—and in the West until quite recently—marriages were considered a communal affair. Aziz’s own parents had an arranged marriage, and according to him have had a long, successful relationship. (To be honest the idea of an arranged marriage has always been strangely appealing to me, since I don’t think any decision of such importance should be left in my hands. But the rest of my generation disagrees, apparently, so now I’m left to rummage through apps.)Connected to this rise in the “soul mate” marriage is a rise in our preoccupation with romantic love. According to the biological anthropologist, Helen Fisher, there are two distinct types of love in the human brain: romantic, and companionate. Romantic love is the kind that writes bad poetry; companionate love is the kind that does the dishes. Romantic love hits early in a relationship and lasts up to a year and a half; companionate love grows slowly over time, perhaps over decades. This division accords well with my own experience. (Parenthetically, I have long been skeptical, even morbidly suspicious, of romantic love: that kind of idealizing, gushing, delicious, walking on air feeling. To me it seems to be a form of self-deception, convincing yourself that your partner is perfect, even divine, and that nobody else in the world could make you so happy—when the truth is that your partner is a flawed person, only one of many flawed people who could induce the same delirious sensation. Wow, I sound really bitter in this paragraph.)This cultural shift has been bolstered by our new dating technology. Now we do not only have the expectation that we can find the perfect partner, but we have the tools to do the searching. I can, and sometimes do, scroll through hundreds of faces on my phone per day. All this is very exciting; never before could I have so many romantic options at my fingertips. But there are some major drawbacks to this. One is what the psychologist Barry Schwartz called the “paradox of choice.” Although you’d think having more options would make people more satisfied, in fact the reverse occurs. I remember watching TV was a lot more fun when I was a kid and I only had a few dozen channels; when we upgraded to hundreds of channels, it became stressful—what if there was something better on? Similarly, after spending three months in a camp in Kenya, eating whatever I was given, I found it overwhelming to go to a pizza place and order. How could I choose from so many toppings?Along with these broader observations is a treasure trove of statistics and anecdotes that, if you’re like me, you’ll be quoting and misquoting for weeks. I found the little vignettes on the dating cultures in Japan, where there’s a sex crisis, Buenos Aires, where there’s a machismo crisis, and Paris, where there’s lots of infidelity but apparently no crisis, to be particularly memorable. These anecdotes are not just for mental titillation, but are used to support several tenets of dating advice. Here are just a few takeaways. Check your punctuation before you send a text. When you ask someone out on a date, include a specific time and location, not “wanna hang out some time?” vagueness. Texting people is not a reliable way to gauge if you’ll like them in person; it’s best to ask them out sooner and not prolong a meaningless texting conversation. Take the time to get to know people; seldom do you see the more interesting side of someone’s personality on a first date.As you can see, this book is quite a rare hybrid: part social science, and part self-help, and part comedy. And yet the book rarely feels disorganized or scatterbrained. Aziz keeps a tight rein on his materials; the writing is compact, clever, and informative. With the notable limitation that this book deals only with heterosexual couples, and covers no topic in serious depth, I can say that it’s hard for me to imagine how any such short book could give so complete a picture of modern romance. Most impressive is the human touch. What could have potentially been a mere smattering of facts and stories, Aziz makes into a coherent whole by grounding everything in the day-to-day frustrations and realities of the dating world. Aziz knows firsthand how much dating can suck, how tiresome, uncomfortable, and stressful it can be. Yet, for all this, the book is ultimately hopeful. Behind all these shifts in values and demographics, all the innovations in dating technologies and changes in romantic habits, all the horror stories and the heartbreaks—beyond the lipstick and the cologne, the collared shirts and high heeled shoes, the loud music and the strong liquor—is the universal human itch to connect. This itch has always been with us and always will be. Each generation just learns to scratch it in new and interesting ways.(To any interested parties, please direct all inquiries to my mom.)"
19,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1416912-trudi,4,"I've been so behind on my reviewing these days, but I had so much fun with this one I wanted to make sure I didn't let it fall through the dark cracks into the swirling abyss where my non-reviewed books go. I'm a huge fan of Ansari. I think he's cute as a button and funny as goddamn hell. I watched him in Parks & Rec, his most recent Netflix original Master of None (which I highly recommend), and thoroughly enjoy his stand-up concerts. He's not at the same level as Louis CK or Patton Oswalt, but he's also a lot younger than these gentlemen who have been honing their dark and brilliant comedy for decades now.Modern Romance is not your typical ""comedian writes a book"" fare. It's not a memoir, or a book filled with ruminations on the life of a comedian. It's a thinky piece, backed up by real sociological research, with pie charts and everything! Ansari's approach to breaking down the ins and outs of dating and hooking up and settling down in the 21st century is as intriguing and compelling as it is infectious and informative. I loved every minute of it. The layout is light and breezy, and super accessible without distilling and dumbing down the subject matter too much as to be insulting to its audience. Ansari wants to make you laugh, make no mistake, but he's also very earnest in his desire to tell you what he's learned. And can I just say I find all of it utterly FASCINATING. I'm addicted to ""meet cute"" stories (even though I would never consider myself a romantic, and have an averse reaction to rom-com movies -- that make me break out in hives). But how people meet and when they decide ""to put a ring on it"" (or not) can always get my attention. I have to check myself from being perpetually nosy all of the time, getting the ""deets"" on all this stuff from my friends, both of the online and the in real life variety. For me, this book is too short. With its laudable success my hope is that Ansari will be compelled to pen a follow-up, because if there's one thesis that comes chiming out loud and clear here, it's that the 21st century dating world is changing fast, at warp speed, impacting how we communicate with one another, form bonds and friendships, and take that scary running leap into ""the big commitment"". A lot of the current research being done is showing that the bonds we form online, platonic or otherwise, can no longer be dismissed so easily as superficial and suffering by comparison to those we forge ""IRL"" (in real life). I do believe most of us on this site would concur that social media has opened up a ""brave new world"" that's not just brighter and more vibrant, but has proven increasingly successful in bringing colorful people into our lives that we otherwise would not have known existed, friendships that we now rely upon and cherish. And that ""modern romance"" is blooming out of those virtual connections should really be coming as no surprise to anyone. Ansari does an excellent job of pointing out the pros and cons of modern romance in the 21st century in all its tech'd out, geeked out splendor. We now have more choice than ever before, all at our fingertips with the click of a button or the swipe of a screen, but that landslide of choices might also be paralyzing some of us into making any choice at all. Our standards and expectations for a lifelong partnership might have been raised to exceptionally high, unreasonable levels too. With all that choice at our fingertips, why would we settle for anything less than AMAZING? That perfect ""soul mate"" who is going to fulfill every single one of our needs every day for the rest of our days. Pfft, people you know this: that person does not exist. But it's not all bad news. Technology has not ruined romance for us living in the 21st century. In fact, for many of us, especially women -- things have improved vastly. Not because of the tech component, but because women are no longer expected to settle down as early as possible. We can invest in our careers now, and date more and live life as a single, learning about ourselves and the things that are going to make us happy if we do decide to pair off. There are many areas (due to space constraints) that this book by necessity leaves unaddressed or goes light on, and Ansari is very good about pointing those out at the beginning. One thing missing for me is a breakdown of dating from an extrovert versus introvert point of view. I think our current technology has been an absolute miracle and marvel to introverts who struggle to put themselves out there in the real world of bars and supermarkets and church basements, but are absolutely charming and brave and socially high functioning on the interwebs. It's been an essential transition for that half of the human population to discover their ""tribe"" and connect in meaningful ways to people it would have been extremely unlikely they would have ever met IRL. (and it's here I'm going to put a plug in for Felicia Day's memoir You're Never Weird on the Internet who also describes this ""social revolution"" for introverts in a way that resonated with me completely).So in case it isn't obvious by now, I loved this book and I think everyone should read it, young/old, guy/girl, married/single. While it's easy to despair of the human race, and we know there are too many assholes and unforgivable idiots and sneaky jerkfaces running around out there, human behaviour and why we do the shit we do is still endlessly fascinating, isn't it? I think so.  "
20,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4881551-rachelbianca,4,"Ok, so I picked this up thinking this was going to be a Aziz Ansari version of a Steve Harvey book. You know the kind with advice like ""Ladies, don't call him back right away!"" kind of thing. This is not that kind of book. Ansari worked with a sociologist to look at love in the modern age. He covers everything from texting to sexting to Tinder and how love/romance has changed due to technology. I really like that the book took a more academic approach. Because it's Aziz, it's also still funny. If you've seen his standup or enjoy him on Parks & Rec, you will enjoy the tone of the writing, it really comes across well in print. Overall, a great, fun read. And for the single people out there, great fodder for chatter on a first date :D "

Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestThere are a lot of books that I am interested in reading but don't really get around to unless the book is selected by a book club or for a buddy read. This is because sites like Amazon and Goodreads have made the whole prospect of choosing a book so stressful. Up-and-coming books, out-of-print books, esoteric books from small presses - there are so many options. Before Goodreads, I would select books based on the cover, the synopsis on the back cover, and whether I recognized the author (usually from a magazine or a friend/family member's suggestion). Now? I have books thrown at me from all directions in the form of ebook sales, ARCs, and thrift shops, and it's so overwhelming, because there are so many books I want to read, and I have a finite amount of time to get through them all. It's frustrating, to say the least.Why is this relevant? Because Aziz Ansari takes this same concept: the infinite permutations of options offered to us in the digital age and the difficulty of prioritizing or selecting between them. Only, instead of books, he applies it to dating and relationships. When we use dating apps, we're exposed to way more people than we would ever encounter in real life (sometimes, in the case of d*ck pics, 'exposed' in the literal sense), in cities that we have never personally been to, with interests way outside of our own social groups.While this is compelling, and in some cases - especially in the cases of those with specific sexual needs/desires or niche hobbies - extremely beneficial, Ansari argues that this can actually be detrimental for others. He argues that in the old days, people often married someone they knew, and became complacent about their partner, with a sense of compansionship that occurred later on from shared history and interests. In the modern age, people are far less willing to settle down, he argues, constantly wondering what's behind that figurative door number two. Is it someone better? Are we missing out? Digital dating might help us find people, but it also makes us less willing to stay with people, and can enable us to cheat or indulge in flaky behavior like text breakups or flimsy plans.I was expecting this to be a dating memoir, so you could cover me shocked when I found out that one of my favorite male comedians was writing a semi-scientific book about dating habits in the modern age (hence the title), with a focus group he created, information gleaned from a subreddit set up by him, and many, many studies cited from actual sociologists and psychologists, and literature I'm actually acquainted with, such as Barry Schwartz'z PARADOX OF CHOICE and Sheena Iyengar's THE ART OF CHOOSING (both must-reads, even if you're not a psych major). I studied psychology in college because I love finding out what makes people tick. I knew this was going to be good.And it was!Ansari covers a wide variety of topics, starting from how older people in his focus groups met their spouses and what their motiviations for marriage were, and what their courtship rituals looked like. He discusses various dating sites at length, as well as their humble origins in speed dating and video dating, as well as touching upon hookup culture. He also talks about what dating looks like in different parts of the world. He discusses the U.S., but also what dating looks like in Qatar, in Argentina, in Japan, and in France, and how their attitudes are changing in the modern age, as well.While this book is drier than some would like, I think it's especially relevant to anyone who has dated in the 21st century or anyone who rolls their eyes at people who say, ""I just can't find anyone"" when they live in a city with several million people for being overdramatic. Finding people is hard. Finding people to settle down with is even harder. Ansari manages to take a very complicated topic and do an admirable job of examining it from multiple perspectives, while also keeping it fresh with light humor that I imagined him delivering in a Tom Haverford sort of tone.P.S. When Ansari talks about the present his girlfriend his girlfriend got him for their 1 year, I smiled so hard my cheeks hurt. 3.5 stars!"
22,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1902630-jokoloyo,4,"This book is more insightful than I first anticipated. It is a funny book indeed, but the focus group discussions and other researches that discussed in this book are good for my own thinking and introspection."
23,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14066678-christina,4,"3.5 stars, but I rounded up, just because Aziz is hilarious.This was really a very interesting read. Obviously well researched and very insightful. It was funny, for me, reading about the way romance was done before the technology we have today and in modern times, because I went through my teens in a gap time I guess. I grew up in the 90's and early 00's, so I didn't have my own cell phone until I was closer to an adult and even these days, I'm not big into social media (GR is about it for my social media life). So I guess I kind of got to experience some of both dating times. This book also made me supremely happy that I'm already in a relationship and not dealing with the single life games. Definitely worth the read, and I think that no matter anyone's relationship status, everyone can find something to take from this."
24,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6753400-gabrielle,4,"This is a more serious book than the cover or author could lead one to believe: I think Ansari is hilarious, and I was pleasantly surprised by the blend of humor and social sciences to be found in this often funny, but sometimes painful, look at modern dating culture. As a student of history, I was well aware that the very idea of romance is fairly modern, marriages having basically been business transactions for thousands of years. But post-Industrial Revolution Western society quickly became pretty obsessed with romance, the idea of true love, the idealization of the nuclear family (though it wasn’t called that at the time) and all that stuff. I have always been skeptical of those ideas, as any properly embittered child of divorce/dysfunctional family would be, I guess.I grabbed a copy of this book at the used bookstore after Joe’s enthusiastic review, mostly because I was really curious to see if my experience was in any way, shape or form “normal”. I have often wondered what it must have been like dating before all these digital means of communications I take for granted.Reviewing this book seems to beg for an executive summary of one’s experience with dating in the digital age, so here goes (I put it in spoiler tags in case you just want my review, and not my overshare)!(view spoiler)[ As of the writing of this review, I am 34 and have been happily married for almost 3 years. Like a lot of people of my “generation” (I believe I am what is known as an “elder millennial”), I met my husband on an online dating site. He isn’t the first guy I’ve met that way: two relationships I had prior to Jason were also the results of OkCupid dates. I had decided to investigate that option for meeting people because my social circle offered no interesting options (despite the best efforts of some), and I was horrified by the idea of dating someone I would have met at work. I had been told by a few (older) colleagues to simply do out and do things I liked and that I would inevitably meet someone doing those things… Well, I like reading, cooking and going to punk shows; the first two are solitary activities and the third is usually in a setting when you can’t hear yourself think, let alone hear what someone else is saying. So I created an OkCupid profile (not Tinder, because after seeing “The Social Network”, the swiping thing reminded me too much of Zuckerberg’s early experiments with websites that rated women based on their looks - the thought of which makes me ill).And let’s be honest here: I hated online dating. It was a frustrating and often psychologically rattling process; but it was still better than meeting someone at a bar or other random place because I could actually screen for basic mutual interests and dig a little bit deeper than simple physical attraction (which, while admittedly important, is not enough for me; I need intellectual stimulation!). It also made for a few very entertaining stories about how painful it is to meet new people when you are a mostly introverted person who has a weird tendency to speak your mind and doesn’t really care what people think.Here is a list of things I learned/experienced on various OkCupid email exchanges and dates – most of which are touched upon in the book:-Being ghosted by someone because they found a random detail on your profile that is an arbitrary deal-breaker for them is a frequent and always puzzling occurrence. You’ll never know what the problem was, which will only make you feel insecure because now everything is potentially wrong with you. Hurray.-The ""hey"" message, with zero effort, context or content. I'd actually made a point to write in my profile that I ignored such messages, but got a ton of them anyway. Go figure.-Telling someone you had a great time on the second date apparently means you are clingy, and hinting you’d like to get to know someone you enjoy spending time with is a huge demand to impose on that person; unless they are instantly smitten, it’s not worth their time. Play hard to get all the time! Sigh.-Being asked by random guys (whom, to put it mildly, aren’t models) how much you weigh before they commit to meeting you for a cup of coffee is a real thing (they are afraid of being disappointed when they meet you face to face, you see), but don’t you dare ask them about the size of their junk in retaliation, because they’ll take that very badly! What if I am afraid to be disappointed when I take off their pants? Double-sigh for double standards.-Being open about your sexuality means you want unsolicited dick pics and creepy messages; not wanting to talk about sex means you are boring and a hypocrite. Yup, this is also still a thing. Or at least it was in 2014.-If the person you met is not 1000% perfect after a couple of dates, it’s perfectly ok to hump and dump because hook up culture exists and sex is meaningless (wait, what?!), and something better will come along if you just click a few more times… Human beings are now disposable goods, and being unreasonably picky is excused by the fact that the next date is just a swipe away. Besides, you went on that date, so you knew it was assumed there would be “road-test” sex, right? Urgh…-Speaking of dumping, I have been dumped by means of text message, email, Facebook and ghosting. Because that’s easier than saying to someone’s face you don’t want to be with them anymore, I suppose (though one break up message I once got contained such nasty and hurtful things that it's probably better he didn't say that to my face, I would have hit him with a chair). People are terrified of that conversation, and somehow think that not “technically” having it absolves them from being the “bad guy”. As if breaking up with someone in such a shitty and impersonal way made you a good guy…-I once sent a guy a message telling him I liked the Black Flag t-shirt he wore on his profile pic. And that’s all I meant. “Hey man, nice t-shirt! Black Flag rules!” He replied thanks and deleted his profile: to this day, I am convinced he was afraid I’d steal the t-shirt if we ever met.I was really, really getting sick of all that when I met Jason: ironically, I had just told a friend “I think I’ll have to marry the next one, cuz I can’t deal with this shit anymore!”. Ha! We went for a beer at a pub, talked about music we both loved (someone else who worshiped Henry Rollins and who knew who Maynard James Keenan was; I was impressed!) and books, and agreed to meet for a second date, which consisted of a walk around the city to see a series of artsy light-show installations followed by a drink. For the third date, I made us dinner at my place and we watched “Goon” and laughed at all the crass hockey jokes. We kissed on the fourth date (so old-fashioned of us, I know!) and got married about a year and a half later (it was a tiny, super casual wedding because we both hate weddings… and being the center of attention… and having our picture taken…). There have been ups and downs, because of life being weird and complicated (and because we have different citizenships and bureaucracy is batshit insane), but at the risk of sounding like a sap, he’s the best thing ever, and I can’t imagine life without him around. No matter what is going on, knowing I’ll go to sleep next to him makes everything better and manageable.Jason and I have often reflected about the fact that we both feel we “won” at online dating; and by “winning”, we both mean never having to fucking do it again (he also had interesting, albeit less traumatizing, experiences with the process). The odds of us meeting without the damn thing were next to nil, so we are grateful OkCupid was there when we needed it. But holy cow, did it ever suck sometimes…  (hide spoiler)]Back to the book. One of my favorite things about it was that after many a marathon of ""Parks and Rec"", I could hear Ansari's hysterical nasal voice in my head as I read, and his hilarious phrasing often made me snort in my teacup. Writing entertaining non-fiction is not easy, and he nailed it. It also makes the book extremely readable: I breezed through it in just a couple of days.I completely agree with Ansari’s thoughts about how texting and other such messaging systems de-humanize some communications, in the sense that they facilitate rudeness and flakiness in a way that voice-on-voice interaction never could. Casual rudeness in emails and text messages is one of my biggest pet peeves, and was often a deal-breaker when it came to messaging potential dates: you can’t be bothered to say “hi, how are you” huh? Deleted. I actually wish I could block co-workers who can’t be bothered to be polite by emails as easily as I did with blokes on OkCupid, but alas... In the context of dating, I always tried to meet people face to face quickly, because let's face it, you are not the same person in written form that you are when you have to actually speak to someone standing in front of you: my reasoning was if I was going to date someone, chance are we'd spend a lot of time hanging out, so it was better to find out quickly how they were in person vs. on messenger. It was interesting to see that online dating expert think people should keep messaging to a minimum and meet up in real life asap. I also completely agree that Women's Liberation was a game-changer when it came to dating and marriage, because that's when the rules of the game (for lack of a better phrasing) really changed: no longer needing marriage to leave the parental home meant women could wait and experience the world in unprecedented ways before settling down.I was very interested in the chapters about how the online dating experience differs between men and women: I mean, I knew it was basically night and day, but it was nice to explore the hows and whys people's behaviors and responses. The process takes its toll on both genders, but for wildly different reasons. I also find it really interesting that paradoxically, having more options makes things more difficult and less satisfying for people looking for love; it probably doesn't help that there is a trend towards a tendency to compare people we meet with an imaginary ideal partner no one can live up to... Especially when people don't want to invest any time in getting to know other people.The obsession with “soul mates”, “true love that lasts for ever” and all that stuff is definitely a bi-product of a ton of pop-culture (rom-coms, Disney and radio-friendly adult rock… barf!), but it’s also a reaction to seeing parents and grandparents endure less than perfect marriages with clenched jaws and thinking to ourselves “I will never be in a relationship like that”. It’s an understandable reaction, especially given the fact that getting married was often the only way to respectably leave the parental home for previous generations, but it overshadows the fact that any emotional bond between human beings changes and evolves with time – and keeping a long-term romantic relationship healthy and interesting requires effort, patience and compromise from both partners. What I learned dating in my twenties was that people are, well, kind of lazy!Now the book is fairly superficial: it doesn’t dig very deep into any of the issues it discusses. For instance, I was already well aware that we live in a society that’s all about instant gratification and that most people now see their relationships with other humans in that light: I would have liked to know how we got here! It also very specifically targets heterosexual singles who are mostly middle class, and it's relatively male-centrist, but I expected that - I would have appreciated more women-specific data. The chapters on how people date in other cultures was also interesting, but I was disappointed that his exploration of French culture was focused pretty much exclusively on cheating; it felt a little one-sided. That being said, I think he is right in concluding that while dating now might be harder in many ways than it was for say, our grandparents, chances of meeting someone who is a better match are higher than it was for them. That is, if we are not total bozos when it comes to sexting...A fun and surprisingly informative read with a lot of thought-provoking points. Anyone who has experienced online dating would find this interesting. 3 and a half, rounded up."
25,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,4,"Aziz has written a book on romance and dating in the 21st Century and he wants us all to take him seriously. I know what you're thinking, and so did Aziz, ""Another comedian book, another fluffed out 200 page book with anecdotes that probably didn't happen"". This is not that type of book at all.Aziz was interested in how dating works these days and decided to team up with a proper social scientist to do some research. And it seems like he was heavily invested in it all. The new research that Aziz and Eric Kbinenberg did was mainly anecdotal, consisting of focus groups and online questionnaires, but it still gave fascinating data and resulted in a lot of thought. Interspersed is other research pertaining to aspects that the authors were discussing. It all made for a different mix of anecdotes, researched social science and Aziz being a goofy ding dong through the whole book.I guess that mix would piss off some readers. It really is intended for a casual audience, but one that still likes data and research. But anyone critical of their methods or the style of the book should not be whingeing at all, it's all spelled out clearly in the introduction. So it was even a hit with an old guy like me, who has been in a monogamous relationship for just over a decade. My partner laughed that I was looking for tips. But it really had some strong conclusions that would be very helpful to the young's of today. And it's good to know it was balanced in that it admitted that technology has helped dating so much, and has also hindered it in other ways."
26,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22699228-matthew-quann,5,"Are you single?Are you in a relationship?Do you use a cellphone?Have you ever had a conversation with someone older or younger than you about technology ruining/not ruining society? Do you ever wonder why people don't text you back within moments of you texting them despite the fact that you can see that they've read the text? If any of this applies to you, then you need to do yourself a favour and dig into Aziz Ansari's book. This gorgeously bound book beautifully dodges all the pitfalls of a nonfiction book by being relentlessly funny, and avoids being lumped in with books by comedians by being supremely educational.  First, a confession: I've become an immense Aziz Ansari acolyte over the course of the Autumn. I watched all of ""Master of None"" when it premiered on Netflix and would easily place it as one of my favourite shows of the year. So, when I heard that Ansari had written a book with a renowned sociologist about love and romance? I was sold and primed to enjoy the read long before it came into my hands as a Christmas gifts. So, fair warning, I loved this one, this will be a standing-O of a review. Ansari spent a year traveling the globe, polling and questioning people about love and romance from a wide swath of age ranges. What he found out was pretty interesting. The statistics presented in this volume are on high quality paper with great looking graphs (pretty much what everyone in your local bookstore is hunting for when flipping through covers). Though I'll admit that many nonfiction books can end up being an endless fact slog, Ansari makes esoteric sociological jargon accessible through his illustrative, and often humorous, explanations. You'll be able to grasp sociological concepts quickly through ludicrous examples, and statistics are presented to illustrate huge gaps and differences between expected and experimental results. The stats are never difficult to interpret or require extensive head-scratching. If this all sounds a bit heady, fret not casual reader, for Ansari is talking about stuff that you deal with everyday! I found the section on texting etiquette in burgeoning relationships to be eye-opening and applicable outside of the realm of romance. The examination of other cultures' dating scenes was both interesting and helpful to illustrate universal norms between cultures. What's more, the material throughout grounds the seemingly-mundane experiences of searching for relationships and moving into long-term relationships by acknowledging that no one is alone in these experience. To conclude: read this book. You'll not be disappointed if you are a fan of Ansari's humour, and the nigh-ubiquitous subject matter makes it an easy recommendation for your struggling single 20-something friend and your middle-aged parent. I had neat conversations with my grandparents about how they met and spoke with my parents about how social media changes the way in which we meet. The only limitation to the entire book is that it deals exclusively with heterosexual relationships, with only the odd touch on LTBGQ relationships. With that said, I can't recommend this book enough. It is funny, educational, and heartfelt. This will not disappoint you, dive in head first. "
27,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11644154-la-lionne,2,"Omg what fucking yawnfest. I'm so pissed at how misleading the book description is. In it this book is called ""hilarious"". Can someone point me to the hilarious part in the book? All it got out of me was couple of giggles and a snort. DNF at 50%.I just want to say that I'm fan of Ansari, as an actor and a comedian, but this book felt more like a lecture, with a couple of giggle-worthy comments thrown in. The book is not badly written, at all. Aziz uses a lot research and material from interviews to back his statements up. But it is as dry as a schoolbook. It's crammed with all sorts of reaserch stuff and Ansari's comedic voice is barely there. Another thing that pissed me off, and this is a biggy, that Ansari chose to not include LGBT community in his book. His reason behind the choise was that it's a whole another thing and he could write a whole another book about the community. That different aspects of dating apply to this group of people and he simply wouldn't be able to do justice. I call it bullshit. LGBT is not a group of people from different species! Why did author really excluded this group? Do they date differently? Have different chalanges while looking for a partner? React differently after being stood up? Have different values? Fall in love differently? Don't get heartbroken after a break up? Don't use Internet or mobile divices to communicate with others? Why? What is the reason LGBT got excluded? His reasons for exclusion of LGBT community applies more to Amish people, not LGBT."
28,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4292640-chuddchutney-buana,4,"There's a reason why Goodreads aptly put this book in a non-fiction category in this year Goodreads Choice Awards, while it could've easily been in the humor section. The thing is, much like his brilliant new series Master of None, the comedy's there, but not as a central point. Instead, it was being used as an accessory for Aziz to make an interesting topic become more engaging.If there's one downside is that the book can be repetitive at times. He often wrote something that was pretty much in lieu with what he already pointed down few chapters before.But overall, this book open my eyes in how the modern world has bern evolving today, and in a very entertaining manner. Too bad it's late for me to vote for this in the non-fiction category."

I really like this! It was super interesting and I feel like I learned a lot about the history of romance and how it's changed with technology. Being a person who was been off the market since 2006, a lot of this stuff was news to me, lol - I really enjoyed how Aziz talked to people of all ages and all around the world. This is not your typical comedian-memoir book and that is a great thing. I definitely recommend if you are a fan of Aziz from Parks & Rec or his standup!"

Anyway, this was an excellent first book of the year. I can’t even tell you how refreshing it is to read a book written by a celebrity that isn’t a self-obsessed money grab that makes too much of too little (if any) substance. It’s also well-written. And entertaining. And informative. And helpful!Several years ago when Aziz Ansari was putting together some stand-up routines that involved material on modern dating, he asked around to see if there were any comprehensive books on the subject. When it turned out that there weren’t, he decided to take on the project himself. He teamed up with sociologist Eric Klinenberg to not only write the book, but engage in original research that mostly took the form of focus groups held over the course of 2013-2014, as well as the occasional audience member he would pull up during a set. He even traveled to select other countries to get a feel for the dating practices of different cultures (he chose Tokyo, France and Argentina).The resulting book is by no means comprehensive. He acknowledges from the start that the mainly focused on heterosexual, middle class romantic behaviors–they would have had to write a whole separate book just for LGBT dating culture to do it justice. In fact, the book is meant to be on the general side, to paint a picture of the dating landscape as a whole. Niche specifics don’t really enter into it. Most everything in the book can be applied to most types of relationship, regardless of the sex/gender of the partners. What it does cover is the basics. How we meet people, how that’s changed over the last 100 years or so. How technology impacts relationships and dating. The anatomy of a first date. Just a whole bunch of stuff.The best part is the way that Aziz conveys all this information. He does it professionally and in a way that gives him credibility, but the voice is all his. Especially if you do the audio version, which I highly recommend. He likes to berate the listener every once in a while for listening instead of reading, like when he’s trying to describe a picture or a graph, or at the end of the book when he finishes by calling you a lazy fuck. But, like, in an affectionate way. It’s very entertaining.My respect and liking for Aziz Ansari has only risen after reading this book, and it was already pretty high. I hope he does more out of the box stuff like this in the future. It’s a good look on him."

It is super funny and you learn a lot. It lead to great discussions between my boyfriend and I. I highly suggest listening to this or reading this as a partner read, because there is a lot of fun stuff you'll want to discuss :)"
33,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11172432-marla-mei,4,"Thank God for Aziz Ansari. Also, I really regret not having an audiobook version of this book. "
34,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41218534-erica,3,"I love Aziz and his stance of women's rights. I really enjoyed that he went an alternate route to many other comedians and wrote a book about something that interested him, rather than a memoir."
35,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2120450-julie-ehlers,4,"Perhaps I should start by saying that I barely know who Aziz Ansari is. I've never seen any of his stand-up acts, I've watched maybe 15 total minutes of Parks and Recreation, and I can't even think of anything else I might have seen him in. I wanted to read Modern Romance because I've done some online dating and I'm planning to do a little more soon, so I thought it would be helpful to read some perspectives on how the internet and smartphones have changed the dating landscape. Granted, this book is probably meant for people somewhat younger than me, but I'm thinking that this time around I'm going to respond to some of the younger men who message me, so I figured this book would still be useful. :)Modern Romance is far from just some comedic riff on the topic, however. Ansari actually teamed up with sociologist/author Eric Klinenberg and conducted focus groups and large online studies on how dating has changed from the days before everyone was online. The book includes chapters on dating sites and apps, what works and what doesn't when messaging people, what works and what doesn't when actually going out, sexting, cheating, and various related topics. It also looks briefly at a few other cities/countries with dating cultures very different from the U.S.: Paris, Buenos Aires, Tokyo, and Qatar. There was a lot of interesting information presented here, and it was presented in an extremely entertaining fashion. I can't even entirely explain what made this book so readable, but I didn't want to put it down and read it really quickly (for me). It also helps that Ansari is FUNNY. Like I said, I wasn't familiar with his work and I had my doubts about whether this book would really be that humorous... but trust me when I say the dude is FUNNY. Reading an entertaining and informative book is of course an even better experience when it's punctuated by bouts of uncontrollable laughter.I do have a couple complaints about the book. One is that it's geared somewhat more toward men than women. This effect is generally subtle but occasionally becomes quite noticeable, as when Ansari talks about the lecherous culture of Buenos Aires, and the fact that a lot of women have a hard time in this culture is treated as an afterthought. Ansari also seems to think that people have two modes in life: We're either in a committed relationship, or we're out in the bar scene all the time, meeting lots of different people and having lots of casual hookups, which are studded (no pun intended) with periods of quiet desperation and emptiness when we stumble home drunk and alone at 3 a.m. and fall asleep with a half-eaten burrito on our chest. There's a lot of middle ground between these two extremes, and it would have been nice if Ansari had talked a bit about enjoying your time as a single person and using it to cultivate other interests, as opposed to just hound-dogging around. But this is a book about dating, so I suppose I can't complain too much.Overall, I really enjoyed Modern Romance and feel like I learned a lot. I would definitely recommend it for people who are dating, but people who aren't dating would probably have a good time reading this as well. And hopefully the online daters who read this book will follow Ansari's advice, because as far as I'm concerned it's all good.I won this book in a First Reads giveaway here on Goodreads."
36,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/188447-jessica-jeffers,4,"I’m going to be honest. 99% of the reason I put this book on hold at the library was because of my ridiculous devotion to Parks and Rec. I’m obsessed, to the point that I actually quoted the show in my wedding vows and was introduced at the reception to the theme song. So Aziz Ansari puts out a book, I figure I ought to read it. I initially expected that this would be a collection of humorous essays based on Ansari’s stand-up, much of which is focused on the inanities of modern dating. But then I saw him on The Daily Show and I realized that uh, no, this is straight-up, honest-to-goodness social science research that Ansari teamed up with a sociologist to work on.Ansari and co-author Eric Kleinberg convened focus groups around the world and conducted interviews and combed through research on the topic of dating and how it’s changing in the 21st century. What do we want from a partner, how do we find a partner, how do we go about keeping that partner. The book is broken up into chapters on various aspects of dating – the art of the text message, why Tinder took off – in which he summarizes their findings and then offers advice on what works best based on those findings. A lot of it seems very common sense to me, but maybe that’s because I haven’t navigated 21st century dating all that much? I started dating my first boyfriend when I was 17 and we broke up when I was 25. I realized that I had no idea how dating worked, so I pretty quickly jumped into a relationship with a guy in my friend group. When it turned out to have been the worst mistake I’d ever made, I pretty much exclusively met guys through OK Cupid. Work wasn’t an option and my friend group wasn't much help, so I figured that was the best way to go about it. I did that off and on for about two years before I met my husband. Funny story – we’d lived two doors down from each other for an entire year and never crossed paths until I moved to a new neighborhood and he joined OK Cupid. We are like the poster children for why online dating can be a good thing. But I also experienced all the shitty things that Ansari talks about in this book. Online dating can suuuuuck. Because there are a zillion options and finding someone who stands out can be hard when literally all the dudes in the Philadelphia suburbs were business majors at Penn State and liked 5ks, homebrewing, and the Phillies. There are guys who send you messages asking about your bikini wax or your cleavage, there are guys who never want to go beyond emailing through the website, and there are guys who look at your profile and never reply your witty, charming message. Ansari pointed out how these frustrations are part of why Tinder has taken off and, interestingly enough, how it makes dating a little more like it used to be fifty years ago, when your pool was pretty much exclusively folks in a six-block radius. He also talks about how it’s gone from an app used to find casual hookups to more or less the primary way singles meet in urban areas. He also takes a quick spin through how dating varies in smaller towns in the Midwest (fewer options and you’re likely to have known them all since kindergarten) and other countries. I was particularly fascinated (and horrified) by the chapter on texting, because I feel like I am practically the only person in the world who hates texting. It works in some situations, but dating is super not one of them. Having a long, getting-to-know-you conversation spread out over the course of the entire day as the dude has a chance to check his phone instead of a half-hour chat before bed was the worst. You don’t get to know people over text. You can’t convey tone, you can’t play off the other person’s responses to you, and you’re lucky if you get a response in a reasonable amount of time. It’s such an impetus to actually getting to know someone and I hate that it’s now the standard in communication. I recently saw an article somewhere in which a 22-year-old girl claimed that it’s impossible to date without emojis and it physically hurt my brain. By the end of the chapter, I rolled over and I told my husband, “Promise me I’ll never have to be out there again.”(He totally knew the reference I was making, ‘cause he responded, “Okay Princess Leia. You never have to be out there again.” Have I mentioned that he’s the best?)Anyway, this is a quick, interesting, and occasionally quite funny read. A lot of it isn’t particularly groundbreaking – like I said, some of the advice extrapolated from the research seems like it ought to be common sense but maybe the reliance on emojis to communicate has begun to cripple our collective common sense – but I definitely enjoyed reading it. 3.5 stars."
37,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5745485-christopher,4,"What I expect when I pick up a book written by a comedian is basically an extended standup set molded into a memoir-ish structure. The last thing I expect is a legit sociological study of romance in the modern age contrasted with romance in previous ages. That's what this is. Really. Aziz teamed up with Eric Klinenberg, a dude I've never heard of but is a professor of sociology at NYU nonetheless, and they wrote a book together about how technology shapes our romantic interactions. I mean, this isn't going to go into the history books as the most academic study ever of technology's influence on culture, but that's what makes it a good book to read. There are jokes, there are funny digressions, but at its heart this is a very serious book. Aziz and this other dude draw real conclusions from real data that they got from actual nationally representative surveys that they conducted. The conclusions are not all that life-changing; it's mostly what you'd expect. Technology changed romance drastically, as it's changed all human interaction. It's not better or worse, really. It's just different. But the fact that this book exists is completely unexpected—a fresh and welcomed direction for comedians to take, in my opinion."
38,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6784858-alexandra,2,"super funny & easy to read, although some of aziz's jokes were insensitive imo. i liked how it was an informative novel about dating and it made me feel better on how to navigate our love lives in this digital age. the audiobook is also pretty hilarious since he adds some additional jokes, but it also gets too much at times. all-in-all a fairly enjoyable read!"
39,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16731747-calista,3,An interesting exploration of all the ways technology has changed the dating landscape. Aziz does a good job exploring all the different aspects of romance. He keeps it light with funny stories.

If you don't like reading, pick up the audiobook - Aziz reads it himself and does hilarious voices. There was some stuff I disagreed with (like the idea that infidelity should just be ""expected""), but there were also A LOT of good points, especially with regards to deal-breakers and impatience with new relationships.I picked up this book thinking it'd be another comedian writing funny stories, and was SO PLEASANTLY SURPRISED to be wrong. In this book, Aziz Ansari talks about ACTUAL sociological differences in dating in today's technologically-savvy society versus the generations past. With chapters on OkCupid, Tinder, and how to make online dating more effective, I feel like I learned some useful information I can apply to my own dating life. In addition, he touches on our generation's obsession with Soulmates and finding the Perfect Person for us, as opposed to generations past that looked for someone that would make a good companion (relationships that might not have started out romantically fueled but that could turn into romantic love later).I don't know. I liked this book a lot because STATISTICS and how it made me feel less like a loser with my lack of successful relationships, but the information I learned in it also made me want to give up technological dating (like OkCupid, Tinder, etc) and attempt to revert to the older-fashioned methods of actually meeting people through friends/family and local activities.I want my single friends to read this book to gain insight on what we might be doing wrong as a generation attempting to find love-at-first-sight instead of allowing relationships the time to blossom organically, and I want my attached/married friends (mostly those that have been out of the dating pool for years) to read this book so they understand what I mean when I talk about how overwhelming and hopeless finding someone can seem to someone searching for someone who could be just Good-But-Understandably-Flawed-In-Some-Ways in a society taught to look for someone Perfect.Seriously Read this book. It's worth the cost of it for the entertainment value (seriously, how much does it cost to go to the movie these days? This is comparable), and I want to have DISCUSSIONS about it."

That dude, while funny as hell, is not the guy I'd want to be 'splainin' Hot-Or-Not-esque swiping smartphone apps like Tinder and OkCupid. Well, okay, yeah, it kinda is Tom (and his Pitbull and Ja Rule pseudo-entourage), but really is Aziz: foodie comic, sharp observer of the romantic climate, and no 'playah' but happily involved in a two year-long exclusive dating relationship with an esteemed pastry chef***, teaming up with fellow foodie friend (and published sociologist) Eric Klinenberg to create a fun and informative look at 21st-century dating/marriage trends, both in the US and abroad. Peppered with first-hand focus-group research and bolstered by the studies of others renowned in the field, Ansari and Klinenberg have created a comedic/sociological hybrid that, while at times facile and slight, is consistently interesting. And though my online dating ship has long since sailed (been there, done that), it just might enlighten a few people (if only to show how ridiculous a hook-up text ""Wsup"" sounds like). And though skimpy on matters LGBT/Grindr-centric, some great glimpses at how the smartphone era has influenced Qatar (with its rigid moral stance on dating), Japan (whose populace is dwindling down to near-epidemic levels, despite the the ease in hook-ups smartphone dating apps afford), France (with, evidently, much more relaxed attitudes toward infidelity) and Argentina (where, in Buenos Aires, pay-by-the hour hotels abound). Overall, really fun read! Especially for those who hate sucky tacos! (Aziz, please: Ya gotta write a book on eating; your romance book made me hungry with all your foodie references).*** If the Daily News is to be believed ( http://m.nydailynews.com/entertainmen... ) Aziz needs to reread his own book, alas."
42,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10800225-maria,3,"I didn't like this book as much as I wanted to. Modern Romance tries to be both a humor book and a serious sociological investigation, and instead, it doesn't fully become either. The jokes felt flat and forced into paragraphs that were otherwise legitimate sociological research. So in some ways you have a massive research study that is dumbed-down with lighthearted jokes, or you have a humor book filled with data, statistics and graphs. Neither is as successful as it could have been. The most interesting part of the book to me was Ansari's investigation into the dating cultures of other countries, especially Japan. The focus groups he conducted in Japan shed light on some fascinating reasons behind the country's population decline, which seems to be growing into a national crisis. I wish he had devoted equal time to describing his investigations into the dating cultures of Buenos Aires, Doha and Paris.Overall, you can get the gist of this book from watching Ansari's stand-up routine at Madison Square Garden, which is on Netflix. While Ansari's book is a fun and lighthearted read, I don't think it will teach the reader anything they didn't know and modern romance already."

File it under Life on Earth: the Mating Habits of the 21st Century Youth.As a person who has just reached her fifth decade, this was just as mysterious as a watching a documentary on a recently discovered tribe in the darkest depths of the Amazon. I mean, I know how Amazonian indigeneous peoples and twenty-year old Americans mate in theory, but in practice?I have never seen Mr Ansari's stand-up or his performance in P&R, but I love his wit from this book. This book is hilarious AND educational! If Mr Ansari's comedy career ever tanks, I think he could teach sociologists how to present their material so that the average person can understand and appreciate it."

45,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h,3,"I'd rate this 3.5 stars.I'm a big Aziz Ansari fan, so when I saw that he had written a book giving his take on the good, the bad, and the ugly regarding romance in this day and age, I had to read it. But far from being just a repetitive set of riffs on dating, sexting, sex, breakups, etc., Ansari teamed up with a noted sociologist and other researchers, did a tremendous amount of work (including in-person and online focus groups all over the world), and provided a fairly comprehensive look at relationships, love, sex, and dating trends, complemented by his distinctive comedy style.""In the history of our species, no group has ever had as many romantic options as we have now. So, in theory, this should be a great thing. More options is better, right? Well. It's not that easy.""Ansari takes a look at the way different generations approached dating and choosing the person with whom to settle down, as well as how the advent of computer dating, personal ads, dating apps (like Match.com and Tindr), texting, and sexting have impacted relationships. He looks at how the so-called ""phone world"" (where all of us are so ruled by communicating via our phones) affects infidelity, paranoia, and snooping. And he also looks at dating and the relationship between the sexes in different societies, such as Qatar, Japan, France, and Argentina.While I didn't find most of what Ansari wrote about to be particularly shocking (except, perhaps, looking at certain statistics, like how many people in younger generations think it's okay to end a relationship via text or social media, yet don't want it done to them), but his spin on everything, punctuated by quotes from those who responded to focus groups or other inquiries conducted through the research for the book, is humorous, insightful, and in most cases, dead-on accurate.This is an interesting book with flashes of humor, rather than a humorous book with flashes of information, as you might expect simply seeing Ansari's face on the cover. If you go into this book knowing that, and are interested in just how much the dating world has changed through the years, you'll be surprised, enlightened, occasionally appalled, and entertained.

48,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50620706-alaina,5,"Treat Yo Self!I could not stop laughing to this audio book. I pretty much fell in love with whatever show Aziz was in. So, of course, I have wanted to read his books because if he can make me laugh in any TV show or movie he is in.. then he can definitely make me laugh in the books.I loved absolutely everything about Modern Romance. So it was written by Aziz and his partner Eric and boy did they do a ton of research for this book. It was really interesting to see how people meet and date within different cultures - then throw in some technology and everything changes. Now if you listen to the audio you don't get to see the charts and stuff that they put into the actual book but don't worry if Aziz is the narrator for your audiobook he will tell you every time there's a chart that you can't see it. Which honestly made me snort a little here and there or roll my eyes. Either way I had a smile on my face.Other than that it's hard not to realize that the dating world has changed since technology stepped in as a game player. Yeah, we text all the time. Or snap. Or instagram. I don't even call people on my phone unless I'm in danger or something. I think I called one of my friends because they wouldn't stop texting me and I was driving and she was like.. ""OMG WHAT'S WRONG? WHO PISSED YOU OFF? DO YOU NEED ALCOHOL?"" And I'm all like.. calm your tits I'm driving and you wont stop texting me. I'm at a god damn red light.. what the hell do you want?Yeah, so I would rather text than talk on the phone.. but I think that's the same for a lot of people nowadays. Overall, I really liked this book. I liked how Aziz told me I was lazy because I was listening to the audio instead of reading the actual book. Kudos for you. I was lazy.. but I was also working/cleaning while listening to this book.. so I guess I'll call it a truce."
49,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68136775-tess-taylor,4,"4- Modern Romance is Aziz Ansari's social psychology dissertation detailing how love and dating have changed with the rise of the technological era. Random, I know, but along with his research partner Eric Klinenberg, Aziz was able to put together a realistic snapshot of the contemporary dating scene that is both humorous and insightful. I learned, I laughed, and I got some great international culinary tips. This is definitely worth the read.(I recommend the audiobook, even though Aziz will absolutely berate your ""lazy ass,"" it's worth it to hear the book with his distinct expression.) "
50,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5858699-kavita,4,"Romance, sex and relationships are concepts that have existed since forever. But the way we express them have changed from one generation to the next. How is our current generation dealing with this problem? Is romantic behaviour the same all over the world, or are there major differences in different places? How has technology changed romance for the new generation? These are questions that Aziz Ansari has attempted to answer in his book.I enjoyed reading this book immensely. I also learned a LOT about the sexual / romantic behaviours of people around the world. The data collected is extensive, but I still think there are some generalisations in the book. But as a pop culture overview of this subject, I think Ansari did a fabulous job. The anecdotes of people's personal lives, as well as his own, only added to the book's charm.Two things that stood out for me in this book:1 - Ansari is my kind of comedian. I got most of his jokes, though the American cultural references lost me a few times. But apart from this small problem, his wittiness and humour were fantastic. And not demeaning to anyone.2 - Ansari's feminism shone through clearly. He does not hesitate in calling a spade a spade and refuses to normalise bad behaviour, violence and sexism. It is genuinely refreshing to read about romance by an author who treats men and women as equal and acknowledges the challenges that patriarchy throws into people's relationships.And a bonus is that Ansari is of Indian origin but he made no claims of being Indian or of understanding what Indian society is like. I appreciate this very much. In closing, I think I will just repeat Ansari's conclusion: For me the takeaway of these stories is that, no matter how many options we seem to have on our screens, we should be careful not to lose track of the human beings behind them. We’re better off spending quality time getting to know actual people than spending hours with our devices, seeing who else is out there."
51,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17957823-erin,4,"Nowadays the Internet is my chubby friend. It is the whole world's chubby friend.   I think I picked this book up after seeing Aziz Ansari on Jimmy Fallon and I'm so glad that I read it. My ribs hurt from laughing so much as Aziz and Eric Klineberg take readers through the ups and downs of today's quest for modern romance. I felt that this book is going to resonate more with today's singles who are dealing with online dating sites and apps or have gone through that dating process, but there is certainly lots of information that people might enjoy if they're seeking to understand why their lone single pal might be struggling to find a mate. Since I'm the single thirty something in my very married group of friends this really resonated with me. Definitely a favorite read of this year!"

56,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,4,"This fun and breezy book is a window not only into the social mores of modern dating but into some of the ways in which technology has impacted the way we think and interact.Aziz starts out by exploring the ways in which dating has changed in just a few decades. Whereas adults once expected to get married in their early twenties, today they tend to spend that decade exploring a variety of options before settling down (maybe) in their late twenties or early thirties. Unlike those in earlier generations who were happy to select from a limited pool and settle down with a good-enough spouse for a companionate marriage, people today tend to seek their soul mates and want a marriage that will be instantaneously passionate and fulfill a wide range of lofty expectations -- a set-up for inevitable disappointment, some scholars say. The protocol of asking someone out has changed as well. The rise of texting has led, it seems, to heightened anxiety about actually calling a prospective date. Texting also tends to depersonalize the other person and disinhibit the texter, and texts can be highly embarrassing or, perhaps worse, generic and noncommittal. Texting can also result in an endless and unproductive back-and-forth before people actually meet, and some confusion about whether the person is being asked to ""hang out"" or asked out on a real date. When the dater is actually interested in the person, a whole lot of mind games ensue (e.g., how long to wait before texting back, the length of your texts vs. the length of their texts, etc.). Then, there's the question of how to respond if you're not interested in dating the person who texted you. Etiquette just gets more and more complicated, it seems.Aziz goes on to discuss online dating and the impact of having exponentially more dating choices. ""That's the thing about the Internet,"" says Aziz. ""It doesn't simply help us find the best thing out there; it has helped to produce the idea that there is a best thing and, if we search hard enough, we can find it...we live in a culture that tells us we want and deserve the best, and now we have the technology to get it."" We have an unprecedented number of romantic options today, but is having more choices a good thing? Aziz explains the concepts of maximizers, people who do a rigorous amount of research to seek out the best, and satisficers, who are happy to make do with good-enough. In today's day and age, with the Internet, why not be a maximizer, right? Interestingly, research has found that with regard to jobs, maximizers put more time and effort into their job search and land better jobs but are less satisfied with them. Satisficers, on the other hand, have jobs that seem worse on paper but actually report higher job satisfaction. What happens is that the maximizers, who research a large number of jobs, end up creating a fantasy in their mind combining the best features of all the jobs they've researched and wishing for this unattainable ideal. The same may very well be true for people who perceive themselves as having lots of dating options available. In fact, in another famous experiment, while people are more likely to sample jams from a stand that offers many choices, they're more likely to actually buy jams from a stand that sells a smaller number of flavors. Aziz seems to suggest that daters would be better off focusing on a smaller number of people and trying to get to know them better rather than allowing themselves to be continually distracted by the availability of so many other options.With so many options available, people can also set the bar unrealistically high for a first date to impress them. This is compounded by the fact that first dates are often boring, taking place in banal settings with unoriginal choices of activity and conversation. They arguably don't offer daters the opportunity to show much personality or creativity, in contrast to more original date settings. Aziz also suggests giving dates more than one opportunity to impress you; many first dates are just okay whereas second and third dates can give someone an opportunity to warm up and improve rapport.After going cross-cultural to inform us about the dating scenes in Tokyo and Buenos Aires, Aziz discusses the impact of technology on many age-old dating behaviors, e.g., jealousy, infidelity, and sexual intimacy. He explores the rise of sexting, the disinhibiting effect of texting and social media on infidelity, the fact that difficult breakup conversations can now take place on screens rather than in person, and the temptation to monitor your significant other's activities by snooping in their phone and/or computer. Aziz then explores the process of deciding to settle down in a serious relationship as opposed to continuing to play the field. Casual dating is fun for a while, says Aziz, but eventually it gets old, particularly as your single buddies increasingly couple off. Despite this, it can still be difficulty to take the plunge and remove oneself from the single life, where there is always the theoretical possibility of an ""upgrade."" Aziz discusses the typical phases of relationships, passionate love followed by companionate love. Passionate love is, and should be, short-lived; the world couldn't function if people remained infatuated with their partners and obsessed with their relationships. That being said, the transition from passionate love to companionate love can create some challenges. In some cases, as the haze dissipates, people realize that they've made a poor choice of partner. Even in the best-case scenario, the relationship's waning excitement can make people wonder if they've made a poor choice. According to researchers, this phase is normal and typical and, if you stick it out, you'll often find that you've created a deeper relationship.Examining all of this, Aziz asked an interesting question. Wouldn't life be more enjoyable with a series of multiple passionate relationships, so that someone can repeatedly experience passionate love rather than only experiencing it once and having it dissolve into apparently more mundane companionate love? The answer he received from the psychologist he asked bears quoting: ""If you think the best life would be the one with the most passion in it, then yes, that strategy would be much better than getting married. Falling in love is the most intense and wonderful experience..."" However, the psychologist adds that there is another way of thinking about satisfaction -- what he calls the narrative view, ""that the best life is about building a story."" He states: ""If you take a narrative view, there are different things to accomplish at different stages of life. Dating and having these passionate flings are perfect when you're younger, but some of the greatest joys of life come from nurturing and from what' called 'generativity.' People have strong strivings to build something, to do something, to leave something behind. And of course having children is one way of doing that. My own experience having children is that I discovered there were rooms in my heart that I didn't even know were there. And if I had committed to a life of repeated sexual flings, I never would have opened those doors. If you think the whole point of life is to gaze into your lover's eyes all day until you die -- well, then, I wouldn't want your life."" Aziz also tells us honestly that although it's one thing to imagine a single life that is an endless series of passionate relationships, the reality is far more complicated and less satisfying.Since many of my clients are adult singles seeking a relationship, it was fascinating to get this window into today's dating world and how things have changed. What I truly appreciated, though, was the opportunity to consider the impact of technology on our functioning beyond dating. The accessibility of so many choices -- good for us, or bad for us? Is it better to be a maximizer or a satisficer? Finally, Aziz points out that although books like this can make us get negative about technology and its impact and romanticize the past, the reality is more nuanced. Technology also gives us tools to store, remember, and share reminders of our love for each other. And finally, Aziz tells us, ""no matter how many options we seem to have on our screens, we should be careful not to lose track of the human beings behind them. We're better off spending quality time getting to know actual people than spending hours with our devices, seeing who else is out there."""
57,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27250071-vimal-thiagarajan,5,"I've been watching Aziz's stand-up videos in youtube and Netflix ever since some friends who do stand-up at Evam, Chennai had introduced me to his shows a few years ago.He makes stand-up seem so effortless and uncontrived which it undoubtedly isn't, and has already made a huge mark as one of the leading entertainers of our times.But of late I haven't watched any of his videos since I got a bit sated due to repetition.Nevertheless I picked the book up since I was curious to see how he'd handle a book.The book explores in detail what romance was and what romance is, and goes for a methodical exploration of the current dating scene in USA, and also provides brief but engaging and hilarious glimpses into the dating scenes of Qatar, Japan(absolutely shocking),Paris and Buenos Aires. Aziz being an American Indian, I thought he would've brought the Indian scene into the mix too which would've been extreme fun given his narrative skills, but he limited it to the stories of 2 Indian dudes who go fishing for dates in Los Angeles.Some of the funniest parts in the book are where he describes what people really do using dating apps like tinder and websites like okcupid.com and match.com(It's CEO claims that match.com has brought more love to the planet than anything since Jesus Christ!).But across the numerous fun parts,his main underlying theme throughout is to show that if you feel so terrible and anxious and frustrated in your search for a life-partner please be comforted that you are not alone - this is something so friggin universal now and typical of our times and we are all in this together.I expected his usual irreverence, flippancy, canny tone modulations, clever remarks and impossible improvisations, all of which were in generous supply, but what I didn't expect was some good solid social research and gravity(of all things) thrown into the mix which made for a weird concoction which was just weirdly too good.Can't imagine reading and liking a subject matter like this, if anyone apart from Aziz Ansari scripts it. An enjoyable read!"
58,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26417-susie,5,"a surprisingly academic and sociological investigation of the challenges and advances of dating using social networking and smartphones vs. how our parent's generation dated. I audiobooked this one and loved aziz's performance. Many of the statistics will fascinate or make you laugh out loud, but his voices for third person narration are the cherry on top.I've never dated using technology and I found his analysis of how we believe we can use technology to find the ""best"" of anything completely compelling. this book feels like it was written by a super smart pre-med major as much as it seems it was written by a comedian... and that's because it was!"
59,1594206279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40275186-sarah,4,"This was fun. I was actually expecting more of a memoir but it turns out it's more of a research paper on dating in a digital age (apparently I don't read blurbs- like at all). Aziz (and his team?) interviewed people from around the world, young and old, in primarily heterosexual relationships about how cell phones, texting, and social media has affected their dating life and how they find partners.So I'm making it sound really boring but it wasn't boring at all! I listened to the audio, and though I missed all the graphs, and was continuously berated by Aziz for being a lazy reader, I really enjoyed it. I think Aziz Ansari is hysterical and his humor could be found throughout and I'm not sure the humor would have translated as well to the page (for example he reads some of the dater comments in different voices- something you'd completely lose in a hard or e-book copy).Although I'd only recommend reading this if you're pretty much done with relationships or don't mind open relationships or you are polyamorous. One of the facts he shared was that something like 70% of people who engage in monogamous relationships will cheat at some point or other (I'm reading this as: 70% of people will cheat in a lifetime, not 70% of people are unfaithful all the time.)It also cued me in to what feels like a growing rate of social anxiety amongst my peers. Modern Romance more or less related it to texting, being able to think about what we say, plan it out, and show it to other people before sending, being largely responsible for a loss of phone and face-to-face social skills. I have always been introverted and painfully shy, but something happened between my 20s and now (a span of about 12 years) and now I find myself almost paralyzed by fear, especially when it comes to speaking on the phone, to the point where I am annoyed if people call instead of texting or emailing.Now- I'm not blaming this entirely on my iPhone, there are a number of contributing factors in my case, but it was an interesting thought and sort of makes me worried for the future. Anyway- all in all an interesting and humorous read. I'd highly recommend to people interested in the subject or fans of the author. "
