0,0385540418,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,4,"A worthy Wellcome Book Prize winner! [I was pleased that our shadow panel managed to predict the official winner (that hardly ever happens), and enjoyed attending the awards ceremony last night.] Rarely have I been so surprised to love a book. On the face of it, the subject matter did not interest me very much. Transhumanism is about using technology to help us overcome human limitations and radically extend our lifespan. Many of the strategies O’Connell, a Dublin-based freelance writer with a literature background, profiles are on the verge of science fiction. Are we looking at liberation from the rules of biology, or enslavement to technology? His travels take him to the heart of this very American, and very male, movement.Cryogenic freezing: The first person was cryogenically frozen in 1966. Max More’s Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Scottsdale, Arizona offers whole-body or head-only (“neuro”) options for $200,000 or $80,000. More argues that the residents of Alcor are somewhere between living and dead. These entities are held in suspension in the belief that technology will one day allow us to upload the contents of the mind into a new vessel.This approach seems to conceive of the human mind/consciousness as pure information to be computed.Cyborgs: Grindhouse Wetware, near Pittsburgh, aims to turn people into literal cyborgs. Tim Cannon had a Circadia device the size of a deck of cards implanted in his arm for three months to take biometric measurements. Other colleagues have implanted RFID chips. He intends to have his arms amputated and replaced by superior prostheses as soon as the technology is available.That may seem extreme, but think how bound people already are to machines: O’Connell calls his smartphone a “mnemonic prosthesis” during his research travels.Mortality as the enemy: Many transhumanists O’Connell meets speak of aging and death as an affront to human dignity. We mustn’t be complacent, they argue, but must oppose these processes with all we’re worth. One of the key people involved in that fight is Aubrey de Grey of SENS (“Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence”), and Google has also gotten in on it with their “Calico” project.O’Connell recounts explaining aging and death to his three-year-old son; his wife chipped in that – according to “Dada’s book” – perhaps by the time the boy is grown up death will no longer be a problem.The Singularity: Posited by Ray Kurzweil, the Singularity is the future point at which artificial intelligence will surpass humanity. O’Connell likens it to the Christian idea of the Rapture, itself a moment of transcendence. At a conference on transhumanism and religion in Piedmont, California, he encounters Terasem, a religion founded recently by a transhumanist and transgender person.To my surprise, To Be a Machine makes frequent reference to religious ideas: O’Connell thinks of transhumanism as an attempt to reverse the Fall and become godlike, and he often describes the people he meets as zealots or saints, driven by the extremity of their beliefs. Both religion and transhumanism could be seen as a way of combating nihilism and insisting on the meaning of human life.O’Connell’s outsider position helped me to engage with the science; he’s at least as interested, if not more so, in the deeper philosophical questions that transhumanism raises. I would caution that a grounding in religion and philosophy could be useful, as the points of reference used here range from the Gnostic gospels and St. Augustine to materialism and Nietzsche. But anyone who’s preoccupied with human nature should find the book intriguing.You could also enjoy this purely as a zany travelogue along the lines of Elif Batuman’s The Possessed and Donovan Hohn’s Moby-Duck. The slapstick antics of the robots at the DARPA Robotics Challenge and the road trip in Zoltan Istvan’s presidential campaign Immortality Bus are particularly amusing. O’Connell’s Dickensian/Wildean delight in language is evident, and I also appreciated his passing references to William Butler Yeats.It could be argued, however, that O’Connell was not the ideal author of this book. He is not naturally sympathetic to transhumanism; he’s pessimistic and skeptical, often wondering whether the proponents he meets are literally insane (e.g., to think that they are in imminent danger of being killed by robots). Most of the relevant research, even when conducted by Europeans, is going on in the USA, particularly in the Bay Area. So why would an Irish literary critic choose transhumanism as the subject for his debut? It’s a question I asked myself more than once, though it never stopped me from enjoying the book.The title (from an Andy Warhol quote) may reference machines, but really this is about what it means to be human. O’Connell even ends with a few pages on his own cancer scare, a reminder that our bodies are flawed machines. I encourage you to give this a try even if you think you have no particular interest in technology or science fiction. It could also give a book club a lot to discuss.Favorite lines:“We exist, we humans, in the wreckage of an imagined splendor. It was not supposed to be this way: we weren’t supposed to be weak, to be ashamed, to suffer, to die. We have always had higher notions of ourselves. … The frailty is the thing, the vulnerability. This infirmity, this doubtful convalescence we refer to, for want of a better term, as the human condition.”Originally published on my blog, Bookish Beck."

He was an enemy of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, a disembodied brain who paraded around in a human-shaped exo-suit after his alien form had been destroyed. Just a fun cartoon, right? Well it may be closer to reality than we thought. Shredder's pal might have been on to something.Mark O'Connell's compelling new book examines the growing popularity of transhumanism. The followers of this movement see the human body as obsolete. They believe in using technology to extend the lifespan of our species. Some are interested in cryonics and pay to have their bodies frozen and stored ""in a state of hopeful deferral."" Some see ageing as a disease that can be cured and are currently examining DNA for clues to an antidote. Others are hopeful of uploading their minds into some kind of artificial humanoid that would be controlled by a brain-machine interface (a bit like my buddy Krang's solution).Many transhumanist philosophies are quite 'out there' to say the least, and O'Connell meets a number of unusual characters on his travels. Zoltan Istvan decides to publicise the cause by running for US President and driving a bus designed to look like a coffin across America. Aubrey de Grey, a life extension impressario, tells him that his chances of living to a thousand are ""a little better than fifty-fifty"" and that ""it's very much dependent on the level of funding."" Roen Horn, founder of the Eternal Life Fan Club, is a virgin who is saving himself for sexbots, because ""a real girl could cheat on you, sleep around. You get get an STD. You could maybe even die.""Strange as some of these folk may be, O'Connell is always respectful and willing to hear them out. Though you can imagine his eyebrow arching on more than one occasion, he is always interested in what they have to say. He explains his fascination with transhumanism by framing it within his own experiences. The recent birth of his son has prompted a re-examination of his priorities and given him a new understanding about the fragility of human life. This elicits some beautiful insights about fatherhood and mortality:
""I talked about my son, and how my love for him was largely, even fundamentally, a bodily experience, a mammalian phenomenon. When I held him in my arms, I said, I felt his smallness, his compactness, the slender bones of his little shoulders, and I experienced the softness and delicateness of his neck as a physical sensation, a tender swelling, a quickening in the machinery of the heart. I often found myself marveling at how little space he took up in the world, how his chest was no wider than the span of my hand, how he was literally a small object, an arrangement of fragile bones and soft flesh and warm unknowable life. And it was this that constituted my love, my animal anxiety and affection for him, little beast that he was.""
It's an absolutely intriguing read, at once hopeful and unsettling. What if we could eradicate ageing and live longer than we had ever dreamed? What perils await if the Singularity occurs and Artificial Intelligence becomes smarter than humans? O'Connell is a thoughtful and witty narrator throughout, and a writer of tremendous eloquence. To Be a Machine is an important, illuminating book about a subject that concerns every single one of us."
2,0385540418,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3126915-imi,2,"As a Wellcome Book Prize winner, this was a bit of disappointment. This is less a book about transhumanism than it is about O'Connell's own ""journey"", as a journalist and a sceptical, bewildered outsider looking in on the movement. He spends more time trying to describe how ""odd"" these personalities are, which he's not wrong about, seeing as how most of them are quasi-religious, cult-like, and highly irrational, but he spends very little time exploring in depth the many scientific, moral, and existential issues that surround our growing reliance on technology, and the possible future uses of technology to extend life and modify the human body. Yes, there may currently be very little scientific support for the beliefs of many of the people in this book, but that doesn't mean these questions and discussions should be dismissed as ""sci-fi"" or modern day forms of religion. Technology has dramatically changed our world over time, and will surely continue to do so in the future, even if it is not in the ways today's transhumanists want, so it was disappointing how insubstantial and surface-level this book felt in exploring these issues."
3,0385540418,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57360106-jamesboggie,2,"The most important thing to know about To Be a Machine is that it's not about transhumanism or the transhumanist movement. It's about Mark O'Connell and his exploration of the topic. That is a meaningful distinction. I expected an overview of transhumanism and cogent criticisms from an avowed skeptic of the movement. Instead I received a piece of poor new journalism that puts the focus on the feelings of a man who admits to being unable to understand the topic.In my opinion, O'Connell never goes far enough in any aspect of this book. He never goes into depth on any aspect of the topic. He does not offer a real stance on transhumanism; he constantly snipes with snide comments and ""witty"" observations, but he consistently equivocates when it comes to real criticisms. He does not fully commit to the form of new journalism; imagine how boring Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail would have been if Hunter S. Thompson choose to forego a narrative structure and instead wrote chapters on different politicians and political issues with a few personal observations and mundane anecdotes peppered in. The result is a weak and toothless book that produced no impact on me other than annoyance.Honestly, the final two chapters are the most interesting and enjoyable. That's damning praise, as those chapters are the least informative. However, only then did he approach what I think the book should have been. O'Connell spent a couple years on an adventure to understand this technological movement that may create our future. Write about that! Make the book a real narrative about that exploration! I can invest in an intelligent but admittedly not scientifically inclined man on a trip to investigate a huge force shaping our world more readily than a shallow, scattershot overview of a technically complicated topic by a lay person with the intellectual capacity to only make snarky comments. It could be truly informative and entertaining to accompany O'Connell on the actual process of researching transhumanism, connecting to transhumanists, and traveling the world to find answers. That change in approach may not have saved the booked for me, though. New journalism requires interesting writers as well as interesting topics. The writers must make meaningful and witty observations out of their experiences. O'Connell utterly failed in that regard. To Be a Machine is filled with shallow and inane comments, like a paragraph about how transhumanists still need to eat. Or belabored descriptions of coffee shops demonstrating nothing but their similarity to every other Starbucks in existence. Or an irrelevant quote from Oppenheimer solely because they visited the site of the Manhattan Project. I could go on and on. These painfully inane notes were only outdone by the persistent poisoning of the well with terms like ""weird"", ""far-fetched"" and ""unfathomable."" I got the distinct impression that Mark O'Connell is a mean girl, faking respect to the topic while making lots of meaningless insults whenever possible. These impressions were especially strong in the first 60 pages. I did not give up on the book, but I never lost the feeling that my time was being wasted and my intelligence was being insulted."
4,0385540418,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8101737-peter-tillman,2,"People really, really don't want to die. Transhumanism aims to fix this, by extending life, or by somehow uploading your brain to a computer. Sadly, all of the ideas in this short book remain science fiction, although the author talked to many people who passionately *believe* that death can be solved. With (SFAICT) no real scientific support for their beliefs. Too bad!Author Mark O'Connell started out annoying me by proclaiming his belief in all the current doomsayer stuff: the Sixth Mass Extinction. Catastrophic climate change. Capitalism and income inequality. The Progressive litany. Do I need to know his political beliefs, and his stream of consciousness? He is appropriately skeptical of the Transhumanist stuff. He's a good interviewer, and he has a fine eye for absurdity, and how reality can resemble bad fiction. But way too many philosophical vaporings for my taste!His problem (and mine) is, there's no there there. The people he talks to seem sincere, although some are *very* odd. He concludes that this is a secular religion, more or less. Fair enough.So it's a disappointing and insubstantial book. I wonder if there really is any sound science being done on longevity and life extension? If so, the author missed it. I'm dropping my rating to 2 stars. A readable and pretty entertaining book, but mostly fluff and filler. See the first comment for a meatier, and much shorter, recommended read, by Charles Stross.The review that led me to read the book, at the NY Times:https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/bo...""The book is a wonderful, breezy romp filled with the beginnings of philosophical reflections on the meaning of the techno-utopians’ search for immortality, or as O’Connell puts it, “solving death.” ""--in a mixed but mostly positive review."
5,0385540418,http://goodreads.com/user/show/272909-blair,4,"(3.5) To Be a Machine examines various scientific and technological ways of prolonging life and the beliefs/assumptions that surround them, broadly categorised here as transhumanism. This ranges from technology and techniques that already exist in some form – AI and robots; cryogenic freezing and biohacking – to the more esoteric work of scientists, entrepreneurs and fanatics aiming to make death obsolete. As someone who has never been able to understand the appeal of living forever, I came to this book sceptical, and didn't feel any different by the end: O'Connell himself is a sceptic, often describing his subjects with gentle humour which highlights the absurdity of their proclamations. He also makes an interesting case for science having replaced religion in the minds of many within/adjacent to the transhumanism movement (the Singularity = the Rapture, and so on). The book could've perhaps been a bit pacier, and there are some overlaps with Jamie Bartlett's Radicals, published in the same year. Still, it's an intriguing journey, written in a pleasingly approachable style. TinyLetter | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"
6,0385540418,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,3,"Nowadays technology is pervasive; you are rarely more than a few feet away from a smartphone or some sort of internet-enabled device. But there are some people out there who want to take it further, much, much further. Not only do they want to embrace technology, but quite a few of them want to actually inhale it; to change their bodies, improve their minds, maybe even become immortal. These people are looking beyond humanity; these people want to be transhuman.O'Connell poses the question; what is next for humanity? To answer this question will take him all around the world to meet the weird, the wonderful and the slightly disturbed people who are trying to answer it. He visits the DARPA Robotics Challenge to meet engineers who are building the next generation of robots that are capable of learning and have awareness of their surroundings, a frightening thought when you consider the implications. He visits a cryogenics company who will remove and store your head with the promise that it will be available should the technology reach the point where it can resuscitate you, something that no one can predict if this will ever happen at this current moment. Teenagers seem perfectly happy to be constantly holding a phone, but there are those that want the technology to be always available and who are hacking their own bodies to install home-made electronics within themselves. Some are seeking immortality and are looking for ways to postpone death indefinitely and there are those that see that immortality should be capturing the mind and uploading it as you would do with photos. These concepts that O’Connell explores on his journey through transhumanism are starting to move from the pages of science fiction into the mainstream. We already have athletes that compete in the Paralympics that are capable of equalling regular competitors and as our trust grows in technology we are looking at ways of enhancing our humanity. We, as a species, have many limitations, but the one we do not lack is imagination. Turning those ideas that the people in this book have into practical solutions is another level up on where we are at the moment, but humanity is nothing but ingenious. As an electronics and mechanical engineer this book both fascinates and terrifies me at the same time (am I the only one who had the name Skynet pass through my mind). There is the potential of the enhancements that can change people’s lives for the good, but there are lots of very real problems that need to be addressed. No one can categorically say if these things will work, or if they will benefit us, or what the implications are of submitting our lives to the responsibility of robots helpers will be. An interesting book that hopefully will provoke further discussion as we embrace technology and it envelops us. 3.5 Stars."
7,0385540418,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6593669-whitney-milam,5,"Absolutely brilliant; a breathtaking read. I'll be thinking about the ideas in this book (so beautifully expressed and analyzed!) for a long, long time. We exist, we humans, in the wreckage of an imagined splendor. It was not supposed to be this way: we weren't supposed to be weak, to be ashamed, to suffer, to die. We have always had higher notions of ourselves. The whole setup - garden, serpent, fruit, banishment - was a fatal error, a system crash. We came to be what we are by way of a Fall, a retribution. This, at least, is one version of the story: the Christian story, the Western story. The point of which, on some level, is to explain ourselves to ourselves, to account for why it's such a raw deal, this unnatural nature of ours. 'A man, wrote Emerson, 'is a god in ruins.' Religion, more or less, arises out of this divine wreckage. And science, too."
8,0385540418,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3528864-darryl,2,"Pearl Ruled after 70 pages. This book about transhumanism (the new eugenics) may be of interest to Silicon Valley geeks, sci-fi fans, and others who naïvely believe that humans can be cryopreserved and achieve immortality. As a Christian I find this movement to be morally repugnant, and the money spent trying to play God would be better used to support research to cure Alzheimer's dementia, cancer, and other chronic illnesses. This book was a curious and disappointing choice for this year's otherwise outstanding Wellcome Book Prize longlist, which concerns medicine and health, rather than pseudoscience and fantasy."
9,0385540418,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9142626-deepak-rao,4,"""Flesh is a dead format"".Death has interested philosophers and scientists alike. Confronting it with modern medicine and making peace with this bitter truth of life are two principal ways of dealing with it. Transhumanism is a movement that aims to push the boundaries of science to the extent of achieving immortality or at least a significantly long life. Mark O’Connel, makes a journalistic inquiry into the current form of this movement and explores ideas as radical as uploading of minds in computers, post-death cryonic suspension of human bodies to be revived later by some yet-to-be developed advanced technology, cyborgs, technological singularity etc. The book also discusses the ethical questions posed by these technologies.A facile reading of the book’s title and blurb may indicate to the reader that it’d be about some inchoate futuristic stuff of sci-fi movies, but let me tell you that at present a lot of organisations like Google and people of credibility such as Aubrey de Grey, Bryan Johnson(founder PayPal), Dmitri Itskov,Ray Kurzweil( director of engineering at Google) and many others are involved in “solving death” and they believe that it is very likely that a radical breakthrough may be just around the corner, or for all we know, as Zoltan says, maybe singularity has already started. This was not an easy book both because of the language and concepts discussed. Author has fully exhibited his literary skills in writing this overtly technical piece. He has presented a detached generalist’s opinion on these technologies which, though has an advantage over an enthusiastic specialist’s in that it paints a picture as is visible to most of us, I believe suffers from the deficiency of adequate sympathy that such ideas require.Having recently read Prof. Yuval Harari’s Sapiens & Homo Deus, I had some previous familiarity with these ideas and technologies and yet while reading this book, I was overwhelmingly occupied thinking about myriad abstract ideas and questions related to human existence and death. When I say I, what am I referring to? Whether it’s my body or my mind? Will a life lived in a manufactured body but having my mind(not brain) in a different substrate be worth living? After finishing the book, I had a strong urge to listen to my all-time favourite song Zindagi ka Safar from Safar movie. Life is undecipherable and unpredictable, the only certainty being death. Maybe it’s about time these notions underwent a radical shift."
10,0385540418,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4,"In parts tongue and cheek, in parts chiliastic, in parts tech writing this book on transhumanism are the musings of an ordinary Joe (if a creative writer can be considered an ordinary Joe) on the technological apocalyptic movement. The transhumanist really believes we can transcend the flesh via technology and solve death. Of course, there are worries that the default path to Strong AI and the singularity probably means it will be our last invention and probably the destruction of the human race but as we speak thousands of brilliant minds are working to bring about the day when there will be something that outclasses human intelligence and will displace us from the crown of creation. It sounds batty and cult-like until you realize that big money and the smartest minds are behind it. The more you delve into it the more transfixed one becomes by the twin images of eternal life and a universal holocaust. We are all in a sci-fi story now."
11,0385540418,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1497559-jayaprakash-satyamurthy,3,"I share O'Connell's bemused skepticism of singularitarians and transhumanists. I mostly enjoyed this journalistic trawl through their nerdy, zealous world. I just wish someone had asked him to cut down on the run-on sentences."
12,0385540418,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12763282-jackie-law,5,"To Be a Machine, by Mark O’Connell, won the 2018 Wellcome Book Prize, one of my favourite literary accolades. It introduces the reader to transhumanism, a movement that aims, by various means, to allow humans to defeat the problem of aging and thereby death. As part of his investigation the author attended events and interviewed proponents of strands of the movement. Their faith in science and zeal to keep themselves alive is akin to a religion albeit with eternal life possible for those who can pay rather than as a reward for particular behaviours.The first strand discussed is cryogenics which brought to mind ancient Egyptian burial rituals. Corpses are treated to prevent further decay and then stored in the hope that they may one day be reanimated in some new form, a type of reincarnation. Those who cannot afford the full body treatment are decapitated with a view to uploading only the brain. Promoters of this process regard the essence of a person as data, although how they hope to extract this data from the dead is unclear. They believe that the technology will one day be developed. I wondered why they thought future people would see value in bringing back to life those who had demonsrated a god complex.“The mind is much more than information”“brains constantly reorganise themselves, both physically and functionally, as a result of actual experience”The brain is dynamic and there is as yet no precise scientific definition of consciousness. Those who rail against the frailty of their bodies, who wish to develop something more long lasting, regard humans as machines that require an upgrade. They wish to find a way to store the data in their brains that this may be moved elsewhere, enhanced and rejuvenated. The author ponders if only the mega wealthy would be able to afford a version that was ad free.“I was increasingly aware of the extent to which my movements in the world were mediated and circumscribed by corporations whose only real interest was in reducing the lives of human beings to data, as a means to further reducing us to profit.”The discussion moves on to the dangers of developing a super-intelligent machine that would view man in the way man now views animals, a useful resource to be farmed for the machine’s benefit. Unlike man, machines bear no malice, hatred or desire for vengeance.“The fundamental risk […] was not that superintelligent machines may be actively hostile towards their human creators, or antecedents, but that they would be indifferent.”In creating these machines we would be creating our successors, rendering ourselves obsolete (in 1863 Samual Butler wrote something similar in light of the industrial revolution – these ideas are not new, merely updated in the language of the computer age).“Once we can automate computer science research and AI research the feedback loop closes and you start having systems that can themselves build better systems”“It is unreasonable to think that machines could become nearly as intelligent as we are and then stop”Caution is advised when creating machines and then setting them tasks. Ask a machine to obliterate cancer and it will obliterate every being that could suffer the disease. Harmful behaviours are intrinsic in goal driven systems. Living requires managing risk but it has yet to be worked out how to teach this to an acceptable level to a machine.The author attends a show put on by those who fund research into robotic development. Many of the developers and those who fund them are based around Silicon Valley, watched closely by the Pentagon. Tasks set for the robots are obviously aimed at producing machines that could be utilised in war zones.“This is what we did as a species, after all: we built ingenious devices, and we destroyed things.”Watching as the robots attempt to complete their tasks, it is clear that whilst machines could easily defeat adult humans in intelligence tests, they struggled to match the skills of a one year old in perception and mobility. These robots are“an instrument of human perversity, in the service of power and money and war.”It was noted that Amazon are amongst those funding research into robotic development. Unlike human workers, robots do not need breaks, do not complain or form unions.The author returns to the transhumanists, comparing their fundamentalism with religion. I pondered if heaven was invented because people couldn’t bear the idea of loved ones, including themselves, no longer existing anywhere, and if hell then followed as a means to coerce them into following codes of conduct prescribed by those who would thereby benefit. Religions tend to be overseen by men.One of the young men talked of looking forward to the development of sexbots, always available for his pleasure and would never cheat on him. The vast majority of those involved in the movement were white and male.Certain transhumanists look to a future when man as machine may go forth and colonise space – a new type of empire building.“This is one of the problems with reality: the extent to which it resembles bad fiction.”The writing style is thoughtful, informative and often humorous. There are many absurdities raised. Transhumanists cannot seem to comprehend how anyone could accept death as inevitable. They do not within these pages address the problem of overpopulation.This is a fascinating and accessible read that raises many interesting questions. It is hard to comprehend why so many supposedly intelligent individuals have become involved in particular aspects of the research given where it leads. It is worrying to think that possible upgrades may further increase the inequalities in western capitalist society. Funded by the war makers and hyper wealthy, this may not be of any concern to them."

Had I previously given much thought to transhumanism? Well, maybe an occasional news article on futurist thinking stemming from California where I spend a fair amount of time, but it was not a topic I followed.This Irish author covers the topic with research, conference attendance, interviews, crazy funny trips following Zoltan Istvan in his Immortality Bus and generally bringing fun to the topic whilst weighing the views of these curious with balance.If the book is too much for you, try this writer's article on Zoltan's trip toward presidential campaign, 2016. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/ma..."

The conversation tone is a little ironic, yet sympathetic. The topic is very deep, but its depth is hinted at and never wallowed in. I think the bemused tone keeps the gravity at bay, like getting close to the heat but never really touching it. It works here, because were one to touch the source, one would get burned. And this is just a conversation, not treatise. Important questions, troubling doubts, a bit of sighing, amazing quotes, funny anecdotes. a good time."

At times it felt like journalistic fiction, too deep in the realm of sci-fi to have anything to do with the world we live in now. But. There's something perversely and very profoundly human about being dissatisfied with being human; trans-humanists and would-be cyborgs are simply more up front about their dissatisfaction of the substrate they're trapped in. I'm no less wary of AI after reading this book -- we're far too close to making it a reality, and much too far from having a concrete way of containing it when we do -- but as for the rest? Brain downloading and the like? I don't think they're going to happen, at least not in my lifetime. And I'm okay with that.

The cost of cryogenically freezing one's head for example, or why a person might cut his own arm open to implant a computer into his flesh. The author clearly has some misgivings about much of the subject matter that he covers, but he manages to do it thoroughly and fairly. I would recommend reading this book if you want to have an idea of what the future may hold as technology forever changes the way we live."
22,0385540418,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68295640-zak,5,"What a fascinating read. A non-scientist dives headlong into the world of Transhumanism. Along the way, he spends time with and talks to key figures of the Transhumanist movement and those working in its related sub-branches, eg. radical life extension, cybernetics, etc. Concepts such as ""substrate independent mind"" and ""biological emancipation"" are discussed matter-of-factly and death/ageing are viewed merely as problems to be solved by science and technology.I found out there are already hundreds of ""people"" who have cryo-frozen their bodies (or heads, if they chose the cheaper package) in anticipation of the day science will be advanced enough to revive them. I found out one of the Transhumanism proponents actually ran for US President in the recent elections on the platform that immortality is a basic human right and more funding should be channelled towards it rather than to military spending.If you think, as I previously assumed (a little) that this is some fantasy realm populated by Sci-Fi fanboys, you would be surprised to find out that the figures working on all these things include some (presumably) really smart people who have PhD's and are billionaire founders of various tech companies (including a woman/girl who was first accepted into MIT at the grand old age of 14).This book (although written in a witty and never boring style) took me longer than usual to finish as I found myself frequently going to YouTube to hear more talks and interviews with the people covered in it. And to me that's the sign of a good book.. if it makes me want to find out more about the subject topic or the personalities involved and really dig down into their motivations. At the end of the day, I found myself asking, "" Why not?"" While I'm not ready to give up this decaying bag of meat and bones called my body yet, being able to live in good health, say 50-100 years more than average sounds good enough. And being able to upload a copy of my ""consciousness"" onto a pod shot out into space to explore the furthest reaches of the universe sure seems like an exciting prospect."
23,0385540418,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22513637-michelle,4,"'What was it that was going on here? The whole enterprise suddenly seemed to me like an absurdist parody of social privilege: three white men traveling across a wilderness, protesting against the final injustice they would one day suffer in common with all creatures, the greater leveler that must itself be leveled. Was dying of old age not, in this sense, the ultimate First World Problem?'I came across 'To Be a Machine' in the library and was intrigued. O'Connell explores the transhumanism movement and its philosophical implications - the idea that we can and should use technology to augment our human bodies, often with immortality as the end goal. He meets and interviews some fascinating people across the movement, and the reader gets an insight into everything from cryopreserving bodies after death until science can bring us back, to the uploading of human minds into machines, to the Singularity as a concept. We also get acquainted with artificial intelligence and existential risk, robotics, cyborgs and transhumanism and religion.The book is written from O'Connell's perspective, and his journey exploring transhumanism. At first I struggled to get into it - I found his writing style slightly pretentious - however, I definitely warmed up to both the book and its author. Many parts are extremely funny, and as the author does not subscribe to the concept of transhumanism himself, it makes for an interesting read. Several unforgettable scenes, including his visit to a cryonics facility and his journey on the Immortality Bus.I work for a disability charity, and throughout the book I was thinking about what transhumanism means for disability, neurodiversity and mental health. In the final chapter, O'Connell meets with a transhumanist who believes that disabled people need to be 'fixed', and therefore embraces the medical model over the social model of disability. I was left disappointed that the author does not challenge this point of view, especially as he up to then has questioned other views he has come across. The result is that disabled people are left disempowered, and in transhumanist speak being seen as a 'problem to be solved'."
24,0385540418,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56322984-emmett-mottl,4,"Transhumanism is a field of belief and hope that, while small in membership and hard to define, has an outsized impact on what we imagine the future will be like, and how money is spent to create it. Mark O'Connell does an excellent job of highlighting the libertarian strain running through the heart of the movement— The radical desire for complete individual control of destiny, the removal of limitations, and the enticing promise of being able to do anything. Or, more importantly, having the time to do anything.The most powerful points of the book come when O'Connell highlights the disconnect between individuals that want to end the suffering of death but seem completely unmoved by the poverty, sickness, and inequality of access that defines the world today. He, for instance, rails against the Randian billionaire tech bros slurping down life-extending elixirs, biding their time until the panacea is created for them. For some of the subjects in the book, there's a deep and alarming insensitivity to the suffering of today, which they awkwardly brush away with promises of future utopia.While he spends a lot of time highlighting ideas that are morally questionable, O'Connell is great at pointing out the inherent humanity of his subjects. Their flaws, their dreams, their fears— All things that presumably would be eliminated if they had their way— Make them human. What happens when the socially awkward late 20-something living at home suddenly is liberated from death, or removed from the physical world? When the traits that define you are ablated away, what have you become?O'Connell also has the unfortunate habit of framing many conversations in a way that allows him to end an interview with a forced literary allusion."

It is so rare to read a well-written text from an ""outsider"" on a subject close to you, but Mark O'Connell nailed it. He tours the world and meets some of the biggest names in transhumanism and does so with a (if I may say so) ""British literary style"". He is cynical, skeptical, dry - but also very curious and very, very human. The book made me reflect on the tech ecosystems new infatuation with philosophy and the great questions. One should casually share their views of our existence in the most extreme ways: ""I believe we live in a simulation"", ""death is like any disease and can be cured"", ""humans are just flesh machines"". And, in an Emperor's New Clothian style, anyone who doesn't agree of just wants to think for a second is a Luddite, backward thinking, or just daft. Thanks - Mark O'Connell for an amazing book!"

Mark O'Connell's tour along the back roads and thoroughfares of the transhumanist movement is at once humorous, thought-provoking, and terrifying. Not that I think change is bad, or impossible, but because O'Connell makes it clear that those leading the change will have a huge impact on how it's framed and implemented, and how badly the have-nots in our society are affected by the upheaval."

28,0385540418,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13547148-olivia,2,"I liked his perspective. Outside, looking in. Quite confused by many of the trans-humanist he met. I guess that was a fun perspective, as it would be my own. So the jokes and observations he felt, felt true to me. I don't think he successfully conveyed the sincerity or belief of these folks, so I am sure they would hate this book. The trans humanist seem more like a fringe-religion cult. Kooks. ... but then again, maybe they are. "

I can't imagine being so disturbed by the concept of death as to spend one's entire adult life trying to figure out how to avoid it. In my view, that's a great way to never live at all. O'Connell feels much as I do, but gave the TransHumanists a fair chance to make their case. Anyway, I should also add that I started the book as a physical book and kind of drifted away from it, but then started it as an audiobook and was enchanted. It definitely gains something from being read aloud, and in this format O'Connell reminded me a bit of Jon Ronson, something to bear in mind if you like Ronson."

But the book is not neutral reportage, he injects his own thoughts and feelings. A former English teacher, he's also good at making links with literature, religion, philosophy, and history. The transhumanists--who are out through technology to defeat death and bring superhuman capabilities to human beings--are an entertaining group: some seem nuts but all are visionaries and force us to think about our future and our relationship with technology.I've already written two blogs inspired by the book, and I have more in mind.

This is a fascinating deconstruction of the movement, and all of its shortsightedness and flaws are on full display.Recommended if you really want to understand how naively out of touch most of these people are. However, if reading about financially privileged individuals holding what are, quite frankly, out of touch, absurd, and insulting beliefs about how transhumanism becoming a reality is more important than the quality of life for all individuals right now is too upsetting, maybe give this a pass.

It covers cryogenics, robotics, AI, cyborgs and a dude who runs for president under the Transhumanist Party. O'Connell has a PhD in English, so not only is the writing sublime, it was so refreshing to have an 'outsider' of sorts come into these spaces, ask basic (but often unvoiced) questions, and really unpick why these people do what they do. The AI section left a little to be desired, but I think this is because, for me, it kind of reflected the time of writing (2017) and so felt a little out-of-date.

Then there are those who want to merge with a machine in some way, or otherwise enhance themselves - as they would put it.They share a mechanistic view of the human condition: that we are no more than machines of flesh and blood ourselves, and that the workings of our brains are exactly analogous to those of a computer.Mark O'Connell doesn't see things that way, but he goes amongst them with a light tread, so as not to freak them out, and he gets to hear their views and report back to the those of us who accept our destiny is to live as something other than a machine, and accordingly, die at some point.The people he meets refuse to accept this, and are thinking in terms of lifespans hundreds or maybe thousands of years long. The planet's going to be very crowded if they get what they want.O'Connell is a little like Louis Theroux, infiltrating the strangest groups, and appearing so benign and harmless they just can't help but tell him what's going on inside their heads. He doesn't judge them. He puts it down on the page, and lets the reader draw their own conclusions.It's fascinating stuff, and you might or might not be surprised to hear that the people who are most committed to these various forms of enhancement are leaders in the world of computer hard and software - the elite of Silicon Valley. Do they know something we don't about human brains and bodies? Or do they see everything that makes us human as essentially similar to the computers that made them their fortunes because, as the proverb has it, to a man with a hammer, every problem looks like a nail?"

46,0385540418,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7410827-allen-adams,5,"http://www.themaineedge.com/tekk/tour...In a world where the growth of technology is exponential, the span of time between science fiction and science fact becomes increasingly shorter. Things that seem like the height of speculative fantasy become commonplace in just a generation or two.That rapid expansion of scientific capability has led to the development of a subculture devoted to accelerating human evolution – and ultimately conquering death itself - through technological means. These people, with varied ideas and attitudes regarding what that acceleration means, are loosely grouped under the umbrella term “transhumanism.”Journalist Mark O’Connell spent some time with assorted members of this movement; the result is his new book “To Be a Machine: Adventures Among Cyborgs, Utopians, Hackers, and the Futurists Solving the Modest Problem of Death.” Through encounters with people that run the gamut – from Silicon Valley billionaires to basement-dwelling hackers – O’Connell discovers the wide array of motivations that drive this unique (and often strange) group.Much of the book revolves around the notion of the Singularity. The term - coined by mathematician and physicist John von Neumann in the 1950s and popularized in recent years by the futurist Ray Kurzweil – represents the hypothesis that the development of artificial intelligence springing from scientific acceleration will trigger a technological explosion far beyond anything that we can currently comprehend.Those who believe in the inevitability of the Singularity can go to drastic (and drastically different) lengths to prepare for it. But all share some variation on a particular belief – that the human body is a machine, one which technology will someday allow us to move beyond. And almost all of them truly believe that their path can lead them in escaping death itself.There’s the Alcor cryonics facility in Arizona, for instance. Alcor – perhaps best known as the final resting place of baseball legend Ted Williams – believes that they are capable of freezing a person in a state between life and death, preserving them until such time as science has determined a way to bring them back. O’Connell also speaks to people who have devoted their life’s work to the notion of mapping the human brain to such a detailed extent as to be able to digitally replicate a person’s consciousness.O’Connell meets with people devoted to preparing for the worst-case-scenario of artificial intelligence, believing AI to be a potentially existential threat to humanity, and young self-styled “biohackers” whose rough-and-ready work is based around turning themselves into literal cyborgs.To each of these encounters, O’Connell brings a keen and empathetic journalistic eye that conflicts nicely with his personal distaste for the concepts being presented. That’s not to say that he’s judging these people. He’s not. Quite the opposite – his interest, engagement and even admiration for their passion comes through.Essentially, he allows his own feelings about what it means to be human to help balance the singular zeal presented by the people he dubs (not without affection) “Singularitarians.” That balance turns something that could have been fairly dry into a compelling narrative, one populated with outsized characters who are brilliant, eccentric or – most often – both.“To Be a Machine” is flat-out fascinating. O’Connell’s journey is a layman’s adventure through the technological looking glass, an opportunity to meet with a subculture existing on the fringes of the tech scene and a compelling peek at one possible future. Sharply-written and thought-provoking, “To Be a Machine” is a book that will undoubtedly set your mind to racing and your gears to turning."
47,0385540418,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17277847-barry-dank,4,"This book is about transhumanism. To appreciate transhumanism, to understand it at a ""gut"" level, one must not accept the inevitability of death. In the pre-humanism world, in today's world, we embrace life saving medical technologies, but we believe that such technologies may save us from a life threatening disease, from dying from said disease, will delay our death, but not abolish our death. And this is what is explored in this book, the abolition of so-called natural death. The author guides us into a paradigm shift, and the basis of the paradigm is ageing is a sickness that can be treated and abolished. But in order to do this, the meaning of what it means to be human changes since to abolish death we merge into a form of machinehood (my word, not the author's), and the intelligence of the machine is artificial intelligience (AI), possibly a super intelligence which dwells human or flesh intelligence into insignificance.To get beyond this as not a science fiction one must embrace the notion that death is not natural. Such is no easy task. Such was no easy task for the author, he struggles with transhumanism or post human notions as he presents it. I think he does a pretty good job presenting it, but spends way too much time engaging in his intrapsyche struggle with the idea of being post human and living forever. He is quite open that many ideas presented in this book, many readers will find repugnant just as I believe he at times finds them repugnant. He quotes one scientist as stating: ""But people will always think something is terrible when it's in the future. Once it's here, they will accept it.""The author reviews the mechanics of preserving ones body in liquid nitrogen and then when the hoped for technological breakthroughs occur, there will be a thawing and reanimation. So a few of us who were born too early for immortality, may still get by contracting to be frozen in a facility in Arizona at a price, of course. But then again those thawing into a new reality may find no fellow human, just super intelligent machines or what the newly emergent once called robots.The author notes that to be or become a machine is an ""extreme expression of techno-progressivism, the belief that the universal application of technology will solve the world's most intractable problems"". As computer scientist Ray Kurzweil notes such will be in part achieved by manipulating the process of evolution. But even if the world's most intractable problems will be solved, the likelihood is that we will have a new set of intractable problems. For example, at some point in time a generation may come to be viewed as the final generation. With immortality becoming a given then the idea of one generation replacing another will become an historical relic. And therefore reproduction may come to represent some sort of intractable problem. Myself, I can't get my mind around the idea of machine reproduction. And O'Connell does not deal with this, maybe this was outside the purview of his book.But the author does deal with religious ideas noting that as we become unfleshed escaping the fallen condition of humanity, we will be reinstated into wholeness, a final union in which technology will replace archaic ideas of God. And, of course, transhumanism provides what the archaic religions of the past were held to provide by the faithful- immortality.So many ideas presented in this book. Such may facilitate new intellectual journeys by many readers of this book. I know that such has been the case foor me."
48,0385540418,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106580658-mark-walter,3,"I think Mark O'Connell is struggling to commit to transhumanism. I felt the book was him saying 'So I'm not a transhumanist, but I spend a lot of my life thinking about it and talk excessively to my three year old child about death'. Maybe this is his attempt to maintain his journalistic rigour or choosing the easy life of being a sceptic, rather than rolling his sleeves up and getting involved.The book is funny, with just enough light moments and expletives to keep you entertained. There is a really broad scope of characters, many of whom I am beginning to get to know from other reading. This made them more human, in their out of town warehouse complexes, or driving across America in a coffin shaped vehicle whilst campaigning for President - Zoltan Istvan.Unfortunately the Cyborgs in the book came across as slightly unhinged. I need to read more on what the current and projected technology actually looks like. There is a lot going on in Sweden and other places that may - he says without doing any prior reading - be more mainstream than the cyborgs in this book. The book had an overarching message around aiming to solve death. However, I didn't see how automating the central heating through a sensor in my arm would solve death. What would happen if I went out on a cold day, or had a fever?Mark O'Connell tackled Artificial Intelligence and the threat of superintelligence really really well.Mark introduced Nick Bostrom (author of Superintelligence - also on my to-read list) and told the tale of the superintelligence given the goal of creating paper clips, that inevitably turns the whole universe into paperclips in the pursuit of it goal.I do not buy the idea that anything could truly be intelligent without being able to question its goals, and moderate its behaviour accordingly. The same fear-inducing themes are described in James Barrett's Our Final Invention without convincing anyone (if the Good Reads reviews and my opinion are anything to go by). I think that book solely got the attention it did from one tweet from Elon Musk.Mark O'Connell proposed a neat solution. Intelligence must be solved by copying how humans learn. We are not goal orientated. We use our senses to observe the behaviour of others, and observe the results of experiments - scientific or behavioural. We use these observations to derive values which informs our behaviour. We continually adjust our values and behaviour in response to further observations. Perhaps it is wise that we observe and experiment most as children when the risk of us causing serious damage is reduced!There is an unexpected section on Faith, but this very much the fringes of religion. There appeared to be one adherent to transhumanist faith from each religion.I would to have spent more time on anti-ageing. Having read a bit on evolution (Nick Lane and others), solving this is not as easy as transhumanists make out. Ageing and death exist for a reason, and are often a trade off for a benefit elsewhere. Nick Lane as described the myth of anti-oxidants and the benefits of free radicals in controlling our rate of reactions. One cyborg was even releasing magnesium directly from a block inserted into his mouth. This is just bad science. Transhumanism needs more biology and less technology."
49,0385540418,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47719722-shelley,4,"This a book about solving the problem of mortality. Is it a problem? When I feel repulsed at the idea of my consciousness being uploaded to a universal data stream, is this just an aspect of the conditioning we go through to try and accept death? Should we be fighting this acceptance?My instinct says no, but I am not half way through my projected lifespan. Perhaps ask me again in another 26 years.Mark O'Connell takes a wry look at transhumanism, interviewing the people and companies exploring AI, cryonics and lifespan enhancers in the hopes of defeating death. The author is not a transhumanist and is in the perfect position to question and note patterns in the though process of these people. When your life is centred on data and software it is easy to interpret the human body as a faulty ""meat machine"". But of course a biologist thinks very differently. This interpretation of humanity and the meaning of life would be fine if it wasn't almost universally accepted in Silicon Valley, where the required money and power is available to accomplish their goals. A theme running throughout the book is the hubristic nature of the men in Silicon Valley (and it is nearly always men who are drawn to transhumanism). These men are the elite and wish to live forever. Moreover, they believe they have a right to defeat mortality. Most people who read this book will champion death in such cases but even without our natural disgust, it is worrying to consider that the advantages brought about by future technology will only be appreciated by the rich and powerful. The promise of the future 'trickling down' to the commoners may be empty.Nonetheless, for all the great technological leaps we are seeing today, the futurist vision seems a long way off. O'Connell makes a strong point that the reality of future technology will probably not provide the extremes of vision currently being expressed. AI is a good example. The expected Singularity is predicted to bring a new era of human progression that borders on a utopia or the complete annihilation of our species. Caution and conversation are obviously required but the reality will probably be somewhere in the middle, as with most new applications.The book itself is written in an entertaining style. Fans of Jon Ronson's journalism will find much to enjoy here. The order of the book felt a little frustrating. Perhaps it is just personal taste but the more interesting discussions were placed at the beginning of the book with the less interesting body hackers and Immortality Bus making up the finale. Looping back round to cryonics and the immediate fear of death may have made for a more satisfying ending, rather than the seemingly chronological description of new meetings."
50,0385540418,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73928542-thijs-stalenhoef,4,"In this book Mark O’Connell provides an engaging and entertaining account of his personal inquiry into ‘strange’ ideological subcultures informed by transhumanism. The book does a good job of rendering the engagements O’Connell had with prominent figures within the transhumanist movement, though his scepticism is never withheld from the reader’s view. This is understandable, and the correlation that is drawn between religious dogmatism and the rigid rhetorical standpoints the characters in this book assume seems apt. On occasion I felt that O’Connell could have provided some more in-depth explanation to the science cited by his interviewees. His repeated statement that he was sure the interviewee knew what s/he was talking about, but that the science went over his head felt somewhat dishonest, considering the intellectual fortitude that O’Connell displays throughout most of the book. Initially I had bought this book with the expectation that it would engage more with the philosophical argumentation and speculation surrounding the onset of the potential posthuman. Unfortunately there was not much of that in this book. However, this is because O’Connell is not engaging with the idea of a posthuman, but rather with the drivers that fuel the transhumanists. His reasoning that the transhumanists’ appeal to technology is no different from e.g. theological appeals to God to stave off the ultimate unknowable (death) seems valid. O’Connell does a great job of pointing out the paradoxes inherent in the transhumanist ideology. Occasionally, the suggestion seems to be that the transhumanists’ hope for techno-immortality is a naïve belief in the progressive fallacy, specifically an illusory progressivism cast by the capitalist hegemony. All this makes for an interesting underlying theme of humanity’s chronic desire to overcome death, and the role of that drive in modern society. At times while reading To Be A Machine it felt like I was reading a novel (something akin to e.g. Zen And The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance) rather than a non-fiction text. This attests to the strength of O’Connell’s style (perhaps the decision to omit more in-depth scientific explanations was made to preserve the text’s flow). In fact, I would even say that the concluding chapter was quite moving. Overall a very good book!"
51,0385540418,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8807144-marc-faoite,0,"This isn't really a review - more a collection of thoughts prompted by reading this excellent book.I used to read Wired back in the early 90s, picturing how Eric Drexler's nano-machines would have transformed everything by the 2020s, which at the time seemed improbably far into the future. But while nano-technology is still a field of research it increasingly looks like Drexler's projections were a bit like nuclear fusion, insofar as the advent of these promises will always be 20 years away. Ditto transhumanism, which I read about at the same time, but which made less of an impact on me for one basic reason. While I have no particular desire to die in the immediate future I have never seen the prospect of immortality as appealing. Are these transhumanists lives so wonderful that they would gladly extend it to eternity? That seems more than long enough to go completely insane. I find, in general, life to be a difficult thing, and while I don't quite see the off-ramp on the horizon yet, I've come to the part of the road where the signposts indicating its imminent appearance are unavoidable and I approach that ultimate destination with at least as much of a sense of relief as trepidation. As such, the whole idea of transhumanism has never appealed to me. Also, what kind of life would it be to live without a body?Certainly I would like to be in good health until the end, and am well aware of many of the problems linked with wearing a meat suit, but so much of our lives, our thought, our hopes and fears are inextricably linked with our biology. O'Connell's book deals with many of the people involved in the frontline of the movement, but doesn't really imagine what a bodiless existence might be like. Fair enough, the book is not meant to be a work of science fiction, but I couldn't help wishing that he explore a bit what, for example, it might be like to 'live' a 'life' where we never eat, because we are never hungry. Or what might happen when the machines inevitably break down.Again, this isn't meant to be a real review, I'm just using this space to note a few of my thoughts and reactions to the book and it's content.Also, be sure to read his second book Notes from the Apocalypse, which is excellent too. His style is accessible and engaging. "
52,0385540418,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39755297-fipah,4,"4 stars = I really liked itAn absolute joy to read, the author offers a non-transhumanist outsider view of the movement - I found this refreshing as I enjoy non-opinionated outsider point of views, and these are rare to come by. Normally a writer holds a different view that may or may not be based on the scientific method, but it indeed is rare to come across someone open to novel ideas and exploring them while at the same time holding a certain agnostic aura around themselves. As a result, the reader can form their own view of what is being described.O'Connell writes in an affable, sometimes lightly humorous, tone. Some of the passages I found to be profoundly heart-warming in their humanity, so much so that I wrote them down by hand. For example, after spending an overwhelming amount of time with people who reduce the human experience to code and machines, he writes:[...] my wife entered the bedroom on her hands and knees, our son on her back, gripping the collar of her shirt tight in his little fists. With a loud neighing noise, she arched her back and sent him tumbling gently into a row of shoes by the wall, and he screamed in delighted outrage, before climbing up again. None of this, I felt, could be rendered in code. Their beauty was bodily, in the most profound sense, in the saddest and most wonderful sense. I never loved my wife and our little boy more, I realised, than when I thought of them as mammals. I dragged myself, my animal body, out of bed to join them. I expected the book to outlie more facts or to explore other more scientific disciplines that deal with ageing, such as molecular biology, genetics and biochemistry. This is especially palpable in the ultimate third of the book where the narration is heavily focused on the author's ""adventures"" with several transhumanists, driving a coffin-like van across USA. As a consequence, I am still thirsty for more facts - how does science really deal with the matter of ageing and death? Can we surmount cellular senescence and damage? However, the book does not profile itself as an in-depth scientific book on transhumanism, ageing and death, so it's okay - it is just a thing to keep in mind. Highly recommended."

54,0385540418,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69056-ada,5,"I found this a very enjoyable quick read. O'Connell describes the growing movement of transhumanism. These are people (often, but not necessarily of a computer science background) who believe in the analogy between the human body being hardware and the brain being the operating system. If our hardware becomes obsolete, the idea is that the human brain can be uploaded into another medium. This is why people tend to pay good money to have their bodies, or even just their heads, frozen. The belief is that in time, those brains will be reuploaded and 'reincarnated' in machine-form. I really enjoyed reading O'Connell's take on the subject. I am new to it - and I shared his scepticism and curiosity. Especially the parallels he points out with other dualist movements of the past - the idea that the essence of being human is intellect, untinged by the bodies needs or even emotions. O'Connell also describes the people in Google who await the coming of the Singularity. In case, like me, you haven't read enough Science Fiction, the Singularity is the time when artificial intelligence will run far more efficiently than humans ever could, and human brains basically become immortal and conquer the surrounding galaxies. Why artificial intelligence should particularly want humans to be immortal is anyone's guess. Here's Steve Wozniak's take on this problem : we will become pets of superintelligent robots, but this will actually be a good thing. Robots ""will know they have to keep nature and humans are part of nature.""The book may ostensibly pretend to be about developments in technology, but truly it is an exploration of human fear of death. An excellent example would be the transhumanist candidate for US president who drove around the US in a bus made to look like a coffin called the ""immortality bus"", which was an attempt to convince the US government that it should spend more money on longevity research. Another example is Peter Thiel ( a co-founder of PayPal) who wrote: ""Death will eventually be reduced from a mystery to a solvable problem."" He is currently funding an increasing number of programs - mainly aimed at reducing the effects of human aging, ultimately with the goal of achieving immorality. When asked whether such projects would likely exacerbate economic inequality giving long life to the rich and short to the poor, he said that ""Probably the most extreme form of inequality is between people who are alive and people who are dead."" I have to say, unconvinced as I ultimately was by Shelley Kagan's Yale University Course on death, Peter Thiel might benefit from it. An exciting fact for anyone of a Slavic background is that the word 'robot' comes from Czech, from a 1921 play by Karel Čapek (The play is called R.U.R - Rossum's Universal Robots""). It shares the stem of the Czech (and also Polish) word ""robota"", which simply means ""work"".I do thoroughly recommend this book to people who want to know what Silicon Valley is currently up to. Favourite quotes:""This is one of the problems with reality: the extent to which it resembles bad fiction.""""Creating your cyber-self accelerates your joyful immorality"" read the bearded latecomer. Jason interjected. ""That's supposed to be 'joyful immortality', actually.""""Says 'immorality here."""
55,0385540418,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84852-ann-rufo,3,"Neither technology nor living are really my strong suits. Which is probably why I found the premise of the book so interesting, and why I appreciated O'Connell's own level of skepticism. His journalistic roots are clear as the book follows the stories and moment of the people he encountered and less the technology or reality of the work being done or anticipated. And while I didn't expect it to be a treatise or history, I did feel a desire for more breadth, and more analysis. O'Connell spend most of his analysis turning inwards, trying to figure out how he feels, his responses to the people he meets and their ideas. At times it feels overdone, at others it is perfect. The later no more so than when he reaches this realization, that struggling and fighting against the tragedy of death by old age is the ultimate first world problem. Absolutely. Maybe it's why I find his cast of characters not only uninspiring but unrelatable. I don't want to live forever. That sounds exhausting. And I don't want to live on and on if I'm only going to be surrounded by other people who only care about trying to live forever. That sounds even more exhausting. O'Connell seems to leave his project with no sense of ending. It starts as abruptly as it started, as if the whole thing were episodes 6 and 7 of a 13 run season. I guess I wanted more. Maybe he was proving a point. For all the skepticism and distance he brings and maintains during his book, he is also well aware of the way technology has already become a part of his body and this human existence, most of all through his constant connection via cell phone. It makes one wonder where we draw a line, when it's too much tech, when we rely too heavily on machines. I like to think I'm low tech, far on the opposite end of the spectrum from the transhumanists or the guy with the giant implant in his arm. I'd like to think that, but then... typedy type type on my laptop. "
56,0385540418,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30735411-dan-hanly,5,"There's something deeply disconcerting about this movement of people who view biology and the body with such disdain that they're so motivated to transcend their nature. The author does a phenomenal job of weaving through the Therouxvian characters within this movement, humanising them despite their need to transcend humanity, presenting them in all their madness for us to both sympathise with and become disgusted by.At each juncture, the author, who self-identifies as a transhumanism-sceptic, grapples with the many philosophical questions raised by the quest of the transhumanists; from mind-uploading to cybernetics, from cryonics to life-extension, all present some very key philosophical and ethical challenges, that the transhumanists behind these advancements seem painfully blind to. The transhumanists have a noble quest - the betterment of humanity, but their lack of sight over the obvious implications of their quest creates heroes and villains in this movement. In short, it's difficult to even address transhumanism as a movement, since there's very little that ties them together, it's more akin to a widespread diaspora of differing and sometimes conflicting technological advancements with a single point of origination. Some of the technological advancements are but a short time away from becoming reality, others are straight out of the books of Asimov or Dick and are deeply rooted in such shaky foundations that they'll likely become the Minidisc of the transhumanist wave, leapfrogged by technologies that are obviously much more realistic.All in all, I would highly recommend this book. The author's style and care with the participants, whilst also not shying away from asking some of the more difficult questions really engaged me with his journey. This is a must-read."
57,0385540418,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31686848-jerrod,3,"To Be A Machine is a fun jaunt through the world of transhumanism. The author is unapologetically critical of transhumanists, but he also treats the subject of death and transhumanism with respect (except where the characters are just manifestly absurd (like the biohackers in Pittsburgh)... but how much consideration can you really give them?). A common theme is that transhumanists are afraid to die because they are extreme egotists and can't fathom not being around. What's odd is that they criticize non-transhumanists' acceptance of death without much thought as to why it should be extended. Put another way, they criticize people's mundane existences, but the only apparent difference between the transhumanist and the non-transhumanist is that the non-transhumanist is content to let his/her mundane existence come to an end. There's a bit of talk of brain emulation, body enhancements, etc., but not much discussion of what a person's life cycle would look like. Would they go through cycles of work and retirement? Would long-term relationships come to a mutually agreed upon end? Would there be serial monogamy? What would people do with all that life? These are questions that O'Connell either does not get extended answers to or he just didn't press hard enough. Most of the book is on the physical hurtles of achieving the transhumanist goals not on the societal implications once they have been achieved. Not surprisingly, this book probably would have been better as a series of 2 - 3 New Yorker length articles, leaving out most of the stuff on the transhumanist presidential candidate Istvan. I saw the book on a list of the year's best non-fiction. Good? Yes. Best? I hope not."
58,0385540418,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2998430-david,2,"This is not so much a book about transhumanism, but rather a fascinated, but bewildered, outsider's look on the ""movement"". The book is really made up of the author going around having casual conversations with people within the movement and then putting it together with his own musings on the conversations and events he witnessed on his travels. He does a good job of conveying an image of the transhumanists as super-rational individuals, who treats other's, and themselves, as instruments (as for example one person who won't have sex with people since they can cheat on you and transmit STDs, but who is really looking forward to sexbots) and firm believer's in a kind of Silicon Valley idea that everything can be solved with technology. I have no doubt there is a lot of truth to that image. The thing is, when I started to read the book I had the impression it would go to some depth on the different subject's which is gathered under the transhumanist umbrella and this turned out to be incorrect. Sure the author brings up mind-uploading, research to try to stop aging, singularity, etc, but it only scratches the surface. The author does try to engage with the moral/existential questions this gives rise to (Would I/we like to be uploaded to a computer? Isn't death a necessary and important part of life?, etc), but while he is honest and upfront with his thoughts, I do find them quite shallow. So while the book is certainly well-written and an easy read, I felt the book missed its mark. I don't think the book will give much to people who are interested and want to know more about transhumanism, but I do think it is a book for transhumanists to read to understand how they are viewed by ordinary people outside the movement."
59,0385540418,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3570671-john-braine,4,"I just finished To Be a Machine. And scribbled this:Some books come at you from a few different angles and demand to be read: I saw the author do a reading from this book a few months ago, and then a friend borrowed a robot from our kids to shoot a promotion for the book, and then most importantly of all, I kept hearing how amazing it is. And it is. The writing is superb, not only when dealing with complex philosophical issues but even when just describing the people he meets:“Physically, he was an extraordinary proposition: long and somber as a scarecrow and exhibiting an immensely unreasonable beard, a Rasputinian profusion of wiry russet that terminated chaotically somewhere around his lower rib cage.”And the subject matter is fascinating. It's primarily about transhumanists, people who want to live forever via technology, including some very clever people, and less surprisingly some very rich people, though I think the title and cover is a bit misleading: half of the book is about people who see a future where our selves are transferred to a machine, while a lot of people in the book are more interested in coming up with a medical cure for aging. Personally, I think he could have delved a bit deeper into what the self actually is because I think he glossed over the fact that transferring your memory to a machine is really just cloning your self not transferring it. *You* still die. You still divine no pleasure or knowledge from a version of yourself living forever in the memory of a machine. Otherwise this is a fantastic Gonzo style view into the world of transhumanism."
