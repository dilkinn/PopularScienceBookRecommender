0,0192880519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69589444-jen,5,"If you’re keen on understanding the marvelous artifacts of animal intelligence, this is a must read. Have you ever, while plumb blown in the creek on lead-tainted moonshine pissed from a noisy radiator, grew irate while watching a spider craft a beautiful web and systematically took a sledge hammer to all the toilets in your house, while screaming: “Competence without comprehension makes me sick!”? Well, that might’ve been a tad bit of an overreaction, even if your heart was in the right place. So I’m going to encourage you to check this out.Dawkins is best known for his seminal work: The Selfish Bean, which argued persuasively for the value of the Bean’s-Eye-View of evolution. This is a continuation of The Elfish Dean which concerns itself with extending that concept to better understand how Beavers can be such good engineers without attending classes. How termites, obeying relatively simple local rules, can work together to construct magnificent castles. How spiders can weave silk tapestries of such intense beauty that you wake up to a house riven by porcelain shrapnel. And how bees can construct hives of such exacting dimensions as to ensnare that bastard Pooh yet again. For my money, although far less accessible than The Shellfish Gene, this little ditty contains the most exciting ideas that Mr. Dawkins has produced since being urinated upon by Nagapies in sub-Saharan Africa (citation needed). And he agrees.This book seeks to expand the Neo-Darwinian synthesis to include not only how genes encode the instructions for producing bodies, (the phenotype), but also how they instill instinctual competencies, which instruct parasitic behaviors, catalyze evolutionary arms races, inform mating strategies, and facilitate the construction of fitness enhancing artifacts external to the organism (extended phenotype). This last bit, seeing the reach of the gene pushed beyond its normal purview of the physical body, is a real humdinger, and, if taken fully on board, constitutes a paradigmatic panty annihilation. You’ll stand before the grandeur of nature forevermore without recourse to undergarments.Unfortunately, a fair amount of the book is dedicated to beating recalcitrant ideologues about the neck and chest for their wishy washy objections. The barest whiff of genetic determinism, and the most timid formulations of evolutionary psychology, send people tumbling down slippery slopes and into seizures of unreason. Perhaps understandably, given how perverse incentives have motivated bad actors to alloy theories of this kind with bullshit political dogmas. Still, it’s important work. Let me assure you that, despite the voluminous amount of confabulatory drivel that has been hurled the man’s way, primarily by people who have only read the title of The Delphic Routine, Dawkins is anything but careless when putting forward these ideas. Lucky for our species that, heretical though they may seem at the time, there exist people who are not satisfied with the low hanging fruit of our wishful preconceptions, and reach instead for truer approximations of the reality we inhabit.It’s not an easy read. But it would be much more difficult if written by anyone else. Dawkins possesses an unparalleled talent for making head scratching topics fully explicable to knuckle heads like me. He is the best writer of popular science since Sagan. Tell me I’m wrong and I’ll call you a filthy liar.Pulverize your commodes with this book!"
1,0192880519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/188511-krishan,5,"The book is a logical continuation of his devastating book  The Selfish Gene. Here Dawkins turns his critical eye and razor sharp words to evolutionary views that take the individual organism as the definitive playing field for natural selection to operate. Using the gene's eye view of life that he developed so well in  The Selfish Gene, he shows that animal artifacts are better understood as objects engineered by natural selection, rather than as by products of the behavior of organisms. He also makes the case that many phenomena incidental to parasitism and symbiosis are better understood if the organism level view of biological agents is abandoned. Dawkins' explores these and similar topics with his characteristic clarity, and the reader is exposed to the full power of evolutionary thinking.  A quote often seen on the cover of Dawkins' books is ""Richard Dawkins climbs mental Everests"". This book illustrates the point and then some. Dawkins concise language is without peer in the biological sciences. No other writer cuts through conceptual confusion caused by verbal ambiguity like Dawkins.5/5 "

Some parts required me to google terms definitions and problem backgrounds each paragraph, if not line.Despite of this the whole reading experience is very satisfying. Lot of new concepts that bring up interesting ideas, numerous facts and remarkably great language - all of this teams up to build the great book.

3,0192880519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5121917-peter,0,"The essentials of life's story: Biodiversity is more than a buzzword for ecologists. Variation gives life its grandeur, and Richard Dawkins gives us a description of the workings of variation. Fortunately, with a sharp mind and sharper wit, he has the ability to deliver this portrayal so that nearly everyone can understand it. That's not to say this book is an easy read. Although he delivers his narration as if sitting with you in a quiet study, you may still need to review his words more than once. That's not a challenge or a chore, it's a pleasure.Dawkins, unlike other science writers, is forthright in declaring his advocacy in writing this book. It's a refreshing start to his most serious effort. After publication of The Selfish Gene led to a storm of fatuous criticism, Extended Phenotype comes in response with more detail of how the gene manifests itself in the organism and its environment. It's clear that Dawkins' critics, who label him an ""Ultra-Darwinist"" [whatever that is] haven't read this book. His critics frequently argue that The Selfish Gene doesn't operate in a vacuum, but must deal within some kind of environment, from an individual cell to global scenarios. Dawkins deftly responds to critics in describing how genes rely on their environment for successful replication. If the replication doesn't survive in the environment it finds itself, then it, and perhaps its species, will die out.The child's favourite question, ""why"" is difficult enough for parents and teachers to answer. Yet, as thinking humans we've become trained to deal with that question nearly every context. So well drilled that we consider something for which that question has no answer to be suspicious if not insidious. Part of Dawkins presentation here reiterates that there is no ""why"" to either the process of evolution nor its results. It isn't predictable, inevitable or reasonable. It's a tough situation to cope with, but Dawkins describes the mechanism with such precision and clarity, we readily understand ""how"" if not ""why"" evolution works. We comprehend because Dawkins does such an outstanding job in presenting its mechanics.This edition carries three fine finales: Dawkins well thought out bibliography, a glossary, and most prized, indeed, an Afterword by Daniel C. Dennett. If any defense of this book is needed, Dennett is a peerless champion for the task. Dennett's capabilities in logical argument are superbly expressed here. As he's done elsewhere {Darwin's Dangerous Idea], Dennett mourns the lack of orginality and logic among Dawkins' critics. Excepting the more obstinate ones, these seem to be falling by the wayside. It's almost worthwhile reading Dennett's brief essay before starting Dawkins. It would be a gift to readers beyond measure if these two ever collaborated on a book.

It's an expansion of topics covered in The Selfish Gene, which I'd previously enjoyed, but there was too much detail for me to take in. I'll skip back to some of his later books. "
6,0192880519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,4,"In this book, Dawkins picks up his selfish gene theme and extends its influence to organs and systems within the body and then to the external environment. In doing so, Dawkins never strays from his central themes: Genes are in charge, pursuing their self-interest; the body and its behavior is their vehicle; and the germ-line replicator is the unit of selection. Dawkins argues* that the gene replicators first begin to transcend their gene-only behavior within the body when they cooperate with other genes for mutual benefit (forming organs and bodily systems) and those genes that work well with other genes are selected through “within body selection”. This is where the selfish gene becomes in effect a cooperative gene, although the gene’s self-interest remains always as the driving force (Dawkins also allows for “outlaw” genes that seek advantage at the expense of other genes). Dawkins writes that through behavior, the phenotypic effects of genes “feed back on those genes’ chances of surviving, and as a result gene frequencies change in succeeding generations in adaptive directions.” As I understand it, mutation and alternate forms for each gene (alleles) create a range of variation that natural selection then works on, tossing out options that don’t work and keeping those that do. This argument on the surface appears similar to what Jean Piaget puts forward in his book, Behavior and Evolution. And, in the glossary, Dawkins adds this supporting sentence about evolution’s role in selecting behavior that works: “From the point of view of this book, the significant feature of the Lamarckian theory is the idea that new genetic variation tends to be adaptively directed, rather than ‘random’ (i.e., non-directed) as in the Darwinian theory.”This same process extends to phenotype behavior in the environment. Beaver bodies, as collections of selfish genes, build ponds and habitats because they are conducive to gene-level survival within all beavers. This same extension of gene-level behavior applies to bees and termites as well. (Dawkins writes in such a way that bees and termites seem to be specialized cells that operate outside of the body.) Dawkins also adds that this sort of extended behavior within one species is applied toward other species through parasitic, manipulative behavior. In short, Dawkins writes, “We must think of each replicator as the centre of a field of influence on the world at large.”After defending his gene replicator as the unit of selection for evolutionary purposes, Dawkins’ last chapter is titled, “Rediscovering the Organism.” This chapter comes across as flat. I can understand Dawkins’ reluctance to support in any shape or form the individual as the unit of selection for evolution. Dawkins states that genes only care about copies of themselves, not about the welfare of the body-vehicle for all the genes. Yet, if the gene’s success depends on the body vehicle’s success as an extended phenotype, then the body vehicles take on a near equal importance. As in any part-whole relationship, there’s a mutual dependence and one is not more important than the other. If the body as the gene’s vehicle is not viable prior to reproduction, then all the genes, so to say, go down with the ship. Interestingly, as a side note to his main theme, Dawkins allows for two different strategies for sexual behavior. Both the “faithful” and “philander” models (and a continuum that lies in between?), are variable strategies to move genes into the next generation. If this is true for sex, might this equally apply to genetic-based character types where both self-oriented (manipulative) and other –oriented (cooperative) types are equally valid survival types? Elsewhere (“Twelve Misunderstandings of Kin Selection"") he writes, “To stick my neck out a little, it seems to me that, far from genes for altruistic behavior being implausible, it may even be that a majority of behavioural mutations will turn out to be properly describable as either altruistic or selfish.” Recognizing the speculation here, could this be the ground for what seems to be a fairly basic character division between two poles of human nature? This is an excellent book. It is strong and stimulating. It would be improved if Dawkins were less preoccupied with defending himself against his detractors, if he better separated his broad points from his technical detail, and if he made clearer distinctions between his criticisms of others and his own positions. Dawkins endlessly cites his previous works, which seems a bit biased when the reader is looking for additional and independent support for what Dawkins is putting forward. *Dawkins is writing for the more technically oriented reader. Lay readers do the best they can. "
7,0192880519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67690919-ben,4,"First half 3*, Second 5*This is a good book. Off the back of reading The Selfish Gene, and reading that The Extended Phenotype is Dawkin's favourite of his products, I was expecting big things. From the get-go, the style of the book is a lot more science-heavy—more jargon, more in depth scientific ideas and reasoning, which (as a scientist myself) I enjoyed: Dawkins is terrific at scientific reasoning, and this was a good outing from him, even by his standards. The problem with the first half (maybe even more) of the book, is the content. Dawkins spends a very long time addressing criticism from The Selfish Gene, as well as some criticism with his extended phenotype theorem. Genetic determinism, group selection, green beards (etc. etc.) are all delved into in detail. Whilst this is very well done, it shows the age of the book. Almost all of these criticisms are no longer pertinent (which shows how correct Dawkins was at the time, might I add), so some arguments seem a little trivial.What the first half lacks, Dawkins makes up for in the second half. The theorem of the extended phenotype is a fantastic way of viewing the impact replicators have on the world, and is almost flawless (plus, Dawkins addresses the few issues that arise with the theorem). He even ends with an optimistic view of life, presumably addressing the sadness (?) that this way of thinking brought at the time.Overall, a very good book, but unless you wish to get into the knitty-gritty of many different theories (some very pertinent and some a bit less), you might be best off reading the last few chapters. Alternatively, the summary of the extended phenotype theorem that Dawkins provides in the recent editions of The Selfish Gene might be a good option."

I can understand his claim that this book is his most unique contribution to science, but the only way this should be your first Dawkins book is if you are already familiar with biological concepts. After all, the book was written for professionals, not laypeople. I started with River out of Eden, an easier one, and, although my mind was blown, I struggled with some of it. It was only after I read a lot of other things that I was ready for this, and it was still hard. The middle of the book was probably the hardest part. I think I got frustrated at some point and put it down, then picked it up again later. I do that a lot. I probably should've just powered through in the first place, because the end of the book references a lot of concepts that he builds on in the beginning. The glossary in the back and I recommend you take note of it and use it frequently instead of Googling the words. I'm sure the glossary terms will be more relevant to the text than Google's version. It's essential to have an understand of terms like ""gamete,"" ""germ-line,"" and other words that he uses. If you don't know these words, you won't understand the book. Another science book I'm reading, Origins, by Neil DeGrasse Tyson, has a glossary, so you should check for one if you're reading something like that. Whether you are new to Dawkins or a long-time fan, The Extended Phenotype will probably be difficult, but rewarding if you are willing to put in the time."
11,0192880519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75618360-tien-manh,4,"Richard Dawkins asks us (again) to try to think of evolution in terms of selfish *genes*.The book promotes concepts called replicators (genes, DNA) and vehicles (organisms, groups, species...). Examples are given of how this replicator/gene-centric view of evolution tries to make sense of evolutionary phenomena that otherwise we would have a hard time explaining if we stuck to the traditional, organism-centric view.I got to about mid-way through the book, then Dawkins went on a ""Lamarckism bash"", and some other academic debates regarding (neo?)Darwinism. Not being a scientist myself and having little formal context in evolutionary biology, I got a bit lost. Will retry the latter half of the book in the future!"
12,0192880519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Difficult but eminently worthwhileThis is a long and difficult book, although not as long and difficult as it might be if it had been written by somebody without Richard Dawkins' gift for clarity of thought and expression.The crux of Dawkins' thesis is expressed early on and much of what follows is a very detailed supporting argument. What he wants us to see is that the ""selfish gene"" has a reach that extends beyond the confines of the individual organism that houses the gene. The phenotype of our genes is the human organism in all its glory; however the extended phenotype of our genes is not only the human organism but part of the environment in which the organism finds itself. In other words, the gene has the power to influence not only our behavior but the behavior and structure of elements in the world in which we live.This thesis is not as striking to me as it has been to many others mainly because I have studied Eastern religious views, and it is a tenant of such views that the distinction between ourselves (the ""selfish organism,"" in Dawkins' terminology) and the environment is an artificial one, an illusion actually. We are part and parcel of all that is around us and within us, and the boundary of our skin is merely functional. We cannot be understood by looking at only our bodies. Dawkins makes the point that looking at a beaver and microscopically examining it and its genes is not sufficient to an understanding of what a beaver is. We have to also consider the dams that the beaver builds, the trees that it gnaws down and even the streams that it dams and turns into lakes. Presenting a point of view somewhat at odds with that of Dawkins (and one that I think that Dawkins does not sufficiently appreciate) is Franklin M. Harold in his book, The Way of the Cell: Molecules, Organisms and the Order of Life (2001). He writes, ""Organisms process matter and energy as well as information; each represents a dynamic node in a whirlpool of several currents, and self-reproduction is a property of the collective, not of genes.... DNA is a peculiar sort of software, that can only be correctly interpreted by its own unique hardware.... [S]ending aliens the genome of a cat is no substitute for sending the cat itself--complete with mice."" (p. 221)Dawkins tries to discount the view of those he calls ""group selectionists"" who see life from a ""group benefit"" viewpoint. Dawkins has, since writing this book, stepped back from this position to allow that some group selection may take place. I believe some day he may see the world not from a ""selfish gene"" point of view, and not from a ""selfish organism"" point of view, but from a ""selfish ecosystem"" perspective--well, more likely his successors will see this, since the work of a lifetime is not easily amended in one's later years.Dawkins gives what he calls ""our own 'central theorem' of the extended phenotype"" on page 233: ""An animal's behaviour tends to maximize the survival of the genes 'for' that behaviour, whether or not those genes happen to be in the body of the particular animal performing it.""This is a mouthful. Clearly we can say that the genes of the reed warbler code for behavior that benefits the genes of the cuckoo who has laid its egg in the warbler's nest. This is what Dawkins has in mind. But then arises the question, ""how far afield can the phenotype extend?"" Here Dawkins gets cautious and writes, ""The farthest action at a distance I can think of is a matter of several miles."" (p. 233) Note the chosen terminology, ""action at a distance."" This is from physics of course causing Dawkins to ask if there is ""a sharp cut-off"" of the genes' reach or ""an inverse square law"" at work?It is here that I believe Dawkins has come so, so close to that which he will not see (or couldn't see then), namely that everything works toward an ecology and that the idea of selfish genes and selfish organisms is a limited view. In truth the reach of the genes should be governed by something like an inverse square law since humans are now reaching beyond the solar system.When we look at such great distances we might want to credit the dreaded and verboten ""group selection"" that Dawkins is at pains to reject. Just as some see our earth as ""Gaia,"" an organism itself, so too might we see those organisms that have the means to survive the destruction of the home planet by migrating to other planets as being selected by group as opposed to other groups who have no such ability. Planet A produces beings that extend beyond their solar system; planet B produces beings that do not. Both planets blow up. Who is ""selected"" by the (extended) environment and who is not?Dawkins is one of the geniuses of science, and I don't mean to argue with the great insights he has brought to biology, but my point is that it is always something of an artificiality to speak of living systems as confined to one level of existence or expression. We may think of earth creatures as being completely separate from the rest of the universe, yet without the sun, 93 million miles away, we would not exist; and come a supernova even many light years away, we will be affected.So all is one and one is all in some extended sense. And using the word ""selfish"" (as Dawkins knows) at any level of life is merely to be anthropomorphic.Daniel Dennett, in a new afterword written in 1999, asks if this book is science or philosophy, and he answers both. I agree, and it is science and philosophy of the highest order, aimed equally at the professional and at the educated layperson. --Dennis Littrell, author of “Understanding Evolution and Ourselves”"

Dawkins never fails to achieve radicality with simplicity."
17,0192880519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22039713-bob-anderson,5,"Richard Dawkins here explains his view that the largest unit on which natural selection can reasonably be said to operate is the gene rather than the organism, and explores this idea’s consequences for the standard conceptions of organisms, groups, and selection. The motif he introduces to show this best is a Necker Cube, which is a simple line drawing of all the edges of a cube: when looked at for the first time, it seems to be an overhead view of the cube. But with some visual effort, you can make your brain interpret the exact same stimulus as a view from below. Your two perspectives can be shifted between without many problems at all. This an slightly off analogy, because the two views of the cube have no reason to prefer one over the other, whereas Dawkins clearly believes that his focus on the gene is more proper than some biologists’ focus on the organism. Another analogy: we often hear from nature documentaries and wide-eyed wonderers how harmonious the biological systems of Earth are: how fortunate that some things breathe carbon dioxide and some breathe oxygen, that both cheetah and gazelle are lithe and fast in their dance of predation, that symbiotic pairs of species fill each other’s needs so well. But this is an illusion: the different organisms of the planet do not evolve their interplay from any interest in harmony on the part of nature. Rather, given that every other organism already exists, a certain organism will have its various genotypes selected for or against depending on how their expressed phenotypes allow them to be ruthless exploiters and reproducers. Similarly, the genes that make up a genotype are not selected for their harmonious interaction. Instead, at each locus, the alleles that are best able to propagate themselves via their modifications of the expressed phenotype, given their fellow genes, will be selected for. The key difference is that the balance is not driven by a push towards harmony but the ruthless interactions and pushes for self-replication between a myriad of different genes.Dawkins pushes this concept far in this book: he explores parasitism, evolutionary arms races, sex ratios, and embryology with an expert’s touch. But by far the most gripping part comes from his title: the extended phenotype is what happens when a gene’s reach extends beyond the physical boundaries of its host organism. A gene can influence the structure of the containing organism, and this surely is a phenotype, but Dawkins gradually pushes this further: a baby bird’s gene influences its parent to feed it, a beaver’s gene pushes it to build a larger dam, and a songbird’s gene summons another bird to come and mate, transferring the risk of travel to that other creature. The most difficult to grasp concept in this book, but in my mind the most fruitful, is the idea that an organism’s behavior tends to increase the success of the gene responsible for that behavior, no matter whether that gene resides in that organism (or indeed even in the same species) or not. While this is a book starting its fourth decade, it still feels very fresh and eye-opening. A word of warning: the book is more technical than various popular books from Dawkins; if you feel like you could tackle a college-level evolutionary biology class you can handle this, though."

It is only now that I realize the publication of The Extended Phenotype (TEP) was in 1982, a mere three years after my favorite work of his The Selfish Gene (TSG). This close publication date explains why these two books are so similar, and why I felt like TEP was dragging its heels for the first ~200 pages.It was not until chapter 11 that Dawkins began explicating his theory, the pages spent before this point were designed to undercut the reader's focus on the individual organism as the unit of adaptive benefit and instead place his/her faith in the gene. Chapters on Arms Races and Manipulation, Active Germ-line Replicators, and Selfish DNA were slightly modified extractions from TSG and although very relevant to TEP these chapters will be redundant to anyone who is familiar with TSG. It is because of this redundancy that I can say I really liked this book, but wouldn't consider it ""amazing"". Apart from redundancy, TEP is a fairly accessible concept especially for anyone who's familiar with Dawkin's previous work. Genes exert a phenotypic effect, but this isn't limited to the physical body of the organism; genes also affects behavior. A beaver's dam-building behavior is equally the result of its genes as a thick coat of fur, and so it is equally valid to claim a gene 'for' fur as one 'for' dam building. There are also genes 'for' the behavior of other organisms; parasites burrow into ants (their temporary host) and modify their behavior to cause the ant to climb blades of grass and therefore becomes more susceptible to being eaten by grazing sheep (the parasite's permanent host). Here we have genes in one animal for the control of another animal. The ""Bruce Effect"" where male mice exude a pheromone which causes a recently inseminated female mouse to block her pregnancy shows phenotypic action at a distance. A male mouse has in his DNA a gene 'for' phenotypic effect within the DNA of a female mouse. The logical progression of this theory is awesome, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in evolution and genetics. For those who aren't familiar with evolutionary theory there's a glossary in the back to aid reading, but even with a good foundation in evolutionary theory it was a difficult read. Like all Dawkin's books on evolution I highly recommend this. "
21,0192880519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13922772-psykeactiv1,4,"This was a very informative but mentally exhausting book. The technical aspect of the distinction between the organism(s) and the components to which are said to benefit from 'phenotypic effects' was cause for re-reading many paragraphs. Often more than once. It's not new for me to sit with a dictionary/the Internet to research what Dawkins is saying just to get a context, but this felt like a full-blown revisit to Biology. Thankfully because he summarizes his points at the end of each paragraph, even if one is clueless to the specifics of what he's staying, it's still possible to walk away with a confident grasp on how Natural Selection and Adaptive Fitness works. The main premise of this book is that: just as the title to his previous book 'the Selfish Gene' is misleading, the term 'survival of the fittest' is also misleading in that the layman tends to conflate the fitness and selfishness of genes with that of the organism it tends to inhabit. What he and countless other evolutionary biologists observed is that, a phenotype (the visible traits of an organism) exists solely to benefit the gene responsible for such trait or behavior, and to be quite specific, the active germ-line replicator (the potential ancestor of an indefinitely long line of descendents whose nature influences it's chance of being copied). The fitness of an ""individual"" then, would be defined as the reproductive success of an organisms active germ-line replicators. Thus in context, adaptiveness is determined by the genes ability to out-compete alleles within the organism as well as its environment. The reason I put quotations on the word 'individual' is because, as Dawkins makes abundantly clear: a gene is not a unitary entity, nor are the bodies* that genes may inhabit as vehicles from one life cycle to the next.This is important knowledge because if one comes from a theistic mindset, it totally annihilates the idea that evolution could be guided to some ideal state, or serve to benefit one species/person rather than another. In fact, it opens the door to see how even within oneself/an organism may have genes at odds with its own survival. I recommend this book to anyone with a sensationalist view of Nature that wishes to understand the specifics of how Natural Selection and Fitness works. I look forward to reading both 'the Selfish Gene' and 'Climbing Mount Improbable' next."
22,0192880519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12484910-charbel,5,"In The Extended Phenotype, Richard Dawkins proposes that the expression of a gene is not limited simply to the organism's physical appearance or phenotype, that is the direct synthesis of proteins, or to the organism's behaviour, but also includes the impact of the phenotype and the behaviour on the organism's environment. This hypothesis is not experimental in the traditional sense; rather it's a new way to think about the impact of the gene. Of course, this new approach revolves around the idea that the gene is the fundamental unit of life in the organism, and that natural selection does not operate on the organism, or the population, or even the species, but on the gene itself; a concept introduced in The Selfish Gene. Hence, if we follow Dawkins' process of thought, all behaviours and beneficial mutations have the future survival of the gene as the ultimate purpose. This idea appeals to me for several reasons: 1) because it reminds me of the ecosystem approach, where in this case the ecosystem extends from the DNA molecule to the large natural environment, 2) because it raises interesting questions about individual survival and what it truly means to be ""well adapted to one's environment"", and 3) because it incorporates different biological fields ranging from biochemistry to ecology, with all of them orbiting principles of evolutionary biology.This has to be the most objective work by Dawkins that I've read so far. It reads like a laid back thesis, but is substantiated by multiple references and delivered with the refined technique of the experienced professor.   "

The last four chapters explain the long-reach-of-the-gene idea and argue that the phenotypical effects are not limited to one organism. With a multitude of examples Dawkins demonstrates that there is no real reason to believe in ""gene A of X accounts for X's skin color"" and at the same time deny anything like ""gene A of X account's for change in Y's behavior"".

33,0192880519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24870603-jan,4,"This is Dawkins' most explicitly scientific book, the only one that is written primarily with fellow biologists in mind. Reading it now, it's a reminder of how wonderful Dawkins' books were before he embarked on his evangelical atheist polemics. It's really a joy to read, written in his well-known fluent style, and showing his great ability to reason using the principles of evolution, specifically from the 'gene's eye point of view'.It's only in the last chapters that he talks about the extended phenotype. The book deals with a broader range of issues, like what it means for the gene to be a replicator and, in competing with its alleles, is the unit of evolution, and organisms to be just vehicles or survival machines for its genes. Also with evolutionary arms races and manipulation by organisms of other organism's nervous systems. But all these issues are a way for Dawkins to lead us gradually to the idea of the extended phenotype.Just as genes have effects outside the cell in the multicellular organism, often in a very complex and devious way, they also have effects outside the organism in its behaviour. So everything the organism does that varies genetically and is effected by natural selection is an extended result of its genotype, including artefacts that some organisms make. This idea can be further extended to include artefacts that many organisms make together, such as the beehives and termite mounds of the social insects, but also to beaver dams made by cooperating individual mammals. The variation in beaver dams can be studied as expressing mutations in the genes of the beavers, increasing or decreasing their chances of survival. The fact that this expression takes a very long and complex genetic, biochemical and physcial route does not matter.Extended phenotypes even extend beyond species, in the case of symbiosis and the nasty case of parasitism, where the parasite changes the physical appearance or behaviour of its host, not just as an uninteresting symptom of parasitical disease, but because it confers some advantage to the parasite, or rather, to the parasite's genes. From the genes' eye point of view it doesn't even matter in which particular vehicle they are. They just have different strategies to perpetuate their existence by levering themselves into the next generation of organisms. And we have to remember that genes are not certain molecules but information. A code. A code that includes the instructions to make copies of itself and to create encasings or vehicles or tools for themselves made at first of carbon-based molecules but eventually of other materials too, such as the ones in snail houses or beaver dams, to enhance its chances of survival.In the last chapters Dawkins returns to arms races and manipulation. He says that the chapters on these subjects could be entirely rewritten using the idea of the extended phenotype. Genes in one organism have an effect on the phsyiology or behavior of another organism. 'Action at a distance' Dawkins calls it, using Einstein's term for quantum entanglement. When exactly should we use the extended phenotype idea? Dawkins takes a pragmatic view of this: whenever it is convenient in understanding a particular evolutionary phonemenon. The point is always that 'an animal's behaviour tends to maximize the survival of the genes ""for"" that behaviour, whether or not those genes happen to be in the body of the particular animal performing it'.Could we extend this principle indefinitely, in the sense that genes can be said to have an effect via food chains and all interactions within the whole ecosystem? No, that's not useful. The gene's effects must result in feedback in the form of natural selection on the genes themselves. Otherwise we just have chains of causes and effects. Dawkins takes the opportunity to take a swipe at James Lovelock's Gaia theory, in which the whole ecosphere is said to be an organism, regulating itself to continue its existence.In principle a phenotype's extension in space is unlimited, but in practice the furthest reach of the gene is probably the size of the lakes that result from beaver dams.Still I wonder to what extent human civilizations in history can be said to be extended phenotypes of human genes, as a kind of very complicated, intricate termite mounds, using not only genetical and biochemical but also memetical pathways of cultural evolution. Surely not in their details, but at a sufficiently low resolution. Their general characteristics like efficiency in organization, information processing and knowledge creation must have determined their relative success, and thereby the survival or extinction of the genes of their members.This competition between human civilisations in history leads us to group selection theory. A heresy to the puritanical Dawkins, but recently much advanced by other evolutionairy biologists such as E.O.Wilson (see for instance The Social Conquest of Earth) and David Sloan Wilson (Evolution for Everyone, and his new book This View of Life, which is on my reading list.)"
34,0192880519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58812554-vhey-casison,5,"As thought-provoking and as perspicuous as his other books. If you want to see the biological world through Dawkins' eyes, read this book and the Selfish Gene (TSG). The reader is warned, however, that the Extended Phenotype (TEP) definitely requires more brain power than TSG. The arguments presented are as philosophical as they are scientific. Unlike his other books, TEP is more scholarly written complete with parenthetical citations and a glossary of terms. If not for Dawkins' popular writing style, it would have been as dry as a textbook. After all, the target audience is professional biologists and students who have more than a smattering knowledge of biology. Readers should have strong grasp of basic concepts in genetics, molecular biology, and evolutionary theory, to profit from the initial investment of buying the book. Reading TSG beforehand will also increase your appreciation for this book, as TSG introduces important concepts like the replicator/vehicle distinction, evolutionary stable strategies (ESS), and kin selection.As the author says early in the first chapter, TEP doesn't offer testable hypotheses nor new theories that will revolutionize evolutionary biology. Instead it offers an alternative way of seeing biological facts, a point of view that, like the other side of a flipping optical illusion, is not necessarily more correct than its counterpart. The POV Dawkins is advocating is called the doctrine of the ""selfish gene with its extended phenotype"", as opposed to the doctrine of the selfish organism. Briefly the former forces us to see adaptations as traits that have evolved by natural selection not necessarily because they benefit the individual organism but because they aid the continued survival of the genes responsible for them. It is the main thesis of TEP that genes can exert phenotypic effects beyond the body that contains it, e.g., bower bird's genes determining variation in nest structure, beaver genes determining variation in beaver dam size, or parasitic worm genes determining variation in an intermediate shrimp host phototaxis behavior. Therefore traits that may seem maladaptive for the individual who expresses them may be favored and maintained by natural selection because they benefit the genes in another organism. Organisms are temporary vehicles for the true players in the struggle for existence, genes.My personal favorites in TEP are those examples, whether derived from actual research or just hypothetical thought experiments, that serve to prove the author's theses. Dawkins seems to have vast knowledge of animal arms race and manipulation (he even wrote a journal article about it). I find it interesting his discussion of arms race in cuckoo birds as well as social parasitism in ants. The topic of meiotic drive and the existence of segregation distorter genes that disrupt the random lottery of meiosis thereby increasing the said genes' chance of getting into the next generation at the expense of others' -- prove that genes can, and will, ""rebel"" against the interest of the whole genome if opportunity arrives. The example on the bacterial tumor-inducing plasmid causing crown gall in plants sounds so oddly satisfying in gene language in contrast to, say, a""selfish bacteria"" one. I believe this book is a must-read for any student of biology."
35,0192880519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96342578-grips,3,"I commend Richard for his childlike infatuation with his lifelong object of study. It permits him great stamina in meandering unnecessarily long semantic labyrinths for explaining the most trivial of points. He really loves his thought experiments. Unfortunately however, for the less than raptly engrossed among us, it makes for a tiresome read. The prose, instead of flowing free and clear like water, feels doughy. Going through this book feels like wading waist deep through strawberry jam. Smells nice and it tastes sweet but it is nonetheless an absolute slough.Much because the actual thesis of the book begins at the 60% mark: chapter 11 (out of 14) and it ends at the 76% mark, chapter 13. I wish I knew this before I started reading. Where was Richard’s editor, did he simply give up?The extended phenotype, as the name implies, makes the case for the impracticality of arbitrarily defining the boundary of the phenotype and its effects at the epidermal layer. It doesn’t bring novel grounds to cover but rather through an exercise of logic arrives at the necessary conclusion given existing evidence and reasoning. It can be summarized as: 
The replicators that exist tend to be the ones that are good at manipulating the world to their own advantage. In doing this they exploit the opportunities offered by their environments, and an important aspect of the environment of a replicator is other replicators and their phenotypic manifestations. Those replicators are successful whose beneficial phenotypic effects are conditional upon the presence of other replicators which happen to be common. These other replicators are also successful, otherwise they would not be common. The world therefore tends to become populated by mutually compatible sets of successful replicators, replicators that get on well together. In principle this applies to replicators in different gene pools, different species, classes, phyla and kingdoms. But a relationship of specially intimate mutual compatibility has grown up between subsets of replicators that share cell nuclei and, where the existence of sexual reproduction makes the expression meaningful, share gene-pools.
 Or even more succintly, 
An animal’s behaviour tends to maximize the survival of the genes ‘for’ that behaviour, whether or not those genes happen to be in the body of the particular animal performing the behaviour.
 This is a great idea. I would almost call The Extended Phenotype a revolutionary phenotype theory, would that name not be taken already by its eponymous successor, thereon worthy of it in the superlative."
36,0192880519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67413965-benjamin-arnold,4,"I have waited to read this book for almost six years, and I must say, it didn't disappoint. I'm also glad I had to wait for that long, because I'm not sure my younger self would have been able to appreciate the book fully, even if I'd understood it. This book is not a light read; although only 250 pages or so, it took hours and hours of concentration to finish, and even now I feel I need to re-read it to understand it fully. In short, it's not something to read unless you are really interested in the topic, and to any layman I would recommend reading the Selfish Gene first.Dawkins is very clear with his lines of reasoning. The chapters which are good are really, really good. I enjoyed especially the chapter on Outlaws and Modifiers, the Active Germ-Line Replicator, and the final three or four chapters in which the central thesis of the book is explored. The way Dawkins takes a point to its ultimate conclusion, the way he manages to go beyond the point at which any other person would sit satisfied is amazing. Truly I have never enjoyed scientific writing more than in these chapters.However, I have one (very major) grudge with this book, which is why I didn't give it five stars. Dawkins is too defensive of his ideas than necessary; the title of this book should ideally be ""The Extended Phenotype, and Miscellaneous Topics and Debates in Evolutionary Biology."" There's no harm in defending your own ideas, and these chapters are probably a lot more interesting to an expert in the field, but they are frankly very boring for someone who doesn't know the wider context of the debates. Ideally, these two sections of the book should be separated so that it's easier to get down to the good stuff.If you enjoyed reading the Selfish Gene, give this a shot. It's well worth the hard work, but I'd advise skipping the chapters which seem irrelevant, because they really don't add much to the book unless you have an interest in those debates."
37,0192880519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90186128-clyde-macalister,5,"Dawkins beyond succeeds in pursuing the task implied by the title of the book and the topic of his first best seller: beginning with the gene-centered view of evolution as his main, first principle, he infers the ""extended"" phenotypic effects of genes outside the strict confines of particular vehicles (cells, organisms, groups, etc.) -- the cliché example being dams constructed by beavers.Reading some of the other reviews of the book, it seems to strike many readers as difficult reading. I don't, on the whole, accept this claim. To be sure, the primary audience was intended to be professional biologists, but general audiences were not excluded as a possible readership as well. Most of the explanation is pretty intuitive, and even the comparatively more esoteric, specialized language can be easily deciphered by any non-biologist with the glossary provided in the back. I don't claim expertise on biology and especially genetics, but Dawkins does not fail to reach out to people like me. If I can do it so can you.Dawkins's theoretical paradigm in this work, much like in The Selfish Gene, integrates heavily the thought and contributions of all the most important scientists of the modern synthesis, including William Hamilton, E.O. Wilson, George Williams, Robert Trivers, Ronald Fisher, and others. Moreover, he addresses the few, minor details where these men have erred. He also confronts assailants of gene-centered theory, especially Richard Lewontin and Stephen Jay Gould, and performs particularly well in his rebuttal of the strawman claim that proponents of the theory posit genetic determinism. One has no shortage of empirical evidence Dawkins cites for his theoretical claims to admire, either, including the examples snails, shrimps, various parasites, cuckoos, the prokaryotic origins of eukaryotic life, and many others. I can identify no noteworthy defects in this book whatsoever, empirically or theoretically."
38,0192880519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106010728-jens,0,"Valid criticism towards selfish gene theory, it is a good start to redirect public understanding into how genes are formed. As the book stated, gene myth has become a cultural meme and laziness of thinking, and it's good to use scientific method to reveal this cultural absurd. Affecting is not equal to determining. Optimization, manipulation and maximization are fantasies, we should drift from instrumentalising part of traits into acknowledging performance of a pool of genes. Meaning Darwin had not provided a full picture.I'm not so sure about analogy between genes and memes, although both are passive/active, but there is a problem of accountability, as it's all valified by observations, it might be limited to earth sphere. Replicators and vehicles might seem right metaphors, but I think replication is only one of the observations of the system we try to picture. Outlaw, modifier and superfluous DNA might explain this better, where active two might only be reactions that the speed surpasses the purposeless one. Yet, the rethinking ""fitness"" is crucial, as it is relative and implies some struggles from Darrida's Of Grammatology, where we have this tendency to compare and form habits, even for observation of our phenotype.So, how should we approach observing reactions and settlement of change within a period of time? Extended phenotype seems to be a good start, but I have gut feeling on this should not be the conclusion for what has drew into the book. By doing so, we can put both individualistic Darwinism and ecological beings together in adjacent possibilities"

I was able to understand in detail how evolution has operated throughout the ages. This 1982 sequel, aimed at other biologists, developed his new idea of the extended phenotype. Many people misunderstand the idea of ""fitness"". We tend to think that an organism or a group of organisms that looks out for its own interests will pass on its genes. But that is not necessarily the case. Often times, organisms are manipulated by other organisms, parasites, and even members of the same species, into doing things that benefit another organism's genes. Manipulation is but one way that an organism can benefit another's genes, and it was interesting to learn about the different ways this occurs in nature.The most important message of the book was to change our perspective of the individual organism selfishly acting for its own benefit to focus on the genes within organisms extending their influence to the outside world, even beyond the skin and outer tissues they are contained in, to manipulate their environment, thereby increasing their chances of being propagated. This amazing intersection of webs of influences creates a world in which gene exchange can even be affected from a distance!! I highly recommend this book, but prepare yourself by studying the basics of evolutionary biology first."

Acclaimed to be Dawkins's most original and intuitive work, I had no reservations putting my concentration to the test, trusting that the rewards would match those which I had received from The Selfish Gene. Unfortunately, while at times I was greatly entertained, I did not realize how apt it was on page one for Dawkins to call a layman a ""spectator"" in this grand novel of digressions and counter-arguments. Truly, if you do not participate actively in the concerned fields, a large portion of this book will bore you for the sheer reason that it is meant to wrangle up the beliefs of his contemporaries and set them straight. As a layman, however, I followed these arguments with ever more frustration, not simply for the difficulty of the text, but for the outdated ideas like ""junk DNA,"" which to be fair, Dawkins mentions each time as ""so-called junk DNA."" More explicitly, one example, and one source of my queer amusement, was the confusing nature of cistrons, which certainly was confusing at the time of this book's publishing, but is now only confusing because we've solved it, and found a hundred more questions. Therefore, I hope it is not insulting that I consider Dawkins's speculation on that subject be secondary to a layman's interest in this book, and therefore frustrating, especially as it is made into a long digression-- the like of which characterizes this book."

It is a very worthwhile book if you are interested in how genes work. It's long though so if you get the following points you can likely skim it or skip the book altogether. I found that it explained the concept at more length than was necessary for me to internalize it.I think the two interesting points that Dawkins put forward in The Extended Phenotype are, one being the book's namesake, and the other an exposition about organism bodies. The first being the phenomenon that phenotopic effects act on the world around them at large and need not stop at the boundary of the individual's body. This means that genes on one animal can change behaviors in another animal even ones of a different species and that those behavior changes benefit the propagation of the gene that caused the behavior.The other is interesting but only really touched on at the end of the book. It is an exploration as to why genes house themselves in discrete bodies at all. He attempts to explain, convincingly enough, that complex changes to body structure can only be achieved by reproduction (as opposed to simple growth) because the genes have the opportunity to act on the individual's development phase."

I started this shortly after finishing ""The Selfish Gene"", a book I very much enjoyed. It was fresh and disruptive and easy to follow. ""The Extended Phenotype"", however, seems to cement and extend already established ideas, in a very, very thorough way. It's like a boring book on a fascinating topic.On the one hand, this might be due to the book's age: the ideas in there are have been popularized for several decades already and had I not known what the extended phenotype means in a broad sense from popular science media, I probably wouldn't have picked up the book in the first place. On the other hand, it's about very abstract, near-philosophical matters that are being backed up in as much a scientific way as possible. I applaud Mr. Dawkin's thoroughness of citation and his achievement of weaving such an intricate contextual net by referring and commenting on so many other sources. But being a reader of all this 35 years after that context was contemporary is just painful.I hope the reader of these lines notices that this was just a commentary on my personal enjoyment of reading an old book, not a judgement of the book's quality. I can imagine that for many a scientist in the early 80s, this was book was a revelation. I wish I had read it then."

I went into this book with a more teleological view of nature - that has been completely shattered. I also went in with an underlying idea about the perfection of nature and how everything just fits together in a 'perfect', 'balanced' and 'elegant' way - that has also been shattered. These things aren't even the main subjects of the book! The main subject is an eye opening perspective shift that is about extending the effects of the genes of an organism beyond the confines of the organism that the genes happen to sit in. Beautifully articulated by Richard Dawkins with heaps of thought experiments, examples and reasoning. The fantastic thing about the thought experiments is that, as far fetched as some of them seem, nature often out does them! Reality is far stranger than fiction! Glad to have taken the time to read this."

Part of my issue being his framing of evolution acting on the genetic level. That is with 'genes' being the primary agents that natural selection acts upon as opposed to individual organisms which I am more familiar with. It is still a framework which I find difficult to fully conceptualize myself. This not being helped by how biology and writings on evolution are not my forte. With these personal setbacks in mind, I found this book to be a fair amount more enjoyable to read. I thought it was really interesting. The reading was slow going, but I still found the ideas and arguments put forward to be thought provoking. His thesis of the extended phenotype reminds me of more recent ideas such as niche construction in neuroanthropology and the work of Tim Ingold. From a different direction obviously, but nonetheless an interesting take. "

I personally didn’t feel the last chapter added much, largely due to my degree having prepared me quite well for the main conclusion of the book, given in the penultimate chapter. But this could also be down to the other main problem with the book - its complexity. This is only a problem if you’re reading it when tired, but this ended up delaying me finishing it by some way, because the only opportunities I had to read were at times when I would always be tired. Still, when awake enough to appreciate it, this is essentially The Selfish Gene for students and scientists, which makes it a very interesting read. I can’t wait to see what studies have been done on extended phenotypic effects since its publication 36 years ago."

While the 'Selfish Gene' can be read by laypeople, I feel like the 'Extended Phenotype' requires some biological background, and even then it is not an easy read.It might be annoying for some readers that the first two-thirds of the book is actually just Dawkins' response to the criticism that Selfish Gene received, and seemingly boring discussion full of jargon. The actual theory of the Extended Phenotype is only the last one third of the book, maybe even less.However, for those who are truly into this subject, I think this will not be a problem.

75,0192880519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28363483-heather-stowell,4,"What continues to impress me about Dawkins’ writing is his accessible style, with solid opening paragraphs and good chapter endings. So much so, that I was able to trace backwards his basic ideas presented in, “The Extended Phenotype,” and translate them from the language of phenotypes to epigenetics. Phenotypes are the set of epigenetic features that change a cell. Dawkins’ openly states his thesis:  “The thesis that I shall support is this. It is legitimate to speak of adaptations as being ‘for the benefit of” something, but that something is best not seen as an individual organism. It is a smaller unit, which I call the active germ line replicator. The most important kind of replicator is the gene or small genetic fragment. Replicators are not, of course, selected directly, but by proxy; they are judged by their phenotypic effects. Al though for some purposes it is convenient to think of these phenotypic effects as being packaged together in discrete vehicles such as individual organisms, this is not fundamentally necessary. Rather the replicator should be thought of as having extended phenotypic effects, consisting of all its effects on the world at large, not just its effects on the individual body in which it happens to be sitting.” p.4 Three types of extended phenotypeFirst there is a capacity of animals to alter their environment using physical constructions or creating animal artefacts, like beaver dams, termite mounds, and possibly beehive site selection and spider webs. Second, some parasitic organisms have a direct ability be alter their environment to their advantage, through the capacity to benefit from a host organism. Parasites that manipulate host behavior to facilitate its own reproduction can be found in the female Sacculina (a barnacle like parasite) that finds a male crab, penetrates its shell, sterilizes it, widens its abdomen, hormonally changes the male into a female and deposits her eggs.The third type of extended phenotype refers to an action at a distance. These are found in morphological - markers are often detectable by eye, by simple visual inspection. Many butterflies mimic the color pattern of the Monarch Butterfly, which is brought about by the nectar of milkweed. But only the Monarch is immune to the poison in milkweed and the Monarch is the only one that is poisonous if eaten by a predator. The false Monarchs indirectly benefit from the adaption of the Monarchs color pattern schemata. Or another idea is that of female choice and sexual selection and it is called indirect choice. It is the notion that females are not making active choices of males, but through their actions, they are selecting for sexually selected traits. Many courtship routines entail elaborate and vigorous chasing and the like, and a female may indirectly select the best male by performing such actions. Only the fittest male can keep up with her and she will weed out any stragglers. Selection favors the more vigorous males and any aspects of secondary sexual traits that aid in such pursuit.Daniel Dennet in the Afterword very succinctly condenses one of Dawkins major theorems that presages the present day enticing examination into epigenetics with;  “Dawkins makes a very important point that a change in the environment may not just change the success rate of a phenotypic effect; it may change the phenotypic effect altogether!” I admire Dawkins not only for his clear communication style but is ability to speculate with such a reasoned capacity that his theories actually become part of everyday scientific dialogue. I also really like how Dawkins differentiates between the Gaia hypothesis and a genecentric worldview; it really helped to clear this up for me. 4.5 "
76,0192880519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84358220-sunrise-brit,4,"75% = 4 StarWhile this book isn't as complex as I was hoping, it was written well. I like that the author has moved on from the strict darwinian view to perhaps a slight derivative. An example would be, organisms are often seen as not acting in their own best interest, but in the best interest of another organism who is manipulating it. I can point out so many examples of this in my observations of people that to consider it on smaller and smaller scales of biology is really interesting. Overall, this is a very interesting book and it has some good examples. It introduces modern ideas regarding genetics and evolution, and definitely adds to the greater discussion."
77,0192880519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28203914-luke,5,"	I recently finished The Extended Phenotype by Professor Richard Dawkins. Published over thirty years ago this book is surprisingly relevant as well as profoundly interesting and important. This book is a “work of unabashed advocacy” used by the author, a prominent Biologist, to introduce his view he dubbed the Extended Phenotype. It is a work of nonfiction, but is more of a zealous lecture than a narrative. This book is an extension of his first book, The Selfish Gene which introduces his theory that the unit natural selection acts on is the gene and not the individual. In The Extended Phenotype Dawkins shows that it is most useful and accurate to view all phenotypic effects of life as the effects of genes which natural selection acts upon. He wants us to appreciate that genes from other organisms such as parasites can affect our phenotypes causing behaviors such as coughing as well as more traditional effects such as rashes.	Richard Dawkins uses exceptionally well chosen and expertly articulated analogies and thought experiments to not only show the flaws in many alternate views, but also to clearly and logically convince the reader of this viewpoint. His viewpoint is summarized in his thesis, “An animal’s behavior tends to maximize the survival of the genes ‘for’ that behavior, whether or not those genes happen to be in the body of the particular animal performing it.” While I do think very highly of this book wouldn’t recommend it to anyone without either reading The Selfish Gene first or having a background in biology. That is partially because it would be significantly more difficult to understand without having at least one of the two, but also because the book would be less meaningful without all of the connections and references he makes.	My favorite thing about this book other than the exciting implications and awe of nature it inspires is Dawkins’ voice. He regularly uses examples which not only capture his point perfectly but are hilariously memorable. On page 36 while talking on the time lag effect in adaptations he uses the example of how “the hedgehog antipredator response of rolling up into a ball is sadly inadequate against motor cars.” He also almost compulsively defends every statement and logical babystep which sometimes seems unnecessary, but all of my complaints were put to rest when multiple times after reading a sentence I made note of my disagreement only to find my issue addressed and put to rest in the very next paragraph. This being said I didn’t find myself having any major issues with his argument as I was already a proponent after its single chapter in The Selfish Gene. That combined with his exemplary defense of his logic makes it difficult imaging any argument having legs to stand on.	Since I can’t argue with the book I will return to fawning over it. The Extended Phenotype is a fascinating read for anyone who is interested in evolution or biology in general as long as they are willing to crack a dictionary on occasion. This book will stick with me and presumably most of the people who read it as it highlights an entire new viewpoint from which to look at all life, (though of course Richard Dawkins justifiably gives humans a wide berth.) Though the book’s main point is to introduce his revolutionary viewpoint, the examples alone would have made the book worth it for me. From parasitic flukes causing snails to have thicker shells to assassinating ants named “Bothriomyrmex regicidus and B.decapitans,” this book is well worth reading for anyone with an interest in biology."
78,0192880519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116847-nicolai,5,"you stand in the midst of uncountable interlocking fields of replicator power!!!an extended phenotypic character i teh product of teh intereaction of many genes whose influence impinges from both inside and outside the organism. this book follows on logically from the selfish gene and takes the genes eye view all the way outward from the gene to its ultimate effects. genes exert quatitative, mutually interactive, mutually modifying, effects on a shared phenotype. natural selection is the process whereby some alleles outpropagate their alternatives. the instruments by which they achieve this are their phenotypic effects. therefore, phenotypic effects can always be thought of as relative to alternative phenoptypic effects. the phenotypic effects of genes, whether at the level of intracellular biochecmistry, gross bodily morphology, or extended phenoptype, are potentially devices by whcih genes lever themselves into the next generation. dick roe ko lee um, den dree tik um - dicrocoelium dendriticum. in teh case of parasites the extended phenotype reaches out of teh body in whose cells the genes lie, reaches out to the tissues of other organisms. in this sense there is no important distinction between our 'own' genes and parasitic or symbiotic insertion sequences. for example, a cuckoo has a particularly bright gape that reaches into the nervous system of the reed warbler via its eyes, and has a particualrlly shrill loud begging cry that reaches in through the ears - control through the eyes and ears. therefore, cuckoo genes to exert their development power over host phenotypes have to reply on action at a distance. an animals behaviour tends to maximise the survival of the genes for that behaviour whether or not those genes happen to be in the body of the particular animal performing it. for example, as i write this i have a virus in my eye that causes intense itching and therefore rubing and therefore spreading.natural slection is all about relative success. loci in germ line chromosomes are hotly contested pieces of property. most replicators have won their place by defeating available alleles. the weapons with whcih they won and the weapons with which their rivals lost are their respective phenotypic consequences. a network of relationships must be made up of small self interested unitsa replicator is the centre of a field of influence on the world at large. casual influence radiates out from the replicator but ist power does not decay with distance according to any simple mathematical law. it travels wherever it can, far or near, along available avenues. in the same way every gene is the centre of a radiating field of influence on the world, a phenotypic character is teh centre of converging influences fom many genes. genes are selected against the background of the other genes that happen to be frequent in the gene pool a gene works in a world of phenotypic consequences of other genes. the living world is a network of interlocking fields of replicator power. therefore, phenotypic cahracter turns out to bear the marks of compromise between internal and external replicator forces. sex is capable of leading to complex adaptations in a way that cloning canot by cyclically repeating the development process starting with ONE cell; developmental bottleneck; a new begining.

79,0192880519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49570809-ann,3,"Solid, interesting.. I often felt like points were drawn out and repeated more than necessary (but maybe I was only looking for a more superficial understanding that Dawkins was trying to share). I was introduced to the idea of outlaw genes, which is super cool.The buildup to extended phenotype was clear and deliberate. "
80,0192880519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66087336-jovan-lazarevski,5,"After his revolutionary book ""The Selfish Gene"" which established the gene itself as a unit of natural selection, Richard Dawkins introduced the concept of extended phenotype. Genes compete with their alleles for a particular locus on the chromosomes. They do that by exerting phenotypic effects. The first and direct phenotypic effect of a gene is the amino acid sequence for which they are coding. Those amino acid sequences are proteins which are building blocks of cells, tissues, organs, bodies. Up until the introduction of this concept by Dawkins, most biologists were thinking of the body as the final phenotypic effect of the genes in the whole phenotypic chain. But why stop there? Can the phenotypic effects of genes extend beyond the bodies which they are riding in? Yes. A prime example of this is the behaviour of reed warblers and other birds which are manipulated by cuckoos. A female cuckoo hatches its egg in the nest of the reed warbler. The reed warbler then cares for the young cuckoo by feeding it, even though the young cuckoo is not its kin, which means they are not sharing genes. The cuckoo is manipulating the reed warbler with its red gape, which prompts the reed warbler to feed the young cuckoo. We can say that the reed warbler is addicted to the red gape of the cuckoo. The red gape of cuckoos is a phenotypic effect of the genes in cuckoos genome. So is the behaviour of the reed warbler. So the reed warbler behaviour is the extended phenotypic effect of the genes in the cuckoo. Dawkins summarized the idea ""An animal's behaviour tends to maximize the survival of the genes ""for"" that behaviour, whether or not those genes happen to be in the body of the particular animal performing it"". Even though it is more challenging and harder to grasp than ""The Selfish Gene"", it is a fantastic read nevertheless."
81,0192880519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7891595-alex,3,"This was a strange one. First of all, Dawkins starts by saying the book is written for his professional colleagues and that laypeople who have read his other works may struggle. I fall into the former category (I'm currently doing a PhD in evolutionary biology), but I also found this a real struggle. It wasn't because the language was too technical or the idea were beyond me - this book is really in two parts.The Extended Phenotype builds on and follows on from Dawkins's previous work, the infamous The Selfish Gene. However, despite the gene-centred view of evolution he puts forward in that being accepted by the majority of evolutionary biologists today, this was not the case six years later, when this book came out. As a result, he spends the early part of the book responding to criticism and reinforcing the idea of the gene as the unit of selection. This part of the book is a real slog - full of arguments Dawkins was having in the 70s which aren't relevant today. We know he was right, and that Wilson was wrong on kin selection, and Gould's punctuated equilibrium is a load of nonsense. I'd rather read a book of his Twitter rants than read these chapters over again. And unfortunately, this takes up nearly the entire book - ten chapters of a fourteen page book. I actually skipped the last two because I couldn't take anymore. If you've read The Selfish Gene, these are unnecessary. If you've not read The Selfish Gene, then why are you reading this?But if those chapters were Dawkins at his worst, the last four reminded me about why I loved his work in the first place. A natural progression from The Selfish Gene, Dawkins illustrates how genes can display their phenotypes outside the organism, and that selection still works on these ""extended phenotypes"". I flew through these chapters in a couple of days, whereas the rest of the book took me a couple of months and I nearly gave up.This book badly needs revising. The first part, while probably needed at the time, just isn't necessary anymore and detracts from the work as a whole. The chapters actually about the extended phenotype are just about the best thing he's written, but could do with being in a book by themselves, or maybe in a combined volume with The Selfish Gene. I'd recommend this, but make sure you start on page 195."
82,0192880519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10360599-alex-daniel,3,"More of a sequel than a standalone work. Scattered, and many chapters serve simply as clarifications or defenses of past work (The Selfish Gene). Last three/four chapters are great."
83,0192880519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12354264-glauber,5,"The first two thirds of the book are actually an extension of the previous book (The Selfish Gene) where Dawkins goes deeper in that idea and discusses whatever he thought necessary before actually discussing the idea of the extended phenotype, which he does in the last third of the book. Again, this idea is not a real theory, instead, it's a different way of seeing things just like the selfish gene was. Indeed, the extended phenotype idea is more of a corollary that follows from the selfish gene point of view, so if you think from the point of view of the gene then phenotypes will be regarded in a different way also. Overall the idea is very interesting and valid, which makes me ponder on why hasn't this book being more popular. Maybe because it seems that this idea has limited practical applications, or maybe because it eventually changed the definition of phenotype in a way that many people didn't like. Whatever the reason, it is a very good book in my opinion and I do recommend it, though it cannot be read by those who didn't read the previous one (The Selfish Gene).Note: A small flaw of his writing is the confusion he unintentionally creates with genes and alleles. For most of what he is talking this distinction doesn't really matter, so he prefers to use the word gene for both, rarely using the word allele, but sometimes he forgets the distinction is due and it becomes confusing to understand when this happens. Another possible flaw is that sometimes you can notice a flaw on a given argument right from the start (and he knows it), but he will only discuss the flaw after he has completely exhausted the initial argument, which means you must be patient and read until the end before taking your own conclusion (it seems to me now that biologists do it all the time, but most people are not used to this kind of “listen to it all before criticizing” habit)."
84,0192880519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15655372-alan-clark,4,"As a layman, as opposed to the professional biologist to whom the book is primarily aimed, I did not know what to expect. I have read his other books and had little difficulty with them, and some parts of this were heavy going for me so I did occasionally skip a few pages. However there is much of interest. As well as giving a different perspective on Evolution, Dawkins illustrates his book with many interesting examples of animal behaviour, and talks about them from a game-playing point of view, with different players trying to adopt the best strategy in a complex situation. In the case of bees, for example, the workers and queens are cooperating up to a point, but they also have slightly different objectives at the same time, leading to a complicated situation.I also enjoyed his brief discussion of the Gaia hypothesis, which I have always regarded as screwy, and Dawkins reinforces my opinion.My only minor disagreement concerns his discussion of the Bruce Effect, whereby male mice cause a pregnant female to abort, presumably so that the male can fertilse her himself. Dawkins says that ""we now guess that females would be unlikely to to submit to such manipulation without resistance.."". However, it would make sense for the female not to resist, because it would make sense to have sons which carry the Bruce Effect genes. Of course, the baby mice would not agree, so it is best for them if they somehow resist being aborted, which would give rise to an interesting arms race!certainly not a light read, but worth reading if that fact does not put you off."
85,0192880519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3241028-c-s-lane,5,"In which Richard Dawkins cogently explains the logical extension of phenotypic effects beyond the confines of the organism.Even if Dawkins had not already established himself as an eminent voice in contemporary biology with his propagation of the concept of Selfish Genes---this book--this idea: the extended phenotype---would well have been enough to secure his legacy all on its own.Dawkin's idea of the Extended Phenotype is perhaps the theoretical crowning jewel of his career, and it is an idea with which all scientifically literate individuals should at least attempt to aquatint themselves.A note however, for the lay reader:THE EXTENDED PHENOTYPE was written for the professional biologist, and although its arguments are easy enough to follow (with a smidgen of grit), the vocabulary Dawkins uses might be sufficiently unfamiliar to preclude a lay reader's comprehension. If readers are not already familiar with the jargon of Genetics (phenotypes, genotypes, fillial generations, monohybrid crosses, gametes, etc.), they might find this book to require more effort than they are personally willing to exert, even for the conceptual gem it contains.To read THE EXTENDED PHENOTYPE, readers do not need advanced degrees in Biology, but they do need at a solid, rudimentary grounding in the basics of Genetics and Natural Selection.Insum:This book is an absolutely enlightening read for readers with sufficient preparation --- but it is likely a tangled, unintelligible mess for readers without the proper background."
86,0192880519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/705887-broodingferret,4,"Well, that took a while. This book is not for everyone. Dawkins himself says in the Introduction that this book is intended for professional biologists and not laymen, and it is no understatement. Halfway through the book I had to stop and take a break, during which I read the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, a trashy queer beach-read and two graphic novels.This book is absolutely fascinating, though it requires quite a bit of rigor to complete (having an encyclopedia handy doesn't hurt, either). Though The Extended Phenotype is not intended for mass-consumption, Dawkins does realize that many less informed people might make a go at it, so he includes a glossary of the more obscure biological jargon, which is helpful. Dawkins' thesis, that genes can be viewed as having phenotypic effects far outside of the bodies in which they dwell and that these effects can feedback and improve the genes' own inclusive fitness (to give an overly simplified synopsis that does this book no justice), while not empirically testable, is nonetheless quite fascinating. Rather than a testable hypothesis, Dawkins' idea of the extended phenotype is simply another way of viewing gene selection, a shift in vantage point that makes the genetic Necker Cube flip (to use Dawkins' own metaphor). If you like a challenge and have an interest in biology, I highly recommend this book."
87,0192880519,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12309462-jason-griggs,2,"This book contains wonderfully interesting information about the animal world. I had no idea that some of those bizarre parasitic organisms existed or that many of the commonly known organisms have such elaborate strategies for competing with each other. If you liked The Selfish Gene, then be reassured that The Extended Phenotype is full of the type of factoids that you enjoyed in the first book. The problem is that it is a poorly written book with too many long tangents upon tangents. This leads to a very confusing structure. Also, the author devoted a significant portion of the book to countering critiques of his previous books and articles. Although Dawkins is the king of the snarky riposte, that section probably won't interest the readers who are not academic scientists.For potential readers who want to know the thesis before deciding to purchase this book, Dawkins extends the paradigm that he began in The Selfish Gene -- that natural selection does not select genes for the reproductive success of the species or for the reproductive success of the individual organism, but rather it selects for the success of the gene. He considers the organism a mere vehicle and then examines a variety of hypothetical and real organism-organism interactions to blur the boundaries between that vehicle and its environment."

This is why I think I'm being terribly unfair with just a three-star rating, but at least I'm being honest. It's not that I couldn't keep up with the level of argument and the abundance of technical terms, no - I just didn't care! I have no interest in the nuances of the evolution wars that were going on at Dawkin's time of writing, and I completely devoured the Selfish Gene, so for me about a third of the book consisted of preaching to the choir, on that it was spent refuting criticisms of Dawkins' earlier theory. I found myself skipping these clarificatory passages.And yet! The actual core argument (which can be found in the last four chapters) is so elegantly delivered, that I would have given it five stars had it been published on its own. It offers a wonderful new perspective on genetics that, taken together with the Selfish Gene, has certainly revolutionised my outlook on evolutionary biology. I'd gush a bit more but I'd probably end up quoting blocks of text verbatim from Daniel Dennett's afterword verbatim, as he shares my perspective of an 'outsider' whose formal discipline is philosophy, and appreciates the book for its sustained consistent arguments and beautiful thought experiments. Classic early Dawkins."

In The Selfish Gene (1976) Dawkins advocated a gene's eye view of evolution: it's best to focus on the effects of and cost and benefits for a gene (or combination of genes) to explain phenotypes and behaviour. The fact that genes have to 'operate' in an environment full of competitors (at the same locus on a chromosome) and of colleagues (at others loci on all chromosomes) leads inevitably to evolutionary stable states and strategies. This explains cooperation and altruism in organisms. In The Extended phenotype Dawkins takes his gene's eye view on evolution to its logical conclusion: we have to look at all the effects a gene has on its environment: inside the cell, inside the organism and in the world at large. This means that a beaver dam is just as much a phenotype as a beavers tail or a beavers mating behavior. In the preface to this book Dawkins says that this book is mainly written for professional biologists. This means that this book is a tough one to read for the layman. Nonetheless I found it (on my re-read) easy to follow - which says more about Dawkins' capacity for explaining difficult themes in a clear language than it does about my own intelligence. For me this is one of those rare books that really lets me see the world through a different lens. Amazing job!"
