Before you get too far into the book, you may wonder if the author is not setting you up to join him in a plants' rights campaign. But if you read to the end you will be disabused of such a conclusion. In fact, you will find that such anthropomorphizing is not the purpose of the book. It is simply a book to increase the awareness (a word chosen in harmony with the content of the book) of what plants ""see."" ""smell,"" ""feel,"" ""hear,"" ""taste,"" ""known,"" and ""remember,"" but do not think or reason about--just sense and remember for the survival value involved. I'm always put off by the use of ""very"" as a modifier for ""unique,"" which the author chose to do at one point, so the book could use some critical editing, but it is a totally fascinating book."
1,0374288739,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12267442-melindrift,5,"Silly rabbit. Plants don’t have a brain or central nervous system – how can they “know” anything? Turns out though, that their cells communicate with electrical currents and contain some of the same neuroreceptors as human cells. Huh? Also, they see. They have photoreceptors on the tips of their shoots that cause the stalks to bend toward light (if you cut off the tip, the rest of the stalk doesn’t bend). And, they smell. Infested trees let off a chemical that bugs don’t like, and trees nearby pick up that scent and release the same chemical to ward off attacks. People, they remember. A fly has to be big enough to trigger at least two little hairs on the Venus Flytrap within a certain period of time for the trap to snap shut.The author Daniel Chamovitz is Tel Aviv University’s director of the Manna Center for Plant Biosciences, a field that has apparently blossomed (pardon the pun) over the past decade. Chamovitz makes the topic very accessible by using the science behind our human senses as a jumping off point for exploring the similarities and differences between us and plants. The result is an extremely clear and utterly fascinating overview of what plants know. I loved this book. Ate it up. Thanks again to Brain Pickings for another cool recommendation."
2,0374288739,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21675244-stian,3,"Have you ever wondered what plants 'see'? What they 'smell'? What they feel? How come a plant 'knows' when and how to bend towards the light? Does the colour of the light play a role in all this? What about the day and night cycle, do plants have some sort of circadian rhythm? Do plants experience jet lag? How does the plant distinguish between colours? How come a plant can tell that there's a bug on its leaves? If the bug is a dangerous one, how come it 'knows' that and will release chemicals to defend itself?If any of this is interesting you, and you want to find out about these things, you should read this book. It's short, sweet, and very fascinating. Chamovitz shows you not only what we know about plants today, but also how we came to know those things -- through ingenious and oftentimes laborious experiments. Books like this remind me how much we humans have learnt about the world we live in, and how smart we can be as a species, and it's really mindblowing. Even though it dwarfs in comparison with what we don't yet know and what we are yet to find out, it's still amazing what we humans have been able to figure out about the world around us. 'So the next time you find yourself on a stroll through a park, take a second to ask yourself: What does the dandelion on the lawn see? What does the grass smell? Touch the leaves of an oak, knowing that the tree will remember it was touched. '"
3,0374288739,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2161504-karen-p,3,"I alotted time before spring for this piquing book about how plants, lacking a brain/central nervous system, can sense and process information. My reading just happened to coincide with the special arrival of my niece's baby girl. Maleigha, now 16 days old, was born without a brain (anencephaly), but has a portion of brain stem, which allows her to breathe and have a heartbeat. She is blind and deaf, and will never be able to walk or talk. (Actually I know very little about the condition of anencephaly, and was surprised to learn that Maleigha can flail her arms.) In describing both her function and her care, I compared Maleigha to a plant: She is sessile, can't communicate, needs 'watering', and protection. As I began the reading of this book, I was continuously drawing parallels between the limitations plants have, and the circumstances of Maleigha. More intriguing to me was the wonders of what plants CAN do, and the question in my mind of whether an anencephalic human could have the same potential. Chamovitz explains to readers that plants may not see, but they are aware of their visual environment. They know when you are near. They know if you are wearing a blue or a red shirt. They know if you have painted your house. Could Maleigha know these things? Maleigha has a nose, but no brain to receive olfactory sensory input. Well, plants can detect aromas and pheromones, and respond to these particles without a brain to process that input. Plants know when they are being touched, and can distinguish between different touches. Plants have proprioceptive awareness; that is to say they know where they are in space, which way is up or down, and where their appendages are. Plants have no 'memory' yet they can remember past infections, or pests, or environments, and respond based on their 'memories'. Plants may not be defined as intelligent, but they are ""acutely aware of the world around them."" These ponderings have been intriguing for me. Babies born with anencephaly have short life spans; 55% are still-born. Most die within a few hours or days. In the longest living case of anencephaly, the child survived for three years. Maleigha may not have a long time here with us, but because of this book I am hopeful that she may be aware she is here, and aware that her family is caring for her. "
4,0374288739,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15727591-cate-kate-caruso,3,"A light and moderately enjoyable read, and even though it delves into a fair amount of science ranging from biology, to biochemistry and beyond, it still comes up a little thin. I found myself wanting more. I'm realizing that ""more"" would have been a greater emphasis on how the research on plant senses: smell, touch, hearing, seeing, etc, relates to the everyday care-taking of plants. In short, a more horticultural bent would have been more interesting to me. Michael Pollan's The Biology of Desire comes to mind - a much more worthwhile read than this, in my view.To sum up, Chamovitz lays out the various human concepts of the senses and draws the plant analogies. He outlines the facts of our evolutionary connection, but fails to take the opportunity to stop in a moment of awe at our primal connection. At the end, he concludes with questions of plant intelligence and self-awareness. Interesting questions, mostly debunked (although the self-awareness question lingers)....and ends with the observation that though the old oak tree might not remember you ""You, on the other hand, can remember this particular tree and carry the memory of it with you forever"". Personally, I prefer Robert Frost or Mary Oliver's perspective on trees. Or, Martha Nussbaum, ""Be more more like a plant than like a jewel, something rather fragile, but whose very particular beauty is inseparable from that fragility""...and in so doing, we become better human beings. Now that, to me, is interesting...."
5,0374288739,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23428788-john-kaufmann,4,"A fascinating little book. Describes how plants sense things - how they detect and respond to light, touch, smell, sound, and how a plant remembers - with the experiments that led to these conclusions. It describes Darwin's experiment that determined that it is the tip of plants that sense the presence of light. It describes the experiments that determined how ethylene induces ripening, and how the trait evolved as a response to environmental stresses such as drought and as a mechanism to ensure uniform ripening (in order to attract animals that would eat and spread the plants seed). It discusses how plants emit defense hormones (such as salicylic acid) when wounded or infected to activate immune reactions elsewhere in the plant. It describes experiments that discovered how plants feel touch and how they respond. It describes how some plants even ""remember"", that allows them to differentiate spring from fall (when temperatures, length of day, rainfall may be similar) based on what preceded it; this is crucial in telling a plant when to sprout, flower, produce, etc.The author also looks at hearing and evaluates the popular claim, based on experiments, that plants grow better with classical music than with rock. As it turns out, plants can't hear. You'll have to read the book to find out how the initial claim was made and how it was subsequently disproved."

My only complaint is that I found it to be a little sparse on actual scientific explanation, but I do have a degree in horticulture science. Still, I think this book should be required reading - so few seem to realize that plants are complex organisms that must engage in the types of warfare typically found only in science fiction. "

10,0374288739,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30541335-jimmy-ele,4,"Interesting book that outlines briefly the scientific information we have concerning what a plant ""feels, sees, hears, thinks, and smells"". Those terms are in quotations for a reason. We can only perceive these aspects of a plant's sensory perceptions through our own limited human sensory perceptions. My favorite part of the book was the chapter on what a plant feels (in particular how they feel gravity and their internal circumnutational dance). The book was worth it for the chapters on light and gravity and how plants respond to these universal realities."
11,0374288739,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58375962-david-raz,4,"This is an excellent popular science book. I have no formal biology education, though I am a scientist of sorts, or at least that is what my Ph.D. claims. When I browsed through the list of contents, I got worried. ""What a plant sees"", ""what a plant feels"", ""what a plant remembers"". I do not care for anthropomorphizing, and I was worried this book is one of those insubstantial books about how plants are similar to us so we should care about them. But no worries, this book is the exact opposite.The author is very careful not to make claims he cannot scientifically substantiate. Each chapter begins with a short review of how humans (and animals) see, smell, feel etc. Only then does he explain in what way plants are similar, in what way they are different, and most importantly, how we learnt, in the most scientifically rigorous way, that this is the case. The explanations are clear even for someone as myself, which has no biological knowledge at all.I also like how, even when it is obvious the author does not think very positively about the scientific worth of something (like Dorothy L. Retallack's The Sound of Music and Plants) he is very careful not to ridicule them, and let you be the judge. The size of the book, 150 pages, was very appropriate, enough for a concise and interesting review, several hours of enjoyable reading, yet not too much to get you tired.This is exactly what I expect of popular science – I learned my fill about how plants see, smell, feel and so on, and it was all proper science, yet not too complicating to tire me. Four stars out of five.אני אתחיל מהסוף – זה ספר מדע פופולרי מצוין. אין לי חינוך ביולוגי רשמי, אם כי אני מדען מסוג כלשהו, או לפחות זה מה שהדוקטורט שלי טוען. כשהצצתי בתוכן העניינים די חששתי – ""מה רואים הצמחים"", ""מה מרגישים הצמחים"" וכן הלאה. אני לא אוהב במיוחד אנתרופומורפיזציה והייתי מודאג שהספר הזה הוא אחד מאותם ספרים חסרי משקל איך שהצמחים דומים לנו ואנחנו צריכים לדאוג להם. אבל אל דאגה, הספר הזה הוא ההפך הגמור.המחבר נזהר מאוד שלא לטעון שום טענה שהוא לא יכול להוכיח מדעית. כל פרק מתחיל בסקירה קצרה על איך בני אדם (ובעלי חיים) רואים, מריחים, מרגישים וכו' ורק אח""כ עובר המחבר להסביר איך הצמחים דומים, במה הם שונים, והכי חשוב, איך אנחנו יודעים זאת. את זה הוא מסביר בצורה המדוקדקת ביותר מבחינה מדעית אבל גם בהסברים ברורים אפילו למישהו כמוני, שאין לו ידע ביולוגי כלל.אהבתי גם את הדרך שבה גם כאשר ברור המחבר לא חושב באופן חיובי במיוחד על הערך המדעי של משהו (כמו העבודה של דורותי רטלק) הוא נזהר מאוד מללעוג להם ונותן לקורא להיות השופט. גם האורך של הספר, כ-150 עמודים, היה נכון מאוד עבורי, מספיק בשביל לתת סקירה ממצה ומעניינת, מספר שעות של קריאה מהנה, אבל לא יותר מדי בשביל לא לעייף.זה בדיוק מה שאני מצפה מדע פופולרי - למדתי כל מה שרציתי על מה ואיך צמחים רואים, מריחים וכן הלאה והכל במדע רציני וטוב אבל לא מסובך או מעייף. ארבעה כוכבים מתוך חמישה."

14,0374288739,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3850379-vasha7,2,"What a Plant Knows is a very brief survey of research into plant senses and awareness: a bare 120 pages divided into sections on sight, hearing, smell, touch, proprioception, and memory. A fascinating subject, to be sure, but too shallowly and sketchily treated. The author writes at an extremely introductory level, thinking it necessary to explain things like what a cell wall is*; all these explanations, along with abundant comparisons between humans and plants, plus the chatty style of the writing, scarcely leave room for the real meat of the subject. The important experiments, and what they reveal about plant abilities, are described in oversimplified, incomplete form. At the end of the section on gravity sensing, which has been all about the role of statoliths (tiny stones in cells), the author notes, ""The overall mechanism of sensing gravity is more complex than simply statoliths falling within the cell"" -- and that's it. So this book is better suited to amuse and intrigue the reader than to truly inform. For that reason, the epilogue, a general consideration of the meaning of plant awareness, may be the best part. It reflects on both the commonalities and the profound differences between how we and the plants experience the world, and urges us to think about the lives they're leading when we see them.* The author doesn't really have a gift for simple explanations, either. Consider this misleading account of osmosis (a term he doesn't use): ""The high concentration of potassium inside the cell relative to the outside causes water to enter the cell in a futile attempt to dilute the potassium."" At another place he describes the genetic code, mutations, and such basic concepts, but then goes on to talk about stem cells without saying what they are. "
15,0374288739,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15704502-colleen,4,"Reviews by others range from 2 to 4. I give 4 Stars because book conveyed information in exactly the way the author intended. The readers giving 2 stars had Bachelor Degrees in Science and thus they thought the book was a bit light in conveying the science behind ""What a Plant Knows."" But if that science had been included the book would have been too long and too difficult for me. I just wanted to enjoy being amazed at what scientists have discovered and agree upon. I was motivated to read the book from beginning to end, information was conveyed as a story (more or less), it enhanced my understanding of how plants sense the environment, made me question and rethink how I interact with plants, and it expanded my knowledge on what constitutes ""plant intelligence."" As one author expressed, this book could be read to children of a certain age or ability to pique their interest in science. As a teacher I would have to qualify that recommendation as probably only highly curious and scientifically oriented children would find this book interesting or understandable; but, if the children love science and particularly plants, then reading and discussing the concepts with them would be a wonderful and stimulating parent-child activity. For adults, I think this book is a wonderful quick read that provides an update on where science is in regards to understanding plant senses. The books uses metaphors frequently to draw parallels between human and plant senses, which made the book more fun and understandable for those of us with limited science background."

Debunks some of the ideas expressed in The Secret Life of Plants, at least as they were popularized in the media, and yet in the end saying plants are aware. Disappointingly short, only 141 pages plus 30 pages of notes, index, and acknowledgements. Highly recommended for people who love to read science. Good discussion of epinegenetics, also. Saw it reviewed in Science News, asked the library to order, and will be getting it back so the 10 other people in line can read it.*** I'm updating this review to reflect the fact that it was so good I bought the book. I should also have said that the reason it's disappointing that it's short is that scientists who write well are even more rare than writers who write well about science...but if they're writing, they're not doing the science...but if they're not explaining the science...anyway.

It is pretty much a prime example of how dull plain biology can be without an evolutionary sense. which is how I studied plants before, thus, never really caring about them. the book is written awfully well. it is so elegant and sensible. and as much as I feared the it would take a chance on trying to anthropomorphize plants, it didn't. and it also summed the matter well in its last chapter. which was such a perfect finish for it.

21,0374288739,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1971718-b-rule,4,"Chamovitz brings great enthusiasm to this short survey of plant sensoria, which makes it an enjoyable and quick read. While he delves into a little technical science, mostly the book hits highlights and moves on. The framing about whether plants technically meet the definition of possessing various human senses is a little tedious, but Chamovitz's head and heart are in the right place. He tacks a reasonable line between anthropomorphism and pedantry, recognizing similarities but acknowledging the very real differences resulting from ancient branches in the evolutionary tree. This book will either pique your interest to go learn more about plant biology, or you'll find that even this brief guide was more than enough, thanks. I leaned more toward the former and would have gladly absorbed more detail, but I think Chamovitz made the right call for showbiz and pop-sci books: always leave them wanting more."

To me, this is popular science done right: easy to understand, but not superficial, frequently brings it back to the big picture, but also includes a lot of details, and good descriptions of the experiments performed to generate the information.

Very interesting to understand how plants adapt and respond to their environment. As the author points out, humans tend to interpret things using human characteristics.

It has just enough experimental data and simplified scientific explanations to expand on each chapter's topic without burying the clueless in a flood of complicated definitions. And the language is clean, so anyone of any age can read it. Many thanks to all the scientists who fact-checked Chamovitz and his editor, Amanda Moon. Amazing job!I can't compare this edition to the original, so I don't know how much of this would be repeated information. And I already knew some of the information presented in the book before reading it. Even so, I found it enthralling to take a peek into what is known by scientists in 2016. This is not an assertive ""I can feel the colors, brother"" sort of book; it's curiosity for the plants around us and attempts to answering our itching questions with current scientific methods. Like can a plant understand gravity and how would it react in space? Do plants hear and can they speak? Questions that scientists aren't completely agreed upon yet, but the search is an exciting chain of possibilities. What is known is awesome. An editor of an educational TV program would cut and omit information not quite related to the named topic. On the other hand, Chamovitz has sporadic footnotes throughout his book for a lovely laugh or reference, such as the quirky naming of cryptochromes and his quibbling over definitions to distinguish what scientists of a particular study would normally know. He also includes YouTube and website links related to a particular experiment. This is where I think an ebook version would benefit if it existed, since the links are often lengthy. They are not particularly necessary to watch while reading (Chamovitz is thorough enough for me), but do try to watch them if you have the online access and the patience to type them out. For instance, here's a time lapse of a dodder plant reaching for a tomato.170 pages of fascinating information in which I ended up loving to learn. Another pleasant reminder that our world as it is now is weirdly beautiful, interesting, and strange in the eyes of science.

Corrected many misconceptions around plants being able to ""know"" in the traditional sense, and gave strong experimental evidence for how plant ""memory"" and other functions that seem mystifying actually work.

28,0374288739,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1725717-maria,4,"This is a short, whimsical book about the life of plants. How does a plant perceive the world? There are three levels of consciousness in humans--anoetic, noetic, and autonoetic--associated with the three levels of memory formation processes--procedural, semantic, and episodic, respectively. In this book, Daniel Chamovitz outlines the perceptions of a plant, one sense at a time, in order to give the reader a sense (convenient pun) for what plants know versus what characteristics we attribute to them in order to relate with them.Since plants do not have a nervous system, they cannot feel things in the way that we do. However, there is plenty of scientific evidence to suggest that plants possess procedural memory which means they have a purely anoetic view of the world. Chamovitz likens this to Freud's id, or what we call our animal instinct. I'm not sure that I see the comparison, since an id needs a brain to exist, but what I do see from this book is that plants are entities able to perform a set of complex chemical processes and are able to sense their environment through touch, sight, and smell/taste (not necessarily sound!). They can respond to and store external information, and interestingly, the genes that determine these characteristics are genes we have in common--evolution is such a wonderful, awe inspiring thing! Three fun facts I learned from this book:-Darwin played the bassoon and he attempted to woo his plants with it and see if he could get them to grow faster, but it turned out to be one of his failed experiments. -Menstrual cycle synchronization in close proximity occurs due to perspiration odor cues (sort of like telepathic communication if you think about it!)-The buzz of a bee is a result of the vibration of its wings (not the same as flapping) and only through touch can this vibration signal a plant to release its pollen (not through sound).-Bonus: we do have a sixth sense!!! and it's called proprioception; it's our sense of balance and sense of what is up and what is down. Overall I liked this little book. It's interesting and gets you thinking about what it means to be intelligent life. I will always look at old trees as wise and comforting, and I will always weep for trees that are cut down because they are a part of me, just as all life on earth is a part of me. This little book helps me understand this part of me better. **Special note: This book is my first intentional read in a long time, meaning I read it slowly, attentively, and with a pen and notebook at my side. I'm trying a new approach where I try to learn at least three new things from each book that comes into my hands, whether it be a fun fact, a new way to see the world, or a witty expression I can use in conversation to appear more intelligent (attributed of course!). I'm also trying to read more regularly as a recent listen to the first chapter of Al Gore's Assault on Reason has reminded me of the importance of reading a mother effing book to stave off ignorance, and a recent conversation with a Muslim Burmese refugee has made me more aware of the extent of my ignorance of the world beyond my own boundaries and my general cultural illiteracy."

This fascinating little book explores the inner life of plants and how they address the Darwinian forces that surround them. The sun provides life giving light for the plant and the plant itself must find ways of capturing that light for use; it grows toward the light, it manufacturers food from light through photosynthesis, add to that the changing of the seasons and the cycle of night and day and the picture fills out. But does the plant actually ""see"" the light? Does it ""feel"" the touch of an insect on its leaves? Does it ""smell"" any of the aromas that surround it? These issues and many others are addressed by Chamovitz in a way that's accessible to the general reader. I found the writing interesting, charming and at times a little technical but not so technical that it becomes a problem for the reader. The author also delves into the history of botany and our changing view of the plant life all around us. If you've ever wondered how a plant ""knows"" the difference between up and down, when its time to flower or to shed its leaves then you might enjoy this book as much as I did. Give it a try!LastRanger"
31,0374288739,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20734270-michelle,2,"Chamovitz's charming book was just that: charming. I kept running into issues with his topic, which at times bordered on the fantastical instead of the scientific. He sites numerous experiments and published studies about plant behavior, but many of them have been debunked or inconclusive. I don't mean to say you can't have a book that sites experiments that didn't work out, but when the topic is about defending plant behavior and you point to a bunch of studies which were never conclusive, it gets a little frustrating to keep going. He points out at the beginning of the book that he does not want to anthropomorphize plants (he specifically points to Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird's highly criticized The Secret Life of Plants, which did just what Chamovitz aims not to do. But I often found myself feeling that's exactly what he was doing. I guess part of me was hoping for a book along the lines of Mary Roach's Bonk! (or one of her other many investigative works), but Chamovitz's writing and topic fell short. It took me a long time to read this rather short piece and, in the end, I simply learned a handful of interesting facts about plant physiology, nothing more."

By revisiting what our senses actually are, versus what we tend to glorify them as, this book argues that plants qualify as being capable of seeing, smelling, etc. Basically, the ability to sense, and react, to different wavelengths qualifies as seeing. An organ dedicated to complex sensing is not necessary. This is how each sense plays out. My favorite, though, is the remembering. Quite a unique thought.In the end, the author touches on the need to temper our anthropomorphism. Many have gone down the path of trying to recognize the ""dignity"" of plants, and this only brings ridicule. ""A plant's awareness also does not imply that a plant can suffer. A seeing, smelling, feeling plant can no more suffer pain than can a computer with a faulty hard drive."" I see this book more about shedding light on the wonderful variations of evolutionary adaptation then with the specifics of the plants themselves. Good book, well-written, nothing Earth-shattering, wasn't on the edge of my seat, hence three stars."

The title can easily be misinterpreted as a kind of New Age speculation about plants senses, which it isn't. The author shows both the similarities and differences between human- and plant senses of the world and the result is quite astonishing! Can plants see, feel, remember and smell? If so, how is this possible, and what kind of 'world' do they perceive? These questions are not new. Charles Darwin and his son were two prominent scientists in the nineteenth century asking these same questions and they became pioneers in this kind of plant phenomenology studies.I can highly recommend this brilliant scientific field guide to the plant senses."

Chamovitz is at pains to distinguish legitimate scientific investigations into plant awareness from typical New Age mumbo-jumbo like The Secret Life of Plants,, which unfortunately soured the legitimacy of seriously studying plant sensation. Chamovitz's book provides a lucid introduction to classic and modern experimentation on plant's sensory abilities going back to Darwin's own investigations and plant's sensitivities to light. Although Chamovitz sometimes plays fast and loose with metaphor and skirts over some delicate issues regarding the definition of awareness and subjectivity, by and large he makes a convincing case that if we set aside our own biased expectations for what cognition ""in the wild"" looks like, we can begin to see continuities between the alien complexities of plant cognition and our own."

But this books is a page turner. Being a vegetarian, I was a bit nervous starting it. The book promised to explain how plants are aware of their environment. So, my reflex was to tag a carrot with feelings and imagine it suffer, while being eaten raw.Thank heavens, I was wrong. The book didn't make me say no to the last bits of real food. Instead, it made me aware of the world of these green things that keep on wilting in my pots. The real eye opener was the fact that the more you pet a plant, the faster it dies, which means that while I was trying to establish a friendly contact with my green friends, they were seeing me as a pure intruder and an undesirable. I guess it was Thich Nhat Hanh who said: To love without knowing how to love wounds the person plant we love."

It details similarities (more than I realized existed) between plants and humans without falling into the trap of anthropomorphizing plants. The author uses the human senses as an analog to explain plant responses to environmental stimuli. I feel that these connections are useful in that they help us to understand plants better and to understand ourselves better. The current research on epigenetics is what fascinates me most. The idea that an environmental stress causes a heritable change that is passed on to successive generations has vast implications."

Unlike some books that suggest that plants can talk to you, this book provides a great look at how plants adapt to their environments in ways not entirely dissimilar from the way that people sense their environment. The author is very clever in drawing analogies between sensory processes in people and those in plants. Naturally, plants aren't sentient in the same ways as people (except for some politicians), but the activity of plant cells is electrochemical, just as it is in humans. The author does a creditable job of describing the basics of human sensation, so I'm trusting that his depictions of plants (his specialty area) are on the money."

It turns out that our self-awareness isn’t as easy to explain as scientists used to think. In fact, there is an increasing amount of evidence that consciousness, like so many other “human traits”, has evolved over the years from other animals up to the current state of humans. But can this evolution also include plants?As a long time vegetarian I have always felt that humans were chauvinistic when it comes to what we consider “advanced traits” such as: thinking, feeling, and self-awareness. While I am not sure an ant, in going about its daily work, gives much thought to itself, it’s place in the universe, and its prodigy, I cannot look at a whale, a dolphin, a gorilla, or even a cow without considering the idea that it thinks, feels and has many other traits in common with myself.In What A Plant Knows: A Field Guide To The Senses, Daniel Chamovitz raises the question of how many senses plants have in common with humans and other animals. Before our family tree split off from one another eons ago, did plants and animals start out with similar senses? Camovitz makes the case that plants see, smell, feel, have sense of place, and remember. Not necessarily in the same way as human beings but not as different as most of us think.Chamovitz isn’t making the case for plant consciousness. He does, however, clearly lay out in his book that the overlap between humans and plants is much closer than we have been taught. In a remarkably small number of pages, he presents a series of questions, hundreds of years of scientific research, and remarkable conclusions.For those of you who shy away from scientific books and jargon, this is an amazingly easy to read book. While there is some heavy chemistry now and then plus some “fifty cent words” like thigmomorphogenesis, you can gloss over them and still get to the understand what Chamovitz is saying.This is not your father’s The Secret Life of Plants. Chamovitz’s book is based on a lot fo scientific experimentation. He is careful to avoid anthropomorphizing. He is not saying that plants and animals are the same, just that there are a lot more similarities than you might have been aware of before reading this book. While What A Plant Knows is not a “page turner” like many fiction books, it is also not a dull and repressive scientific tome. I enjoyed reading it and think that most other people will as well."

It’s a simple yet thought-provoking read on an organism that has long been studied and served different purposes for human--plants. We are surrounded but plant life, but often not many of us “stop to smell the roses” and carefully consider how plants work with a lack of intricate nervous and excretory, and sensory systems. However, we are naturally curious about nature and this book successfully answers many “mysteries” you might be wondering about!Learning about what a plant knows altered my perception and you will look at plants in a different way after reading this-- with curiosity and fascination. Plants are intelligent and curious organisms that can see, smell, feel, hear, know where it is, and remember and this perspective redefines the sensory system we are familiar with for humans. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and it is easy to follow for both readers looking looking for simple botanical perspective or people looking for a more scientific explanation of plant physiology. This book was like a guided tour of the plant sensory systems and about years of research that illuminated how plants are intelligent. Plants detect different colors to know when it’s day or night or time of year it is, they can smell when a neighboring plant is present, and they can feel when you touch them. Plants respond to what they sense in interesting ways and the mechanisms that have been discovered are clearly explained in the book with synopsis of experiments. The author does a great job paralleling human sensory system with that of plants to show how uniquely it works in plants. There are resources provided in the book that link to different videos and studies to illustrate points made in the chapter. If you’re curious about any plant behavior like how certain flowers bloom in the spring, how a venus flytrap closes on a fly, how plants communicate with each other, you will be satisfied with what answers this book offers!"
58,0374288739,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7321485-brandon,5,"Plant brains are not in one place like our own. Instead, What A Plant Knows is distributed throughout the plant, according to the current (2012) science as reported by author and PhD, Daniel Chamovitz. Plants have sensors at the cellular level and often in the same cell or nearby cells there are biological structures that respond to what is picked up by the sensors. He makes it quite clear that plants have sensors for sight, touch, smell, mechanisms for memory and other senses that are not all that different than ours. He does an outstanding job of describing what science does know about how plants interact with their environment. And how some speculations in the history of botany have sometimes been proven true later; while pointing out that the jury is still out on other speculations. In the process of discussing the sensory mechanisms of plants, he provides a very clear summery of what science currently knows about human sensory mechanisms.I highly recommend his common sense approach when he comes to places where the temptation to speculate is hard to resist -- is a plant intelligent? I'm perfectly happy to speculate that eventually plants, at least some of them, may end up becoming citizens of some future world. Chamovitz is very much Joe Friday, just the facts. But even so, the facts provide support for yet do nothing to destroy my speculation; a speculation, by the way, which is at least inspired by, if not directly from, Ursula K. Leguin's novel ""The word for world is forest."" I also found a youtube video of the author giving a 40 minute talk that covers a lot of what's in the book, https://youtu.be/Qv-iluydZOo . "

I approached this book with some trepidation not knowing if I'd enjoy the comparison between plant and human senses, but Daniel Chamovitz executed this concept really well. I definitely know more about plants and have a deeper understanding of and appreciation for their inner workings. Given my background, the content of this book may be a little easier for me to dive into than someone without this training, but I did find the explanations of the sensory systems to be accurate and quite clear.

A lot of interesting studies are used as examples to better understand the concepts, and I learned a lot. I think this book provides a broad overview of what life is like for a plant, while being quite careful not to anthropomorphize or make any bold claims about plant consciousness or emotion.

So the two wavelengths could be a switcher for a plant to choose when to bloom. It didn't explain why there is difference between the wavelength of dawn light and dusk light. A proper guess is that difference density of air caused it, since during the day the air above the earth is heated by the Sun."

This book was recommended by a witty phytologist, and it was the perfect entrée, building on my existing understanding of human physiology to examine how plants sense their world in order to survive. As a bonus, I discovered a MOOC by the author based on the book. FMI see my blog post at A Just Recompense."
69,0374288739,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36918446-holly-harding,4,"I was completely hooked from start to finish. Each chapter breaks down a different sense that a plant has, how it has it and why they have it. There's a chapter for seeing, one for hearing, smelling and so on. It's always nice to remember that everything is just made up of cells and pathways. That we aren't just in the world but actually a part of the world. Humans are getting more and more disconnected. It's probably best if plants just take over the world. Anyways. Cool book!"
70,0374288739,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4260115-dale-muckerman,4,"Fascinating book about the kind of awareness plants have. The book is more on the hard science end rather than the New Age mystical end, so if you are looking for another Secret Life of Plants this is not the book for you. The most interesting part of the book was near the end where it talks about plant memory and epigenetics. Another interesting thing I learned was how much research that Darwin did with plant behavior. If you want a better understanding of plants, read this book."
71,0374288739,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47112679-joseph-carrabis,5,"I enjoyed What a Plant Knows. It's probably PopSci and definitely one of the better ones. It amused me that Chamovitz worked hard to deanthropomorphize plants and, in the end, his book left me wondering how similar humans and plants are. I did like his constant refrain of ""this is what we know right now"" and his willingness to admit our best knowledge is our best knowledge for a little while, not forever. Recommended."
72,0374288739,http://goodreads.com/user/show/934662-wendy-feltham,3,"The title of this book seems wrong, and I wonder if the author himself might have preferred ""What a Plant Senses?"" Daniel Chamovitz is an expert on plant research and a very good writer. He often compares plant to human anatomy, to ease the understanding for his human readers. It's fun to learn how similar we are, and I will now consider plants in a new way. I was impressed with how frequently current research reflects Darwin's studies. "
73,0374288739,http://goodreads.com/user/show/219366-erica,0,"An interesting book, if sometimes bogged down in minutiae. Could have used a good editor.But on the whole, I think it's an important counterpoint to Pollan's edicts about plants manipulating humans, interacting with humans. Plants do interact with the world, of course. And this book reveals the many ways they do. I especially liked the segments reviewing Darwin's experiments with plants and how they have been explored and updated today."

Again, another attempt to anthropomorphize living creature. Plants to not sense the world as we do, they don't have memory as we do (despite what's in the book, which is common to most living creature and has nothing to do with memory). They cannot smell, they can just sense specific compuound, which is more similar to the concept of pheromone than small. And so on."

87,0374288739,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26034375-jonathan,3,"Interesting, compares with how we sense the world so delves into that a bit as well. I read ‘The secret life of plants’ when young, the pseudoscience book par excellence, which he adamantly states in the introduction is not this book. Plants aren’t ‘conscious,’ they don’t feel pain, but they do respond to their environment in relatively complex ways."
88,0374288739,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"Do plants have memory and consciousness?The author is a leading researcher in the field of plant sensory communications and he reviews the literature by asking hypothetical questions such as; does a plant has the ability to see, hear, feel, think and react to external stimuli like animals do. He has a unique way of expressing himself, and in the process tries to answer each question so that a reader can understand and appreciate the subject. He describes simple plant experiments that demonstrate how a plant responds to external stimuli. The author argues that even though the plants doesn't have a central nervous system (with a brain and a system of branching nerves and nerve endings), but certain experimental evidences lead to the conclusion that plants do have cell to cell communication and they do respond to internal and external stimuli like animals. This is also supported by genetics of plants and animals where many animal genes are found in plants. With his arguments and clever plant experiments described in this book, he convinces the reader that the traditional definition of memory and thinking has to be revaluated, since the ""neurobiological"" mechanisms at the molecular and cellular level are very similar in plants and animals. A recent study published in the journal Plant Cell, biologists found that one leaf of a plant named Arabidopsis thaliana exposed to light caused the whole plant to respond to the light; and this response lasted even after the light source was taken away. This shows that plants send electrochemical signals at cellular levels in leaves that were not exposed to light; and they were responding to the electrical signals. In a similar experiment with tomato leaves, it was found that wounded leaves leads to responses in the unwounded leaves on the same plant. These responses include the transcription of a class of genes for proteinase inhibitors in intact leaves. This was accomplished by the transmission of electrical signals with the coordinated functions of ion channels during the cell to cell communication.Most animals choose their environment to find food, mate, and migrate with changing seasons, but plants have to adapt to their environment and hence have evolved complex sensory and regulatory systems. A head lettuce has to know if there are ravenous aphids so that it can defend by secretions against the invading aphids. An Elm tree knows when and where to branch if its neighbor is shading it from sun; and a cherry tree knows when to flower.Plant can feel the touch and they also differentiate between hot and cold temperatures. Vines start rapid growth upon contact with an object like a fence and carnivorous parts snap/trap when an insect lands on its surface. The electrochemical signals generated in Venus flytrap are very similar to the action of a nerve during muscular contraction of an animal. The plant responses are not subjective, and they do not experience pain like animal do, but they feel mechanical stimulations.Plants do not have ears but apparently they hear music since certain types of music has positive influence in the growth of plants, but some biologists insist that it may be related to very small temperature differences or even being touched by the sound vibrations caused by the music, which imply mechanical response rather than music response.Experiments in space with arabidopsis plants have demonstrated that gravity is essential in amplifying the movement/growth in plants. Humans and plants respond to gravity in similar ways.Plants benefit from rich and varied sensory inputs, but plants do not have memories and they don't cower at the thought of drought or dream. They don't watch or remember the way plants grew under their shade or in their immediate neighborhood. They however retain past events and recall the information at a later period. Tobacco plants know the color of the last light they ""saw"" and Willow tree knows if their neighbors have been attacked by caterpillars. These examples illustrate a delayed response to a previous occurrence which is a key component to memory.The mechanism of memory is not completely understood. We know that electric signaling between neurons is important for memory formation and storage, but the molecular and cellular mechanism are sketchy. The latest research hints that our memory is infinite but only very small number of proteins is involved in memory process. There are several types of memory; sensory memory, short-term memory, long-term memory, muscle-motor memory, and immune memory. All these processes follow three simple mechanisms; encoding information, information storage and its retrieval. In Venus flytrap, the plant has a short-term memory in a mechanism by which it traps an insect lurking on the surface.There are three levels of memory associated with increasing levels of consciousness. Procedural memory is associated with anoetic consciousness; semantic memory is associated with noetic consciousness; and episodic memory associated with autonoetic consciousness. Plants appear to have the lowest level of consciousness, the anoetic consciousness that refers to the ability of the plant to sense and react to external and internal stimulation."
