0,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat,0,"I am fairly sure this was recommended on a management course. Entertaining read, well illustrated. Not sure how accurate it is, I tried out some of the ideas such as sitting side by side or at an angle to somebody rather than opposite across a desk at them. I certainly felt better for doing so but then the book told me that I would!The downside for me is that I started to become absurdly self-conscious. Was I standing in an optimum way, sending out the best messages? Were my feet pointing in the right directions? If somebody's body language is negative should I try to counter it by offering them something to hold? Does any of this stuff really work or is it just silliness? Is the conscious embrace of silliness the most sensible approach to interaction with fellow humans?The serious downside is that there is a lot of assertions made in the book with very little evidence and what evidence there is tends to fall back on one study or one anecdotal example which leaves one wondering quite how generally applicable the guidance is, particularly outside of the UK. On the other hand having been the retreating party when talking with somebody whose notions of allowable personal space where much smaller than mine(view spoiler)[ from a distance and at the incorrect angle it must have looked as though we were dancing the quickstep  (hide spoiler)], I wish that this book was read more widely - I eventually ended up backed up against a wall trapped by a water cooler feeling distinctly unamused."

You will be able to tell if someone is genuinely agreed with you or simply is faking so.2. It would be easier for you to see if someone is lying or hiding something.3. When to tell if your message being conveyed and that your subjects are open and receptive to your arguments. 4. How to use body language to power up your position, radiate a dominant outlook and literally be more effective.5. You can tell if someone is interested in you or others.6. In the book, there are lots of mistakes pointed out to be avoided in business situations and especially has a lot of advice for women to obtain a more firm stance in their meetings.And much more interesting topics ...I highly recommend this book to anyone who seeks communication skills and wants to appear more competent in his/her social or business interactions as well as to those whom with high ambitions of having an upper hand in their day-to-day meetings with others.If you desire to consume more advanced topics in this subject, I'd also recommend:• Emotions revealed• Unmasking the face• Telling liesAll by the psychology guru and deception expert: Paul Ekman"
2,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3638053-maureen-forys,1,"Aside from there being misinformation scattered about, (Napoleon wasn't 5'4"", George W Bush didn't get his first passport when he became president) the authors completely rely on logical fallacies to prove their points. They make huge sweeping generalizations (they said Britain, Germany, etc. have been world powers is because their populations often mirror body language...... What??? And also that heavy smokers haven't been breast-fed whereas non smokers have been) and completely lost their credibility. Then the gender differences they pointed out always seemed to paint women in an unforgiving light, to say the least. You can get all the basic information via Google and spare yourself the sensationalized sweeping generalizations. "
3,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2416724-raluca,3,"3.5/5.This book was very difficult to rate. On one hand, it's a pretty comprehensive guide of human gestures and postures, aided in their understanding by suggestive illustrations. On the other hand, I kept getting the feeling that the authors were trying really, really hard to sell me a commercial version of body language. Often, things were exaggeratedly emphasized in a clickbaity way and I would not have been surprised to see chapter titles such as: ""You will not believe how your boss is dominating you!"" or ""Seven ultra-secret signals she's into you!"".Searching for information about the authors, I see that neither of them is a psychologist or scientist of any kind. They're just really, really good salespeople who've found their niche. That makes me a bit skeptical about the validity of the interpretations they offer.There are other clues that make me doubt the content. One is the studies cited at the end. The book often contained phrases such as ""studies show"" or ""research says"". However, if I wanted to read about the study mentioned in chapter X, point Y, and flipped the pages to the end of the book, surprise! Instead of showing the research in the order it is cited, it is shown alphabetically. That means that I have to wade through a few hundred cited sources to see which applies and I am pretty sure this was done on purpose. The other objection I have with the studies is that most of them are from the 70s. (The newest ones are from 2003.) That leads me to believe that a) a lot of this research has been debunked/updated/couldn't be replicated and that b) the authors purposefully selected only those sources that had a vague resemblance to the point they were trying to make and stretched the interpretation in a sensationalist manner.A few other things bothered me. One was the ""old gramps who's trying to be hip"" cringe humor. The second was the outdated examples and references - it really shows that the book hasn't been edited for a newer audience, but is still stuck somewhere in the 80s-90s (in mentality too). Then there were the problems I had encountered in the previous body language book I had read, although to a lesser extent here.First, the book had a really strong emphasis on man vs man or man vs woman relationships.Second, there were very few references to woman vs woman relationships. (In fact, the authors presented a very petty/catty attitude between women as the only plausible one. What about female friends? Is the notion that alien?)Third, all the interactions between men and women were interpreted in a sexual manner. (What about the young man arguing with the old woman in the bus over the position of the window? I bet the authors would say that the opening and closing of the window is a suggestive sexual allusion or whatever.) More so, women were seen as always submissive in their gestures in a man's presence. (I'm not going to go into that.)Fourth, men were also presented as some sort of primitive grunting beasts ready to jump at each other's throats... OK, I am exaggerating, but the authors did seem to see them as very simplistic beings incapable of any kind of complex thoughts. (I find this particularly insulting.)Again, I think that most of the things mentioned in the paragraph above have a very high commercial value and while they might carry some form of truth (yes, there are differences between the two sexes), they have been exaggerated for the public, because this is what sells and this is what the public wants to hear/read.All in all, this was another book I used as research for the series I am writing. The best thing about it is that a) it's comprehensive (there are even chapters about mirroring another person's body language or height differences or seating positions) and b) it has useful illustrations. I recommend it to other (aspiring) writers, just be careful to take it with a grain of salt.(As a bonus, checking this book, I realize that my characters' body language has been pretty well-written, just too detailed and hard to follow at points.)"
4,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2898778-ellen-maze,4,"As an author, I am naturally a student of observation, so this book had the potential to be of great service to me not only in my writing, but in character-building and expression. I enjoyed the read. Unlike some other Body Language books, this one has a lot of photographs, and at the risk of sounding sophomoric, they really added to my understanding of the text. The chapters/categories made a lot of sense, and the information moved along with little unnecessary repetition. I think everyone who reads this book will have their eyes opened, and begin to read body language everywhere they go. The only thing that bugged me was that the authors used evolution to explain much of the human's use of body language. I didn't find their theories believable, and evolution explanations really weren't necessary. I would expect some reference to the ape-man, Neanderthal, etc, but these authors referred to them with a fervor akin to proselytizing. This shortcoming is the only thing that held me back from leaving 5-stars. Skimming those sections was easy, and the book is well worth the read and the purchase price.

5,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8107877-gabriela,5,"Allan Pease and Barbara Pease apply their experience in medicine, biology and psychology to illustrate the workings of the brain and how this influences our body language. In the Definite Book Of Body Language, the authors show us how we can use our knowledge of the brain's functions to understand people's emotions and behaviors.I have to say that neuropsychology and behavioral science have always fascinated me. There are many books out there about these topics. But I found this one particularly interesting as it covered real life examples which you could see yourself applying or identify body language behavior and what the other person in communicating. The authors have used real life examples and offer various exercises that you can undertake to practice reading people's emotions and behaviors.I would recommend this one to everyone really. Whether you are interviewer, a manager, a teacher, businessperson, someone looking for a job, or for a partner, this book can help you understand other people's behavior and perhaps overcome communicational barriers. It does serve as a great premier especially if you are not entirely familiar with the psychology of body language. "
6,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36489698-r-nair,3,"I am not saying that if the authors claim ""water is wet"", you need to ask for a second opinion. Ok I lied, you need to ask for a second opinion. There are parts that are genuinely riddled with sweeping statements and superfluous information, but to be fair, there are also parts that actually are interesting and are based on psychological studies done on human behaviour and the resulting body language. The problem lies in separating the proverbial wheat from the chaff. Since some claims are questionable, all claims are questionable and it doesn't hurt to educate yourself on claims that seem too neatly packaged to be true. Winnowing and Google go hand in hand.So, in summary -- Interesting read if you suspend scientific rigour and logical disbelief at certain points. - Good book to skim through to get a better grasp on reading your audience or improving your body language but not one to be taken word for word and read through with firm conviction in all the claims made.- Get a second hand copy for yourself and speed-read the book in a day or two."
7,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/576391-mary,3,"I rarely read every word of non-fiction books, but this is one of the rare exceptions. It's not even particularly fascinating. But it is interesting enough to hold my attention without skipping or skimming over anything. ALMOST four stars. It wasn't awesome enough to go out and purchase, but it would be great to have around all the time for reference when the fancy strikes. I doubt I'll remember this stuff on my own as well as I'd like to.I'm sure that for a few days at least, I'll be watching everyone around me to try to guess their secret thoughts like a mind-reader, ha ha! Next step, rule the world!Note: It appears from the descriptions in the book that I display some body language characterized by male dominance (for those who don't know me, I am a smallish female). Has anyone I know noticed this about me? I personally had never noticed. Does it unnerve you as the book says it would? I wonder if they are learned behaviors that I picked up because most of my friends have been male through my adolescence and young adulthood. I did not view myself as a dating option for them, but a social equal. Or am I simply more a more aggressive than average woman? Hmmm...makes me want to observe myself better."

Examples are: turn your palms up to put someone at ease - I tried using this during my PT retail job and got wierd looks. Another example that truly disagree with is - if someone keeps you waiting - pull out some financial papers adn a calculator adn do calculations. When they call for you say say ""I'll be ready in a moment - I'll just finish these calculations"" - what???? or the other example for this is to take out your cell, loudly mention large amounts of money, drop iin a well-known name or two - yeah, I'd never do that.

It is a fantastic insight into understanding the people around you.I highly recommend this book to martial artists and students of self defense classes, because Allan discusses topics your instructors allude to, but quickly pass over, because they don't have the time to cover this subject in depth. Realistically, anyone who has to deal with people should read this book. From a self defense point of view, it's easier to avoid trouble if you can read the people around you (but it does take practice).I purchased this revised edition a few years ago because it contained a lot of additional information. While it would be impossible to remember everything discussed by the author, it is definitely worth your while to absorb as much of the information as you are able."

So, let me start off by saying that I very much recommend people read books about body language. And then let me follow that up by saying this is not the book I would recommend reading. But, I do think this book was really helpful and it was eye-opening and for the most part it was really interesting. I'm glad I read it and I learned a lot from it and I will most likely be re-reading it and studying it from time to time to learn more. Along with all that good information, there was enough stuff in this book that was awkward, inappropriate, or wrong (nearly every page talked about evolution and I don't agree with that) that I wouldn't even be okay having the book sit somewhere where people could pick it up and read it. I bought white-out for me to fix a few of the issues (like illustrations that really aren't okay), so that was helpful. So, this book was helpful, and the information for the most part was stuff that I think was important to know (even when it was awko-taco) - I just wouldn't be okay handing the book to most people and recommending it. But body language as a whole? Yes, very important."

Not only about making impressions of yourself on other, a lot more crucial takeaway here is about how you can create better turnouts for common goals. Did that meeting go bad because you disagree so much or because you had unknowingly assumed a competing body/sitting arrangement? Before telling my business partner about this example after having a few too intense meetings, I just switched up the seating arrangement & worked like a charm - we found common ground on all our disagreements, and we’ll both appreciate body language more after this."

20,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2170861-carrie-wilson,4,"This book is a well-researched summary of proxemics, gender and cultural differences in non-verbal communication, facial expressions and much more! A few tidbits you'll learn from this book: female brains are designed for multi-tasking (which is explains why we can watch TV, read a book, and chat online while drinking coffee); smiling is seen as a subordinate action and women tend to smile much more than men, something likely hard-wired into our brains; organs that are transplanted retain cellular memory so that recipients assume the mannerisms and gestures of their donor (!); in courtship, women are the initiators a whopping 90 percent of the time.There is much more to this book--these examples are teasers. The only downside to the book (and it is quite a small one) is that the authors list their references in the back in alphabetical order-- I prefer endnotes or footnotes or MLA style citation because I usually like to see the original sources for studies when I read non-fiction. Since this book is written for a general audience, I doubt many people are put off by their referencing style. I also didn't care for the line drawings--again that is such a nit-picky criticism, but really! They could have done a better job with the illustrations. . . I recommend this book to anyone human interested in fellow humans.  "

At first, I had stopped reading it after about 3/4 of it and now, because of the long break, I've started from the beginning. It's a really entertaining book, though, written with a great sense of humour. About methods that the authors present in it... People say that there are some mistakes, but I think that most of it is quite right and useful. Still, I'm not an expert. And the methods at the end, about job interviews, don't sound reliable. See for yourselves ;).To już w zasadzie drugi raz, kiedy się za nią zabrałam. Za pierwszym przerwałam w 3/4 i teraz, z racji ogromnej przerwy, zaczęłam od początku. Ta książka jest jednak niesamowicie rozrywkowa, napisana ze świetnym poczuciem humoru. Co do zawartych w niej teorii... Słyszałam, że są jakieś błędy, ale według mnie bardzo duża część jest po prostu trafna i przydatna. No, ale ekspertem nie jestem.

22,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5218519-cynthia,5,"I found this to be a very interesting and informative book. It's fascinating, and disconcerting, to read how many things we do unconsciously that are so denotative about our motives and thoughts. Moreover, another intriguing concept is the fact that another person's actions, gestures or body language can engender a sense of benevolence, aversion or even hostility in us towards that individual, without us being able to comprehend why we feel that way.The book is full of examples from real-life personages, some of which are highly entertaining and amusing.It certainly teaches you a lot about hiding insecurities and looking more confident.

35,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91977885-michael,4,"Body language is an outward reflection of a person's emotional condition. It's about matching what you see and hear in the environment in which it all happens and drawing a probable conclusion. However, most people only see the things they think they are seeing. Early research on communication shows that the total impact of a message is about 7% for spoken words and 38% for vocal, i.e., the voice's tone and 55% for non-verbal. This means that words are used primarily for conveying information and data. For example, a study done between 1970-80 revealed that a person with a strong argument usually wins in a phone conversation. However, in the round table encounter 60 to 80 percent accounts for body language, and usually, the people make initial impressions within 4 minutes of the conversation.According to the book, some people, especially women's, are more perceptive than men - 'women's intuition.' Being perceptive means able to spot the contradictions between someone's words and body language. When we say we have a hunch or gut feeling, we usually mean that their words and body language do not much. And overall, women are good at picking them. In addition, it is usually easy to read children than adults. This could be that adults have less muscle tone in the face. An interesting fact about body language is that it is easy to misread it, yet it is hard to fake it.While talking about body language, it's important to note that it can be different across different cultures, though some body languages like nodding the head, shoulder shrug, smiling are inborn and are usually the same across cultures. For accurately reading body language, the book presents 3 rules.	1. The reading of gestures should be in clusters. This is to mean that an individual gesture might not give or mislead. Gestures are words, and clusters are sentences in body language. To read them correctly, it needs at least three testers in a match. 	2. Look for congruence between gesture clusters and verbal language. If the gestures and the verbal language do not much, women tend to take the gestures. 	3. Gestures should be read in the context. For example, a person sitting in a cold bus waiting with hands crossed (defensive) and chin down (critical/hostile) should not be interpreted negatively.The HandsPalms of a hand are vocal cords of body language because they did more talking than any other body parts. Three are 3 main palm command testers	▪ Palm Up : is a used as a submissive non-threatening gesture.	▪ Palm Down : shows immediate authority.	▪ Palm Closed : shows the speaker figuratively beats his listeners to submission.Fingers also play a role, where a pointing finger gives negative feelings. Also, squeezing your finger into your thumb to make an OK gesture while giving public speech is considered authoritative, but not aggressive.Handshakes can also be used to show dominance- down Palm, submission-up Palm, and equality-vertical.While encountering power player giving down Palm the following two techniques help to disarm. 	1. Step into the left foot first and then move the right foot ahead of the left foot, then put the left foot again in the same position as the right foot. Practically this might be hard to use since most right-handed people tend to step their right leg first but helps a great deal because you are invading their private space. 	2. While a person presents a Palm up position, then put your left hand over his right to form a double handler and straighten the handshake. Also, while posing for a photo with a handshake, its always good to be on the right side as it gives a Palm down advantage. Touching while shaking hands, with the other hand, creates a powerful result. When you meet someone new and shake hands, extend your left arm, give a light touch on elbow or hand as you shake, and repeat their name to confirm you heard it correctly. Facial SmilesNatural smiles produce characteristic wrinkles around the eyes. The fleshy part of the eye between the eyebrow and the eyelid moves downward, and the end of the eyebrows dip slightly with open mouth for true similes. False smiles only pull back the mouth. Smiling attracts people and signifies a submission signal. Also, laughing simulates the body's natural pain killers and feel good enhancers, like the endorphins, helping relieve stress and heal the body. Thus is used as a therapy in hospitals. People who have trouble laughing at the tough things in life often turn to drugs and alcohol to achieve the same feeling that endorphin induced laughter produces.The 5 common types of smiles include: 1. The Tight-lipped Smile : is a kind that stretches the mouse tightly across the face to form a straight line concealing the teeth. This smile sends the message that the similer has withheld opinions or attitudes that will not be shared with you.  2. Twisted smile : is another kind where it shows opposite emotions on each side of the face, one happy one angry. This smile show sarcasm in the western world. 3. Drop-Jaw Smile : is when the lower jaw is dropped to show the person is laughing or playful. 4. Sideway looking up smile  is a playful and secretive pose that affects both genders. Its orientation is, head turned down and away while looking up with a tight-lipped smile. 5. Permanent Smirk is always smiling that everyone wonders what you have been up to.Laughing is more than 30 times as likely to occurs in participants in a social situation than in a solitary setting. This shows that laughing has less to do with jokes and funny stories and more to do with building relationships. Thus people tend to laugh more and longer in a social situation than each will last alone. Women will find a person that makes her laugh more attractive.Arm SignalsAny crossing of the arms in front of the body is perceived as unfavorable. By folding arms, a barrier is formed, i.e., unconscious attempt to block out what we perceive as a threat or undesirable circumstance. When a person has a nervous, negative, or defensive attitude, it will be manifested by folding the hands. Thus, it useful to avoid crossing your arms under any circumstances unless your intention is to show you don't agree or don't want to participate.Types of crossed arms are:	▪ The universal cross arms on the chest to show its defensive. So while giving speeches, if most of the listeners are crossing their arms, the speech needs to be turned to a kind where it turns to a receptive position. On another way to break this is to give the listeners something to hold in their hands like a notebook and pen. It's also good to use arm chaired to avoid people sitting this way, which in turn blocks their listening. 	▪ Fist Clenched Arm crossed shows hostility as well as defensiveness. A verbal or physical attack could happen if it is combined with a tight-lipped simile or clenched teeth and red face.	▪ Double Arm Grip is a self hugging position that shows a negative restrained attitude. It can be seen by doctors in the waiting room, first-time travelers on air. It depicts the person is feeling insecure and not buying what you are selling.	▪ Thumbs up cross arm shows defensiveness with a self-confident attitude. 	▪ Broken zipper position is used by men to protect their vulnerable area. It creates the feeling of having someone else holding your hand. Women's take hugging themselves position where one arm hung while the other takes hold or touches the other arm.	▪ Cuff Link Adjust is used by celebrities to disguise their nervousness.Hand and Thumb GesturesHumans have 27 small bones and dozens of tiny muscles to move the joints. There are more nerve connections between the hands and the brain than in any other part of the body. Because of that, hands can tell what is the person is thinking more easily. The common hand gestures include:	▪ Rubbing palms together to show positive expectancy. If it is slow, it looks sneaky or devious, but the faster shows excitement. 	▪ Thumb fingertip rub to show gesture about money. 	▪ Clenched hands placed centered to the face elbows resting to the desk while sitting shows frustration, restrained anxious or negative attitude. If placed on the desk centered to the body while elbows are at the same level, they show the same attitude with less degree and the less with standing position. 	▪ The Steeple used by superior to subordinate interaction and indicates a confident or self-assured attitude. As a general rule, this gesture should be avoided when you want to be persuasive or win others person confidence as it can sometimes be read as smugness. The Lowered steeple, hands-on thighs can be used to show assurance. 	▪ Face platter is used by ladies to show their faces, usually presenting themselves for a man. 	▪ Hands in the back with Palm-in-Palm show superiority and confidence. The gripping hand wrist shows frustration and anger. The higher it's up, the more the person is frustrated. 	▪ Thumps protrude is a sign of power authority. They can be in Arms folded with thumb us pointing upwards and thumbs out from the pocket.Evaluation and Deceit SignalsLying is the oil that greases our interactions with others and let us maintain friendly social relationships. Such are called White Lies because their goals are to make others feel comfortable instead of telling them the cold hard truth. Malicious Lies are, however, deliberate lies that set out to deceive another for personal benefit. When children lie, they use the hand to face gesture, i.e., putting the hand on the face. For adults, their umber of gulps of saliva increases, which is especially noticeable for a man as he has Adam apples. The following are the eight most common lying gestures. 1. The mouse cover : the hands cover the mouth as the brain subconsciously instructs it to try to suppress the deceitful words that are being said. While you are talking, if someone covers their mouse, it shows that they feel you are hiding something.  2. The nose touch : The human nose expands with blood during lying. This is followed by nose touching repossessed.  3. Itchy nose : is also a response like a nose touch that is used to disguise own deceit words or listener who doubts the speaker's words.  4. Eye rub : is the brain attempt to block it the deceit doubt or distasteful thing it sees, or to avoid having to look at the face of the person who is being lied to.  5. The Ear grab : is a signal that says, 'I don't want to hear it.' It is also a signal that the person heard enough and want to speak.  6. The Neck Scratch : is a gesture that shows doubt or uncertainty and is characteristic of the person to say, I'm not sure I agree. 7. The Collar Pull : is another gesture of telling lies.  8. Fingers in the mouse is an outward indication of an inner need for assurance, so giving a node guarantees a positive move. Evaluations gestures are shown by a closed hand resting on the chin or cheek, often the index finger pointing upward. Rubbing the back of the neck is also another reaction caused by feeling frustrated or fearful. Slapping the back of the neck tells your are being pain-in-the-neck for the issue while slapping the forehead shows reminding the forgotten thing and not intimidated by you mentioning it.Eye SignalsThe eyes are the most revealing and accurate of all human communication signals because they work independently of conscious control. In general, pupils will dilate or contract as your attitude and mood change from positive to negative and vice versa. When someone becomes excited, their pupils can dilate to up to four times their original size. Conversely, an angry, negative mood causes the pupils to contract to what is commonly known as beady little eyes.When people are lying, they are likely to dramatically increase their blinking rate, an unconscious attempt by the person's brain to block you from their sight because they have become bored or disinterested or feel superior to you. In such scenarios, to rattle the person while taking extended blink, quickly step a pace to your left or right.There are three geographical areas-gazing kinds, people look upon while talking to each other. 1. The social gaze : looks on the triangular area on the other persons face that is between the two eyes and noise. This gaze perceived as non-aggressive. 2. The Intimate gaze : looks at the lower body first to establish what sex it is and up between the eyes and below the chin. Women's has a wider peripheral vision that helps her to look at top to bottom while looking at the face. However, because of male tunnel vision, he needs to gaze up and down in a very obvious way. This is the reason why men are accused of ogling women's body at close range though research shows that women do more of it than men. 3. The Power gaze : looks at the triangular area between the eye and middle of the forehead. This gaze is used to treat a person who intimidates or the person you want to make shut up.Other gaze form, The power stare, gives more authority. It is done by looking at the person in narrow eyelids and without blinking. To perform this, move your eyeballs first and then let your head follow while making your shoulders remain still.Another interesting thing about the eyes is the movement they follow while trying to remember something. If a person recalls something that they saw, their eyes will move upward. If they recall something, they heard- they look to the side and tilt their head as if they are listening. If they are recalling a feeling or emotion they'll look down and to the right. And when they are talking to themselves, they look down and to the left.To keep control of where a person is looking while showing something, use a pen to point to the presentation and, at the same time, verbalize what he sees. Next, lift the pen from the presentation and hold it between his eyes and your eyes.continued in the comment section..."

37,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45626469-hadi-abedini,5,"It's really a definitive book about body language. simple and clear writing and perfect examples makes it easy to understand.as told in book, we should not interpret single gestures. gestures should be interpreted in clusters and this book could not cover this important aspect. I think another book should be appended so that we can analyse different real situations and put together all we know about body language in practice."
38,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71950414-mariagiulia,2,"A poorly written, not that accurate, superficial and even slightly sexist body language manual that I struggled to finish. What stopped me from giving it only 1 star is that despite the many things I disagreed with, I found anyway a couple of useful pieces of advice. Overall not recommended."
39,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17413971-jinkm,1,"I got this book from the library because I have problems reading another person's body language. However, from the first page I got the feeling this book wouldn't be for someone like me. I saw the other books the author's have written. Here is the list:Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read MapsWhy Men Lie and Women CryWhy Men Can Only do One Thing At A Time and Women Never Stop TalkingThe Little Book of Men and women In my opinion, it's obvious the authors probably subscribe to the belief that men and women are totally and inherently different. And that they probably also believe in inherent gender roles, which, again, in my opinion, is bollocks. But hey, I thought, let's not judge. People's opinions and beliefs evolve and everyone has questionable opinions. That doesn't mean they don't know what they are talking about when it come to body language. So, I decided to give it a try.Eleven pages in I see ""Body language is an outward reflection of a person's emotional condition""Now, as someone who others describe as very stoic and stone-faced and as someone who has trouble with expressing emotion, I found this to be a little narrow minded. I constantly have to explain to people that ""No, I am not angry, I am thinking."" ""No, I am not attacking you, I am trying to have a serious discussion with you, please ignore my angry looking eyeballs."" ""No I am not a serial killer, I just have a very intense face sometimes, okay?!"" XD However, I am willing to consider this is the case for most people and I came to learn about others, so I carry on!  Unfortunately, immediately below the above quote, as an illustrative image to show an example of body language, they inserted a conveniently angled picture of Prince Charles so that it looked like he was grasping a large-chested woman's breasts with the caption of ""Prince Charles finds a bosom buddy"". Now, I'm all for humor and recognize that it makes reading about scientific subjects easier to digest. However, I found this tasteless and inappropriate. Red flag #3. (And it wasn't even the only sexual innuendo :S) However x2 though, we don't require our 'experts' to have appropriate senses of humor, (NASA scientists as an example :D). They are there to make a point and instruct, not to tickle our funny bones SO, I read on. :/ (If you can't tell, I'm a little hard-headed and have trouble listening to my own intuition.) The Final Straw - Not knowing the definition of words- The authors say ""Women have an innate ability to pick up and decipher non verbal signals, as well as having an accurate eye for small details"" I disagree, but I've already decided to ignore their outdated gender opinions. Just in the next paragraph, though, they totally contradict themselves. The authors cite a Harvard study that showed that women have a greater ability to read emotions in situations. Okay, that is in line with what they said, BUT they go on to say in the very next sentence  that men in 'nurturing' careers, like art (what?), acting, and nursing, as well as gay men, scored as well as women. They then go on to say that women are so very good at reading emotions because they ""practice reading signals early"". Which to me, seems to be the exact opposite definition of 'innate'. That's a definite sign of a dodgy book. Now I have a logical reason to quit. Good, I quit. Best decision I've made today. I feel good about quitting. You can tell, because my stance is open and I'm smiling. No really, I'm smiling. It might only be slightly more curved than straight line, but it's a smile.  My recommendation: find a different book to read. One that is more up to date and perhaps is written by some one who is more interested in solid academics than telling crass jokes. Two thumbs down."
40,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6712675-lucas-leite,2,"More impressions  in my personal blog of reviewsNot So Evident Signs Certain gestural groups emitted by the body generate positive or negative influences in the unconscious of the interlocutor, this is the argument put forward by Allan and Barbara Pease in the book The Definitive Guide to Body Language. The authors, professionals with vast experience in business, use their professional experience, latest data and researches to, in a colloquial and brief language, expose to the general public importants tips to interpret behavior in the professional and personal situations. The book deals with meanings gestures offered by the eyes, hands, feet and other expressions and body parts. Moreover, it exposes how elements found in the environment can influence the course of a conversation: how, for example, the position of your chair in relation to the interviewer can assist you in gaining a place of employment or assist in selling a product or service. These tips are very important when you have the notion that the interlocutor form an opinion about the other in just 4 minutes of talking, appealing, unconsciously, much more to the visual attributes and gestures than the competencies inherent to the career or quality of the curriculum. In fact, you'll never get a second chance to make a good first impression.Although richly illustrated, the weak point of this simple language book is the lack of depth. The Definitive Guide to Body Language deal only with situations illustrating it without specifying or explain motivations, it is a behavioral manual. Let, therefore, gaps that can only be fulfilled if the reader looking for more technical books in the area. If the goal is get tips, this is a good book. But if the intention is to look hard into the study of body language, this is a book that can be considered only introductory.***Sinais pouco evidentesDeterminados grupos gestuais emitidos pelo corpo geram influências negativas ou positivas no inconsciente do interlocutor, esta é a tese defendida por Allan e Barbara Pease no livro Desvendando os segredos da linguagem corporal. Os autores, profissionais de vasta experiência no mundo empresarial, utilizam-se da sua vivência profissional, dados e mais recentes pesquisas para, numa linguagem coloquial e breve, passar para o grande público importantes dicas de interpretação e comportamento em situações no âmbito profissional e pessoal.O livro trata de significados gestuais oferecidos pelos olhos, mãos, pés entre outras expressões e partes do corpo. Além disso, expõem como os elementos encontrados no ambiente podem influenciar nos rumos de uma conversa: o quanto, por exemplo, a posição de sua cadeira em relação ao entrevistador pode auxiliá-lo na conquista de uma vaga de emprego ou auxiliá-lo na venda de um serviço/produto.Essas dicas são muito importantes quando se tem a noção de que o interlocutor forma uma opinião sobre o outro em apenas 4 minutos de conversa, apelando, inconscientemente, muito mais para os atributos visuais do que para as competências imanentes à carreira profissional ou qualidade do currículo. De fato, a primeira impressão muitas vezes é a que fica.Embora ricamente ilustrado, o ponto fraco deste livro de simples linguagem está na falta de profundidade. Desvendando os segredos da linguagem corporal limita-se a exemplificar situações sem especificar ou explicar motivações, trata-se de um manual comportamental. Deixa, por isso, lacunas que só podem ser preenchidas se o leitor procurar por livros mais técnicos dentro da área. Se o objetivo é captar dicas, este é um bom livro. Mas se a intenção é debruçar-se sobre o estudo da linguagem corporal, este é um livro que pode ser considerado apenas introdutório. "

He brings the different aspects into conscious thinking of how these things developed by evolution and have been hardwired into brain to interpret.I cannot emphasize more on how fantastic book it was! It has helped me immensely, especially the courtship gestures!"
42,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95025914-wilmington,2,"I have read and enjoyed Allan and Barbara Pease's other bestsellers Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps and Why Men Lie and Women Cry: How to Get What You Want Out of Life by Asking and therefore was really looking forward to reading this book. It was quite a disappointment. Half of the body language described seems perfectly obvious to me. Some of the explanations were useful, but others were dubious or downright mistaken.It didn't start well when on page 7 the caption under Schwarzenegger showing the thumb up explained that it meant five in Japan, which is utterly false. I can forgive one mistake, but not dozens, and the book is filled with them. Here are other examples.On p. 18-19, the authors say that shaking the head from side to side to indicate 'no' is universal. Are they forgetting that in India it means 'yes' ? Over one billion people is not a minor exception.On p. 20, under the title Universal Gestures, the first example is the shoulder shrug to show that a person doesn't know or doesn't understand. In France it means that the person doesn't care or that it can't be helped. Perhaps their meaning of universal is not the one universally understood by English speakers ?On p. 109-110, they say that figures E and F are insults in Japan, and figure L means 5 in Japan and 1 in (continental) Europe. None of that is true.On the next page, under 'Why We are All Becoming American', they say that the middle finger raised is originally an American insult that became adopted in other countries because of American TV and movies. It actually originated in Ancient Greece and Rome and has been used in many European countries (especially Mediterranean ones) for a very long time. The authors claim that the American Ring gesture to mean OK is now recognised in many countries due to American influence. It may be recognised, but is hardly ever used in most of Europe and Asia, where it often has a different meaning. They carry on with the words for toilet becoming Americanised, but what does this have to do with body language ? It is also a fallacy, since most speakers of English today are non-native speakers, and Europeans are far more likely to use the word 'toilet' than 'bathroom' because the word 'toilet' exists in most European languages.On p.114, they claim that the French greet each others with a double kiss and the Belgians with a triple kiss. The truth is that the number varies from one to five in France, depending on the region and generation. In Belgium it is only once among French speakers, and usually none among Dutch speakers like in Britain.On p.119, they explain that the American OK sign means zero in France and money in Japan, but they are not done the same way and therefore cannot be misunderstood easily. The OK sign is done with the three other fingers open (pointing up). The French zero is done with the middle to little fingers closed, aligned on the index finger. The Japanese zero is done with the hand placed horizontally, open fingers pointing sideways, and the palm pointing towards the body.On p. 171, we read that the Japanese are the only ones that don't 'eyebrow flash'. Again it's not true. That's an East Asian thing.After the ignorance of other cultures come the scientific errors. On p. 171, the authors say that, contrarily to humans, ""apes lack eye-whites, which means that their prey don't know where the ape is looking or whether they have been spotted, giving the ape a greater chance of hunting success."" Really ? It's a surprising theory to say the least, since all apes aside from humans, and all monkeys are vegetarian.I also wonder what they mean when on p.192 they write ""by animals, birds, fish and primates"". Animals sound redundant here.In the section of personal space (p.193), they explain that lions have a territorial space of 30 miles or more, but that lions raised in captivity have a personal space of only several yards. They confuse personal space (safe distance between two individuals, even of the same family) and the lion's hunting territory, which isn't personal but used by all the lionesses (as it is the females that hunt) belong to the same clan. They make the same confusion afterwards by mentioning countries, cities and other non-personal boundaries. It's sounds highly unscientific and unprofessional on the authors' part to make such a simplification on a book about body language.I wasn't happier to read on the next page that they were going to compare the personal space radius in (and I quote) ""Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, North America, Northern Europe, Scandinavia, Canada or anywhere a culture is 'Westernised' such as Singapore, Guam or Iceland"". Wow ! What's the point of saying Great Britain and Scandinavia is they say Northern Europe ? Why say North America and Canada ? But much worse, why on earth would they consider that Iceland is not part of Scandinavia and believe it is not a Western country but a Westernised one like Singapore ? Do they have any idea of how uneducated that sounds ? On p.202 they insist again on saying ""Northern Europeans and Scandinavians"" as if Scandinavians weren't Northern Europeans. It might be useful for them to look at a world map some time.On p.199, trying to justify that people become more aggressive when their personal space is invaded, the authors claim that ""areas that have the highest human population density also have the highest crime and violence rates"". This is another factual mistake. Countries with very high population densities like Japan, the Netherlands, England, or even India, tend to be more peaceful and have lower crime rates than sparsely populated countries like most of Africa or South America, or even the USA.On p.268, Mr and Mrs Pease claim that ""Twice as many women smoke as men"". This is completely wrong. The WHO data shows that in average, worldwide, smoking is five times as prevalent among men than women. There is hardly any country where women smoke more than men, and in some Muslim countries the percentage of smoking men is one hundred times higher than for women (for example in Morocco and Algeria).After the factual mistakes come the dubious theories. On p.260-1, we read that one of the most common forms of mirroring is yawning, and that ""It was one thought that the purpose of yawning was to oxygenate the body but we now know that it's a form of mirroring that serves to create a rapport with others and to avoid aggression"". The problem with this theory is that yawning is most commonly done when people are alone or with close relatives at home, and therefore doesn't serve to avoid aggression.I also want to add that the quiz at the end of the book is terrible. The pictures are very unclear and it's hard to find all the signals even after reading the descriptions."
43,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/538517-alissa-thorne,4,"I found this book so useful, I decided to listen to it twice in a row.* When it became clear that much of the book was going to be a lengthy list of various subtle body language queues, I groaned at what I anticipated would be a lot of rote memorization. As it turned out, since body language is so tied up with emotions, almost all of the indicators were immediately recognizable. More importantly, they matched with an emotional understanding of what it feels like when exhibiting that indicator, and it feels like when I see others. This made information easy to absorb, and once it did it stuck.The most thought provoking concept in this book is what I mentioned earlier--emotional state and body language are mirrors of one another. That is to say, not only is your body language an expression of your emotion, but your feelings can be affected by changing your physical expressions. One of the more striking examples of this is the idea that if someone has a negative attitude, expressed with crossed arms, you can influence their emotional openness by handing them a pen or cup of coffee, requiring that they uncross their arms.So far, I am primarily becoming more aware of my own body language rather than reading others. That's fine by me--not only is it useful to know what messages you are subconsciousness sending others, it also makes me more aware of my own emotional state.One questionable bit about this book--it makes heavy use of bold claims about gender and other topics that contradict common wisdom. I don't know how supported these claims are, but I take much of the alleged science with a grain of salt.* In part, this is because I kept spacing out or losing my place, so I know I was missing bits."

In any social aspect of life, being able to recognize and use knowledge of body language to our favor can make a difference. Allan and Barbara Pease use their business and research backgrounds to uncover a general overview of body language for use in personal and professional situations. They cover hands,arms, smiles and laguther, cultural differences, hand and thumb gestures, evaluation and deceit signals, eye signals, personal space, legs, thirteen most common gestures, mirroring, signals of cigarettes, glasses and makeup, how the body points, courtship/attraction signals, ownership/territory/height signals, seating arrangements, and interviews/office politics. They also include an assessment at the end. Reading this book brought to light many things I already knew, but never thought about, and gestures I never encountered. I enjoyed the straightforward read, and the helpful visuals accompanying the explanations. I would've preferred less emphasis on business when they assumed in several sections you're persuading someone to make a sale, and more on social situations though much of it is applicable. Also they cover gender differences quite a bit which is useful and link it to biology which I found interesting. Still from a social perspective it's helpful to keep in mind the varieties of each genders' differences rather than to accept the general assumption. That said, I also enjoyed the research studies cited.Overall, this book is a great resource for anyone looking to improve their communication and relationships personal or professional, and especially those in helping/people professions."

46,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1171505-princely,4,"I felt that this book was good, and had accurate things to say about WESTERN gestures. However, I live in Japan, and none of the quote *offensive* gestures mean anything to anyone under thirty five. The business relations section for Japanese was suprisingly off. I mean, every time someone bows, they inspect your shoes? Most of the folks I meet here change from their outside, nice shoes into crappy indoor ones, so everyone's shoes look kind of beaten up when we meet everyone inside :). I'm more suprised at the fact that they didn't research carefully or emphasize more useful Japanese mannerisms, that it is far harder to tell what the Japanese are thinking through body language. They behave differently than Westerners, and many body cues, such as hand gestures, don't apply. The feet gestures, however, are dead on. I find that section useful, but then again it was generally applicable to everybody. As for the book's style, of course, it could have been ghostwritten- it lacked a personal flavor for me that it would have had with an original author. Despite my complaints about its Japanese culture section and writing style, I still give this book a high score. I just found the information fascinating. So many things are being hidden by folks when they talk, but not when they move...it simply blows my mind."

At the time I didn't find it important; but in both personal and professional relationships, body language is crucial in understanding how the other person feels. This book provides a good overview of common body language gestures. I've been told by some, that reading body language can be contradictory. One sign another gives doesn't mean that's how they really feel. Luckily, this book reinforces this cautionary statement by teaching to read body language in clusters and to keep in mind the context in which the body language is given.This book is pretty well laid out in terms of grouping gestures by body part which are by chapter. It makes quick reference a little easier - although I don't feel this book is intended for a reference book. The read itself is really quite quick and easy. Toward the end, there's a self-test chapter to help solidify the knowledgeThe reason why I gave this book one 4 stars is because in some ways, a ""quick guide"" would have been nice. A quick study guide in this only means a smalll chapter recapping all the gestures discussed. A reference, if you will. That could be used to increase the utility of the book to a study guide too."

I bought this book from Amazon and read it before the book by Joe Navarro (also on my list)The authors appear to be sales/marketing people and conduct workshops and trainings on reading body language. There seems to be a bias such as ""this behavior equals this meaning."" I have a problem with this simplistic type of interpretation. However, I try to glean the basic underlying concepts and blend that with my own understanding of body language. There is some interesting information in the book. Since reading this book, I've tried to be more observant of people and their body language, but I tell you it's hard. I tend to lapse into my old ways of looking at the world.Anyway, some interesting information here, some of which I have found interesting.

Sometimes when it comes to words,people don't really say much & we always want to get to know the self that's behind these words. This book made me understand many things about body language that i've never known before to the extent where i started reading & highlighting almost everything! I found it extremely helpful,whether a person is too sure while stating his lie his body can give everything away starting from his eyes to his nose and his arm movements.

This book touches on human beings body language, such as how we cross our legs, touch our face, put things to our mouth such as pen chewing, etc. It decodes even the way we talk with our hands and what it means. There is some info too on hand gestures that the western world uses that offends in other countries. I highly enjoyed this novel and look forward to reading other books written by Allan and Barbara Pease. It must have been a ball researching for thid book. "

It introduces body language from point of view of business and politics. Therefore, I loved this book as it would prepare me for my future major and career, which will be involving international affairs. Topics include the basics of body language, and then to specific elements including hand and arm movement and gestures, facial expressions, eye signals, leg and body positioning. I found the illustrations and images that come with the text to be very funny. In addition, I found it to be very nice and simple to understand the body language from a practical point of view. Therefore I recommend this book to people who would like to understand and communicate people in a better way. "

After reading How to Speak Dog and noticing much of doggish is found in body language I thought it would be good to have a base level of knowledge about human body language as well. Unfortunately this book isn't really about that. It's a kind of misogynistic guide to the unhealthy world of Sales. Bloody damn and blast! I should have known something was amiss when I found myself in the marketing section of the library rather than social sciences!Really though, unless you're selling widgets, don't read this book. There are a few truths that I have since verified regarding human body language, but there's got to be a better book out there regarding the subject."
54,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4504589-boots,4,"I didn't realize how interesting I would find the subject of body language. This book is written to be entertaining and I would say the authors were fairly successful with that. One of the main issues I have with this book is that some of the authors interpretations of various studies are based on their own opinions, but stated as fact; which had me thinking, ""how did you come to that conclusion?"" Another issue that I found a bit annoying is the fact that the authors seem to shamelessly promote other books they have published. But even with those annoyances, I still might actually read this book again. "
55,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17486478-aziff,4,"There are many body language books out there but none have I found to be as illustrative, interesting or as informative as this. Body Language explores the subtle physical signs we let out and interprets them in sweeping ways, often using examples (public figures like Bill Clinton) to nail down points. And not only limited to body language, A. Pease also jabs in the usage of external accessories such as spectacles which I found amusing and also enlightening. The sitting arrangement in a meeting, how one positions their arms, where your foot points; these are among the different subject areas this book sheds light on."
56,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55164647-yousra,3,"	After studying this book you'll be able to read people better no doubt. Of course it takes some practice to really master the techniques you learn in this book, and you'll be a bit overwhelmed and confused at first...it gets better over time however. With this book you can connect better with people; communicate more effectively, and get across the nonverbal information you really want to convey in a variety of situations, from giving speeches or presentations to being in a job interview. Lot's of VERY valuable information in this book; highly recommended!"

I find myself constantly looking for the tell-tale clusters of body language and doing my best to interpret them. Truly interesting read and inspiring to find more information on the topic and become a self-taught expert. Lets be honest though, great thing to learn to manipulate and work people your way as well. "
58,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17570957-salma-a-240511,5," I have benefited greatly by reading this book, it helps to understand the behavior of people in various positions. The pictograms,they help a person to understand the idea and analyze body language before they help the reader to translate the situation and analyzed own style. This book helps to know around us more and what we must do in any case or situation. I advise the readers to read this book , because it help a lot and it's very useful too. "
59,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4458112-kelly,3,"I liked this book at the beginning and I definitely learned a few things but the more I read, the more it felt like the author was spouting generalizations as fact. I think parts are research based but claims like most women are not good at running and accountants don't have good social skills took away some of the book's credibility in my eyes not to mention somewhat insulted me. However, it is a light read, written without a serious tone so it is still worth reading in my opinion."
60,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74464328-emanuel-serbanoiu,5,"This is one of the best books I've read this year, definitely better than the other books about body language I've read. It's really important for everybody to know more about this subtle form of communication and I would recommend it to anyone. You will find at least a dozen things you didn't know about before."
61,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32450066-suzie,5,"Another informative, interesting and amusing read from the Pease's. Would definitely recommend! Well written, clear and very useful for everyday life."
62,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30074243-antonia-ivanova,5,"It's a good book, it doesn't lie to you. You cannot read body language by just analyzing individual gestures you saw depicted here. You have to trust your intuition, but this is a good blueprint for further analysis. Warning: makes you slightly obsessive and less attentive when people speak."

65,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91977885-michael,4,"Body language is an outward reflection of a person's emotional condition. It's about matching what you see and hear in the environment in which it all happens and drawing a probable conclusion. However, most people only see the things they think they are seeing. Early research on communication shows that the total impact of a message is about 7% for spoken words and 38% for vocal, i.e., the voice's tone and 55% for non-verbal. This means that words are used primarily for conveying information and data. For example, a study done between 1970-80 revealed that a person with a strong argument usually wins in a phone conversation. However, in the round table encounter 60 to 80 percent accounts for body language, and usually, the people make initial impressions within 4 minutes of the conversation.According to the book, some people, especially women's, are more perceptive than men - 'women's intuition.' Being perceptive means able to spot the contradictions between someone's words and body language. When we say we have a hunch or gut feeling, we usually mean that their words and body language do not much. And overall, women are good at picking them. In addition, it is usually easy to read children than adults. This could be that adults have less muscle tone in the face. An interesting fact about body language is that it is easy to misread it, yet it is hard to fake it.While talking about body language, it's important to note that it can be different across different cultures, though some body languages like nodding the head, shoulder shrug, smiling are inborn and are usually the same across cultures. For accurately reading body language, the book presents 3 rules.	1. The reading of gestures should be in clusters. This is to mean that an individual gesture might not give or mislead. Gestures are words, and clusters are sentences in body language. To read them correctly, it needs at least three testers in a match. 	2. Look for congruence between gesture clusters and verbal language. If the gestures and the verbal language do not much, women tend to take the gestures. 	3. Gestures should be read in the context. For example, a person sitting in a cold bus waiting with hands crossed (defensive) and chin down (critical/hostile) should not be interpreted negatively.The HandsPalms of a hand are vocal cords of body language because they did more talking than any other body parts. Three are 3 main palm command testers	▪ Palm Up : is a used as a submissive non-threatening gesture.	▪ Palm Down : shows immediate authority.	▪ Palm Closed : shows the speaker figuratively beats his listeners to submission.Fingers also play a role, where a pointing finger gives negative feelings. Also, squeezing your finger into your thumb to make an OK gesture while giving public speech is considered authoritative, but not aggressive.Handshakes can also be used to show dominance- down Palm, submission-up Palm, and equality-vertical.While encountering power player giving down Palm the following two techniques help to disarm. 	1. Step into the left foot first and then move the right foot ahead of the left foot, then put the left foot again in the same position as the right foot. Practically this might be hard to use since most right-handed people tend to step their right leg first but helps a great deal because you are invading their private space. 	2. While a person presents a Palm up position, then put your left hand over his right to form a double handler and straighten the handshake. Also, while posing for a photo with a handshake, its always good to be on the right side as it gives a Palm down advantage. Touching while shaking hands, with the other hand, creates a powerful result. When you meet someone new and shake hands, extend your left arm, give a light touch on elbow or hand as you shake, and repeat their name to confirm you heard it correctly. Facial SmilesNatural smiles produce characteristic wrinkles around the eyes. The fleshy part of the eye between the eyebrow and the eyelid moves downward, and the end of the eyebrows dip slightly with open mouth for true similes. False smiles only pull back the mouth. Smiling attracts people and signifies a submission signal. Also, laughing simulates the body's natural pain killers and feel good enhancers, like the endorphins, helping relieve stress and heal the body. Thus is used as a therapy in hospitals. People who have trouble laughing at the tough things in life often turn to drugs and alcohol to achieve the same feeling that endorphin induced laughter produces.The 5 common types of smiles include: 1. The Tight-lipped Smile : is a kind that stretches the mouse tightly across the face to form a straight line concealing the teeth. This smile sends the message that the similer has withheld opinions or attitudes that will not be shared with you.  2. Twisted smile : is another kind where it shows opposite emotions on each side of the face, one happy one angry. This smile show sarcasm in the western world. 3. Drop-Jaw Smile : is when the lower jaw is dropped to show the person is laughing or playful. 4. Sideway looking up smile  is a playful and secretive pose that affects both genders. Its orientation is, head turned down and away while looking up with a tight-lipped smile. 5. Permanent Smirk is always smiling that everyone wonders what you have been up to.Laughing is more than 30 times as likely to occurs in participants in a social situation than in a solitary setting. This shows that laughing has less to do with jokes and funny stories and more to do with building relationships. Thus people tend to laugh more and longer in a social situation than each will last alone. Women will find a person that makes her laugh more attractive.Arm SignalsAny crossing of the arms in front of the body is perceived as unfavorable. By folding arms, a barrier is formed, i.e., unconscious attempt to block out what we perceive as a threat or undesirable circumstance. When a person has a nervous, negative, or defensive attitude, it will be manifested by folding the hands. Thus, it useful to avoid crossing your arms under any circumstances unless your intention is to show you don't agree or don't want to participate.Types of crossed arms are:	▪ The universal cross arms on the chest to show its defensive. So while giving speeches, if most of the listeners are crossing their arms, the speech needs to be turned to a kind where it turns to a receptive position. On another way to break this is to give the listeners something to hold in their hands like a notebook and pen. It's also good to use arm chaired to avoid people sitting this way, which in turn blocks their listening. 	▪ Fist Clenched Arm crossed shows hostility as well as defensiveness. A verbal or physical attack could happen if it is combined with a tight-lipped simile or clenched teeth and red face.	▪ Double Arm Grip is a self hugging position that shows a negative restrained attitude. It can be seen by doctors in the waiting room, first-time travelers on air. It depicts the person is feeling insecure and not buying what you are selling.	▪ Thumbs up cross arm shows defensiveness with a self-confident attitude. 	▪ Broken zipper position is used by men to protect their vulnerable area. It creates the feeling of having someone else holding your hand. Women's take hugging themselves position where one arm hung while the other takes hold or touches the other arm.	▪ Cuff Link Adjust is used by celebrities to disguise their nervousness.Hand and Thumb GesturesHumans have 27 small bones and dozens of tiny muscles to move the joints. There are more nerve connections between the hands and the brain than in any other part of the body. Because of that, hands can tell what is the person is thinking more easily. The common hand gestures include:	▪ Rubbing palms together to show positive expectancy. If it is slow, it looks sneaky or devious, but the faster shows excitement. 	▪ Thumb fingertip rub to show gesture about money. 	▪ Clenched hands placed centered to the face elbows resting to the desk while sitting shows frustration, restrained anxious or negative attitude. If placed on the desk centered to the body while elbows are at the same level, they show the same attitude with less degree and the less with standing position. 	▪ The Steeple used by superior to subordinate interaction and indicates a confident or self-assured attitude. As a general rule, this gesture should be avoided when you want to be persuasive or win others person confidence as it can sometimes be read as smugness. The Lowered steeple, hands-on thighs can be used to show assurance. 	▪ Face platter is used by ladies to show their faces, usually presenting themselves for a man. 	▪ Hands in the back with Palm-in-Palm show superiority and confidence. The gripping hand wrist shows frustration and anger. The higher it's up, the more the person is frustrated. 	▪ Thumps protrude is a sign of power authority. They can be in Arms folded with thumb us pointing upwards and thumbs out from the pocket.Evaluation and Deceit SignalsLying is the oil that greases our interactions with others and let us maintain friendly social relationships. Such are called White Lies because their goals are to make others feel comfortable instead of telling them the cold hard truth. Malicious Lies are, however, deliberate lies that set out to deceive another for personal benefit. When children lie, they use the hand to face gesture, i.e., putting the hand on the face. For adults, their umber of gulps of saliva increases, which is especially noticeable for a man as he has Adam apples. The following are the eight most common lying gestures. 1. The mouse cover : the hands cover the mouth as the brain subconsciously instructs it to try to suppress the deceitful words that are being said. While you are talking, if someone covers their mouse, it shows that they feel you are hiding something.  2. The nose touch : The human nose expands with blood during lying. This is followed by nose touching repossessed.  3. Itchy nose : is also a response like a nose touch that is used to disguise own deceit words or listener who doubts the speaker's words.  4. Eye rub : is the brain attempt to block it the deceit doubt or distasteful thing it sees, or to avoid having to look at the face of the person who is being lied to.  5. The Ear grab : is a signal that says, 'I don't want to hear it.' It is also a signal that the person heard enough and want to speak.  6. The Neck Scratch : is a gesture that shows doubt or uncertainty and is characteristic of the person to say, I'm not sure I agree. 7. The Collar Pull : is another gesture of telling lies.  8. Fingers in the mouse is an outward indication of an inner need for assurance, so giving a node guarantees a positive move. Evaluations gestures are shown by a closed hand resting on the chin or cheek, often the index finger pointing upward. Rubbing the back of the neck is also another reaction caused by feeling frustrated or fearful. Slapping the back of the neck tells your are being pain-in-the-neck for the issue while slapping the forehead shows reminding the forgotten thing and not intimidated by you mentioning it.Eye SignalsThe eyes are the most revealing and accurate of all human communication signals because they work independently of conscious control. In general, pupils will dilate or contract as your attitude and mood change from positive to negative and vice versa. When someone becomes excited, their pupils can dilate to up to four times their original size. Conversely, an angry, negative mood causes the pupils to contract to what is commonly known as beady little eyes.When people are lying, they are likely to dramatically increase their blinking rate, an unconscious attempt by the person's brain to block you from their sight because they have become bored or disinterested or feel superior to you. In such scenarios, to rattle the person while taking extended blink, quickly step a pace to your left or right.There are three geographical areas-gazing kinds, people look upon while talking to each other. 1. The social gaze : looks on the triangular area on the other persons face that is between the two eyes and noise. This gaze perceived as non-aggressive. 2. The Intimate gaze : looks at the lower body first to establish what sex it is and up between the eyes and below the chin. Women's has a wider peripheral vision that helps her to look at top to bottom while looking at the face. However, because of male tunnel vision, he needs to gaze up and down in a very obvious way. This is the reason why men are accused of ogling women's body at close range though research shows that women do more of it than men. 3. The Power gaze : looks at the triangular area between the eye and middle of the forehead. This gaze is used to treat a person who intimidates or the person you want to make shut up.Other gaze form, The power stare, gives more authority. It is done by looking at the person in narrow eyelids and without blinking. To perform this, move your eyeballs first and then let your head follow while making your shoulders remain still.Another interesting thing about the eyes is the movement they follow while trying to remember something. If a person recalls something that they saw, their eyes will move upward. If they recall something, they heard- they look to the side and tilt their head as if they are listening. If they are recalling a feeling or emotion they'll look down and to the right. And when they are talking to themselves, they look down and to the left.To keep control of where a person is looking while showing something, use a pen to point to the presentation and, at the same time, verbalize what he sees. Next, lift the pen from the presentation and hold it between his eyes and your eyes.continued in the comment section..."

I think another book should be appended so that we can analyse different real situations and put together all we know about body language in practice."
68,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71950414-mariagiulia,2,"A poorly written, not that accurate, superficial and even slightly sexist body language manual that I struggled to finish. What stopped me from giving it only 1 star is that despite the many things I disagreed with, I found anyway a couple of useful pieces of advice. Overall not recommended."
69,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17413971-jinkm,1,"I got this book from the library because I have problems reading another person's body language. However, from the first page I got the feeling this book wouldn't be for someone like me. I saw the other books the author's have written. Here is the list:Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read MapsWhy Men Lie and Women CryWhy Men Can Only do One Thing At A Time and Women Never Stop TalkingThe Little Book of Men and women In my opinion, it's obvious the authors probably subscribe to the belief that men and women are totally and inherently different. And that they probably also believe in inherent gender roles, which, again, in my opinion, is bollocks. But hey, I thought, let's not judge. People's opinions and beliefs evolve and everyone has questionable opinions. That doesn't mean they don't know what they are talking about when it come to body language. So, I decided to give it a try.Eleven pages in I see ""Body language is an outward reflection of a person's emotional condition""Now, as someone who others describe as very stoic and stone-faced and as someone who has trouble with expressing emotion, I found this to be a little narrow minded. I constantly have to explain to people that ""No, I am not angry, I am thinking."" ""No, I am not attacking you, I am trying to have a serious discussion with you, please ignore my angry looking eyeballs."" ""No I am not a serial killer, I just have a very intense face sometimes, okay?!"" XD However, I am willing to consider this is the case for most people and I came to learn about others, so I carry on!  Unfortunately, immediately below the above quote, as an illustrative image to show an example of body language, they inserted a conveniently angled picture of Prince Charles so that it looked like he was grasping a large-chested woman's breasts with the caption of ""Prince Charles finds a bosom buddy"". Now, I'm all for humor and recognize that it makes reading about scientific subjects easier to digest. However, I found this tasteless and inappropriate. Red flag #3. (And it wasn't even the only sexual innuendo :S) However x2 though, we don't require our 'experts' to have appropriate senses of humor, (NASA scientists as an example :D). They are there to make a point and instruct, not to tickle our funny bones SO, I read on. :/ (If you can't tell, I'm a little hard-headed and have trouble listening to my own intuition.) The Final Straw - Not knowing the definition of words- The authors say ""Women have an innate ability to pick up and decipher non verbal signals, as well as having an accurate eye for small details"" I disagree, but I've already decided to ignore their outdated gender opinions. Just in the next paragraph, though, they totally contradict themselves. The authors cite a Harvard study that showed that women have a greater ability to read emotions in situations. Okay, that is in line with what they said, BUT they go on to say in the very next sentence  that men in 'nurturing' careers, like art (what?), acting, and nursing, as well as gay men, scored as well as women. They then go on to say that women are so very good at reading emotions because they ""practice reading signals early"". Which to me, seems to be the exact opposite definition of 'innate'. That's a definite sign of a dodgy book. Now I have a logical reason to quit. Good, I quit. Best decision I've made today. I feel good about quitting. You can tell, because my stance is open and I'm smiling. No really, I'm smiling. It might only be slightly more curved than straight line, but it's a smile.  My recommendation: find a different book to read. One that is more up to date and perhaps is written by some one who is more interested in solid academics than telling crass jokes. Two thumbs down."
70,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6712675-lucas-leite,2,"More impressions  in my personal blog of reviewsNot So Evident Signs Certain gestural groups emitted by the body generate positive or negative influences in the unconscious of the interlocutor, this is the argument put forward by Allan and Barbara Pease in the book The Definitive Guide to Body Language. The authors, professionals with vast experience in business, use their professional experience, latest data and researches to, in a colloquial and brief language, expose to the general public importants tips to interpret behavior in the professional and personal situations. The book deals with meanings gestures offered by the eyes, hands, feet and other expressions and body parts. Moreover, it exposes how elements found in the environment can influence the course of a conversation: how, for example, the position of your chair in relation to the interviewer can assist you in gaining a place of employment or assist in selling a product or service. These tips are very important when you have the notion that the interlocutor form an opinion about the other in just 4 minutes of talking, appealing, unconsciously, much more to the visual attributes and gestures than the competencies inherent to the career or quality of the curriculum. In fact, you'll never get a second chance to make a good first impression.Although richly illustrated, the weak point of this simple language book is the lack of depth. The Definitive Guide to Body Language deal only with situations illustrating it without specifying or explain motivations, it is a behavioral manual. Let, therefore, gaps that can only be fulfilled if the reader looking for more technical books in the area. If the goal is get tips, this is a good book. But if the intention is to look hard into the study of body language, this is a book that can be considered only introductory.***Sinais pouco evidentesDeterminados grupos gestuais emitidos pelo corpo geram influências negativas ou positivas no inconsciente do interlocutor, esta é a tese defendida por Allan e Barbara Pease no livro Desvendando os segredos da linguagem corporal. Os autores, profissionais de vasta experiência no mundo empresarial, utilizam-se da sua vivência profissional, dados e mais recentes pesquisas para, numa linguagem coloquial e breve, passar para o grande público importantes dicas de interpretação e comportamento em situações no âmbito profissional e pessoal.O livro trata de significados gestuais oferecidos pelos olhos, mãos, pés entre outras expressões e partes do corpo. Além disso, expõem como os elementos encontrados no ambiente podem influenciar nos rumos de uma conversa: o quanto, por exemplo, a posição de sua cadeira em relação ao entrevistador pode auxiliá-lo na conquista de uma vaga de emprego ou auxiliá-lo na venda de um serviço/produto.Essas dicas são muito importantes quando se tem a noção de que o interlocutor forma uma opinião sobre o outro em apenas 4 minutos de conversa, apelando, inconscientemente, muito mais para os atributos visuais do que para as competências imanentes à carreira profissional ou qualidade do currículo. De fato, a primeira impressão muitas vezes é a que fica.Embora ricamente ilustrado, o ponto fraco deste livro de simples linguagem está na falta de profundidade. Desvendando os segredos da linguagem corporal limita-se a exemplificar situações sem especificar ou explicar motivações, trata-se de um manual comportamental. Deixa, por isso, lacunas que só podem ser preenchidas se o leitor procurar por livros mais técnicos dentro da área. Se o objetivo é captar dicas, este é um bom livro. Mas se a intenção é debruçar-se sobre o estudo da linguagem corporal, este é um livro que pode ser considerado apenas introdutório. "

He brings the different aspects into conscious thinking of how these things developed by evolution and have been hardwired into brain to interpret.I cannot emphasize more on how fantastic book it was! It has helped me immensely, especially the courtship gestures!"
72,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95025914-wilmington,2,"I have read and enjoyed Allan and Barbara Pease's other bestsellers Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps and Why Men Lie and Women Cry: How to Get What You Want Out of Life by Asking and therefore was really looking forward to reading this book. It was quite a disappointment. Half of the body language described seems perfectly obvious to me. Some of the explanations were useful, but others were dubious or downright mistaken.It didn't start well when on page 7 the caption under Schwarzenegger showing the thumb up explained that it meant five in Japan, which is utterly false. I can forgive one mistake, but not dozens, and the book is filled with them. Here are other examples.On p. 18-19, the authors say that shaking the head from side to side to indicate 'no' is universal. Are they forgetting that in India it means 'yes' ? Over one billion people is not a minor exception.On p. 20, under the title Universal Gestures, the first example is the shoulder shrug to show that a person doesn't know or doesn't understand. In France it means that the person doesn't care or that it can't be helped. Perhaps their meaning of universal is not the one universally understood by English speakers ?On p. 109-110, they say that figures E and F are insults in Japan, and figure L means 5 in Japan and 1 in (continental) Europe. None of that is true.On the next page, under 'Why We are All Becoming American', they say that the middle finger raised is originally an American insult that became adopted in other countries because of American TV and movies. It actually originated in Ancient Greece and Rome and has been used in many European countries (especially Mediterranean ones) for a very long time. The authors claim that the American Ring gesture to mean OK is now recognised in many countries due to American influence. It may be recognised, but is hardly ever used in most of Europe and Asia, where it often has a different meaning. They carry on with the words for toilet becoming Americanised, but what does this have to do with body language ? It is also a fallacy, since most speakers of English today are non-native speakers, and Europeans are far more likely to use the word 'toilet' than 'bathroom' because the word 'toilet' exists in most European languages.On p.114, they claim that the French greet each others with a double kiss and the Belgians with a triple kiss. The truth is that the number varies from one to five in France, depending on the region and generation. In Belgium it is only once among French speakers, and usually none among Dutch speakers like in Britain.On p.119, they explain that the American OK sign means zero in France and money in Japan, but they are not done the same way and therefore cannot be misunderstood easily. The OK sign is done with the three other fingers open (pointing up). The French zero is done with the middle to little fingers closed, aligned on the index finger. The Japanese zero is done with the hand placed horizontally, open fingers pointing sideways, and the palm pointing towards the body.On p. 171, we read that the Japanese are the only ones that don't 'eyebrow flash'. Again it's not true. That's an East Asian thing.After the ignorance of other cultures come the scientific errors. On p. 171, the authors say that, contrarily to humans, ""apes lack eye-whites, which means that their prey don't know where the ape is looking or whether they have been spotted, giving the ape a greater chance of hunting success."" Really ? It's a surprising theory to say the least, since all apes aside from humans, and all monkeys are vegetarian.I also wonder what they mean when on p.192 they write ""by animals, birds, fish and primates"". Animals sound redundant here.In the section of personal space (p.193), they explain that lions have a territorial space of 30 miles or more, but that lions raised in captivity have a personal space of only several yards. They confuse personal space (safe distance between two individuals, even of the same family) and the lion's hunting territory, which isn't personal but used by all the lionesses (as it is the females that hunt) belong to the same clan. They make the same confusion afterwards by mentioning countries, cities and other non-personal boundaries. It's sounds highly unscientific and unprofessional on the authors' part to make such a simplification on a book about body language.I wasn't happier to read on the next page that they were going to compare the personal space radius in (and I quote) ""Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, North America, Northern Europe, Scandinavia, Canada or anywhere a culture is 'Westernised' such as Singapore, Guam or Iceland"". Wow ! What's the point of saying Great Britain and Scandinavia is they say Northern Europe ? Why say North America and Canada ? But much worse, why on earth would they consider that Iceland is not part of Scandinavia and believe it is not a Western country but a Westernised one like Singapore ? Do they have any idea of how uneducated that sounds ? On p.202 they insist again on saying ""Northern Europeans and Scandinavians"" as if Scandinavians weren't Northern Europeans. It might be useful for them to look at a world map some time.On p.199, trying to justify that people become more aggressive when their personal space is invaded, the authors claim that ""areas that have the highest human population density also have the highest crime and violence rates"". This is another factual mistake. Countries with very high population densities like Japan, the Netherlands, England, or even India, tend to be more peaceful and have lower crime rates than sparsely populated countries like most of Africa or South America, or even the USA.On p.268, Mr and Mrs Pease claim that ""Twice as many women smoke as men"". This is completely wrong. The WHO data shows that in average, worldwide, smoking is five times as prevalent among men than women. There is hardly any country where women smoke more than men, and in some Muslim countries the percentage of smoking men is one hundred times higher than for women (for example in Morocco and Algeria).After the factual mistakes come the dubious theories. On p.260-1, we read that one of the most common forms of mirroring is yawning, and that ""It was one thought that the purpose of yawning was to oxygenate the body but we now know that it's a form of mirroring that serves to create a rapport with others and to avoid aggression"". The problem with this theory is that yawning is most commonly done when people are alone or with close relatives at home, and therefore doesn't serve to avoid aggression.I also want to add that the quiz at the end of the book is terrible. The pictures are very unclear and it's hard to find all the signals even after reading the descriptions."
73,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/538517-alissa-thorne,4,"I found this book so useful, I decided to listen to it twice in a row.* When it became clear that much of the book was going to be a lengthy list of various subtle body language queues, I groaned at what I anticipated would be a lot of rote memorization. As it turned out, since body language is so tied up with emotions, almost all of the indicators were immediately recognizable. More importantly, they matched with an emotional understanding of what it feels like when exhibiting that indicator, and it feels like when I see others. This made information easy to absorb, and once it did it stuck.The most thought provoking concept in this book is what I mentioned earlier--emotional state and body language are mirrors of one another. That is to say, not only is your body language an expression of your emotion, but your feelings can be affected by changing your physical expressions. One of the more striking examples of this is the idea that if someone has a negative attitude, expressed with crossed arms, you can influence their emotional openness by handing them a pen or cup of coffee, requiring that they uncross their arms.So far, I am primarily becoming more aware of my own body language rather than reading others. That's fine by me--not only is it useful to know what messages you are subconsciousness sending others, it also makes me more aware of my own emotional state.One questionable bit about this book--it makes heavy use of bold claims about gender and other topics that contradict common wisdom. I don't know how supported these claims are, but I take much of the alleged science with a grain of salt.* In part, this is because I kept spacing out or losing my place, so I know I was missing bits."
74,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22787654-justin,4,"Nonverbal signals constitutes the majority of communication, and often gets overlooked. In any social aspect of life, being able to recognize and use knowledge of body language to our favor can make a difference. Allan and Barbara Pease use their business and research backgrounds to uncover a general overview of body language for use in personal and professional situations. They cover hands,arms, smiles and laguther, cultural differences, hand and thumb gestures, evaluation and deceit signals, eye signals, personal space, legs, thirteen most common gestures, mirroring, signals of cigarettes, glasses and makeup, how the body points, courtship/attraction signals, ownership/territory/height signals, seating arrangements, and interviews/office politics. They also include an assessment at the end. Reading this book brought to light many things I already knew, but never thought about, and gestures I never encountered. I enjoyed the straightforward read, and the helpful visuals accompanying the explanations. I would've preferred less emphasis on business when they assumed in several sections you're persuading someone to make a sale, and more on social situations though much of it is applicable. Also they cover gender differences quite a bit which is useful and link it to biology which I found interesting. Still from a social perspective it's helpful to keep in mind the varieties of each genders' differences rather than to accept the general assumption. That said, I also enjoyed the research studies cited.Overall, this book is a great resource for anyone looking to improve their communication and relationships personal or professional, and especially those in helping/people professions."

76,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1171505-princely,4,"I felt that this book was good, and had accurate things to say about WESTERN gestures. However, I live in Japan, and none of the quote *offensive* gestures mean anything to anyone under thirty five. The business relations section for Japanese was suprisingly off. I mean, every time someone bows, they inspect your shoes? Most of the folks I meet here change from their outside, nice shoes into crappy indoor ones, so everyone's shoes look kind of beaten up when we meet everyone inside :). I'm more suprised at the fact that they didn't research carefully or emphasize more useful Japanese mannerisms, that it is far harder to tell what the Japanese are thinking through body language. They behave differently than Westerners, and many body cues, such as hand gestures, don't apply. The feet gestures, however, are dead on. I find that section useful, but then again it was generally applicable to everybody. As for the book's style, of course, it could have been ghostwritten- it lacked a personal flavor for me that it would have had with an original author. Despite my complaints about its Japanese culture section and writing style, I still give this book a high score. I just found the information fascinating. So many things are being hidden by folks when they talk, but not when they move...it simply blows my mind."

At the time I didn't find it important; but in both personal and professional relationships, body language is crucial in understanding how the other person feels. This book provides a good overview of common body language gestures. I've been told by some, that reading body language can be contradictory. One sign another gives doesn't mean that's how they really feel. Luckily, this book reinforces this cautionary statement by teaching to read body language in clusters and to keep in mind the context in which the body language is given.This book is pretty well laid out in terms of grouping gestures by body part which are by chapter. It makes quick reference a little easier - although I don't feel this book is intended for a reference book. The read itself is really quite quick and easy. Toward the end, there's a self-test chapter to help solidify the knowledgeThe reason why I gave this book one 4 stars is because in some ways, a ""quick guide"" would have been nice. A quick study guide in this only means a smalll chapter recapping all the gestures discussed. A reference, if you will. That could be used to increase the utility of the book to a study guide too."

I bought this book from Amazon and read it before the book by Joe Navarro (also on my list)The authors appear to be sales/marketing people and conduct workshops and trainings on reading body language. There seems to be a bias such as ""this behavior equals this meaning."" I have a problem with this simplistic type of interpretation. However, I try to glean the basic underlying concepts and blend that with my own understanding of body language. There is some interesting information in the book. Since reading this book, I've tried to be more observant of people and their body language, but I tell you it's hard. I tend to lapse into my old ways of looking at the world.Anyway, some interesting information here, some of which I have found interesting. If nothing, it has made me much more conscious of my own body language and how I hold myself!"

It might not be your typical number one novel but it's still such a good read to me! I got so hooked on this book that i finished it in two days. Sometimes when it comes to words,people don't really say much & we always want to get to know the self that's behind these words. This book made me understand many things about body language that i've never known before to the extent where i started reading & highlighting almost everything! I found it extremely helpful,whether a person is too sure while stating his lie his body can give everything away starting from his eyes to his nose and his arm movements. I definitely would give this book 5 stars just because it doesn't sound 'sciency'at all,it was a really fun & humorous read filled with facts & helpful tips!

Now I understand why I can go past what I hear and see what's true, for those of you that can't or those who want to improve decoding people, this is a must read. I will admit I have learned more. This book touches on human beings body language, such as how we cross our legs, touch our face, put things to our mouth such as pen chewing, etc. It decodes even the way we talk with our hands and what it means. There is some info too on hand gestures that the western world uses that offends in other countries. I highly enjoyed this novel and look forward to reading other books written by Allan and Barbara Pease. It must have been a ball researching for thid book. "

Topics include the basics of body language, and then to specific elements including hand and arm movement and gestures, facial expressions, eye signals, leg and body positioning.

I should have known something was amiss when I found myself in the marketing section of the library rather than social sciences!Really though, unless you're selling widgets, don't read this book.

This book is written to be entertaining and I would say the authors were fairly successful with that. One of the main issues I have with this book is that some of the authors interpretations of various studies are based on their own opinions, but stated as fact; which had me thinking, ""how did you come to that conclusion?"" Another issue that I found a bit annoying is the fact that the authors seem to shamelessly promote other books they have published.

Body Language explores the subtle physical signs we let out and interprets them in sweeping ways, often using examples (public figures like Bill Clinton) to nail down points. And not only limited to body language, A. Pease also jabs in the usage of external accessories such as spectacles which I found amusing and also enlightening. The sitting arrangement in a meeting, how one positions their arms, where your foot points; these are among the different subject areas this book sheds light on."

The pictograms,they help a person to understand the idea and analyze body language before they help the reader to translate the situation and analyzed own style.

I think parts are research based but claims like most women are not good at running and accountants don't have good social skills took away some of the book's credibility in my eyes not to mention somewhat insulted me.

95,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91977885-michael,4,"Body language is an outward reflection of a person's emotional condition. It's about matching what you see and hear in the environment in which it all happens and drawing a probable conclusion. However, most people only see the things they think they are seeing. Early research on communication shows that the total impact of a message is about 7% for spoken words and 38% for vocal, i.e., the voice's tone and 55% for non-verbal. This means that words are used primarily for conveying information and data. For example, a study done between 1970-80 revealed that a person with a strong argument usually wins in a phone conversation. However, in the round table encounter 60 to 80 percent accounts for body language, and usually, the people make initial impressions within 4 minutes of the conversation.According to the book, some people, especially women's, are more perceptive than men - 'women's intuition.' Being perceptive means able to spot the contradictions between someone's words and body language. When we say we have a hunch or gut feeling, we usually mean that their words and body language do not much. And overall, women are good at picking them. In addition, it is usually easy to read children than adults. This could be that adults have less muscle tone in the face. An interesting fact about body language is that it is easy to misread it, yet it is hard to fake it.While talking about body language, it's important to note that it can be different across different cultures, though some body languages like nodding the head, shoulder shrug, smiling are inborn and are usually the same across cultures. For accurately reading body language, the book presents 3 rules.	1. The reading of gestures should be in clusters. This is to mean that an individual gesture might not give or mislead. Gestures are words, and clusters are sentences in body language. To read them correctly, it needs at least three testers in a match. 	2. Look for congruence between gesture clusters and verbal language. If the gestures and the verbal language do not much, women tend to take the gestures. 	3. Gestures should be read in the context. For example, a person sitting in a cold bus waiting with hands crossed (defensive) and chin down (critical/hostile) should not be interpreted negatively.The HandsPalms of a hand are vocal cords of body language because they did more talking than any other body parts. Three are 3 main palm command testers	▪ Palm Up : is a used as a submissive non-threatening gesture.	▪ Palm Down : shows immediate authority.	▪ Palm Closed : shows the speaker figuratively beats his listeners to submission.Fingers also play a role, where a pointing finger gives negative feelings. Also, squeezing your finger into your thumb to make an OK gesture while giving public speech is considered authoritative, but not aggressive.Handshakes can also be used to show dominance- down Palm, submission-up Palm, and equality-vertical.While encountering power player giving down Palm the following two techniques help to disarm. 	1. Step into the left foot first and then move the right foot ahead of the left foot, then put the left foot again in the same position as the right foot. Practically this might be hard to use since most right-handed people tend to step their right leg first but helps a great deal because you are invading their private space. 	2. While a person presents a Palm up position, then put your left hand over his right to form a double handler and straighten the handshake. Also, while posing for a photo with a handshake, its always good to be on the right side as it gives a Palm down advantage. Touching while shaking hands, with the other hand, creates a powerful result. When you meet someone new and shake hands, extend your left arm, give a light touch on elbow or hand as you shake, and repeat their name to confirm you heard it correctly. Facial SmilesNatural smiles produce characteristic wrinkles around the eyes. The fleshy part of the eye between the eyebrow and the eyelid moves downward, and the end of the eyebrows dip slightly with open mouth for true similes. False smiles only pull back the mouth. Smiling attracts people and signifies a submission signal. Also, laughing simulates the body's natural pain killers and feel good enhancers, like the endorphins, helping relieve stress and heal the body. Thus is used as a therapy in hospitals. People who have trouble laughing at the tough things in life often turn to drugs and alcohol to achieve the same feeling that endorphin induced laughter produces.The 5 common types of smiles include: 1. The Tight-lipped Smile : is a kind that stretches the mouse tightly across the face to form a straight line concealing the teeth. This smile sends the message that the similer has withheld opinions or attitudes that will not be shared with you.  2. Twisted smile : is another kind where it shows opposite emotions on each side of the face, one happy one angry. This smile show sarcasm in the western world. 3. Drop-Jaw Smile : is when the lower jaw is dropped to show the person is laughing or playful. 4. Sideway looking up smile  is a playful and secretive pose that affects both genders. Its orientation is, head turned down and away while looking up with a tight-lipped smile. 5. Permanent Smirk is always smiling that everyone wonders what you have been up to.Laughing is more than 30 times as likely to occurs in participants in a social situation than in a solitary setting. This shows that laughing has less to do with jokes and funny stories and more to do with building relationships. Thus people tend to laugh more and longer in a social situation than each will last alone. Women will find a person that makes her laugh more attractive.Arm SignalsAny crossing of the arms in front of the body is perceived as unfavorable. By folding arms, a barrier is formed, i.e., unconscious attempt to block out what we perceive as a threat or undesirable circumstance. When a person has a nervous, negative, or defensive attitude, it will be manifested by folding the hands. Thus, it useful to avoid crossing your arms under any circumstances unless your intention is to show you don't agree or don't want to participate.Types of crossed arms are:	▪ The universal cross arms on the chest to show its defensive. So while giving speeches, if most of the listeners are crossing their arms, the speech needs to be turned to a kind where it turns to a receptive position. On another way to break this is to give the listeners something to hold in their hands like a notebook and pen. It's also good to use arm chaired to avoid people sitting this way, which in turn blocks their listening. 	▪ Fist Clenched Arm crossed shows hostility as well as defensiveness. A verbal or physical attack could happen if it is combined with a tight-lipped simile or clenched teeth and red face.	▪ Double Arm Grip is a self hugging position that shows a negative restrained attitude. It can be seen by doctors in the waiting room, first-time travelers on air. It depicts the person is feeling insecure and not buying what you are selling.	▪ Thumbs up cross arm shows defensiveness with a self-confident attitude. 	▪ Broken zipper position is used by men to protect their vulnerable area. It creates the feeling of having someone else holding your hand. Women's take hugging themselves position where one arm hung while the other takes hold or touches the other arm.	▪ Cuff Link Adjust is used by celebrities to disguise their nervousness.Hand and Thumb GesturesHumans have 27 small bones and dozens of tiny muscles to move the joints. There are more nerve connections between the hands and the brain than in any other part of the body. Because of that, hands can tell what is the person is thinking more easily. The common hand gestures include:	▪ Rubbing palms together to show positive expectancy. If it is slow, it looks sneaky or devious, but the faster shows excitement. 	▪ Thumb fingertip rub to show gesture about money. 	▪ Clenched hands placed centered to the face elbows resting to the desk while sitting shows frustration, restrained anxious or negative attitude. If placed on the desk centered to the body while elbows are at the same level, they show the same attitude with less degree and the less with standing position. 	▪ The Steeple used by superior to subordinate interaction and indicates a confident or self-assured attitude. As a general rule, this gesture should be avoided when you want to be persuasive or win others person confidence as it can sometimes be read as smugness. The Lowered steeple, hands-on thighs can be used to show assurance. 	▪ Face platter is used by ladies to show their faces, usually presenting themselves for a man. 	▪ Hands in the back with Palm-in-Palm show superiority and confidence. The gripping hand wrist shows frustration and anger. The higher it's up, the more the person is frustrated. 	▪ Thumps protrude is a sign of power authority. They can be in Arms folded with thumb us pointing upwards and thumbs out from the pocket.Evaluation and Deceit SignalsLying is the oil that greases our interactions with others and let us maintain friendly social relationships. Such are called White Lies because their goals are to make others feel comfortable instead of telling them the cold hard truth. Malicious Lies are, however, deliberate lies that set out to deceive another for personal benefit. When children lie, they use the hand to face gesture, i.e., putting the hand on the face. For adults, their umber of gulps of saliva increases, which is especially noticeable for a man as he has Adam apples. The following are the eight most common lying gestures. 1. The mouse cover : the hands cover the mouth as the brain subconsciously instructs it to try to suppress the deceitful words that are being said. While you are talking, if someone covers their mouse, it shows that they feel you are hiding something.  2. The nose touch : The human nose expands with blood during lying. This is followed by nose touching repossessed.  3. Itchy nose : is also a response like a nose touch that is used to disguise own deceit words or listener who doubts the speaker's words.  4. Eye rub : is the brain attempt to block it the deceit doubt or distasteful thing it sees, or to avoid having to look at the face of the person who is being lied to.  5. The Ear grab : is a signal that says, 'I don't want to hear it.' It is also a signal that the person heard enough and want to speak.  6. The Neck Scratch : is a gesture that shows doubt or uncertainty and is characteristic of the person to say, I'm not sure I agree. 7. The Collar Pull : is another gesture of telling lies.  8. Fingers in the mouse is an outward indication of an inner need for assurance, so giving a node guarantees a positive move. Evaluations gestures are shown by a closed hand resting on the chin or cheek, often the index finger pointing upward. Rubbing the back of the neck is also another reaction caused by feeling frustrated or fearful. Slapping the back of the neck tells your are being pain-in-the-neck for the issue while slapping the forehead shows reminding the forgotten thing and not intimidated by you mentioning it.Eye SignalsThe eyes are the most revealing and accurate of all human communication signals because they work independently of conscious control. In general, pupils will dilate or contract as your attitude and mood change from positive to negative and vice versa. When someone becomes excited, their pupils can dilate to up to four times their original size. Conversely, an angry, negative mood causes the pupils to contract to what is commonly known as beady little eyes.When people are lying, they are likely to dramatically increase their blinking rate, an unconscious attempt by the person's brain to block you from their sight because they have become bored or disinterested or feel superior to you. In such scenarios, to rattle the person while taking extended blink, quickly step a pace to your left or right.There are three geographical areas-gazing kinds, people look upon while talking to each other. 1. The social gaze : looks on the triangular area on the other persons face that is between the two eyes and noise. This gaze perceived as non-aggressive. 2. The Intimate gaze : looks at the lower body first to establish what sex it is and up between the eyes and below the chin. Women's has a wider peripheral vision that helps her to look at top to bottom while looking at the face. However, because of male tunnel vision, he needs to gaze up and down in a very obvious way. This is the reason why men are accused of ogling women's body at close range though research shows that women do more of it than men. 3. The Power gaze : looks at the triangular area between the eye and middle of the forehead. This gaze is used to treat a person who intimidates or the person you want to make shut up.Other gaze form, The power stare, gives more authority. It is done by looking at the person in narrow eyelids and without blinking. To perform this, move your eyeballs first and then let your head follow while making your shoulders remain still.Another interesting thing about the eyes is the movement they follow while trying to remember something. If a person recalls something that they saw, their eyes will move upward. If they recall something, they heard- they look to the side and tilt their head as if they are listening. If they are recalling a feeling or emotion they'll look down and to the right. And when they are talking to themselves, they look down and to the left.To keep control of where a person is looking while showing something, use a pen to point to the presentation and, at the same time, verbalize what he sees.

97,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45626469-hadi-abedini,5,"It's really a definitive book about body language. simple and clear writing and perfect examples makes it easy to understand.as told in book, we should not interpret single gestures. gestures should be interpreted in clusters and this book could not cover this important aspect. I think another book should be appended so that we can analyse different real situations and put together all we know about body language in practice."
98,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71950414-mariagiulia,2,"A poorly written, not that accurate, superficial and even slightly sexist body language manual that I struggled to finish. What stopped me from giving it only 1 star is that despite the many things I disagreed with, I found anyway a couple of useful pieces of advice. Overall not recommended."
99,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17413971-jinkm,1,"I got this book from the library because I have problems reading another person's body language. However, from the first page I got the feeling this book wouldn't be for someone like me. I saw the other books the author's have written. Here is the list:Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read MapsWhy Men Lie and Women CryWhy Men Can Only do One Thing At A Time and Women Never Stop TalkingThe Little Book of Men and women In my opinion, it's obvious the authors probably subscribe to the belief that men and women are totally and inherently different. And that they probably also believe in inherent gender roles, which, again, in my opinion, is bollocks. But hey, I thought, let's not judge. People's opinions and beliefs evolve and everyone has questionable opinions. That doesn't mean they don't know what they are talking about when it come to body language. So, I decided to give it a try.Eleven pages in I see ""Body language is an outward reflection of a person's emotional condition""Now, as someone who others describe as very stoic and stone-faced and as someone who has trouble with expressing emotion, I found this to be a little narrow minded. I constantly have to explain to people that ""No, I am not angry, I am thinking."" ""No, I am not attacking you, I am trying to have a serious discussion with you, please ignore my angry looking eyeballs."" ""No I am not a serial killer, I just have a very intense face sometimes, okay?!"" XD However, I am willing to consider this is the case for most people and I came to learn about others, so I carry on!  Unfortunately, immediately below the above quote, as an illustrative image to show an example of body language, they inserted a conveniently angled picture of Prince Charles so that it looked like he was grasping a large-chested woman's breasts with the caption of ""Prince Charles finds a bosom buddy"". Now, I'm all for humor and recognize that it makes reading about scientific subjects easier to digest. However, I found this tasteless and inappropriate. Red flag #3. (And it wasn't even the only sexual innuendo :S) However x2 though, we don't require our 'experts' to have appropriate senses of humor, (NASA scientists as an example :D). They are there to make a point and instruct, not to tickle our funny bones SO, I read on. :/ (If you can't tell, I'm a little hard-headed and have trouble listening to my own intuition.) The Final Straw - Not knowing the definition of words- The authors say ""Women have an innate ability to pick up and decipher non verbal signals, as well as having an accurate eye for small details"" I disagree, but I've already decided to ignore their outdated gender opinions. Just in the next paragraph, though, they totally contradict themselves. The authors cite a Harvard study that showed that women have a greater ability to read emotions in situations. Okay, that is in line with what they said, BUT they go on to say in the very next sentence  that men in 'nurturing' careers, like art (what?), acting, and nursing, as well as gay men, scored as well as women. They then go on to say that women are so very good at reading emotions because they ""practice reading signals early"". Which to me, seems to be the exact opposite definition of 'innate'. That's a definite sign of a dodgy book. Now I have a logical reason to quit. Good, I quit. Best decision I've made today. I feel good about quitting. You can tell, because my stance is open and I'm smiling. No really, I'm smiling. It might only be slightly more curved than straight line, but it's a smile.  My recommendation: find a different book to read. One that is more up to date and perhaps is written by some one who is more interested in solid academics than telling crass jokes. Two thumbs down."

The authors, professionals with vast experience in business, use their professional experience, latest data and researches to, in a colloquial and brief language, expose to the general public importants tips to interpret behavior in the professional and personal situations. The book deals with meanings gestures offered by the eyes, hands, feet and other expressions and body parts. Moreover, it exposes how elements found in the environment can influence the course of a conversation: how, for example, the position of your chair in relation to the interviewer can assist you in gaining a place of employment or assist in selling a product or service. These tips are very important when you have the notion that the interlocutor form an opinion about the other in just 4 minutes of talking, appealing, unconsciously, much more to the visual attributes and gestures than the competencies inherent to the career or quality of the curriculum. In fact, you'll never get a second chance to make a good first impression.Although richly illustrated, the weak point of this simple language book is the lack of depth. The Definitive Guide to Body Language deal only with situations illustrating it without specifying or explain motivations, it is a behavioral manual. Let, therefore, gaps that can only be fulfilled if the reader looking for more technical books in the area. If the goal is get tips, this is a good book. But if the intention is to look hard into the study of body language, this is a book that can be considered only introductory.***Sinais pouco evidentesDeterminados grupos gestuais emitidos pelo corpo geram influências negativas ou positivas no inconsciente do interlocutor, esta é a tese defendida por Allan e Barbara Pease no livro Desvendando os segredos da linguagem corporal. Os autores, profissionais de vasta experiência no mundo empresarial, utilizam-se da sua vivência profissional, dados e mais recentes pesquisas para, numa linguagem coloquial e breve, passar para o grande público importantes dicas de interpretação e comportamento em situações no âmbito profissional e pessoal.O livro trata de significados gestuais oferecidos pelos olhos, mãos, pés entre outras expressões e partes do corpo. Além disso, expõem como os elementos encontrados no ambiente podem influenciar nos rumos de uma conversa: o quanto, por exemplo, a posição de sua cadeira em relação ao entrevistador pode auxiliá-lo na conquista de uma vaga de emprego ou auxiliá-lo na venda de um serviço/produto.Essas dicas são muito importantes quando se tem a noção de que o interlocutor forma uma opinião sobre o outro em apenas 4 minutos de conversa, apelando, inconscientemente, muito mais para os atributos visuais do que para as competências imanentes à carreira profissional ou qualidade do currículo. De fato, a primeira impressão muitas vezes é a que fica.Embora ricamente ilustrado, o ponto fraco deste livro de simples linguagem está na falta de profundidade. Desvendando os segredos da linguagem corporal limita-se a exemplificar situações sem especificar ou explicar motivações, trata-se de um manual comportamental. Deixa, por isso, lacunas que só podem ser preenchidas se o leitor procurar por livros mais técnicos dentro da área. Se o objetivo é captar dicas, este é um bom livro. Mas se a intenção é debruçar-se sobre o estudo da linguagem corporal, este é um livro que pode ser considerado apenas introdutório. "
101,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36401880-sagar-acharya,5,"By an occasional visit to my uncle's place, I chose this book amongst many fantastic books he has, and it was worth it.It explains how a person's emotions can be judged by understanding his body gestures and how we can interpret a scenario better by taking into account some non-verbal aspects.We sometimes subconsciously feel in different way, awkwardness, confidence and other feelings. He brings the different aspects into conscious thinking of how these things developed by evolution and have been hardwired into brain to interpret.I cannot emphasize more on how fantastic book it was! It has helped me immensely, especially the courtship gestures!"
102,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95025914-wilmington,2,"I have read and enjoyed Allan and Barbara Pease's other bestsellers Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps and Why Men Lie and Women Cry: How to Get What You Want Out of Life by Asking and therefore was really looking forward to reading this book. It was quite a disappointment. Half of the body language described seems perfectly obvious to me. Some of the explanations were useful, but others were dubious or downright mistaken.It didn't start well when on page 7 the caption under Schwarzenegger showing the thumb up explained that it meant five in Japan, which is utterly false. I can forgive one mistake, but not dozens, and the book is filled with them. Here are other examples.On p. 18-19, the authors say that shaking the head from side to side to indicate 'no' is universal. Are they forgetting that in India it means 'yes' ? Over one billion people is not a minor exception.On p. 20, under the title Universal Gestures, the first example is the shoulder shrug to show that a person doesn't know or doesn't understand. In France it means that the person doesn't care or that it can't be helped. Perhaps their meaning of universal is not the one universally understood by English speakers ?On p. 109-110, they say that figures E and F are insults in Japan, and figure L means 5 in Japan and 1 in (continental) Europe. None of that is true.On the next page, under 'Why We are All Becoming American', they say that the middle finger raised is originally an American insult that became adopted in other countries because of American TV and movies. It actually originated in Ancient Greece and Rome and has been used in many European countries (especially Mediterranean ones) for a very long time. The authors claim that the American Ring gesture to mean OK is now recognised in many countries due to American influence. It may be recognised, but is hardly ever used in most of Europe and Asia, where it often has a different meaning. They carry on with the words for toilet becoming Americanised, but what does this have to do with body language ? It is also a fallacy, since most speakers of English today are non-native speakers, and Europeans are far more likely to use the word 'toilet' than 'bathroom' because the word 'toilet' exists in most European languages.On p.114, they claim that the French greet each others with a double kiss and the Belgians with a triple kiss. The truth is that the number varies from one to five in France, depending on the region and generation. In Belgium it is only once among French speakers, and usually none among Dutch speakers like in Britain.On p.119, they explain that the American OK sign means zero in France and money in Japan, but they are not done the same way and therefore cannot be misunderstood easily. The OK sign is done with the three other fingers open (pointing up). The French zero is done with the middle to little fingers closed, aligned on the index finger. The Japanese zero is done with the hand placed horizontally, open fingers pointing sideways, and the palm pointing towards the body.On p. 171, we read that the Japanese are the only ones that don't 'eyebrow flash'. Again it's not true. That's an East Asian thing.After the ignorance of other cultures come the scientific errors. On p. 171, the authors say that, contrarily to humans, ""apes lack eye-whites, which means that their prey don't know where the ape is looking or whether they have been spotted, giving the ape a greater chance of hunting success."" Really ? It's a surprising theory to say the least, since all apes aside from humans, and all monkeys are vegetarian.I also wonder what they mean when on p.192 they write ""by animals, birds, fish and primates"". Animals sound redundant here.In the section of personal space (p.193), they explain that lions have a territorial space of 30 miles or more, but that lions raised in captivity have a personal space of only several yards. They confuse personal space (safe distance between two individuals, even of the same family) and the lion's hunting territory, which isn't personal but used by all the lionesses (as it is the females that hunt) belong to the same clan. They make the same confusion afterwards by mentioning countries, cities and other non-personal boundaries. It's sounds highly unscientific and unprofessional on the authors' part to make such a simplification on a book about body language.I wasn't happier to read on the next page that they were going to compare the personal space radius in (and I quote) ""Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, North America, Northern Europe, Scandinavia, Canada or anywhere a culture is 'Westernised' such as Singapore, Guam or Iceland"". Wow ! What's the point of saying Great Britain and Scandinavia is they say Northern Europe ? Why say North America and Canada ? But much worse, why on earth would they consider that Iceland is not part of Scandinavia and believe it is not a Western country but a Westernised one like Singapore ? Do they have any idea of how uneducated that sounds ? On p.202 they insist again on saying ""Northern Europeans and Scandinavians"" as if Scandinavians weren't Northern Europeans. It might be useful for them to look at a world map some time.On p.199, trying to justify that people become more aggressive when their personal space is invaded, the authors claim that ""areas that have the highest human population density also have the highest crime and violence rates"". This is another factual mistake. Countries with very high population densities like Japan, the Netherlands, England, or even India, tend to be more peaceful and have lower crime rates than sparsely populated countries like most of Africa or South America, or even the USA.On p.268, Mr and Mrs Pease claim that ""Twice as many women smoke as men"". This is completely wrong. The WHO data shows that in average, worldwide, smoking is five times as prevalent among men than women. There is hardly any country where women smoke more than men, and in some Muslim countries the percentage of smoking men is one hundred times higher than for women (for example in Morocco and Algeria).After the factual mistakes come the dubious theories. On p.260-1, we read that one of the most common forms of mirroring is yawning, and that ""It was one thought that the purpose of yawning was to oxygenate the body but we now know that it's a form of mirroring that serves to create a rapport with others and to avoid aggression"". The problem with this theory is that yawning is most commonly done when people are alone or with close relatives at home, and therefore doesn't serve to avoid aggression.I also want to add that the quiz at the end of the book is terrible. The pictures are very unclear and it's hard to find all the signals even after reading the descriptions."
103,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/538517-alissa-thorne,4,"I found this book so useful, I decided to listen to it twice in a row.* When it became clear that much of the book was going to be a lengthy list of various subtle body language queues, I groaned at what I anticipated would be a lot of rote memorization. As it turned out, since body language is so tied up with emotions, almost all of the indicators were immediately recognizable. More importantly, they matched with an emotional understanding of what it feels like when exhibiting that indicator, and it feels like when I see others. This made information easy to absorb, and once it did it stuck.The most thought provoking concept in this book is what I mentioned earlier--emotional state and body language are mirrors of one another. That is to say, not only is your body language an expression of your emotion, but your feelings can be affected by changing your physical expressions. One of the more striking examples of this is the idea that if someone has a negative attitude, expressed with crossed arms, you can influence their emotional openness by handing them a pen or cup of coffee, requiring that they uncross their arms.So far, I am primarily becoming more aware of my own body language rather than reading others. That's fine by me--not only is it useful to know what messages you are subconsciousness sending others, it also makes me more aware of my own emotional state.One questionable bit about this book--it makes heavy use of bold claims about gender and other topics that contradict common wisdom. I don't know how supported these claims are, but I take much of the alleged science with a grain of salt.* In part, this is because I kept spacing out or losing my place, so I know I was missing bits."
104,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22787654-justin,4,"Nonverbal signals constitutes the majority of communication, and often gets overlooked. In any social aspect of life, being able to recognize and use knowledge of body language to our favor can make a difference. Allan and Barbara Pease use their business and research backgrounds to uncover a general overview of body language for use in personal and professional situations. They cover hands,arms, smiles and laguther, cultural differences, hand and thumb gestures, evaluation and deceit signals, eye signals, personal space, legs, thirteen most common gestures, mirroring, signals of cigarettes, glasses and makeup, how the body points, courtship/attraction signals, ownership/territory/height signals, seating arrangements, and interviews/office politics. They also include an assessment at the end. Reading this book brought to light many things I already knew, but never thought about, and gestures I never encountered. I enjoyed the straightforward read, and the helpful visuals accompanying the explanations. I would've preferred less emphasis on business when they assumed in several sections you're persuading someone to make a sale, and more on social situations though much of it is applicable. Also they cover gender differences quite a bit which is useful and link it to biology which I found interesting. Still from a social perspective it's helpful to keep in mind the varieties of each genders' differences rather than to accept the general assumption. That said, I also enjoyed the research studies cited.Overall, this book is a great resource for anyone looking to improve their communication and relationships personal or professional, and especially those in helping/people professions."
105,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86966257-luana,5,"Bought this book at an airport years ago but never read it until now. Very interesting and probably useful if you’re a business person.I tried some of it out of curiosity, I’m not sure how accurate this is."
106,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1171505-princely,4,"I felt that this book was good, and had accurate things to say about WESTERN gestures. However, I live in Japan, and none of the quote *offensive* gestures mean anything to anyone under thirty five. The business relations section for Japanese was suprisingly off. I mean, every time someone bows, they inspect your shoes? Most of the folks I meet here change from their outside, nice shoes into crappy indoor ones, so everyone's shoes look kind of beaten up when we meet everyone inside :). I'm more suprised at the fact that they didn't research carefully or emphasize more useful Japanese mannerisms, that it is far harder to tell what the Japanese are thinking through body language. They behave differently than Westerners, and many body cues, such as hand gestures, don't apply. The feet gestures, however, are dead on. I find that section useful, but then again it was generally applicable to everybody. As for the book's style, of course, it could have been ghostwritten- it lacked a personal flavor for me that it would have had with an original author. Despite my complaints about its Japanese culture section and writing style, I still give this book a high score. I just found the information fascinating. So many things are being hidden by folks when they talk, but not when they move...it simply blows my mind."
107,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3914724-david,4,"When I was younger, I didn't really pay much attention to body language. At the time I didn't find it important; but in both personal and professional relationships, body language is crucial in understanding how the other person feels. This book provides a good overview of common body language gestures. I've been told by some, that reading body language can be contradictory. One sign another gives doesn't mean that's how they really feel. Luckily, this book reinforces this cautionary statement by teaching to read body language in clusters and to keep in mind the context in which the body language is given.This book is pretty well laid out in terms of grouping gestures by body part which are by chapter. It makes quick reference a little easier - although I don't feel this book is intended for a reference book. The read itself is really quite quick and easy. Toward the end, there's a self-test chapter to help solidify the knowledgeThe reason why I gave this book one 4 stars is because in some ways, a ""quick guide"" would have been nice. A quick study guide in this only means a smalll chapter recapping all the gestures discussed. A reference, if you will. That could be used to increase the utility of the book to a study guide too."

I bought this book from Amazon and read it before the book by Joe Navarro (also on my list)The authors appear to be sales/marketing people and conduct workshops and trainings on reading body language. There seems to be a bias such as ""this behavior equals this meaning."" I have a problem with this simplistic type of interpretation. However, I try to glean the basic underlying concepts and blend that with my own understanding of body language. There is some interesting information in the book. Since reading this book, I've tried to be more observant of people and their body language, but I tell you it's hard. I tend to lapse into my old ways of looking at the world.Anyway, some interesting information here, some of which I have found interesting.

This book made me understand many things about body language that i've never known before to the extent where i started reading & highlighting almost everything! I found it extremely helpful,whether a person is too sure while stating his lie his body can give everything away starting from his eyes to his nose and his arm movements. I definitely would give this book 5 stars just because it doesn't sound 'sciency'at all,it was a really fun & humorous read filled with facts & helpful tips!

This book touches on human beings body language, such as how we cross our legs, touch our face, put things to our mouth such as pen chewing, etc. It decodes even the way we talk with our hands and what it means. There is some info too on hand gestures that the western world uses that offends in other countries.

Topics include the basics of body language, and then to specific elements including hand and arm movement and gestures, facial expressions, eye signals, leg and body positioning.

One of the main issues I have with this book is that some of the authors interpretations of various studies are based on their own opinions, but stated as fact; which had me thinking, ""how did you come to that conclusion?"" Another issue that I found a bit annoying is the fact that the authors seem to shamelessly promote other books they have published.

Body Language explores the subtle physical signs we let out and interprets them in sweeping ways, often using examples (public figures like Bill Clinton) to nail down points. And not only limited to body language, A. Pease also jabs in the usage of external accessories such as spectacles which I found amusing and also enlightening. The sitting arrangement in a meeting, how one positions their arms, where your foot points; these are among the different subject areas this book sheds light on."

The pictograms,they help a person to understand the idea and analyze body language before they help the reader to translate the situation and analyzed own style.

I think parts are research based but claims like most women are not good at running and accountants don't have good social skills took away some of the book's credibility in my eyes not to mention somewhat insulted me. However, it is a light read, written without a serious tone so it is still worth reading in my opinion."

125,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91977885-michael,4,"Body language is an outward reflection of a person's emotional condition. It's about matching what you see and hear in the environment in which it all happens and drawing a probable conclusion. However, most people only see the things they think they are seeing. Early research on communication shows that the total impact of a message is about 7% for spoken words and 38% for vocal, i.e., the voice's tone and 55% for non-verbal. This means that words are used primarily for conveying information and data. For example, a study done between 1970-80 revealed that a person with a strong argument usually wins in a phone conversation. However, in the round table encounter 60 to 80 percent accounts for body language, and usually, the people make initial impressions within 4 minutes of the conversation.According to the book, some people, especially women's, are more perceptive than men - 'women's intuition.' Being perceptive means able to spot the contradictions between someone's words and body language. When we say we have a hunch or gut feeling, we usually mean that their words and body language do not much. And overall, women are good at picking them. In addition, it is usually easy to read children than adults. This could be that adults have less muscle tone in the face. An interesting fact about body language is that it is easy to misread it, yet it is hard to fake it.While talking about body language, it's important to note that it can be different across different cultures, though some body languages like nodding the head, shoulder shrug, smiling are inborn and are usually the same across cultures. For accurately reading body language, the book presents 3 rules.	1. The reading of gestures should be in clusters. This is to mean that an individual gesture might not give or mislead. Gestures are words, and clusters are sentences in body language. To read them correctly, it needs at least three testers in a match. 	2. Look for congruence between gesture clusters and verbal language. If the gestures and the verbal language do not much, women tend to take the gestures. 	3. Gestures should be read in the context. For example, a person sitting in a cold bus waiting with hands crossed (defensive) and chin down (critical/hostile) should not be interpreted negatively.The HandsPalms of a hand are vocal cords of body language because they did more talking than any other body parts. Three are 3 main palm command testers	▪ Palm Up : is a used as a submissive non-threatening gesture.	▪ Palm Down : shows immediate authority.	▪ Palm Closed : shows the speaker figuratively beats his listeners to submission.Fingers also play a role, where a pointing finger gives negative feelings. Also, squeezing your finger into your thumb to make an OK gesture while giving public speech is considered authoritative, but not aggressive.Handshakes can also be used to show dominance- down Palm, submission-up Palm, and equality-vertical.While encountering power player giving down Palm the following two techniques help to disarm. 	1. Step into the left foot first and then move the right foot ahead of the left foot, then put the left foot again in the same position as the right foot. Practically this might be hard to use since most right-handed people tend to step their right leg first but helps a great deal because you are invading their private space. 	2. While a person presents a Palm up position, then put your left hand over his right to form a double handler and straighten the handshake. Also, while posing for a photo with a handshake, its always good to be on the right side as it gives a Palm down advantage. Touching while shaking hands, with the other hand, creates a powerful result. When you meet someone new and shake hands, extend your left arm, give a light touch on elbow or hand as you shake, and repeat their name to confirm you heard it correctly. Facial SmilesNatural smiles produce characteristic wrinkles around the eyes. The fleshy part of the eye between the eyebrow and the eyelid moves downward, and the end of the eyebrows dip slightly with open mouth for true similes. False smiles only pull back the mouth. Smiling attracts people and signifies a submission signal. Also, laughing simulates the body's natural pain killers and feel good enhancers, like the endorphins, helping relieve stress and heal the body. Thus is used as a therapy in hospitals. People who have trouble laughing at the tough things in life often turn to drugs and alcohol to achieve the same feeling that endorphin induced laughter produces.The 5 common types of smiles include: 1. The Tight-lipped Smile : is a kind that stretches the mouse tightly across the face to form a straight line concealing the teeth. This smile sends the message that the similer has withheld opinions or attitudes that will not be shared with you.  2. Twisted smile : is another kind where it shows opposite emotions on each side of the face, one happy one angry. This smile show sarcasm in the western world. 3. Drop-Jaw Smile : is when the lower jaw is dropped to show the person is laughing or playful. 4. Sideway looking up smile  is a playful and secretive pose that affects both genders. Its orientation is, head turned down and away while looking up with a tight-lipped smile. 5. Permanent Smirk is always smiling that everyone wonders what you have been up to.Laughing is more than 30 times as likely to occurs in participants in a social situation than in a solitary setting. This shows that laughing has less to do with jokes and funny stories and more to do with building relationships. Thus people tend to laugh more and longer in a social situation than each will last alone. Women will find a person that makes her laugh more attractive.Arm SignalsAny crossing of the arms in front of the body is perceived as unfavorable. By folding arms, a barrier is formed, i.e., unconscious attempt to block out what we perceive as a threat or undesirable circumstance. When a person has a nervous, negative, or defensive attitude, it will be manifested by folding the hands. Thus, it useful to avoid crossing your arms under any circumstances unless your intention is to show you don't agree or don't want to participate.Types of crossed arms are:	▪ The universal cross arms on the chest to show its defensive. So while giving speeches, if most of the listeners are crossing their arms, the speech needs to be turned to a kind where it turns to a receptive position. On another way to break this is to give the listeners something to hold in their hands like a notebook and pen. It's also good to use arm chaired to avoid people sitting this way, which in turn blocks their listening. 	▪ Fist Clenched Arm crossed shows hostility as well as defensiveness. A verbal or physical attack could happen if it is combined with a tight-lipped simile or clenched teeth and red face.	▪ Double Arm Grip is a self hugging position that shows a negative restrained attitude. It can be seen by doctors in the waiting room, first-time travelers on air. It depicts the person is feeling insecure and not buying what you are selling.	▪ Thumbs up cross arm shows defensiveness with a self-confident attitude. 	▪ Broken zipper position is used by men to protect their vulnerable area. It creates the feeling of having someone else holding your hand. Women's take hugging themselves position where one arm hung while the other takes hold or touches the other arm.	▪ Cuff Link Adjust is used by celebrities to disguise their nervousness.Hand and Thumb GesturesHumans have 27 small bones and dozens of tiny muscles to move the joints. There are more nerve connections between the hands and the brain than in any other part of the body. Because of that, hands can tell what is the person is thinking more easily. The common hand gestures include:	▪ Rubbing palms together to show positive expectancy. If it is slow, it looks sneaky or devious, but the faster shows excitement. 	▪ Thumb fingertip rub to show gesture about money. 	▪ Clenched hands placed centered to the face elbows resting to the desk while sitting shows frustration, restrained anxious or negative attitude. If placed on the desk centered to the body while elbows are at the same level, they show the same attitude with less degree and the less with standing position. 	▪ The Steeple used by superior to subordinate interaction and indicates a confident or self-assured attitude. As a general rule, this gesture should be avoided when you want to be persuasive or win others person confidence as it can sometimes be read as smugness. The Lowered steeple, hands-on thighs can be used to show assurance. 	▪ Face platter is used by ladies to show their faces, usually presenting themselves for a man. 	▪ Hands in the back with Palm-in-Palm show superiority and confidence. The gripping hand wrist shows frustration and anger. The higher it's up, the more the person is frustrated. 	▪ Thumps protrude is a sign of power authority. They can be in Arms folded with thumb us pointing upwards and thumbs out from the pocket.Evaluation and Deceit SignalsLying is the oil that greases our interactions with others and let us maintain friendly social relationships. Such are called White Lies because their goals are to make others feel comfortable instead of telling them the cold hard truth. Malicious Lies are, however, deliberate lies that set out to deceive another for personal benefit. When children lie, they use the hand to face gesture, i.e., putting the hand on the face. For adults, their umber of gulps of saliva increases, which is especially noticeable for a man as he has Adam apples. The following are the eight most common lying gestures. 1. The mouse cover : the hands cover the mouth as the brain subconsciously instructs it to try to suppress the deceitful words that are being said. While you are talking, if someone covers their mouse, it shows that they feel you are hiding something.  2. The nose touch : The human nose expands with blood during lying. This is followed by nose touching repossessed.  3. Itchy nose : is also a response like a nose touch that is used to disguise own deceit words or listener who doubts the speaker's words.  4. Eye rub : is the brain attempt to block it the deceit doubt or distasteful thing it sees, or to avoid having to look at the face of the person who is being lied to.  5. The Ear grab : is a signal that says, 'I don't want to hear it.' It is also a signal that the person heard enough and want to speak.  6. The Neck Scratch : is a gesture that shows doubt or uncertainty and is characteristic of the person to say, I'm not sure I agree. 7. The Collar Pull : is another gesture of telling lies.  8. Fingers in the mouse is an outward indication of an inner need for assurance, so giving a node guarantees a positive move. Evaluations gestures are shown by a closed hand resting on the chin or cheek, often the index finger pointing upward. Rubbing the back of the neck is also another reaction caused by feeling frustrated or fearful. Slapping the back of the neck tells your are being pain-in-the-neck for the issue while slapping the forehead shows reminding the forgotten thing and not intimidated by you mentioning it.Eye SignalsThe eyes are the most revealing and accurate of all human communication signals because they work independently of conscious control. In general, pupils will dilate or contract as your attitude and mood change from positive to negative and vice versa. When someone becomes excited, their pupils can dilate to up to four times their original size. Conversely, an angry, negative mood causes the pupils to contract to what is commonly known as beady little eyes.When people are lying, they are likely to dramatically increase their blinking rate, an unconscious attempt by the person's brain to block you from their sight because they have become bored or disinterested or feel superior to you. In such scenarios, to rattle the person while taking extended blink, quickly step a pace to your left or right.There are three geographical areas-gazing kinds, people look upon while talking to each other. 1. The social gaze : looks on the triangular area on the other persons face that is between the two eyes and noise. This gaze perceived as non-aggressive. 2. The Intimate gaze : looks at the lower body first to establish what sex it is and up between the eyes and below the chin. Women's has a wider peripheral vision that helps her to look at top to bottom while looking at the face. However, because of male tunnel vision, he needs to gaze up and down in a very obvious way. This is the reason why men are accused of ogling women's body at close range though research shows that women do more of it than men. 3. The Power gaze : looks at the triangular area between the eye and middle of the forehead. This gaze is used to treat a person who intimidates or the person you want to make shut up.Other gaze form, The power stare, gives more authority. It is done by looking at the person in narrow eyelids and without blinking. To perform this, move your eyeballs first and then let your head follow while making your shoulders remain still.Another interesting thing about the eyes is the movement they follow while trying to remember something. If a person recalls something that they saw, their eyes will move upward. If they recall something, they heard- they look to the side and tilt their head as if they are listening. If they are recalling a feeling or emotion they'll look down and to the right. And when they are talking to themselves, they look down and to the left.To keep control of where a person is looking while showing something, use a pen to point to the presentation and, at the same time, verbalize what he sees. Next, lift the pen from the presentation and hold it between his eyes and your eyes.continued in the comment section..."

127,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45626469-hadi-abedini,5,"It's really a definitive book about body language. simple and clear writing and perfect examples makes it easy to understand.as told in book, we should not interpret single gestures. gestures should be interpreted in clusters and this book could not cover this important aspect. I think another book should be appended so that we can analyse different real situations and put together all we know about body language in practice."
128,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71950414-mariagiulia,2,"A poorly written, not that accurate, superficial and even slightly sexist body language manual that I struggled to finish. What stopped me from giving it only 1 star is that despite the many things I disagreed with, I found anyway a couple of useful pieces of advice. Overall not recommended."
129,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17413971-jinkm,1,"I got this book from the library because I have problems reading another person's body language. However, from the first page I got the feeling this book wouldn't be for someone like me. I saw the other books the author's have written. Here is the list:Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read MapsWhy Men Lie and Women CryWhy Men Can Only do One Thing At A Time and Women Never Stop TalkingThe Little Book of Men and women In my opinion, it's obvious the authors probably subscribe to the belief that men and women are totally and inherently different. And that they probably also believe in inherent gender roles, which, again, in my opinion, is bollocks. But hey, I thought, let's not judge. People's opinions and beliefs evolve and everyone has questionable opinions. That doesn't mean they don't know what they are talking about when it come to body language. So, I decided to give it a try.Eleven pages in I see ""Body language is an outward reflection of a person's emotional condition""Now, as someone who others describe as very stoic and stone-faced and as someone who has trouble with expressing emotion, I found this to be a little narrow minded. I constantly have to explain to people that ""No, I am not angry, I am thinking."" ""No, I am not attacking you, I am trying to have a serious discussion with you, please ignore my angry looking eyeballs."" ""No I am not a serial killer, I just have a very intense face sometimes, okay?!"" XD However, I am willing to consider this is the case for most people and I came to learn about others, so I carry on!  Unfortunately, immediately below the above quote, as an illustrative image to show an example of body language, they inserted a conveniently angled picture of Prince Charles so that it looked like he was grasping a large-chested woman's breasts with the caption of ""Prince Charles finds a bosom buddy"". Now, I'm all for humor and recognize that it makes reading about scientific subjects easier to digest. However, I found this tasteless and inappropriate. Red flag #3. (And it wasn't even the only sexual innuendo :S) However x2 though, we don't require our 'experts' to have appropriate senses of humor, (NASA scientists as an example :D). They are there to make a point and instruct, not to tickle our funny bones SO, I read on. :/ (If you can't tell, I'm a little hard-headed and have trouble listening to my own intuition.) The Final Straw - Not knowing the definition of words- The authors say ""Women have an innate ability to pick up and decipher non verbal signals, as well as having an accurate eye for small details"" I disagree, but I've already decided to ignore their outdated gender opinions. Just in the next paragraph, though, they totally contradict themselves. The authors cite a Harvard study that showed that women have a greater ability to read emotions in situations. Okay, that is in line with what they said, BUT they go on to say in the very next sentence  that men in 'nurturing' careers, like art (what?), acting, and nursing, as well as gay men, scored as well as women. They then go on to say that women are so very good at reading emotions because they ""practice reading signals early"". Which to me, seems to be the exact opposite definition of 'innate'. That's a definite sign of a dodgy book. Now I have a logical reason to quit. Good, I quit. Best decision I've made today. I feel good about quitting. You can tell, because my stance is open and I'm smiling. No really, I'm smiling. It might only be slightly more curved than straight line, but it's a smile.  My recommendation: find a different book to read. One that is more up to date and perhaps is written by some one who is more interested in solid academics than telling crass jokes. Two thumbs down."

The authors, professionals with vast experience in business, use their professional experience, latest data and researches to, in a colloquial and brief language, expose to the general public importants tips to interpret behavior in the professional and personal situations. The book deals with meanings gestures offered by the eyes, hands, feet and other expressions and body parts. Moreover, it exposes how elements found in the environment can influence the course of a conversation: how, for example, the position of your chair in relation to the interviewer can assist you in gaining a place of employment or assist in selling a product or service. These tips are very important when you have the notion that the interlocutor form an opinion about the other in just 4 minutes of talking, appealing, unconsciously, much more to the visual attributes and gestures than the competencies inherent to the career or quality of the curriculum. In fact, you'll never get a second chance to make a good first impression.Although richly illustrated, the weak point of this simple language book is the lack of depth. The Definitive Guide to Body Language deal only with situations illustrating it without specifying or explain motivations, it is a behavioral manual. Let, therefore, gaps that can only be fulfilled if the reader looking for more technical books in the area. If the goal is get tips, this is a good book. But if the intention is to look hard into the study of body language, this is a book that can be considered only introductory.***Sinais pouco evidentesDeterminados grupos gestuais emitidos pelo corpo geram influências negativas ou positivas no inconsciente do interlocutor, esta é a tese defendida por Allan e Barbara Pease no livro Desvendando os segredos da linguagem corporal. Os autores, profissionais de vasta experiência no mundo empresarial, utilizam-se da sua vivência profissional, dados e mais recentes pesquisas para, numa linguagem coloquial e breve, passar para o grande público importantes dicas de interpretação e comportamento em situações no âmbito profissional e pessoal.O livro trata de significados gestuais oferecidos pelos olhos, mãos, pés entre outras expressões e partes do corpo. Além disso, expõem como os elementos encontrados no ambiente podem influenciar nos rumos de uma conversa: o quanto, por exemplo, a posição de sua cadeira em relação ao entrevistador pode auxiliá-lo na conquista de uma vaga de emprego ou auxiliá-lo na venda de um serviço/produto.Essas dicas são muito importantes quando se tem a noção de que o interlocutor forma uma opinião sobre o outro em apenas 4 minutos de conversa, apelando, inconscientemente, muito mais para os atributos visuais do que para as competências imanentes à carreira profissional ou qualidade do currículo. De fato, a primeira impressão muitas vezes é a que fica.Embora ricamente ilustrado, o ponto fraco deste livro de simples linguagem está na falta de profundidade. Desvendando os segredos da linguagem corporal limita-se a exemplificar situações sem especificar ou explicar motivações, trata-se de um manual comportamental. Deixa, por isso, lacunas que só podem ser preenchidas se o leitor procurar por livros mais técnicos dentro da área. Se o objetivo é captar dicas, este é um bom livro. Mas se a intenção é debruçar-se sobre o estudo da linguagem corporal, este é um livro que pode ser considerado apenas introdutório. "
131,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36401880-sagar-acharya,5,"By an occasional visit to my uncle's place, I chose this book amongst many fantastic books he has, and it was worth it.It explains how a person's emotions can be judged by understanding his body gestures and how we can interpret a scenario better by taking into account some non-verbal aspects.We sometimes subconsciously feel in different way, awkwardness, confidence and other feelings. He brings the different aspects into conscious thinking of how these things developed by evolution and have been hardwired into brain to interpret.I cannot emphasize more on how fantastic book it was! It has helped me immensely, especially the courtship gestures!"
132,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95025914-wilmington,2,"I have read and enjoyed Allan and Barbara Pease's other bestsellers Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps and Why Men Lie and Women Cry: How to Get What You Want Out of Life by Asking and therefore was really looking forward to reading this book. It was quite a disappointment. Half of the body language described seems perfectly obvious to me. Some of the explanations were useful, but others were dubious or downright mistaken.It didn't start well when on page 7 the caption under Schwarzenegger showing the thumb up explained that it meant five in Japan, which is utterly false. I can forgive one mistake, but not dozens, and the book is filled with them. Here are other examples.On p. 18-19, the authors say that shaking the head from side to side to indicate 'no' is universal. Are they forgetting that in India it means 'yes' ? Over one billion people is not a minor exception.On p. 20, under the title Universal Gestures, the first example is the shoulder shrug to show that a person doesn't know or doesn't understand. In France it means that the person doesn't care or that it can't be helped. Perhaps their meaning of universal is not the one universally understood by English speakers ?On p. 109-110, they say that figures E and F are insults in Japan, and figure L means 5 in Japan and 1 in (continental) Europe. None of that is true.On the next page, under 'Why We are All Becoming American', they say that the middle finger raised is originally an American insult that became adopted in other countries because of American TV and movies. It actually originated in Ancient Greece and Rome and has been used in many European countries (especially Mediterranean ones) for a very long time. The authors claim that the American Ring gesture to mean OK is now recognised in many countries due to American influence. It may be recognised, but is hardly ever used in most of Europe and Asia, where it often has a different meaning. They carry on with the words for toilet becoming Americanised, but what does this have to do with body language ? It is also a fallacy, since most speakers of English today are non-native speakers, and Europeans are far more likely to use the word 'toilet' than 'bathroom' because the word 'toilet' exists in most European languages.On p.114, they claim that the French greet each others with a double kiss and the Belgians with a triple kiss. The truth is that the number varies from one to five in France, depending on the region and generation. In Belgium it is only once among French speakers, and usually none among Dutch speakers like in Britain.On p.119, they explain that the American OK sign means zero in France and money in Japan, but they are not done the same way and therefore cannot be misunderstood easily. The OK sign is done with the three other fingers open (pointing up). The French zero is done with the middle to little fingers closed, aligned on the index finger. The Japanese zero is done with the hand placed horizontally, open fingers pointing sideways, and the palm pointing towards the body.On p. 171, we read that the Japanese are the only ones that don't 'eyebrow flash'. Again it's not true. That's an East Asian thing.After the ignorance of other cultures come the scientific errors. On p. 171, the authors say that, contrarily to humans, ""apes lack eye-whites, which means that their prey don't know where the ape is looking or whether they have been spotted, giving the ape a greater chance of hunting success."" Really ? It's a surprising theory to say the least, since all apes aside from humans, and all monkeys are vegetarian.I also wonder what they mean when on p.192 they write ""by animals, birds, fish and primates"". Animals sound redundant here.In the section of personal space (p.193), they explain that lions have a territorial space of 30 miles or more, but that lions raised in captivity have a personal space of only several yards. They confuse personal space (safe distance between two individuals, even of the same family) and the lion's hunting territory, which isn't personal but used by all the lionesses (as it is the females that hunt) belong to the same clan. They make the same confusion afterwards by mentioning countries, cities and other non-personal boundaries. It's sounds highly unscientific and unprofessional on the authors' part to make such a simplification on a book about body language.I wasn't happier to read on the next page that they were going to compare the personal space radius in (and I quote) ""Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, North America, Northern Europe, Scandinavia, Canada or anywhere a culture is 'Westernised' such as Singapore, Guam or Iceland"". Wow ! What's the point of saying Great Britain and Scandinavia is they say Northern Europe ? Why say North America and Canada ? But much worse, why on earth would they consider that Iceland is not part of Scandinavia and believe it is not a Western country but a Westernised one like Singapore ? Do they have any idea of how uneducated that sounds ? On p.202 they insist again on saying ""Northern Europeans and Scandinavians"" as if Scandinavians weren't Northern Europeans. It might be useful for them to look at a world map some time.On p.199, trying to justify that people become more aggressive when their personal space is invaded, the authors claim that ""areas that have the highest human population density also have the highest crime and violence rates"". This is another factual mistake. Countries with very high population densities like Japan, the Netherlands, England, or even India, tend to be more peaceful and have lower crime rates than sparsely populated countries like most of Africa or South America, or even the USA.On p.268, Mr and Mrs Pease claim that ""Twice as many women smoke as men"". This is completely wrong. The WHO data shows that in average, worldwide, smoking is five times as prevalent among men than women. There is hardly any country where women smoke more than men, and in some Muslim countries the percentage of smoking men is one hundred times higher than for women (for example in Morocco and Algeria).After the factual mistakes come the dubious theories. On p.260-1, we read that one of the most common forms of mirroring is yawning, and that ""It was one thought that the purpose of yawning was to oxygenate the body but we now know that it's a form of mirroring that serves to create a rapport with others and to avoid aggression"". The problem with this theory is that yawning is most commonly done when people are alone or with close relatives at home, and therefore doesn't serve to avoid aggression.I also want to add that the quiz at the end of the book is terrible. The pictures are very unclear and it's hard to find all the signals even after reading the descriptions."
133,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/538517-alissa-thorne,4,"I found this book so useful, I decided to listen to it twice in a row.* When it became clear that much of the book was going to be a lengthy list of various subtle body language queues, I groaned at what I anticipated would be a lot of rote memorization. As it turned out, since body language is so tied up with emotions, almost all of the indicators were immediately recognizable. More importantly, they matched with an emotional understanding of what it feels like when exhibiting that indicator, and it feels like when I see others. This made information easy to absorb, and once it did it stuck.The most thought provoking concept in this book is what I mentioned earlier--emotional state and body language are mirrors of one another. That is to say, not only is your body language an expression of your emotion, but your feelings can be affected by changing your physical expressions. One of the more striking examples of this is the idea that if someone has a negative attitude, expressed with crossed arms, you can influence their emotional openness by handing them a pen or cup of coffee, requiring that they uncross their arms.So far, I am primarily becoming more aware of my own body language rather than reading others. That's fine by me--not only is it useful to know what messages you are subconsciousness sending others, it also makes me more aware of my own emotional state.One questionable bit about this book--it makes heavy use of bold claims about gender and other topics that contradict common wisdom. I don't know how supported these claims are, but I take much of the alleged science with a grain of salt.* In part, this is because I kept spacing out or losing my place, so I know I was missing bits."
134,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22787654-justin,4,"Nonverbal signals constitutes the majority of communication, and often gets overlooked. In any social aspect of life, being able to recognize and use knowledge of body language to our favor can make a difference. Allan and Barbara Pease use their business and research backgrounds to uncover a general overview of body language for use in personal and professional situations. They cover hands,arms, smiles and laguther, cultural differences, hand and thumb gestures, evaluation and deceit signals, eye signals, personal space, legs, thirteen most common gestures, mirroring, signals of cigarettes, glasses and makeup, how the body points, courtship/attraction signals, ownership/territory/height signals, seating arrangements, and interviews/office politics. They also include an assessment at the end. Reading this book brought to light many things I already knew, but never thought about, and gestures I never encountered. I enjoyed the straightforward read, and the helpful visuals accompanying the explanations. I would've preferred less emphasis on business when they assumed in several sections you're persuading someone to make a sale, and more on social situations though much of it is applicable. Also they cover gender differences quite a bit which is useful and link it to biology which I found interesting. Still from a social perspective it's helpful to keep in mind the varieties of each genders' differences rather than to accept the general assumption. That said, I also enjoyed the research studies cited.Overall, this book is a great resource for anyone looking to improve their communication and relationships personal or professional, and especially those in helping/people professions."
135,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86966257-luana,5,"Bought this book at an airport years ago but never read it until now. Very interesting and probably useful if you’re a business person.I tried some of it out of curiosity, I’m not sure how accurate this is."
136,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1171505-princely,4,"I felt that this book was good, and had accurate things to say about WESTERN gestures. However, I live in Japan, and none of the quote *offensive* gestures mean anything to anyone under thirty five. The business relations section for Japanese was suprisingly off. I mean, every time someone bows, they inspect your shoes? Most of the folks I meet here change from their outside, nice shoes into crappy indoor ones, so everyone's shoes look kind of beaten up when we meet everyone inside :). I'm more suprised at the fact that they didn't research carefully or emphasize more useful Japanese mannerisms, that it is far harder to tell what the Japanese are thinking through body language. They behave differently than Westerners, and many body cues, such as hand gestures, don't apply. The feet gestures, however, are dead on. I find that section useful, but then again it was generally applicable to everybody. As for the book's style, of course, it could have been ghostwritten- it lacked a personal flavor for me that it would have had with an original author. Despite my complaints about its Japanese culture section and writing style, I still give this book a high score. I just found the information fascinating. So many things are being hidden by folks when they talk, but not when they move...it simply blows my mind."

At the time I didn't find it important; but in both personal and professional relationships, body language is crucial in understanding how the other person feels. This book provides a good overview of common body language gestures. I've been told by some, that reading body language can be contradictory. One sign another gives doesn't mean that's how they really feel. Luckily, this book reinforces this cautionary statement by teaching to read body language in clusters and to keep in mind the context in which the body language is given.This book is pretty well laid out in terms of grouping gestures by body part which are by chapter. It makes quick reference a little easier - although I don't feel this book is intended for a reference book. The read itself is really quite quick and easy. Toward the end, there's a self-test chapter to help solidify the knowledgeThe reason why I gave this book one 4 stars is because in some ways, a ""quick guide"" would have been nice. A quick study guide in this only means a smalll chapter recapping all the gestures discussed. A reference, if you will. That could be used to increase the utility of the book to a study guide too."

I bought this book from Amazon and read it before the book by Joe Navarro (also on my list)The authors appear to be sales/marketing people and conduct workshops and trainings on reading body language. There seems to be a bias such as ""this behavior equals this meaning."" I have a problem with this simplistic type of interpretation. However, I try to glean the basic underlying concepts and blend that with my own understanding of body language. There is some interesting information in the book. Since reading this book, I've tried to be more observant of people and their body language, but I tell you it's hard. I tend to lapse into my old ways of looking at the world.Anyway, some interesting information here, some of which I have found interesting. If nothing, it has made me much more conscious of my own body language and how I hold myself!"

It might not be your typical number one novel but it's still such a good read to me! I got so hooked on this book that i finished it in two days. Sometimes when it comes to words,people don't really say much & we always want to get to know the self that's behind these words. This book made me understand many things about body language that i've never known before to the extent where i started reading & highlighting almost everything! I found it extremely helpful,whether a person is too sure while stating his lie his body can give everything away starting from his eyes to his nose and his arm movements. I definitely would give this book 5 stars just because it doesn't sound 'sciency'at all,it was a really fun & humorous read filled with facts & helpful tips!

Now I understand why I can go past what I hear and see what's true, for those of you that can't or those who want to improve decoding people, this is a must read. I will admit I have learned more. This book touches on human beings body language, such as how we cross our legs, touch our face, put things to our mouth such as pen chewing, etc. It decodes even the way we talk with our hands and what it means. There is some info too on hand gestures that the western world uses that offends in other countries. I highly enjoyed this novel and look forward to reading other books written by Allan and Barbara Pease. It must have been a ball researching for thid book. "

Therefore, I loved this book as it would prepare me for my future major and career, which will be involving international affairs. Topics include the basics of body language, and then to specific elements including hand and arm movement and gestures, facial expressions, eye signals, leg and body positioning. I found the illustrations and images that come with the text to be very funny. In addition, I found it to be very nice and simple to understand the body language from a practical point of view.

I should have known something was amiss when I found myself in the marketing section of the library rather than social sciences!Really though, unless you're selling widgets, don't read this book.

This book is written to be entertaining and I would say the authors were fairly successful with that. One of the main issues I have with this book is that some of the authors interpretations of various studies are based on their own opinions, but stated as fact; which had me thinking, ""how did you come to that conclusion?"" Another issue that I found a bit annoying is the fact that the authors seem to shamelessly promote other books they have published. But even with those annoyances, I still might actually read this book again. "

Body Language explores the subtle physical signs we let out and interprets them in sweeping ways, often using examples (public figures like Bill Clinton) to nail down points. And not only limited to body language, A. Pease also jabs in the usage of external accessories such as spectacles which I found amusing and also enlightening. The sitting arrangement in a meeting, how one positions their arms, where your foot points; these are among the different subject areas this book sheds light on."

The pictograms,they help a person to understand the idea and analyze body language before they help the reader to translate the situation and analyzed own style. This book helps to know around us more and what we must do in any case or situation. I advise the readers to read this book , because it help a lot and it's very useful too. "

I think parts are research based but claims like most women are not good at running and accountants don't have good social skills took away some of the book's credibility in my eyes not to mention somewhat insulted me. However, it is a light read, written without a serious tone so it is still worth reading in my opinion."

155,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91977885-michael,4,"Body language is an outward reflection of a person's emotional condition. It's about matching what you see and hear in the environment in which it all happens and drawing a probable conclusion. However, most people only see the things they think they are seeing. Early research on communication shows that the total impact of a message is about 7% for spoken words and 38% for vocal, i.e., the voice's tone and 55% for non-verbal. This means that words are used primarily for conveying information and data. For example, a study done between 1970-80 revealed that a person with a strong argument usually wins in a phone conversation. However, in the round table encounter 60 to 80 percent accounts for body language, and usually, the people make initial impressions within 4 minutes of the conversation.According to the book, some people, especially women's, are more perceptive than men - 'women's intuition.' Being perceptive means able to spot the contradictions between someone's words and body language. When we say we have a hunch or gut feeling, we usually mean that their words and body language do not much. And overall, women are good at picking them. In addition, it is usually easy to read children than adults. This could be that adults have less muscle tone in the face. An interesting fact about body language is that it is easy to misread it, yet it is hard to fake it.While talking about body language, it's important to note that it can be different across different cultures, though some body languages like nodding the head, shoulder shrug, smiling are inborn and are usually the same across cultures. For accurately reading body language, the book presents 3 rules.	1. The reading of gestures should be in clusters. This is to mean that an individual gesture might not give or mislead. Gestures are words, and clusters are sentences in body language. To read them correctly, it needs at least three testers in a match. 	2. Look for congruence between gesture clusters and verbal language. If the gestures and the verbal language do not much, women tend to take the gestures. 	3. Gestures should be read in the context. For example, a person sitting in a cold bus waiting with hands crossed (defensive) and chin down (critical/hostile) should not be interpreted negatively.The HandsPalms of a hand are vocal cords of body language because they did more talking than any other body parts. Three are 3 main palm command testers	▪ Palm Up : is a used as a submissive non-threatening gesture.	▪ Palm Down : shows immediate authority.	▪ Palm Closed : shows the speaker figuratively beats his listeners to submission.Fingers also play a role, where a pointing finger gives negative feelings. Also, squeezing your finger into your thumb to make an OK gesture while giving public speech is considered authoritative, but not aggressive.Handshakes can also be used to show dominance- down Palm, submission-up Palm, and equality-vertical.While encountering power player giving down Palm the following two techniques help to disarm. 	1. Step into the left foot first and then move the right foot ahead of the left foot, then put the left foot again in the same position as the right foot. Practically this might be hard to use since most right-handed people tend to step their right leg first but helps a great deal because you are invading their private space. 	2. While a person presents a Palm up position, then put your left hand over his right to form a double handler and straighten the handshake. Also, while posing for a photo with a handshake, its always good to be on the right side as it gives a Palm down advantage. Touching while shaking hands, with the other hand, creates a powerful result. When you meet someone new and shake hands, extend your left arm, give a light touch on elbow or hand as you shake, and repeat their name to confirm you heard it correctly. Facial SmilesNatural smiles produce characteristic wrinkles around the eyes. The fleshy part of the eye between the eyebrow and the eyelid moves downward, and the end of the eyebrows dip slightly with open mouth for true similes. False smiles only pull back the mouth. Smiling attracts people and signifies a submission signal. Also, laughing simulates the body's natural pain killers and feel good enhancers, like the endorphins, helping relieve stress and heal the body. Thus is used as a therapy in hospitals. People who have trouble laughing at the tough things in life often turn to drugs and alcohol to achieve the same feeling that endorphin induced laughter produces.The 5 common types of smiles include: 1. The Tight-lipped Smile : is a kind that stretches the mouse tightly across the face to form a straight line concealing the teeth. This smile sends the message that the similer has withheld opinions or attitudes that will not be shared with you.  2. Twisted smile : is another kind where it shows opposite emotions on each side of the face, one happy one angry. This smile show sarcasm in the western world. 3. Drop-Jaw Smile : is when the lower jaw is dropped to show the person is laughing or playful. 4. Sideway looking up smile  is a playful and secretive pose that affects both genders. Its orientation is, head turned down and away while looking up with a tight-lipped smile. 5. Permanent Smirk is always smiling that everyone wonders what you have been up to.Laughing is more than 30 times as likely to occurs in participants in a social situation than in a solitary setting. This shows that laughing has less to do with jokes and funny stories and more to do with building relationships. Thus people tend to laugh more and longer in a social situation than each will last alone. Women will find a person that makes her laugh more attractive.Arm SignalsAny crossing of the arms in front of the body is perceived as unfavorable. By folding arms, a barrier is formed, i.e., unconscious attempt to block out what we perceive as a threat or undesirable circumstance. When a person has a nervous, negative, or defensive attitude, it will be manifested by folding the hands. Thus, it useful to avoid crossing your arms under any circumstances unless your intention is to show you don't agree or don't want to participate.Types of crossed arms are:	▪ The universal cross arms on the chest to show its defensive. So while giving speeches, if most of the listeners are crossing their arms, the speech needs to be turned to a kind where it turns to a receptive position. On another way to break this is to give the listeners something to hold in their hands like a notebook and pen. It's also good to use arm chaired to avoid people sitting this way, which in turn blocks their listening. 	▪ Fist Clenched Arm crossed shows hostility as well as defensiveness. A verbal or physical attack could happen if it is combined with a tight-lipped simile or clenched teeth and red face.	▪ Double Arm Grip is a self hugging position that shows a negative restrained attitude. It can be seen by doctors in the waiting room, first-time travelers on air. It depicts the person is feeling insecure and not buying what you are selling.	▪ Thumbs up cross arm shows defensiveness with a self-confident attitude. 	▪ Broken zipper position is used by men to protect their vulnerable area. It creates the feeling of having someone else holding your hand. Women's take hugging themselves position where one arm hung while the other takes hold or touches the other arm.	▪ Cuff Link Adjust is used by celebrities to disguise their nervousness.Hand and Thumb GesturesHumans have 27 small bones and dozens of tiny muscles to move the joints. There are more nerve connections between the hands and the brain than in any other part of the body. Because of that, hands can tell what is the person is thinking more easily. The common hand gestures include:	▪ Rubbing palms together to show positive expectancy. If it is slow, it looks sneaky or devious, but the faster shows excitement. 	▪ Thumb fingertip rub to show gesture about money. 	▪ Clenched hands placed centered to the face elbows resting to the desk while sitting shows frustration, restrained anxious or negative attitude. If placed on the desk centered to the body while elbows are at the same level, they show the same attitude with less degree and the less with standing position. 	▪ The Steeple used by superior to subordinate interaction and indicates a confident or self-assured attitude. As a general rule, this gesture should be avoided when you want to be persuasive or win others person confidence as it can sometimes be read as smugness. The Lowered steeple, hands-on thighs can be used to show assurance. 	▪ Face platter is used by ladies to show their faces, usually presenting themselves for a man. 	▪ Hands in the back with Palm-in-Palm show superiority and confidence. The gripping hand wrist shows frustration and anger. The higher it's up, the more the person is frustrated. 	▪ Thumps protrude is a sign of power authority. They can be in Arms folded with thumb us pointing upwards and thumbs out from the pocket.Evaluation and Deceit SignalsLying is the oil that greases our interactions with others and let us maintain friendly social relationships. Such are called White Lies because their goals are to make others feel comfortable instead of telling them the cold hard truth. Malicious Lies are, however, deliberate lies that set out to deceive another for personal benefit. When children lie, they use the hand to face gesture, i.e., putting the hand on the face. For adults, their umber of gulps of saliva increases, which is especially noticeable for a man as he has Adam apples. The following are the eight most common lying gestures. 1. The mouse cover : the hands cover the mouth as the brain subconsciously instructs it to try to suppress the deceitful words that are being said. While you are talking, if someone covers their mouse, it shows that they feel you are hiding something.  2. The nose touch : The human nose expands with blood during lying. This is followed by nose touching repossessed.  3. Itchy nose : is also a response like a nose touch that is used to disguise own deceit words or listener who doubts the speaker's words.  4. Eye rub : is the brain attempt to block it the deceit doubt or distasteful thing it sees, or to avoid having to look at the face of the person who is being lied to.  5. The Ear grab : is a signal that says, 'I don't want to hear it.' It is also a signal that the person heard enough and want to speak.  6. The Neck Scratch : is a gesture that shows doubt or uncertainty and is characteristic of the person to say, I'm not sure I agree. 7. The Collar Pull : is another gesture of telling lies.  8. Fingers in the mouse is an outward indication of an inner need for assurance, so giving a node guarantees a positive move. Evaluations gestures are shown by a closed hand resting on the chin or cheek, often the index finger pointing upward. Rubbing the back of the neck is also another reaction caused by feeling frustrated or fearful. Slapping the back of the neck tells your are being pain-in-the-neck for the issue while slapping the forehead shows reminding the forgotten thing and not intimidated by you mentioning it.Eye SignalsThe eyes are the most revealing and accurate of all human communication signals because they work independently of conscious control. In general, pupils will dilate or contract as your attitude and mood change from positive to negative and vice versa. When someone becomes excited, their pupils can dilate to up to four times their original size. Conversely, an angry, negative mood causes the pupils to contract to what is commonly known as beady little eyes.When people are lying, they are likely to dramatically increase their blinking rate, an unconscious attempt by the person's brain to block you from their sight because they have become bored or disinterested or feel superior to you. In such scenarios, to rattle the person while taking extended blink, quickly step a pace to your left or right.There are three geographical areas-gazing kinds, people look upon while talking to each other. 1. The social gaze : looks on the triangular area on the other persons face that is between the two eyes and noise. This gaze perceived as non-aggressive. 2. The Intimate gaze : looks at the lower body first to establish what sex it is and up between the eyes and below the chin. Women's has a wider peripheral vision that helps her to look at top to bottom while looking at the face. However, because of male tunnel vision, he needs to gaze up and down in a very obvious way. This is the reason why men are accused of ogling women's body at close range though research shows that women do more of it than men. 3. The Power gaze : looks at the triangular area between the eye and middle of the forehead. This gaze is used to treat a person who intimidates or the person you want to make shut up.Other gaze form, The power stare, gives more authority. It is done by looking at the person in narrow eyelids and without blinking. To perform this, move your eyeballs first and then let your head follow while making your shoulders remain still.Another interesting thing about the eyes is the movement they follow while trying to remember something. If a person recalls something that they saw, their eyes will move upward. If they recall something, they heard- they look to the side and tilt their head as if they are listening. If they are recalling a feeling or emotion they'll look down and to the right. And when they are talking to themselves, they look down and to the left.To keep control of where a person is looking while showing something, use a pen to point to the presentation and, at the same time, verbalize what he sees. Next, lift the pen from the presentation and hold it between his eyes and your eyes.continued in the comment section..."

What stopped me from giving it only 1 star is that despite the many things I disagreed with, I found anyway a couple of useful pieces of advice. Overall not recommended."
159,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17413971-jinkm,1,"I got this book from the library because I have problems reading another person's body language. However, from the first page I got the feeling this book wouldn't be for someone like me. I saw the other books the author's have written. Here is the list:Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read MapsWhy Men Lie and Women CryWhy Men Can Only do One Thing At A Time and Women Never Stop TalkingThe Little Book of Men and women In my opinion, it's obvious the authors probably subscribe to the belief that men and women are totally and inherently different. And that they probably also believe in inherent gender roles, which, again, in my opinion, is bollocks. But hey, I thought, let's not judge. People's opinions and beliefs evolve and everyone has questionable opinions. That doesn't mean they don't know what they are talking about when it come to body language. So, I decided to give it a try.Eleven pages in I see ""Body language is an outward reflection of a person's emotional condition""Now, as someone who others describe as very stoic and stone-faced and as someone who has trouble with expressing emotion, I found this to be a little narrow minded. I constantly have to explain to people that ""No, I am not angry, I am thinking."" ""No, I am not attacking you, I am trying to have a serious discussion with you, please ignore my angry looking eyeballs."" ""No I am not a serial killer, I just have a very intense face sometimes, okay?!"" XD However, I am willing to consider this is the case for most people and I came to learn about others, so I carry on!  Unfortunately, immediately below the above quote, as an illustrative image to show an example of body language, they inserted a conveniently angled picture of Prince Charles so that it looked like he was grasping a large-chested woman's breasts with the caption of ""Prince Charles finds a bosom buddy"". Now, I'm all for humor and recognize that it makes reading about scientific subjects easier to digest. However, I found this tasteless and inappropriate. Red flag #3. (And it wasn't even the only sexual innuendo :S) However x2 though, we don't require our 'experts' to have appropriate senses of humor, (NASA scientists as an example :D). They are there to make a point and instruct, not to tickle our funny bones SO, I read on. :/ (If you can't tell, I'm a little hard-headed and have trouble listening to my own intuition.) The Final Straw - Not knowing the definition of words- The authors say ""Women have an innate ability to pick up and decipher non verbal signals, as well as having an accurate eye for small details"" I disagree, but I've already decided to ignore their outdated gender opinions. Just in the next paragraph, though, they totally contradict themselves. The authors cite a Harvard study that showed that women have a greater ability to read emotions in situations. Okay, that is in line with what they said, BUT they go on to say in the very next sentence  that men in 'nurturing' careers, like art (what?), acting, and nursing, as well as gay men, scored as well as women. They then go on to say that women are so very good at reading emotions because they ""practice reading signals early"". Which to me, seems to be the exact opposite definition of 'innate'. That's a definite sign of a dodgy book. Now I have a logical reason to quit. Good, I quit. Best decision I've made today. I feel good about quitting. You can tell, because my stance is open and I'm smiling. No really, I'm smiling. It might only be slightly more curved than straight line, but it's a smile.  My recommendation: find a different book to read. One that is more up to date and perhaps is written by some one who is more interested in solid academics than telling crass jokes. Two thumbs down."
160,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6712675-lucas-leite,2,"More impressions  in my personal blog of reviewsNot So Evident Signs Certain gestural groups emitted by the body generate positive or negative influences in the unconscious of the interlocutor, this is the argument put forward by Allan and Barbara Pease in the book The Definitive Guide to Body Language.

The book deals with meanings gestures offered by the eyes, hands, feet and other expressions and body parts. Moreover, it exposes how elements found in the environment can influence the course of a conversation: how, for example, the position of your chair in relation to the interviewer can assist you in gaining a place of employment or assist in selling a product or service. These tips are very important when you have the notion that the interlocutor form an opinion about the other in just 4 minutes of talking, appealing, unconsciously, much more to the visual attributes and gestures than the competencies inherent to the career or quality of the curriculum. In fact, you'll never get a second chance to make a good first impression.Although richly illustrated, the weak point of this simple language book is the lack of depth.

Além disso, expõem como os elementos encontrados no ambiente podem influenciar nos rumos de uma conversa: o quanto, por exemplo, a posição de sua cadeira em relação ao entrevistador pode auxiliá-lo na conquista de uma vaga de emprego ou auxiliá-lo na venda de um serviço/produto.Essas dicas são muito importantes quando se tem a noção de que o interlocutor forma uma opinião sobre o outro em apenas 4 minutos de conversa, apelando, inconscientemente, muito mais para os atributos visuais do que para as competências imanentes à carreira profissional ou qualidade do currículo. De fato, a primeira impressão muitas vezes é a que fica.Embora ricamente ilustrado, o ponto fraco deste livro de simples linguagem está na falta de profundidade. Desvendando os segredos da linguagem corporal limita-se a exemplificar situações sem especificar ou explicar motivações, trata-se de um manual comportamental. Deixa, por isso, lacunas que só podem ser preenchidas se o leitor procurar por livros mais técnicos dentro da área. Se o objetivo é captar dicas, este é um bom livro. Mas se a intenção é debruçar-se sobre o estudo da linguagem corporal, este é um livro que pode ser considerado apenas introdutório. "

He brings the different aspects into conscious thinking of how these things developed by evolution and have been hardwired into brain to interpret.I cannot emphasize more on how fantastic book it was! It has helped me immensely, especially the courtship gestures!"
162,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95025914-wilmington,2,"I have read and enjoyed Allan and Barbara Pease's other bestsellers Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps and Why Men Lie and Women Cry: How to Get What You Want Out of Life by Asking and therefore was really looking forward to reading this book. It was quite a disappointment. Half of the body language described seems perfectly obvious to me. Some of the explanations were useful, but others were dubious or downright mistaken.It didn't start well when on page 7 the caption under Schwarzenegger showing the thumb up explained that it meant five in Japan, which is utterly false. I can forgive one mistake, but not dozens, and the book is filled with them. Here are other examples.On p. 18-19, the authors say that shaking the head from side to side to indicate 'no' is universal. Are they forgetting that in India it means 'yes' ? Over one billion people is not a minor exception.On p. 20, under the title Universal Gestures, the first example is the shoulder shrug to show that a person doesn't know or doesn't understand. In France it means that the person doesn't care or that it can't be helped. Perhaps their meaning of universal is not the one universally understood by English speakers ?On p. 109-110, they say that figures E and F are insults in Japan, and figure L means 5 in Japan and 1 in (continental) Europe. None of that is true.On the next page, under 'Why We are All Becoming American', they say that the middle finger raised is originally an American insult that became adopted in other countries because of American TV and movies. It actually originated in Ancient Greece and Rome and has been used in many European countries (especially Mediterranean ones) for a very long time. The authors claim that the American Ring gesture to mean OK is now recognised in many countries due to American influence. It may be recognised, but is hardly ever used in most of Europe and Asia, where it often has a different meaning. They carry on with the words for toilet becoming Americanised, but what does this have to do with body language ? It is also a fallacy, since most speakers of English today are non-native speakers, and Europeans are far more likely to use the word 'toilet' than 'bathroom' because the word 'toilet' exists in most European languages.On p.114, they claim that the French greet each others with a double kiss and the Belgians with a triple kiss. The truth is that the number varies from one to five in France, depending on the region and generation. In Belgium it is only once among French speakers, and usually none among Dutch speakers like in Britain.On p.119, they explain that the American OK sign means zero in France and money in Japan, but they are not done the same way and therefore cannot be misunderstood easily. The OK sign is done with the three other fingers open (pointing up). The French zero is done with the middle to little fingers closed, aligned on the index finger. The Japanese zero is done with the hand placed horizontally, open fingers pointing sideways, and the palm pointing towards the body.On p. 171, we read that the Japanese are the only ones that don't 'eyebrow flash'. Again it's not true. That's an East Asian thing.After the ignorance of other cultures come the scientific errors. On p. 171, the authors say that, contrarily to humans, ""apes lack eye-whites, which means that their prey don't know where the ape is looking or whether they have been spotted, giving the ape a greater chance of hunting success."" Really ? It's a surprising theory to say the least, since all apes aside from humans, and all monkeys are vegetarian.I also wonder what they mean when on p.192 they write ""by animals, birds, fish and primates"". Animals sound redundant here.In the section of personal space (p.193), they explain that lions have a territorial space of 30 miles or more, but that lions raised in captivity have a personal space of only several yards. They confuse personal space (safe distance between two individuals, even of the same family) and the lion's hunting territory, which isn't personal but used by all the lionesses (as it is the females that hunt) belong to the same clan. They make the same confusion afterwards by mentioning countries, cities and other non-personal boundaries. It's sounds highly unscientific and unprofessional on the authors' part to make such a simplification on a book about body language.I wasn't happier to read on the next page that they were going to compare the personal space radius in (and I quote) ""Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, North America, Northern Europe, Scandinavia, Canada or anywhere a culture is 'Westernised' such as Singapore, Guam or Iceland"". Wow ! What's the point of saying Great Britain and Scandinavia is they say Northern Europe ? Why say North America and Canada ? But much worse, why on earth would they consider that Iceland is not part of Scandinavia and believe it is not a Western country but a Westernised one like Singapore ? Do they have any idea of how uneducated that sounds ? On p.202 they insist again on saying ""Northern Europeans and Scandinavians"" as if Scandinavians weren't Northern Europeans. It might be useful for them to look at a world map some time.On p.199, trying to justify that people become more aggressive when their personal space is invaded, the authors claim that ""areas that have the highest human population density also have the highest crime and violence rates"". This is another factual mistake. Countries with very high population densities like Japan, the Netherlands, England, or even India, tend to be more peaceful and have lower crime rates than sparsely populated countries like most of Africa or South America, or even the USA.On p.268, Mr and Mrs Pease claim that ""Twice as many women smoke as men"". This is completely wrong. The WHO data shows that in average, worldwide, smoking is five times as prevalent among men than women. There is hardly any country where women smoke more than men, and in some Muslim countries the percentage of smoking men is one hundred times higher than for women (for example in Morocco and Algeria).After the factual mistakes come the dubious theories. On p.260-1, we read that one of the most common forms of mirroring is yawning, and that ""It was one thought that the purpose of yawning was to oxygenate the body but we now know that it's a form of mirroring that serves to create a rapport with others and to avoid aggression"". The problem with this theory is that yawning is most commonly done when people are alone or with close relatives at home, and therefore doesn't serve to avoid aggression.I also want to add that the quiz at the end of the book is terrible. The pictures are very unclear and it's hard to find all the signals even after reading the descriptions."
163,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/538517-alissa-thorne,4,"I found this book so useful, I decided to listen to it twice in a row.* When it became clear that much of the book was going to be a lengthy list of various subtle body language queues, I groaned at what I anticipated would be a lot of rote memorization. As it turned out, since body language is so tied up with emotions, almost all of the indicators were immediately recognizable. More importantly, they matched with an emotional understanding of what it feels like when exhibiting that indicator, and it feels like when I see others. This made information easy to absorb, and once it did it stuck.The most thought provoking concept in this book is what I mentioned earlier--emotional state and body language are mirrors of one another. That is to say, not only is your body language an expression of your emotion, but your feelings can be affected by changing your physical expressions. One of the more striking examples of this is the idea that if someone has a negative attitude, expressed with crossed arms, you can influence their emotional openness by handing them a pen or cup of coffee, requiring that they uncross their arms.So far, I am primarily becoming more aware of my own body language rather than reading others. That's fine by me--not only is it useful to know what messages you are subconsciousness sending others, it also makes me more aware of my own emotional state.One questionable bit about this book--it makes heavy use of bold claims about gender and other topics that contradict common wisdom. I don't know how supported these claims are, but I take much of the alleged science with a grain of salt.* In part, this is because I kept spacing out or losing my place, so I know I was missing bits."
164,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22787654-justin,4,"Nonverbal signals constitutes the majority of communication, and often gets overlooked. In any social aspect of life, being able to recognize and use knowledge of body language to our favor can make a difference. Allan and Barbara Pease use their business and research backgrounds to uncover a general overview of body language for use in personal and professional situations. They cover hands,arms, smiles and laguther, cultural differences, hand and thumb gestures, evaluation and deceit signals, eye signals, personal space, legs, thirteen most common gestures, mirroring, signals of cigarettes, glasses and makeup, how the body points, courtship/attraction signals, ownership/territory/height signals, seating arrangements, and interviews/office politics. They also include an assessment at the end. Reading this book brought to light many things I already knew, but never thought about, and gestures I never encountered. I enjoyed the straightforward read, and the helpful visuals accompanying the explanations. I would've preferred less emphasis on business when they assumed in several sections you're persuading someone to make a sale, and more on social situations though much of it is applicable. Also they cover gender differences quite a bit which is useful and link it to biology which I found interesting. Still from a social perspective it's helpful to keep in mind the varieties of each genders' differences rather than to accept the general assumption. That said, I also enjoyed the research studies cited.Overall, this book is a great resource for anyone looking to improve their communication and relationships personal or professional, and especially those in helping/people professions."
165,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86966257-luana,5,"Bought this book at an airport years ago but never read it until now. Very interesting and probably useful if you’re a business person.I tried some of it out of curiosity, I’m not sure how accurate this is."
166,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1171505-princely,4,"I felt that this book was good, and had accurate things to say about WESTERN gestures. However, I live in Japan, and none of the quote *offensive* gestures mean anything to anyone under thirty five. The business relations section for Japanese was suprisingly off. I mean, every time someone bows, they inspect your shoes? Most of the folks I meet here change from their outside, nice shoes into crappy indoor ones, so everyone's shoes look kind of beaten up when we meet everyone inside :). I'm more suprised at the fact that they didn't research carefully or emphasize more useful Japanese mannerisms, that it is far harder to tell what the Japanese are thinking through body language. They behave differently than Westerners, and many body cues, such as hand gestures, don't apply. The feet gestures, however, are dead on. I find that section useful, but then again it was generally applicable to everybody. As for the book's style, of course, it could have been ghostwritten- it lacked a personal flavor for me that it would have had with an original author. Despite my complaints about its Japanese culture section and writing style, I still give this book a high score. I just found the information fascinating. So many things are being hidden by folks when they talk, but not when they move...it simply blows my mind."
167,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3914724-david,4,"When I was younger, I didn't really pay much attention to body language. At the time I didn't find it important; but in both personal and professional relationships, body language is crucial in understanding how the other person feels. This book provides a good overview of common body language gestures. I've been told by some, that reading body language can be contradictory. One sign another gives doesn't mean that's how they really feel. Luckily, this book reinforces this cautionary statement by teaching to read body language in clusters and to keep in mind the context in which the body language is given.This book is pretty well laid out in terms of grouping gestures by body part which are by chapter. It makes quick reference a little easier - although I don't feel this book is intended for a reference book. The read itself is really quite quick and easy. Toward the end, there's a self-test chapter to help solidify the knowledgeThe reason why I gave this book one 4 stars is because in some ways, a ""quick guide"" would have been nice. A quick study guide in this only means a smalll chapter recapping all the gestures discussed. A reference, if you will. That could be used to increase the utility of the book to a study guide too."

I bought this book from Amazon and read it before the book by Joe Navarro (also on my list)The authors appear to be sales/marketing people and conduct workshops and trainings on reading body language. There seems to be a bias such as ""this behavior equals this meaning."" I have a problem with this simplistic type of interpretation. However, I try to glean the basic underlying concepts and blend that with my own understanding of body language. There is some interesting information in the book. Since reading this book, I've tried to be more observant of people and their body language, but I tell you it's hard. I tend to lapse into my old ways of looking at the world.Anyway, some interesting information here, some of which I have found interesting. If nothing, it has made me much more conscious of my own body language and how I hold myself!"

It might not be your typical number one novel but it's still such a good read to me! I got so hooked on this book that i finished it in two days. Sometimes when it comes to words,people don't really say much & we always want to get to know the self that's behind these words. This book made me understand many things about body language that i've never known before to the extent where i started reading & highlighting almost everything! I found it extremely helpful,whether a person is too sure while stating his lie his body can give everything away starting from his eyes to his nose and his arm movements. I definitely would give this book 5 stars just because it doesn't sound 'sciency'at all,it was a really fun & humorous read filled with facts & helpful tips! I would surely recommend this book to all the people out there who are interested in psychology because this books is for you!"

Now I understand why I can go past what I hear and see what's true, for those of you that can't or those who want to improve decoding people, this is a must read. I will admit I have learned more. This book touches on human beings body language, such as how we cross our legs, touch our face, put things to our mouth such as pen chewing, etc. It decodes even the way we talk with our hands and what it means. There is some info too on hand gestures that the western world uses that offends in other countries. I highly enjoyed this novel and look forward to reading other books written by Allan and Barbara Pease. It must have been a ball researching for thid book. "

It introduces body language from point of view of business and politics. Therefore, I loved this book as it would prepare me for my future major and career, which will be involving international affairs. Topics include the basics of body language, and then to specific elements including hand and arm movement and gestures, facial expressions, eye signals, leg and body positioning. I found the illustrations and images that come with the text to be very funny. In addition, I found it to be very nice and simple to understand the body language from a practical point of view.

After reading How to Speak Dog and noticing much of doggish is found in body language I thought it would be good to have a base level of knowledge about human body language as well. Unfortunately this book isn't really about that. It's a kind of misogynistic guide to the unhealthy world of Sales. Bloody damn and blast! I should have known something was amiss when I found myself in the marketing section of the library rather than social sciences!Really though, unless you're selling widgets, don't read this book.

This book is written to be entertaining and I would say the authors were fairly successful with that. One of the main issues I have with this book is that some of the authors interpretations of various studies are based on their own opinions, but stated as fact; which had me thinking, ""how did you come to that conclusion?"" Another issue that I found a bit annoying is the fact that the authors seem to shamelessly promote other books they have published. But even with those annoyances, I still might actually read this book again. "

Body Language explores the subtle physical signs we let out and interprets them in sweeping ways, often using examples (public figures like Bill Clinton) to nail down points. And not only limited to body language, A. Pease also jabs in the usage of external accessories such as spectacles which I found amusing and also enlightening. The sitting arrangement in a meeting, how one positions their arms, where your foot points; these are among the different subject areas this book sheds light on."

Of course it takes some practice to really master the techniques you learn in this book, and you'll be a bit overwhelmed and confused at first...it gets better over time however. With this book you can connect better with people; communicate more effectively, and get across the nonverbal information you really want to convey in a variety of situations, from giving speeches or presentations to being in a job interview.

The pictograms,they help a person to understand the idea and analyze body language before they help the reader to translate the situation and analyzed own style. This book helps to know around us more and what we must do in any case or situation. I advise the readers to read this book , because it help a lot and it's very useful too. "

I think parts are research based but claims like most women are not good at running and accountants don't have good social skills took away some of the book's credibility in my eyes not to mention somewhat insulted me. However, it is a light read, written without a serious tone so it is still worth reading in my opinion."

185,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91977885-michael,4,"Body language is an outward reflection of a person's emotional condition. It's about matching what you see and hear in the environment in which it all happens and drawing a probable conclusion. However, most people only see the things they think they are seeing. Early research on communication shows that the total impact of a message is about 7% for spoken words and 38% for vocal, i.e., the voice's tone and 55% for non-verbal. This means that words are used primarily for conveying information and data. For example, a study done between 1970-80 revealed that a person with a strong argument usually wins in a phone conversation. However, in the round table encounter 60 to 80 percent accounts for body language, and usually, the people make initial impressions within 4 minutes of the conversation.According to the book, some people, especially women's, are more perceptive than men - 'women's intuition.' Being perceptive means able to spot the contradictions between someone's words and body language. When we say we have a hunch or gut feeling, we usually mean that their words and body language do not much. And overall, women are good at picking them. In addition, it is usually easy to read children than adults. This could be that adults have less muscle tone in the face. An interesting fact about body language is that it is easy to misread it, yet it is hard to fake it.While talking about body language, it's important to note that it can be different across different cultures, though some body languages like nodding the head, shoulder shrug, smiling are inborn and are usually the same across cultures. For accurately reading body language, the book presents 3 rules.	1. The reading of gestures should be in clusters. This is to mean that an individual gesture might not give or mislead. Gestures are words, and clusters are sentences in body language. To read them correctly, it needs at least three testers in a match. 	2. Look for congruence between gesture clusters and verbal language. If the gestures and the verbal language do not much, women tend to take the gestures. 	3. Gestures should be read in the context. For example, a person sitting in a cold bus waiting with hands crossed (defensive) and chin down (critical/hostile) should not be interpreted negatively.The HandsPalms of a hand are vocal cords of body language because they did more talking than any other body parts. Three are 3 main palm command testers	▪ Palm Up : is a used as a submissive non-threatening gesture.	▪ Palm Down : shows immediate authority.	▪ Palm Closed : shows the speaker figuratively beats his listeners to submission.Fingers also play a role, where a pointing finger gives negative feelings. Also, squeezing your finger into your thumb to make an OK gesture while giving public speech is considered authoritative, but not aggressive.Handshakes can also be used to show dominance- down Palm, submission-up Palm, and equality-vertical.While encountering power player giving down Palm the following two techniques help to disarm. 	1. Step into the left foot first and then move the right foot ahead of the left foot, then put the left foot again in the same position as the right foot. Practically this might be hard to use since most right-handed people tend to step their right leg first but helps a great deal because you are invading their private space. 	2. While a person presents a Palm up position, then put your left hand over his right to form a double handler and straighten the handshake. Also, while posing for a photo with a handshake, its always good to be on the right side as it gives a Palm down advantage. Touching while shaking hands, with the other hand, creates a powerful result. When you meet someone new and shake hands, extend your left arm, give a light touch on elbow or hand as you shake, and repeat their name to confirm you heard it correctly. Facial SmilesNatural smiles produce characteristic wrinkles around the eyes. The fleshy part of the eye between the eyebrow and the eyelid moves downward, and the end of the eyebrows dip slightly with open mouth for true similes. False smiles only pull back the mouth. Smiling attracts people and signifies a submission signal. Also, laughing simulates the body's natural pain killers and feel good enhancers, like the endorphins, helping relieve stress and heal the body. Thus is used as a therapy in hospitals. People who have trouble laughing at the tough things in life often turn to drugs and alcohol to achieve the same feeling that endorphin induced laughter produces.The 5 common types of smiles include: 1. The Tight-lipped Smile : is a kind that stretches the mouse tightly across the face to form a straight line concealing the teeth. This smile sends the message that the similer has withheld opinions or attitudes that will not be shared with you.  2. Twisted smile : is another kind where it shows opposite emotions on each side of the face, one happy one angry. This smile show sarcasm in the western world. 3. Drop-Jaw Smile : is when the lower jaw is dropped to show the person is laughing or playful. 4. Sideway looking up smile  is a playful and secretive pose that affects both genders. Its orientation is, head turned down and away while looking up with a tight-lipped smile. 5. Permanent Smirk is always smiling that everyone wonders what you have been up to.Laughing is more than 30 times as likely to occurs in participants in a social situation than in a solitary setting. This shows that laughing has less to do with jokes and funny stories and more to do with building relationships. Thus people tend to laugh more and longer in a social situation than each will last alone. Women will find a person that makes her laugh more attractive.Arm SignalsAny crossing of the arms in front of the body is perceived as unfavorable. By folding arms, a barrier is formed, i.e., unconscious attempt to block out what we perceive as a threat or undesirable circumstance. When a person has a nervous, negative, or defensive attitude, it will be manifested by folding the hands. Thus, it useful to avoid crossing your arms under any circumstances unless your intention is to show you don't agree or don't want to participate.Types of crossed arms are:	▪ The universal cross arms on the chest to show its defensive. So while giving speeches, if most of the listeners are crossing their arms, the speech needs to be turned to a kind where it turns to a receptive position. On another way to break this is to give the listeners something to hold in their hands like a notebook and pen. It's also good to use arm chaired to avoid people sitting this way, which in turn blocks their listening. 	▪ Fist Clenched Arm crossed shows hostility as well as defensiveness. A verbal or physical attack could happen if it is combined with a tight-lipped simile or clenched teeth and red face.	▪ Double Arm Grip is a self hugging position that shows a negative restrained attitude. It can be seen by doctors in the waiting room, first-time travelers on air. It depicts the person is feeling insecure and not buying what you are selling.	▪ Thumbs up cross arm shows defensiveness with a self-confident attitude. 	▪ Broken zipper position is used by men to protect their vulnerable area. It creates the feeling of having someone else holding your hand. Women's take hugging themselves position where one arm hung while the other takes hold or touches the other arm.	▪ Cuff Link Adjust is used by celebrities to disguise their nervousness.Hand and Thumb GesturesHumans have 27 small bones and dozens of tiny muscles to move the joints. There are more nerve connections between the hands and the brain than in any other part of the body. Because of that, hands can tell what is the person is thinking more easily. The common hand gestures include:	▪ Rubbing palms together to show positive expectancy. If it is slow, it looks sneaky or devious, but the faster shows excitement. 	▪ Thumb fingertip rub to show gesture about money. 	▪ Clenched hands placed centered to the face elbows resting to the desk while sitting shows frustration, restrained anxious or negative attitude. If placed on the desk centered to the body while elbows are at the same level, they show the same attitude with less degree and the less with standing position. 	▪ The Steeple used by superior to subordinate interaction and indicates a confident or self-assured attitude. As a general rule, this gesture should be avoided when you want to be persuasive or win others person confidence as it can sometimes be read as smugness. The Lowered steeple, hands-on thighs can be used to show assurance. 	▪ Face platter is used by ladies to show their faces, usually presenting themselves for a man. 	▪ Hands in the back with Palm-in-Palm show superiority and confidence. The gripping hand wrist shows frustration and anger. The higher it's up, the more the person is frustrated. 	▪ Thumps protrude is a sign of power authority. They can be in Arms folded with thumb us pointing upwards and thumbs out from the pocket.Evaluation and Deceit SignalsLying is the oil that greases our interactions with others and let us maintain friendly social relationships. Such are called White Lies because their goals are to make others feel comfortable instead of telling them the cold hard truth. Malicious Lies are, however, deliberate lies that set out to deceive another for personal benefit. When children lie, they use the hand to face gesture, i.e., putting the hand on the face. For adults, their umber of gulps of saliva increases, which is especially noticeable for a man as he has Adam apples. The following are the eight most common lying gestures. 1. The mouse cover : the hands cover the mouth as the brain subconsciously instructs it to try to suppress the deceitful words that are being said. While you are talking, if someone covers their mouse, it shows that they feel you are hiding something.  2. The nose touch : The human nose expands with blood during lying. This is followed by nose touching repossessed.  3. Itchy nose : is also a response like a nose touch that is used to disguise own deceit words or listener who doubts the speaker's words.  4. Eye rub : is the brain attempt to block it the deceit doubt or distasteful thing it sees, or to avoid having to look at the face of the person who is being lied to.  5. The Ear grab : is a signal that says, 'I don't want to hear it.' It is also a signal that the person heard enough and want to speak.  6. The Neck Scratch : is a gesture that shows doubt or uncertainty and is characteristic of the person to say, I'm not sure I agree. 7. The Collar Pull : is another gesture of telling lies.  8. Fingers in the mouse is an outward indication of an inner need for assurance, so giving a node guarantees a positive move. Evaluations gestures are shown by a closed hand resting on the chin or cheek, often the index finger pointing upward. Rubbing the back of the neck is also another reaction caused by feeling frustrated or fearful. Slapping the back of the neck tells your are being pain-in-the-neck for the issue while slapping the forehead shows reminding the forgotten thing and not intimidated by you mentioning it.Eye SignalsThe eyes are the most revealing and accurate of all human communication signals because they work independently of conscious control. In general, pupils will dilate or contract as your attitude and mood change from positive to negative and vice versa. When someone becomes excited, their pupils can dilate to up to four times their original size. Conversely, an angry, negative mood causes the pupils to contract to what is commonly known as beady little eyes.When people are lying, they are likely to dramatically increase their blinking rate, an unconscious attempt by the person's brain to block you from their sight because they have become bored or disinterested or feel superior to you. In such scenarios, to rattle the person while taking extended blink, quickly step a pace to your left or right.There are three geographical areas-gazing kinds, people look upon while talking to each other. 1. The social gaze : looks on the triangular area on the other persons face that is between the two eyes and noise. This gaze perceived as non-aggressive. 2. The Intimate gaze : looks at the lower body first to establish what sex it is and up between the eyes and below the chin. Women's has a wider peripheral vision that helps her to look at top to bottom while looking at the face. However, because of male tunnel vision, he needs to gaze up and down in a very obvious way. This is the reason why men are accused of ogling women's body at close range though research shows that women do more of it than men. 3. The Power gaze : looks at the triangular area between the eye and middle of the forehead. This gaze is used to treat a person who intimidates or the person you want to make shut up.Other gaze form, The power stare, gives more authority. It is done by looking at the person in narrow eyelids and without blinking. To perform this, move your eyeballs first and then let your head follow while making your shoulders remain still.Another interesting thing about the eyes is the movement they follow while trying to remember something. If a person recalls something that they saw, their eyes will move upward. If they recall something, they heard- they look to the side and tilt their head as if they are listening. If they are recalling a feeling or emotion they'll look down and to the right. And when they are talking to themselves, they look down and to the left.To keep control of where a person is looking while showing something, use a pen to point to the presentation and, at the same time, verbalize what he sees. Next, lift the pen from the presentation and hold it between his eyes and your eyes.continued in the comment section..."

I think another book should be appended so that we can analyse different real situations and put together all we know about body language in practice."
188,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71950414-mariagiulia,2,"A poorly written, not that accurate, superficial and even slightly sexist body language manual that I struggled to finish. What stopped me from giving it only 1 star is that despite the many things I disagreed with, I found anyway a couple of useful pieces of advice. Overall not recommended."
189,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17413971-jinkm,1,"I got this book from the library because I have problems reading another person's body language. However, from the first page I got the feeling this book wouldn't be for someone like me. I saw the other books the author's have written. Here is the list:Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read MapsWhy Men Lie and Women CryWhy Men Can Only do One Thing At A Time and Women Never Stop TalkingThe Little Book of Men and women In my opinion, it's obvious the authors probably subscribe to the belief that men and women are totally and inherently different. And that they probably also believe in inherent gender roles, which, again, in my opinion, is bollocks. But hey, I thought, let's not judge. People's opinions and beliefs evolve and everyone has questionable opinions. That doesn't mean they don't know what they are talking about when it come to body language. So, I decided to give it a try.Eleven pages in I see ""Body language is an outward reflection of a person's emotional condition""Now, as someone who others describe as very stoic and stone-faced and as someone who has trouble with expressing emotion, I found this to be a little narrow minded. I constantly have to explain to people that ""No, I am not angry, I am thinking."" ""No, I am not attacking you, I am trying to have a serious discussion with you, please ignore my angry looking eyeballs."" ""No I am not a serial killer, I just have a very intense face sometimes, okay?!"" XD However, I am willing to consider this is the case for most people and I came to learn about others, so I carry on!  Unfortunately, immediately below the above quote, as an illustrative image to show an example of body language, they inserted a conveniently angled picture of Prince Charles so that it looked like he was grasping a large-chested woman's breasts with the caption of ""Prince Charles finds a bosom buddy"". Now, I'm all for humor and recognize that it makes reading about scientific subjects easier to digest. However, I found this tasteless and inappropriate. Red flag #3. (And it wasn't even the only sexual innuendo :S) However x2 though, we don't require our 'experts' to have appropriate senses of humor, (NASA scientists as an example :D). They are there to make a point and instruct, not to tickle our funny bones SO, I read on. :/ (If you can't tell, I'm a little hard-headed and have trouble listening to my own intuition.) The Final Straw - Not knowing the definition of words- The authors say ""Women have an innate ability to pick up and decipher non verbal signals, as well as having an accurate eye for small details"" I disagree, but I've already decided to ignore their outdated gender opinions. Just in the next paragraph, though, they totally contradict themselves. The authors cite a Harvard study that showed that women have a greater ability to read emotions in situations. Okay, that is in line with what they said, BUT they go on to say in the very next sentence  that men in 'nurturing' careers, like art (what?), acting, and nursing, as well as gay men, scored as well as women. They then go on to say that women are so very good at reading emotions because they ""practice reading signals early"". Which to me, seems to be the exact opposite definition of 'innate'. That's a definite sign of a dodgy book. Now I have a logical reason to quit. Good, I quit. Best decision I've made today. I feel good about quitting. You can tell, because my stance is open and I'm smiling. No really, I'm smiling. It might only be slightly more curved than straight line, but it's a smile.  My recommendation: find a different book to read. One that is more up to date and perhaps is written by some one who is more interested in solid academics than telling crass jokes. Two thumbs down."

The authors, professionals with vast experience in business, use their professional experience, latest data and researches to, in a colloquial and brief language, expose to the general public importants tips to interpret behavior in the professional and personal situations. The book deals with meanings gestures offered by the eyes, hands, feet and other expressions and body parts. Moreover, it exposes how elements found in the environment can influence the course of a conversation: how, for example, the position of your chair in relation to the interviewer can assist you in gaining a place of employment or assist in selling a product or service. These tips are very important when you have the notion that the interlocutor form an opinion about the other in just 4 minutes of talking, appealing, unconsciously, much more to the visual attributes and gestures than the competencies inherent to the career or quality of the curriculum. In fact, you'll never get a second chance to make a good first impression.Although richly illustrated, the weak point of this simple language book is the lack of depth. The Definitive Guide to Body Language deal only with situations illustrating it without specifying or explain motivations, it is a behavioral manual. Let, therefore, gaps that can only be fulfilled if the reader looking for more technical books in the area. If the goal is get tips, this is a good book. But if the intention is to look hard into the study of body language, this is a book that can be considered only introductory.***Sinais pouco evidentesDeterminados grupos gestuais emitidos pelo corpo geram influências negativas ou positivas no inconsciente do interlocutor, esta é a tese defendida por Allan e Barbara Pease no livro Desvendando os segredos da linguagem corporal. Os autores, profissionais de vasta experiência no mundo empresarial, utilizam-se da sua vivência profissional, dados e mais recentes pesquisas para, numa linguagem coloquial e breve, passar para o grande público importantes dicas de interpretação e comportamento em situações no âmbito profissional e pessoal.O livro trata de significados gestuais oferecidos pelos olhos, mãos, pés entre outras expressões e partes do corpo. Além disso, expõem como os elementos encontrados no ambiente podem influenciar nos rumos de uma conversa: o quanto, por exemplo, a posição de sua cadeira em relação ao entrevistador pode auxiliá-lo na conquista de uma vaga de emprego ou auxiliá-lo na venda de um serviço/produto.Essas dicas são muito importantes quando se tem a noção de que o interlocutor forma uma opinião sobre o outro em apenas 4 minutos de conversa, apelando, inconscientemente, muito mais para os atributos visuais do que para as competências imanentes à carreira profissional ou qualidade do currículo. De fato, a primeira impressão muitas vezes é a que fica.Embora ricamente ilustrado, o ponto fraco deste livro de simples linguagem está na falta de profundidade. Desvendando os segredos da linguagem corporal limita-se a exemplificar situações sem especificar ou explicar motivações, trata-se de um manual comportamental. Deixa, por isso, lacunas que só podem ser preenchidas se o leitor procurar por livros mais técnicos dentro da área. Se o objetivo é captar dicas, este é um bom livro. Mas se a intenção é debruçar-se sobre o estudo da linguagem corporal, este é um livro que pode ser considerado apenas introdutório. "

He brings the different aspects into conscious thinking of how these things developed by evolution and have been hardwired into brain to interpret.I cannot emphasize more on how fantastic book it was! It has helped me immensely, especially the courtship gestures!"
192,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95025914-wilmington,2,"I have read and enjoyed Allan and Barbara Pease's other bestsellers Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps and Why Men Lie and Women Cry: How to Get What You Want Out of Life by Asking and therefore was really looking forward to reading this book. It was quite a disappointment. Half of the body language described seems perfectly obvious to me. Some of the explanations were useful, but others were dubious or downright mistaken.It didn't start well when on page 7 the caption under Schwarzenegger showing the thumb up explained that it meant five in Japan, which is utterly false. I can forgive one mistake, but not dozens, and the book is filled with them. Here are other examples.On p. 18-19, the authors say that shaking the head from side to side to indicate 'no' is universal. Are they forgetting that in India it means 'yes' ? Over one billion people is not a minor exception.On p. 20, under the title Universal Gestures, the first example is the shoulder shrug to show that a person doesn't know or doesn't understand. In France it means that the person doesn't care or that it can't be helped. Perhaps their meaning of universal is not the one universally understood by English speakers ?On p. 109-110, they say that figures E and F are insults in Japan, and figure L means 5 in Japan and 1 in (continental) Europe. None of that is true.On the next page, under 'Why We are All Becoming American', they say that the middle finger raised is originally an American insult that became adopted in other countries because of American TV and movies. It actually originated in Ancient Greece and Rome and has been used in many European countries (especially Mediterranean ones) for a very long time. The authors claim that the American Ring gesture to mean OK is now recognised in many countries due to American influence. It may be recognised, but is hardly ever used in most of Europe and Asia, where it often has a different meaning. They carry on with the words for toilet becoming Americanised, but what does this have to do with body language ? It is also a fallacy, since most speakers of English today are non-native speakers, and Europeans are far more likely to use the word 'toilet' than 'bathroom' because the word 'toilet' exists in most European languages.On p.114, they claim that the French greet each others with a double kiss and the Belgians with a triple kiss. The truth is that the number varies from one to five in France, depending on the region and generation. In Belgium it is only once among French speakers, and usually none among Dutch speakers like in Britain.On p.119, they explain that the American OK sign means zero in France and money in Japan, but they are not done the same way and therefore cannot be misunderstood easily. The OK sign is done with the three other fingers open (pointing up). The French zero is done with the middle to little fingers closed, aligned on the index finger. The Japanese zero is done with the hand placed horizontally, open fingers pointing sideways, and the palm pointing towards the body.On p. 171, we read that the Japanese are the only ones that don't 'eyebrow flash'. Again it's not true. That's an East Asian thing.After the ignorance of other cultures come the scientific errors. On p. 171, the authors say that, contrarily to humans, ""apes lack eye-whites, which means that their prey don't know where the ape is looking or whether they have been spotted, giving the ape a greater chance of hunting success."" Really ? It's a surprising theory to say the least, since all apes aside from humans, and all monkeys are vegetarian.I also wonder what they mean when on p.192 they write ""by animals, birds, fish and primates"". Animals sound redundant here.In the section of personal space (p.193), they explain that lions have a territorial space of 30 miles or more, but that lions raised in captivity have a personal space of only several yards. They confuse personal space (safe distance between two individuals, even of the same family) and the lion's hunting territory, which isn't personal but used by all the lionesses (as it is the females that hunt) belong to the same clan. They make the same confusion afterwards by mentioning countries, cities and other non-personal boundaries. It's sounds highly unscientific and unprofessional on the authors' part to make such a simplification on a book about body language.I wasn't happier to read on the next page that they were going to compare the personal space radius in (and I quote) ""Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, North America, Northern Europe, Scandinavia, Canada or anywhere a culture is 'Westernised' such as Singapore, Guam or Iceland"". Wow ! What's the point of saying Great Britain and Scandinavia is they say Northern Europe ? Why say North America and Canada ? But much worse, why on earth would they consider that Iceland is not part of Scandinavia and believe it is not a Western country but a Westernised one like Singapore ? Do they have any idea of how uneducated that sounds ? On p.202 they insist again on saying ""Northern Europeans and Scandinavians"" as if Scandinavians weren't Northern Europeans. It might be useful for them to look at a world map some time.On p.199, trying to justify that people become more aggressive when their personal space is invaded, the authors claim that ""areas that have the highest human population density also have the highest crime and violence rates"". This is another factual mistake. Countries with very high population densities like Japan, the Netherlands, England, or even India, tend to be more peaceful and have lower crime rates than sparsely populated countries like most of Africa or South America, or even the USA.On p.268, Mr and Mrs Pease claim that ""Twice as many women smoke as men"". This is completely wrong. The WHO data shows that in average, worldwide, smoking is five times as prevalent among men than women. There is hardly any country where women smoke more than men, and in some Muslim countries the percentage of smoking men is one hundred times higher than for women (for example in Morocco and Algeria).After the factual mistakes come the dubious theories. On p.260-1, we read that one of the most common forms of mirroring is yawning, and that ""It was one thought that the purpose of yawning was to oxygenate the body but we now know that it's a form of mirroring that serves to create a rapport with others and to avoid aggression"". The problem with this theory is that yawning is most commonly done when people are alone or with close relatives at home, and therefore doesn't serve to avoid aggression.I also want to add that the quiz at the end of the book is terrible. The pictures are very unclear and it's hard to find all the signals even after reading the descriptions."
193,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/538517-alissa-thorne,4,"I found this book so useful, I decided to listen to it twice in a row.* When it became clear that much of the book was going to be a lengthy list of various subtle body language queues, I groaned at what I anticipated would be a lot of rote memorization. As it turned out, since body language is so tied up with emotions, almost all of the indicators were immediately recognizable. More importantly, they matched with an emotional understanding of what it feels like when exhibiting that indicator, and it feels like when I see others. This made information easy to absorb, and once it did it stuck.The most thought provoking concept in this book is what I mentioned earlier--emotional state and body language are mirrors of one another. That is to say, not only is your body language an expression of your emotion, but your feelings can be affected by changing your physical expressions. One of the more striking examples of this is the idea that if someone has a negative attitude, expressed with crossed arms, you can influence their emotional openness by handing them a pen or cup of coffee, requiring that they uncross their arms.So far, I am primarily becoming more aware of my own body language rather than reading others. That's fine by me--not only is it useful to know what messages you are subconsciousness sending others, it also makes me more aware of my own emotional state.One questionable bit about this book--it makes heavy use of bold claims about gender and other topics that contradict common wisdom. I don't know how supported these claims are, but I take much of the alleged science with a grain of salt.* In part, this is because I kept spacing out or losing my place, so I know I was missing bits."

In any social aspect of life, being able to recognize and use knowledge of body language to our favor can make a difference. Allan and Barbara Pease use their business and research backgrounds to uncover a general overview of body language for use in personal and professional situations. They cover hands,arms, smiles and laguther, cultural differences, hand and thumb gestures, evaluation and deceit signals, eye signals, personal space, legs, thirteen most common gestures, mirroring, signals of cigarettes, glasses and makeup, how the body points, courtship/attraction signals, ownership/territory/height signals, seating arrangements, and interviews/office politics. They also include an assessment at the end. Reading this book brought to light many things I already knew, but never thought about, and gestures I never encountered. I enjoyed the straightforward read, and the helpful visuals accompanying the explanations. I would've preferred less emphasis on business when they assumed in several sections you're persuading someone to make a sale, and more on social situations though much of it is applicable. Also they cover gender differences quite a bit which is useful and link it to biology which I found interesting. Still from a social perspective it's helpful to keep in mind the varieties of each genders' differences rather than to accept the general assumption. That said, I also enjoyed the research studies cited.Overall, this book is a great resource for anyone looking to improve their communication and relationships personal or professional, and especially those in helping/people professions."

196,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1171505-princely,4,"I felt that this book was good, and had accurate things to say about WESTERN gestures. However, I live in Japan, and none of the quote *offensive* gestures mean anything to anyone under thirty five. The business relations section for Japanese was suprisingly off. I mean, every time someone bows, they inspect your shoes? Most of the folks I meet here change from their outside, nice shoes into crappy indoor ones, so everyone's shoes look kind of beaten up when we meet everyone inside :). I'm more suprised at the fact that they didn't research carefully or emphasize more useful Japanese mannerisms, that it is far harder to tell what the Japanese are thinking through body language. They behave differently than Westerners, and many body cues, such as hand gestures, don't apply. The feet gestures, however, are dead on. I find that section useful, but then again it was generally applicable to everybody. As for the book's style, of course, it could have been ghostwritten- it lacked a personal flavor for me that it would have had with an original author. Despite my complaints about its Japanese culture section and writing style, I still give this book a high score. I just found the information fascinating. So many things are being hidden by folks when they talk, but not when they move...it simply blows my mind."

At the time I didn't find it important; but in both personal and professional relationships, body language is crucial in understanding how the other person feels. This book provides a good overview of common body language gestures. I've been told by some, that reading body language can be contradictory. One sign another gives doesn't mean that's how they really feel. Luckily, this book reinforces this cautionary statement by teaching to read body language in clusters and to keep in mind the context in which the body language is given.This book is pretty well laid out in terms of grouping gestures by body part which are by chapter. It makes quick reference a little easier - although I don't feel this book is intended for a reference book. The read itself is really quite quick and easy. Toward the end, there's a self-test chapter to help solidify the knowledgeThe reason why I gave this book one 4 stars is because in some ways, a ""quick guide"" would have been nice. A quick study guide in this only means a smalll chapter recapping all the gestures discussed. A reference, if you will. That could be used to increase the utility of the book to a study guide too."

There seems to be a bias such as ""this behavior equals this meaning."" I have a problem with this simplistic type of interpretation. However, I try to glean the basic underlying concepts and blend that with my own understanding of body language. There is some interesting information in the book. Since reading this book, I've tried to be more observant of people and their body language, but I tell you it's hard. I tend to lapse into my old ways of looking at the world.Anyway, some interesting information here, some of which I have found interesting.

This book made me understand many things about body language that i've never known before to the extent where i started reading & highlighting almost everything! I found it extremely helpful,whether a person is too sure while stating his lie his body can give everything away starting from his eyes to his nose and his arm movements.

After reading How to Speak Dog and noticing much of doggish is found in body language I thought it would be good to have a base level of knowledge about human body language as well. Unfortunately this book isn't really about that. It's a kind of misogynistic guide to the unhealthy world of Sales. Bloody damn and blast! I should have known something was amiss when I found myself in the marketing section of the library rather than social sciences!Really though, unless you're selling widgets, don't read this book. There are a few truths that I have since verified regarding human body language, but there's got to be a better book out there regarding the subject."
204,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4504589-boots,4,"I didn't realize how interesting I would find the subject of body language. This book is written to be entertaining and I would say the authors were fairly successful with that. One of the main issues I have with this book is that some of the authors interpretations of various studies are based on their own opinions, but stated as fact; which had me thinking, ""how did you come to that conclusion?"" Another issue that I found a bit annoying is the fact that the authors seem to shamelessly promote other books they have published. But even with those annoyances, I still might actually read this book again. "
205,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17486478-aziff,4,"There are many body language books out there but none have I found to be as illustrative, interesting or as informative as this. Body Language explores the subtle physical signs we let out and interprets them in sweeping ways, often using examples (public figures like Bill Clinton) to nail down points. And not only limited to body language, A. Pease also jabs in the usage of external accessories such as spectacles which I found amusing and also enlightening. The sitting arrangement in a meeting, how one positions their arms, where your foot points; these are among the different subject areas this book sheds light on."
206,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55164647-yousra,3,"	After studying this book you'll be able to read people better no doubt. Of course it takes some practice to really master the techniques you learn in this book, and you'll be a bit overwhelmed and confused at first...it gets better over time however. With this book you can connect better with people; communicate more effectively, and get across the nonverbal information you really want to convey in a variety of situations, from giving speeches or presentations to being in a job interview. Lot's of VERY valuable information in this book; highly recommended!"
207,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5368332-cole-oberndorfer,5,"Great insight on working with people and truly understanding what their body and what their mouths are saying and are not saying. I find myself constantly looking for the tell-tale clusters of body language and doing my best to interpret them. Truly interesting read and inspiring to find more information on the topic and become a self-taught expert. Lets be honest though, great thing to learn to manipulate and work people your way as well. "
208,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17570957-salma-a-240511,5," I have benefited greatly by reading this book, it helps to understand the behavior of people in various positions. The pictograms,they help a person to understand the idea and analyze body language before they help the reader to translate the situation and analyzed own style. This book helps to know around us more and what we must do in any case or situation. I advise the readers to read this book , because it help a lot and it's very useful too. "
209,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4458112-kelly,3,"I liked this book at the beginning and I definitely learned a few things but the more I read, the more it felt like the author was spouting generalizations as fact. I think parts are research based but claims like most women are not good at running and accountants don't have good social skills took away some of the book's credibility in my eyes not to mention somewhat insulted me. However, it is a light read, written without a serious tone so it is still worth reading in my opinion."
210,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74464328-emanuel-serbanoiu,5,"This is one of the best books I've read this year, definitely better than the other books about body language I've read. It's really important for everybody to know more about this subtle form of communication and I would recommend it to anyone. You will find at least a dozen things you didn't know about before."
211,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32450066-suzie,5,"Another informative, interesting and amusing read from the Pease's. Would definitely recommend! Well written, clear and very useful for everyday life."

You cannot read body language by just analyzing individual gestures you saw depicted here. You have to trust your intuition, but this is a good blueprint for further analysis. Warning: makes you slightly obsessive and less attentive when people speak."

215,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91977885-michael,4,"Body language is an outward reflection of a person's emotional condition. It's about matching what you see and hear in the environment in which it all happens and drawing a probable conclusion. However, most people only see the things they think they are seeing. Early research on communication shows that the total impact of a message is about 7% for spoken words and 38% for vocal, i.e., the voice's tone and 55% for non-verbal. This means that words are used primarily for conveying information and data. For example, a study done between 1970-80 revealed that a person with a strong argument usually wins in a phone conversation. However, in the round table encounter 60 to 80 percent accounts for body language, and usually, the people make initial impressions within 4 minutes of the conversation.According to the book, some people, especially women's, are more perceptive than men - 'women's intuition.' Being perceptive means able to spot the contradictions between someone's words and body language. When we say we have a hunch or gut feeling, we usually mean that their words and body language do not much. And overall, women are good at picking them. In addition, it is usually easy to read children than adults. This could be that adults have less muscle tone in the face. An interesting fact about body language is that it is easy to misread it, yet it is hard to fake it.While talking about body language, it's important to note that it can be different across different cultures, though some body languages like nodding the head, shoulder shrug, smiling are inborn and are usually the same across cultures. For accurately reading body language, the book presents 3 rules.	1. The reading of gestures should be in clusters. This is to mean that an individual gesture might not give or mislead. Gestures are words, and clusters are sentences in body language. To read them correctly, it needs at least three testers in a match. 	2. Look for congruence between gesture clusters and verbal language. If the gestures and the verbal language do not much, women tend to take the gestures. 	3. Gestures should be read in the context. For example, a person sitting in a cold bus waiting with hands crossed (defensive) and chin down (critical/hostile) should not be interpreted negatively.The HandsPalms of a hand are vocal cords of body language because they did more talking than any other body parts. Three are 3 main palm command testers	▪ Palm Up : is a used as a submissive non-threatening gesture.	▪ Palm Down : shows immediate authority.	▪ Palm Closed : shows the speaker figuratively beats his listeners to submission.Fingers also play a role, where a pointing finger gives negative feelings. Also, squeezing your finger into your thumb to make an OK gesture while giving public speech is considered authoritative, but not aggressive.Handshakes can also be used to show dominance- down Palm, submission-up Palm, and equality-vertical.While encountering power player giving down Palm the following two techniques help to disarm. 	1. Step into the left foot first and then move the right foot ahead of the left foot, then put the left foot again in the same position as the right foot. Practically this might be hard to use since most right-handed people tend to step their right leg first but helps a great deal because you are invading their private space. 	2. While a person presents a Palm up position, then put your left hand over his right to form a double handler and straighten the handshake. Also, while posing for a photo with a handshake, its always good to be on the right side as it gives a Palm down advantage. Touching while shaking hands, with the other hand, creates a powerful result. When you meet someone new and shake hands, extend your left arm, give a light touch on elbow or hand as you shake, and repeat their name to confirm you heard it correctly. Facial SmilesNatural smiles produce characteristic wrinkles around the eyes. The fleshy part of the eye between the eyebrow and the eyelid moves downward, and the end of the eyebrows dip slightly with open mouth for true similes. False smiles only pull back the mouth. Smiling attracts people and signifies a submission signal. Also, laughing simulates the body's natural pain killers and feel good enhancers, like the endorphins, helping relieve stress and heal the body. Thus is used as a therapy in hospitals. People who have trouble laughing at the tough things in life often turn to drugs and alcohol to achieve the same feeling that endorphin induced laughter produces.The 5 common types of smiles include: 1. The Tight-lipped Smile : is a kind that stretches the mouse tightly across the face to form a straight line concealing the teeth. This smile sends the message that the similer has withheld opinions or attitudes that will not be shared with you.  2. Twisted smile : is another kind where it shows opposite emotions on each side of the face, one happy one angry. This smile show sarcasm in the western world. 3. Drop-Jaw Smile : is when the lower jaw is dropped to show the person is laughing or playful. 4. Sideway looking up smile  is a playful and secretive pose that affects both genders. Its orientation is, head turned down and away while looking up with a tight-lipped smile. 5. Permanent Smirk is always smiling that everyone wonders what you have been up to.Laughing is more than 30 times as likely to occurs in participants in a social situation than in a solitary setting. This shows that laughing has less to do with jokes and funny stories and more to do with building relationships. Thus people tend to laugh more and longer in a social situation than each will last alone. Women will find a person that makes her laugh more attractive.Arm SignalsAny crossing of the arms in front of the body is perceived as unfavorable. By folding arms, a barrier is formed, i.e., unconscious attempt to block out what we perceive as a threat or undesirable circumstance. When a person has a nervous, negative, or defensive attitude, it will be manifested by folding the hands. Thus, it useful to avoid crossing your arms under any circumstances unless your intention is to show you don't agree or don't want to participate.Types of crossed arms are:	▪ The universal cross arms on the chest to show its defensive. So while giving speeches, if most of the listeners are crossing their arms, the speech needs to be turned to a kind where it turns to a receptive position. On another way to break this is to give the listeners something to hold in their hands like a notebook and pen. It's also good to use arm chaired to avoid people sitting this way, which in turn blocks their listening. 	▪ Fist Clenched Arm crossed shows hostility as well as defensiveness. A verbal or physical attack could happen if it is combined with a tight-lipped simile or clenched teeth and red face.	▪ Double Arm Grip is a self hugging position that shows a negative restrained attitude. It can be seen by doctors in the waiting room, first-time travelers on air. It depicts the person is feeling insecure and not buying what you are selling.	▪ Thumbs up cross arm shows defensiveness with a self-confident attitude. 	▪ Broken zipper position is used by men to protect their vulnerable area. It creates the feeling of having someone else holding your hand. Women's take hugging themselves position where one arm hung while the other takes hold or touches the other arm.	▪ Cuff Link Adjust is used by celebrities to disguise their nervousness.Hand and Thumb GesturesHumans have 27 small bones and dozens of tiny muscles to move the joints. There are more nerve connections between the hands and the brain than in any other part of the body. Because of that, hands can tell what is the person is thinking more easily. The common hand gestures include:	▪ Rubbing palms together to show positive expectancy. If it is slow, it looks sneaky or devious, but the faster shows excitement. 	▪ Thumb fingertip rub to show gesture about money. 	▪ Clenched hands placed centered to the face elbows resting to the desk while sitting shows frustration, restrained anxious or negative attitude. If placed on the desk centered to the body while elbows are at the same level, they show the same attitude with less degree and the less with standing position. 	▪ The Steeple used by superior to subordinate interaction and indicates a confident or self-assured attitude. As a general rule, this gesture should be avoided when you want to be persuasive or win others person confidence as it can sometimes be read as smugness. The Lowered steeple, hands-on thighs can be used to show assurance. 	▪ Face platter is used by ladies to show their faces, usually presenting themselves for a man. 	▪ Hands in the back with Palm-in-Palm show superiority and confidence. The gripping hand wrist shows frustration and anger. The higher it's up, the more the person is frustrated. 	▪ Thumps protrude is a sign of power authority. They can be in Arms folded with thumb us pointing upwards and thumbs out from the pocket.Evaluation and Deceit SignalsLying is the oil that greases our interactions with others and let us maintain friendly social relationships. Such are called White Lies because their goals are to make others feel comfortable instead of telling them the cold hard truth. Malicious Lies are, however, deliberate lies that set out to deceive another for personal benefit. When children lie, they use the hand to face gesture, i.e., putting the hand on the face. For adults, their umber of gulps of saliva increases, which is especially noticeable for a man as he has Adam apples. The following are the eight most common lying gestures. 1. The mouse cover : the hands cover the mouth as the brain subconsciously instructs it to try to suppress the deceitful words that are being said. While you are talking, if someone covers their mouse, it shows that they feel you are hiding something.  2. The nose touch : The human nose expands with blood during lying. This is followed by nose touching repossessed.  3. Itchy nose : is also a response like a nose touch that is used to disguise own deceit words or listener who doubts the speaker's words.  4. Eye rub : is the brain attempt to block it the deceit doubt or distasteful thing it sees, or to avoid having to look at the face of the person who is being lied to.  5. The Ear grab : is a signal that says, 'I don't want to hear it.' It is also a signal that the person heard enough and want to speak.  6. The Neck Scratch : is a gesture that shows doubt or uncertainty and is characteristic of the person to say, I'm not sure I agree. 7. The Collar Pull : is another gesture of telling lies.  8. Fingers in the mouse is an outward indication of an inner need for assurance, so giving a node guarantees a positive move. Evaluations gestures are shown by a closed hand resting on the chin or cheek, often the index finger pointing upward. Rubbing the back of the neck is also another reaction caused by feeling frustrated or fearful. Slapping the back of the neck tells your are being pain-in-the-neck for the issue while slapping the forehead shows reminding the forgotten thing and not intimidated by you mentioning it.Eye SignalsThe eyes are the most revealing and accurate of all human communication signals because they work independently of conscious control. In general, pupils will dilate or contract as your attitude and mood change from positive to negative and vice versa. When someone becomes excited, their pupils can dilate to up to four times their original size. Conversely, an angry, negative mood causes the pupils to contract to what is commonly known as beady little eyes.When people are lying, they are likely to dramatically increase their blinking rate, an unconscious attempt by the person's brain to block you from their sight because they have become bored or disinterested or feel superior to you. In such scenarios, to rattle the person while taking extended blink, quickly step a pace to your left or right.There are three geographical areas-gazing kinds, people look upon while talking to each other. 1. The social gaze : looks on the triangular area on the other persons face that is between the two eyes and noise. This gaze perceived as non-aggressive. 2. The Intimate gaze : looks at the lower body first to establish what sex it is and up between the eyes and below the chin. Women's has a wider peripheral vision that helps her to look at top to bottom while looking at the face. However, because of male tunnel vision, he needs to gaze up and down in a very obvious way. This is the reason why men are accused of ogling women's body at close range though research shows that women do more of it than men. 3. The Power gaze : looks at the triangular area between the eye and middle of the forehead. This gaze is used to treat a person who intimidates or the person you want to make shut up.Other gaze form, The power stare, gives more authority. It is done by looking at the person in narrow eyelids and without blinking. To perform this, move your eyeballs first and then let your head follow while making your shoulders remain still.Another interesting thing about the eyes is the movement they follow while trying to remember something. If a person recalls something that they saw, their eyes will move upward. If they recall something, they heard- they look to the side and tilt their head as if they are listening. If they are recalling a feeling or emotion they'll look down and to the right. And when they are talking to themselves, they look down and to the left.To keep control of where a person is looking while showing something, use a pen to point to the presentation and, at the same time, verbalize what he sees. Next, lift the pen from the presentation and hold it between his eyes and your eyes.continued in the comment section..."

I think another book should be appended so that we can analyse different real situations and put together all we know about body language in practice."
218,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71950414-mariagiulia,2,"A poorly written, not that accurate, superficial and even slightly sexist body language manual that I struggled to finish. What stopped me from giving it only 1 star is that despite the many things I disagreed with, I found anyway a couple of useful pieces of advice. Overall not recommended."
219,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17413971-jinkm,1,"I got this book from the library because I have problems reading another person's body language. However, from the first page I got the feeling this book wouldn't be for someone like me. I saw the other books the author's have written. Here is the list:Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read MapsWhy Men Lie and Women CryWhy Men Can Only do One Thing At A Time and Women Never Stop TalkingThe Little Book of Men and women In my opinion, it's obvious the authors probably subscribe to the belief that men and women are totally and inherently different. And that they probably also believe in inherent gender roles, which, again, in my opinion, is bollocks. But hey, I thought, let's not judge. People's opinions and beliefs evolve and everyone has questionable opinions. That doesn't mean they don't know what they are talking about when it come to body language. So, I decided to give it a try.Eleven pages in I see ""Body language is an outward reflection of a person's emotional condition""Now, as someone who others describe as very stoic and stone-faced and as someone who has trouble with expressing emotion, I found this to be a little narrow minded. I constantly have to explain to people that ""No, I am not angry, I am thinking."" ""No, I am not attacking you, I am trying to have a serious discussion with you, please ignore my angry looking eyeballs."" ""No I am not a serial killer, I just have a very intense face sometimes, okay?!"" XD However, I am willing to consider this is the case for most people and I came to learn about others, so I carry on!  Unfortunately, immediately below the above quote, as an illustrative image to show an example of body language, they inserted a conveniently angled picture of Prince Charles so that it looked like he was grasping a large-chested woman's breasts with the caption of ""Prince Charles finds a bosom buddy"". Now, I'm all for humor and recognize that it makes reading about scientific subjects easier to digest. However, I found this tasteless and inappropriate. Red flag #3. (And it wasn't even the only sexual innuendo :S) However x2 though, we don't require our 'experts' to have appropriate senses of humor, (NASA scientists as an example :D). They are there to make a point and instruct, not to tickle our funny bones SO, I read on. :/ (If you can't tell, I'm a little hard-headed and have trouble listening to my own intuition.) The Final Straw - Not knowing the definition of words- The authors say ""Women have an innate ability to pick up and decipher non verbal signals, as well as having an accurate eye for small details"" I disagree, but I've already decided to ignore their outdated gender opinions. Just in the next paragraph, though, they totally contradict themselves. The authors cite a Harvard study that showed that women have a greater ability to read emotions in situations. Okay, that is in line with what they said, BUT they go on to say in the very next sentence  that men in 'nurturing' careers, like art (what?), acting, and nursing, as well as gay men, scored as well as women. They then go on to say that women are so very good at reading emotions because they ""practice reading signals early"". Which to me, seems to be the exact opposite definition of 'innate'. That's a definite sign of a dodgy book. Now I have a logical reason to quit. Good, I quit. Best decision I've made today. I feel good about quitting. You can tell, because my stance is open and I'm smiling. No really, I'm smiling. It might only be slightly more curved than straight line, but it's a smile.  My recommendation: find a different book to read. One that is more up to date and perhaps is written by some one who is more interested in solid academics than telling crass jokes. Two thumbs down."
220,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6712675-lucas-leite,2,"More impressions  in my personal blog of reviewsNot So Evident Signs Certain gestural groups emitted by the body generate positive or negative influences in the unconscious of the interlocutor, this is the argument put forward by Allan and Barbara Pease in the book The Definitive Guide to Body Language. The authors, professionals with vast experience in business, use their professional experience, latest data and researches to, in a colloquial and brief language, expose to the general public importants tips to interpret behavior in the professional and personal situations. The book deals with meanings gestures offered by the eyes, hands, feet and other expressions and body parts. Moreover, it exposes how elements found in the environment can influence the course of a conversation: how, for example, the position of your chair in relation to the interviewer can assist you in gaining a place of employment or assist in selling a product or service. These tips are very important when you have the notion that the interlocutor form an opinion about the other in just 4 minutes of talking, appealing, unconsciously, much more to the visual attributes and gestures than the competencies inherent to the career or quality of the curriculum. In fact, you'll never get a second chance to make a good first impression.Although richly illustrated, the weak point of this simple language book is the lack of depth. The Definitive Guide to Body Language deal only with situations illustrating it without specifying or explain motivations, it is a behavioral manual. Let, therefore, gaps that can only be fulfilled if the reader looking for more technical books in the area. If the goal is get tips, this is a good book. But if the intention is to look hard into the study of body language, this is a book that can be considered only introductory.***Sinais pouco evidentesDeterminados grupos gestuais emitidos pelo corpo geram influências negativas ou positivas no inconsciente do interlocutor, esta é a tese defendida por Allan e Barbara Pease no livro Desvendando os segredos da linguagem corporal. Os autores, profissionais de vasta experiência no mundo empresarial, utilizam-se da sua vivência profissional, dados e mais recentes pesquisas para, numa linguagem coloquial e breve, passar para o grande público importantes dicas de interpretação e comportamento em situações no âmbito profissional e pessoal.O livro trata de significados gestuais oferecidos pelos olhos, mãos, pés entre outras expressões e partes do corpo. Além disso, expõem como os elementos encontrados no ambiente podem influenciar nos rumos de uma conversa: o quanto, por exemplo, a posição de sua cadeira em relação ao entrevistador pode auxiliá-lo na conquista de uma vaga de emprego ou auxiliá-lo na venda de um serviço/produto.Essas dicas são muito importantes quando se tem a noção de que o interlocutor forma uma opinião sobre o outro em apenas 4 minutos de conversa, apelando, inconscientemente, muito mais para os atributos visuais do que para as competências imanentes à carreira profissional ou qualidade do currículo. De fato, a primeira impressão muitas vezes é a que fica.Embora ricamente ilustrado, o ponto fraco deste livro de simples linguagem está na falta de profundidade. Desvendando os segredos da linguagem corporal limita-se a exemplificar situações sem especificar ou explicar motivações, trata-se de um manual comportamental. Deixa, por isso, lacunas que só podem ser preenchidas se o leitor procurar por livros mais técnicos dentro da área. Se o objetivo é captar dicas, este é um bom livro. Mas se a intenção é debruçar-se sobre o estudo da linguagem corporal, este é um livro que pode ser considerado apenas introdutório. "

He brings the different aspects into conscious thinking of how these things developed by evolution and have been hardwired into brain to interpret.I cannot emphasize more on how fantastic book it was! It has helped me immensely, especially the courtship gestures!"
222,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95025914-wilmington,2,"I have read and enjoyed Allan and Barbara Pease's other bestsellers Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps and Why Men Lie and Women Cry: How to Get What You Want Out of Life by Asking and therefore was really looking forward to reading this book. It was quite a disappointment. Half of the body language described seems perfectly obvious to me. Some of the explanations were useful, but others were dubious or downright mistaken.It didn't start well when on page 7 the caption under Schwarzenegger showing the thumb up explained that it meant five in Japan, which is utterly false. I can forgive one mistake, but not dozens, and the book is filled with them. Here are other examples.On p. 18-19, the authors say that shaking the head from side to side to indicate 'no' is universal. Are they forgetting that in India it means 'yes' ? Over one billion people is not a minor exception.On p. 20, under the title Universal Gestures, the first example is the shoulder shrug to show that a person doesn't know or doesn't understand. In France it means that the person doesn't care or that it can't be helped. Perhaps their meaning of universal is not the one universally understood by English speakers ?On p. 109-110, they say that figures E and F are insults in Japan, and figure L means 5 in Japan and 1 in (continental) Europe. None of that is true.On the next page, under 'Why We are All Becoming American', they say that the middle finger raised is originally an American insult that became adopted in other countries because of American TV and movies. It actually originated in Ancient Greece and Rome and has been used in many European countries (especially Mediterranean ones) for a very long time. The authors claim that the American Ring gesture to mean OK is now recognised in many countries due to American influence. It may be recognised, but is hardly ever used in most of Europe and Asia, where it often has a different meaning. They carry on with the words for toilet becoming Americanised, but what does this have to do with body language ? It is also a fallacy, since most speakers of English today are non-native speakers, and Europeans are far more likely to use the word 'toilet' than 'bathroom' because the word 'toilet' exists in most European languages.On p.114, they claim that the French greet each others with a double kiss and the Belgians with a triple kiss. The truth is that the number varies from one to five in France, depending on the region and generation. In Belgium it is only once among French speakers, and usually none among Dutch speakers like in Britain.On p.119, they explain that the American OK sign means zero in France and money in Japan, but they are not done the same way and therefore cannot be misunderstood easily. The OK sign is done with the three other fingers open (pointing up). The French zero is done with the middle to little fingers closed, aligned on the index finger. The Japanese zero is done with the hand placed horizontally, open fingers pointing sideways, and the palm pointing towards the body.On p. 171, we read that the Japanese are the only ones that don't 'eyebrow flash'. Again it's not true. That's an East Asian thing.After the ignorance of other cultures come the scientific errors. On p. 171, the authors say that, contrarily to humans, ""apes lack eye-whites, which means that their prey don't know where the ape is looking or whether they have been spotted, giving the ape a greater chance of hunting success."" Really ? It's a surprising theory to say the least, since all apes aside from humans, and all monkeys are vegetarian.I also wonder what they mean when on p.192 they write ""by animals, birds, fish and primates"". Animals sound redundant here.In the section of personal space (p.193), they explain that lions have a territorial space of 30 miles or more, but that lions raised in captivity have a personal space of only several yards. They confuse personal space (safe distance between two individuals, even of the same family) and the lion's hunting territory, which isn't personal but used by all the lionesses (as it is the females that hunt) belong to the same clan. They make the same confusion afterwards by mentioning countries, cities and other non-personal boundaries. It's sounds highly unscientific and unprofessional on the authors' part to make such a simplification on a book about body language.I wasn't happier to read on the next page that they were going to compare the personal space radius in (and I quote) ""Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, North America, Northern Europe, Scandinavia, Canada or anywhere a culture is 'Westernised' such as Singapore, Guam or Iceland"". Wow ! What's the point of saying Great Britain and Scandinavia is they say Northern Europe ? Why say North America and Canada ? But much worse, why on earth would they consider that Iceland is not part of Scandinavia and believe it is not a Western country but a Westernised one like Singapore ? Do they have any idea of how uneducated that sounds ? On p.202 they insist again on saying ""Northern Europeans and Scandinavians"" as if Scandinavians weren't Northern Europeans. It might be useful for them to look at a world map some time.On p.199, trying to justify that people become more aggressive when their personal space is invaded, the authors claim that ""areas that have the highest human population density also have the highest crime and violence rates"". This is another factual mistake. Countries with very high population densities like Japan, the Netherlands, England, or even India, tend to be more peaceful and have lower crime rates than sparsely populated countries like most of Africa or South America, or even the USA.On p.268, Mr and Mrs Pease claim that ""Twice as many women smoke as men"". This is completely wrong. The WHO data shows that in average, worldwide, smoking is five times as prevalent among men than women. There is hardly any country where women smoke more than men, and in some Muslim countries the percentage of smoking men is one hundred times higher than for women (for example in Morocco and Algeria).After the factual mistakes come the dubious theories. On p.260-1, we read that one of the most common forms of mirroring is yawning, and that ""It was one thought that the purpose of yawning was to oxygenate the body but we now know that it's a form of mirroring that serves to create a rapport with others and to avoid aggression"". The problem with this theory is that yawning is most commonly done when people are alone or with close relatives at home, and therefore doesn't serve to avoid aggression.I also want to add that the quiz at the end of the book is terrible. The pictures are very unclear and it's hard to find all the signals even after reading the descriptions."
223,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/538517-alissa-thorne,4,"I found this book so useful, I decided to listen to it twice in a row.* When it became clear that much of the book was going to be a lengthy list of various subtle body language queues, I groaned at what I anticipated would be a lot of rote memorization. As it turned out, since body language is so tied up with emotions, almost all of the indicators were immediately recognizable. More importantly, they matched with an emotional understanding of what it feels like when exhibiting that indicator, and it feels like when I see others. This made information easy to absorb, and once it did it stuck.The most thought provoking concept in this book is what I mentioned earlier--emotional state and body language are mirrors of one another. That is to say, not only is your body language an expression of your emotion, but your feelings can be affected by changing your physical expressions. One of the more striking examples of this is the idea that if someone has a negative attitude, expressed with crossed arms, you can influence their emotional openness by handing them a pen or cup of coffee, requiring that they uncross their arms.So far, I am primarily becoming more aware of my own body language rather than reading others. That's fine by me--not only is it useful to know what messages you are subconsciousness sending others, it also makes me more aware of my own emotional state.One questionable bit about this book--it makes heavy use of bold claims about gender and other topics that contradict common wisdom. I don't know how supported these claims are, but I take much of the alleged science with a grain of salt.* In part, this is because I kept spacing out or losing my place, so I know I was missing bits."
224,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22787654-justin,4,"Nonverbal signals constitutes the majority of communication, and often gets overlooked. In any social aspect of life, being able to recognize and use knowledge of body language to our favor can make a difference. Allan and Barbara Pease use their business and research backgrounds to uncover a general overview of body language for use in personal and professional situations. They cover hands,arms, smiles and laguther, cultural differences, hand and thumb gestures, evaluation and deceit signals, eye signals, personal space, legs, thirteen most common gestures, mirroring, signals of cigarettes, glasses and makeup, how the body points, courtship/attraction signals, ownership/territory/height signals, seating arrangements, and interviews/office politics. They also include an assessment at the end. Reading this book brought to light many things I already knew, but never thought about, and gestures I never encountered. I enjoyed the straightforward read, and the helpful visuals accompanying the explanations. I would've preferred less emphasis on business when they assumed in several sections you're persuading someone to make a sale, and more on social situations though much of it is applicable. Also they cover gender differences quite a bit which is useful and link it to biology which I found interesting. Still from a social perspective it's helpful to keep in mind the varieties of each genders' differences rather than to accept the general assumption. That said, I also enjoyed the research studies cited.Overall, this book is a great resource for anyone looking to improve their communication and relationships personal or professional, and especially those in helping/people professions."

226,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1171505-princely,4,"I felt that this book was good, and had accurate things to say about WESTERN gestures. However, I live in Japan, and none of the quote *offensive* gestures mean anything to anyone under thirty five. The business relations section for Japanese was suprisingly off. I mean, every time someone bows, they inspect your shoes? Most of the folks I meet here change from their outside, nice shoes into crappy indoor ones, so everyone's shoes look kind of beaten up when we meet everyone inside :). I'm more suprised at the fact that they didn't research carefully or emphasize more useful Japanese mannerisms, that it is far harder to tell what the Japanese are thinking through body language. They behave differently than Westerners, and many body cues, such as hand gestures, don't apply. The feet gestures, however, are dead on. I find that section useful, but then again it was generally applicable to everybody. As for the book's style, of course, it could have been ghostwritten- it lacked a personal flavor for me that it would have had with an original author. Despite my complaints about its Japanese culture section and writing style, I still give this book a high score. I just found the information fascinating. So many things are being hidden by folks when they talk, but not when they move...it simply blows my mind."

At the time I didn't find it important; but in both personal and professional relationships, body language is crucial in understanding how the other person feels. This book provides a good overview of common body language gestures. I've been told by some, that reading body language can be contradictory. One sign another gives doesn't mean that's how they really feel. Luckily, this book reinforces this cautionary statement by teaching to read body language in clusters and to keep in mind the context in which the body language is given.This book is pretty well laid out in terms of grouping gestures by body part which are by chapter. It makes quick reference a little easier - although I don't feel this book is intended for a reference book. The read itself is really quite quick and easy. Toward the end, there's a self-test chapter to help solidify the knowledgeThe reason why I gave this book one 4 stars is because in some ways, a ""quick guide"" would have been nice. A quick study guide in this only means a smalll chapter recapping all the gestures discussed. A reference, if you will. That could be used to increase the utility of the book to a study guide too."

I bought this book from Amazon and read it before the book by Joe Navarro (also on my list)The authors appear to be sales/marketing people and conduct workshops and trainings on reading body language. There seems to be a bias such as ""this behavior equals this meaning."" I have a problem with this simplistic type of interpretation. However, I try to glean the basic underlying concepts and blend that with my own understanding of body language. There is some interesting information in the book. Since reading this book, I've tried to be more observant of people and their body language, but I tell you it's hard. I tend to lapse into my old ways of looking at the world.Anyway, some interesting information here, some of which I have found interesting. If nothing, it has made me much more conscious of my own body language and how I hold myself!"

It might not be your typical number one novel but it's still such a good read to me! I got so hooked on this book that i finished it in two days. Sometimes when it comes to words,people don't really say much & we always want to get to know the self that's behind these words. This book made me understand many things about body language that i've never known before to the extent where i started reading & highlighting almost everything! I found it extremely helpful,whether a person is too sure while stating his lie his body can give everything away starting from his eyes to his nose and his arm movements. I definitely would give this book 5 stars just because it doesn't sound 'sciency'at all,it was a really fun & humorous read filled with facts & helpful tips!

Now I understand why I can go past what I hear and see what's true, for those of you that can't or those who want to improve decoding people, this is a must read. I will admit I have learned more. This book touches on human beings body language, such as how we cross our legs, touch our face, put things to our mouth such as pen chewing, etc. It decodes even the way we talk with our hands and what it means. There is some info too on hand gestures that the western world uses that offends in other countries. I highly enjoyed this novel and look forward to reading other books written by Allan and Barbara Pease. It must have been a ball researching for thid book. "

Topics include the basics of body language, and then to specific elements including hand and arm movement and gestures, facial expressions, eye signals, leg and body positioning.

I should have known something was amiss when I found myself in the marketing section of the library rather than social sciences!Really though, unless you're selling widgets, don't read this book.

This book is written to be entertaining and I would say the authors were fairly successful with that. One of the main issues I have with this book is that some of the authors interpretations of various studies are based on their own opinions, but stated as fact; which had me thinking, ""how did you come to that conclusion?"" Another issue that I found a bit annoying is the fact that the authors seem to shamelessly promote other books they have published.

Body Language explores the subtle physical signs we let out and interprets them in sweeping ways, often using examples (public figures like Bill Clinton) to nail down points. And not only limited to body language, A. Pease also jabs in the usage of external accessories such as spectacles which I found amusing and also enlightening. The sitting arrangement in a meeting, how one positions their arms, where your foot points; these are among the different subject areas this book sheds light on."

The pictograms,they help a person to understand the idea and analyze body language before they help the reader to translate the situation and analyzed own style.

I think parts are research based but claims like most women are not good at running and accountants don't have good social skills took away some of the book's credibility in my eyes not to mention somewhat insulted me.

245,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91977885-michael,4,"Body language is an outward reflection of a person's emotional condition. It's about matching what you see and hear in the environment in which it all happens and drawing a probable conclusion. However, most people only see the things they think they are seeing. Early research on communication shows that the total impact of a message is about 7% for spoken words and 38% for vocal, i.e., the voice's tone and 55% for non-verbal. This means that words are used primarily for conveying information and data. For example, a study done between 1970-80 revealed that a person with a strong argument usually wins in a phone conversation. However, in the round table encounter 60 to 80 percent accounts for body language, and usually, the people make initial impressions within 4 minutes of the conversation.According to the book, some people, especially women's, are more perceptive than men - 'women's intuition.' Being perceptive means able to spot the contradictions between someone's words and body language. When we say we have a hunch or gut feeling, we usually mean that their words and body language do not much. And overall, women are good at picking them. In addition, it is usually easy to read children than adults. This could be that adults have less muscle tone in the face. An interesting fact about body language is that it is easy to misread it, yet it is hard to fake it.While talking about body language, it's important to note that it can be different across different cultures, though some body languages like nodding the head, shoulder shrug, smiling are inborn and are usually the same across cultures. For accurately reading body language, the book presents 3 rules.	1. The reading of gestures should be in clusters. This is to mean that an individual gesture might not give or mislead. Gestures are words, and clusters are sentences in body language. To read them correctly, it needs at least three testers in a match. 	2. Look for congruence between gesture clusters and verbal language. If the gestures and the verbal language do not much, women tend to take the gestures. 	3. Gestures should be read in the context. For example, a person sitting in a cold bus waiting with hands crossed (defensive) and chin down (critical/hostile) should not be interpreted negatively.The HandsPalms of a hand are vocal cords of body language because they did more talking than any other body parts. Three are 3 main palm command testers	▪ Palm Up : is a used as a submissive non-threatening gesture.	▪ Palm Down : shows immediate authority.	▪ Palm Closed : shows the speaker figuratively beats his listeners to submission.Fingers also play a role, where a pointing finger gives negative feelings. Also, squeezing your finger into your thumb to make an OK gesture while giving public speech is considered authoritative, but not aggressive.Handshakes can also be used to show dominance- down Palm, submission-up Palm, and equality-vertical.While encountering power player giving down Palm the following two techniques help to disarm. 	1. Step into the left foot first and then move the right foot ahead of the left foot, then put the left foot again in the same position as the right foot. Practically this might be hard to use since most right-handed people tend to step their right leg first but helps a great deal because you are invading their private space. 	2. While a person presents a Palm up position, then put your left hand over his right to form a double handler and straighten the handshake. Also, while posing for a photo with a handshake, its always good to be on the right side as it gives a Palm down advantage. Touching while shaking hands, with the other hand, creates a powerful result. When you meet someone new and shake hands, extend your left arm, give a light touch on elbow or hand as you shake, and repeat their name to confirm you heard it correctly. Facial SmilesNatural smiles produce characteristic wrinkles around the eyes. The fleshy part of the eye between the eyebrow and the eyelid moves downward, and the end of the eyebrows dip slightly with open mouth for true similes. False smiles only pull back the mouth. Smiling attracts people and signifies a submission signal. Also, laughing simulates the body's natural pain killers and feel good enhancers, like the endorphins, helping relieve stress and heal the body. Thus is used as a therapy in hospitals. People who have trouble laughing at the tough things in life often turn to drugs and alcohol to achieve the same feeling that endorphin induced laughter produces.The 5 common types of smiles include: 1. The Tight-lipped Smile : is a kind that stretches the mouse tightly across the face to form a straight line concealing the teeth. This smile sends the message that the similer has withheld opinions or attitudes that will not be shared with you.  2. Twisted smile : is another kind where it shows opposite emotions on each side of the face, one happy one angry. This smile show sarcasm in the western world. 3. Drop-Jaw Smile : is when the lower jaw is dropped to show the person is laughing or playful. 4. Sideway looking up smile  is a playful and secretive pose that affects both genders. Its orientation is, head turned down and away while looking up with a tight-lipped smile. 5. Permanent Smirk is always smiling that everyone wonders what you have been up to.Laughing is more than 30 times as likely to occurs in participants in a social situation than in a solitary setting. This shows that laughing has less to do with jokes and funny stories and more to do with building relationships. Thus people tend to laugh more and longer in a social situation than each will last alone. Women will find a person that makes her laugh more attractive.Arm SignalsAny crossing of the arms in front of the body is perceived as unfavorable. By folding arms, a barrier is formed, i.e., unconscious attempt to block out what we perceive as a threat or undesirable circumstance. When a person has a nervous, negative, or defensive attitude, it will be manifested by folding the hands. Thus, it useful to avoid crossing your arms under any circumstances unless your intention is to show you don't agree or don't want to participate.Types of crossed arms are:	▪ The universal cross arms on the chest to show its defensive. So while giving speeches, if most of the listeners are crossing their arms, the speech needs to be turned to a kind where it turns to a receptive position. On another way to break this is to give the listeners something to hold in their hands like a notebook and pen. It's also good to use arm chaired to avoid people sitting this way, which in turn blocks their listening. 	▪ Fist Clenched Arm crossed shows hostility as well as defensiveness. A verbal or physical attack could happen if it is combined with a tight-lipped simile or clenched teeth and red face.	▪ Double Arm Grip is a self hugging position that shows a negative restrained attitude. It can be seen by doctors in the waiting room, first-time travelers on air. It depicts the person is feeling insecure and not buying what you are selling.	▪ Thumbs up cross arm shows defensiveness with a self-confident attitude. 	▪ Broken zipper position is used by men to protect their vulnerable area. It creates the feeling of having someone else holding your hand. Women's take hugging themselves position where one arm hung while the other takes hold or touches the other arm.	▪ Cuff Link Adjust is used by celebrities to disguise their nervousness.Hand and Thumb GesturesHumans have 27 small bones and dozens of tiny muscles to move the joints. There are more nerve connections between the hands and the brain than in any other part of the body. Because of that, hands can tell what is the person is thinking more easily. The common hand gestures include:	▪ Rubbing palms together to show positive expectancy. If it is slow, it looks sneaky or devious, but the faster shows excitement. 	▪ Thumb fingertip rub to show gesture about money. 	▪ Clenched hands placed centered to the face elbows resting to the desk while sitting shows frustration, restrained anxious or negative attitude. If placed on the desk centered to the body while elbows are at the same level, they show the same attitude with less degree and the less with standing position. 	▪ The Steeple used by superior to subordinate interaction and indicates a confident or self-assured attitude. As a general rule, this gesture should be avoided when you want to be persuasive or win others person confidence as it can sometimes be read as smugness. The Lowered steeple, hands-on thighs can be used to show assurance. 	▪ Face platter is used by ladies to show their faces, usually presenting themselves for a man. 	▪ Hands in the back with Palm-in-Palm show superiority and confidence. The gripping hand wrist shows frustration and anger. The higher it's up, the more the person is frustrated. 	▪ Thumps protrude is a sign of power authority. They can be in Arms folded with thumb us pointing upwards and thumbs out from the pocket.Evaluation and Deceit SignalsLying is the oil that greases our interactions with others and let us maintain friendly social relationships. Such are called White Lies because their goals are to make others feel comfortable instead of telling them the cold hard truth. Malicious Lies are, however, deliberate lies that set out to deceive another for personal benefit. When children lie, they use the hand to face gesture, i.e., putting the hand on the face. For adults, their umber of gulps of saliva increases, which is especially noticeable for a man as he has Adam apples. The following are the eight most common lying gestures. 1. The mouse cover : the hands cover the mouth as the brain subconsciously instructs it to try to suppress the deceitful words that are being said. While you are talking, if someone covers their mouse, it shows that they feel you are hiding something.  2. The nose touch : The human nose expands with blood during lying. This is followed by nose touching repossessed.  3. Itchy nose : is also a response like a nose touch that is used to disguise own deceit words or listener who doubts the speaker's words.  4. Eye rub : is the brain attempt to block it the deceit doubt or distasteful thing it sees, or to avoid having to look at the face of the person who is being lied to.  5. The Ear grab : is a signal that says, 'I don't want to hear it.' It is also a signal that the person heard enough and want to speak.  6. The Neck Scratch : is a gesture that shows doubt or uncertainty and is characteristic of the person to say, I'm not sure I agree. 7. The Collar Pull : is another gesture of telling lies.  8. Fingers in the mouse is an outward indication of an inner need for assurance, so giving a node guarantees a positive move. Evaluations gestures are shown by a closed hand resting on the chin or cheek, often the index finger pointing upward. Rubbing the back of the neck is also another reaction caused by feeling frustrated or fearful. Slapping the back of the neck tells your are being pain-in-the-neck for the issue while slapping the forehead shows reminding the forgotten thing and not intimidated by you mentioning it.Eye SignalsThe eyes are the most revealing and accurate of all human communication signals because they work independently of conscious control. In general, pupils will dilate or contract as your attitude and mood change from positive to negative and vice versa. When someone becomes excited, their pupils can dilate to up to four times their original size. Conversely, an angry, negative mood causes the pupils to contract to what is commonly known as beady little eyes.When people are lying, they are likely to dramatically increase their blinking rate, an unconscious attempt by the person's brain to block you from their sight because they have become bored or disinterested or feel superior to you. In such scenarios, to rattle the person while taking extended blink, quickly step a pace to your left or right.There are three geographical areas-gazing kinds, people look upon while talking to each other. 1. The social gaze : looks on the triangular area on the other persons face that is between the two eyes and noise. This gaze perceived as non-aggressive. 2. The Intimate gaze : looks at the lower body first to establish what sex it is and up between the eyes and below the chin. Women's has a wider peripheral vision that helps her to look at top to bottom while looking at the face. However, because of male tunnel vision, he needs to gaze up and down in a very obvious way. This is the reason why men are accused of ogling women's body at close range though research shows that women do more of it than men. 3. The Power gaze : looks at the triangular area between the eye and middle of the forehead. This gaze is used to treat a person who intimidates or the person you want to make shut up.Other gaze form, The power stare, gives more authority. It is done by looking at the person in narrow eyelids and without blinking. To perform this, move your eyeballs first and then let your head follow while making your shoulders remain still.Another interesting thing about the eyes is the movement they follow while trying to remember something. If a person recalls something that they saw, their eyes will move upward. If they recall something, they heard- they look to the side and tilt their head as if they are listening. If they are recalling a feeling or emotion they'll look down and to the right. And when they are talking to themselves, they look down and to the left.To keep control of where a person is looking while showing something, use a pen to point to the presentation and, at the same time, verbalize what he sees. Next, lift the pen from the presentation and hold it between his eyes and your eyes.continued in the comment section..."

However, from the first page I got the feeling this book wouldn't be for someone like me. I saw the other books the author's have written. Here is the list:Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read MapsWhy Men Lie and Women CryWhy Men Can Only do One Thing At A Time and Women Never Stop TalkingThe Little Book of Men and women In my opinion, it's obvious the authors probably subscribe to the belief that men and women are totally and inherently different. And that they probably also believe in inherent gender roles, which, again, in my opinion, is bollocks. But hey, I thought, let's not judge. People's opinions and beliefs evolve and everyone has questionable opinions. That doesn't mean they don't know what they are talking about when it come to body language. So, I decided to give it a try.Eleven pages in I see ""Body language is an outward reflection of a person's emotional condition""Now, as someone who others describe as very stoic and stone-faced and as someone who has trouble with expressing emotion, I found this to be a little narrow minded. I constantly have to explain to people that ""No, I am not angry, I am thinking."" ""No, I am not attacking you, I am trying to have a serious discussion with you, please ignore my angry looking eyeballs."" ""No I am not a serial killer, I just have a very intense face sometimes, okay?!"" XD However, I am willing to consider this is the case for most people and I came to learn about others, so I carry on!  Unfortunately, immediately below the above quote, as an illustrative image to show an example of body language, they inserted a conveniently angled picture of Prince Charles so that it looked like he was grasping a large-chested woman's breasts with the caption of ""Prince Charles finds a bosom buddy"". Now, I'm all for humor and recognize that it makes reading about scientific subjects easier to digest. However, I found this tasteless and inappropriate. Red flag #3. (And it wasn't even the only sexual innuendo :S) However x2 though, we don't require our 'experts' to have appropriate senses of humor, (NASA scientists as an example :D). They are there to make a point and instruct, not to tickle our funny bones SO, I read on. :/ (If you can't tell, I'm a little hard-headed and have trouble listening to my own intuition.) The Final Straw - Not knowing the definition of words- The authors say ""Women have an innate ability to pick up and decipher non verbal signals, as well as having an accurate eye for small details"" I disagree, but I've already decided to ignore their outdated gender opinions. Just in the next paragraph, though, they totally contradict themselves. The authors cite a Harvard study that showed that women have a greater ability to read emotions in situations. Okay, that is in line with what they said, BUT they go on to say in the very next sentence  that men in 'nurturing' careers, like art (what?), acting, and nursing, as well as gay men, scored as well as women. They then go on to say that women are so very good at reading emotions because they ""practice reading signals early"". Which to me, seems to be the exact opposite definition of 'innate'. That's a definite sign of a dodgy book. Now I have a logical reason to quit. Good, I quit. Best decision I've made today. I feel good about quitting. You can tell, because my stance is open and I'm smiling. No really, I'm smiling. It might only be slightly more curved than straight line, but it's a smile.  My recommendation: find a different book to read. One that is more up to date and perhaps is written by some one who is more interested in solid academics than telling crass jokes. Two thumbs down."

The authors, professionals with vast experience in business, use their professional experience, latest data and researches to, in a colloquial and brief language, expose to the general public importants tips to interpret behavior in the professional and personal situations. The book deals with meanings gestures offered by the eyes, hands, feet and other expressions and body parts. Moreover, it exposes how elements found in the environment can influence the course of a conversation: how, for example, the position of your chair in relation to the interviewer can assist you in gaining a place of employment or assist in selling a product or service. These tips are very important when you have the notion that the interlocutor form an opinion about the other in just 4 minutes of talking, appealing, unconsciously, much more to the visual attributes and gestures than the competencies inherent to the career or quality of the curriculum. In fact, you'll never get a second chance to make a good first impression.Although richly illustrated, the weak point of this simple language book is the lack of depth. The Definitive Guide to Body Language deal only with situations illustrating it without specifying or explain motivations, it is a behavioral manual. Let, therefore, gaps that can only be fulfilled if the reader looking for more technical books in the area. If the goal is get tips, this is a good book. But if the intention is to look hard into the study of body language, this is a book that can be considered only introductory.***Sinais pouco evidentesDeterminados grupos gestuais emitidos pelo corpo geram influências negativas ou positivas no inconsciente do interlocutor, esta é a tese defendida por Allan e Barbara Pease no livro Desvendando os segredos da linguagem corporal. Os autores, profissionais de vasta experiência no mundo empresarial, utilizam-se da sua vivência profissional, dados e mais recentes pesquisas para, numa linguagem coloquial e breve, passar para o grande público importantes dicas de interpretação e comportamento em situações no âmbito profissional e pessoal.O livro trata de significados gestuais oferecidos pelos olhos, mãos, pés entre outras expressões e partes do corpo. Além disso, expõem como os elementos encontrados no ambiente podem influenciar nos rumos de uma conversa: o quanto, por exemplo, a posição de sua cadeira em relação ao entrevistador pode auxiliá-lo na conquista de uma vaga de emprego ou auxiliá-lo na venda de um serviço/produto.Essas dicas são muito importantes quando se tem a noção de que o interlocutor forma uma opinião sobre o outro em apenas 4 minutos de conversa, apelando, inconscientemente, muito mais para os atributos visuais do que para as competências imanentes à carreira profissional ou qualidade do currículo. De fato, a primeira impressão muitas vezes é a que fica.Embora ricamente ilustrado, o ponto fraco deste livro de simples linguagem está na falta de profundidade. Desvendando os segredos da linguagem corporal limita-se a exemplificar situações sem especificar ou explicar motivações, trata-se de um manual comportamental. Deixa, por isso, lacunas que só podem ser preenchidas se o leitor procurar por livros mais técnicos dentro da área. Se o objetivo é captar dicas, este é um bom livro. Mas se a intenção é debruçar-se sobre o estudo da linguagem corporal, este é um livro que pode ser considerado apenas introdutório. "

He brings the different aspects into conscious thinking of how these things developed by evolution and have been hardwired into brain to interpret.I cannot emphasize more on how fantastic book it was! It has helped me immensely, especially the courtship gestures!"
252,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95025914-wilmington,2,"I have read and enjoyed Allan and Barbara Pease's other bestsellers Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps and Why Men Lie and Women Cry: How to Get What You Want Out of Life by Asking and therefore was really looking forward to reading this book. It was quite a disappointment. Half of the body language described seems perfectly obvious to me. Some of the explanations were useful, but others were dubious or downright mistaken.It didn't start well when on page 7 the caption under Schwarzenegger showing the thumb up explained that it meant five in Japan, which is utterly false. I can forgive one mistake, but not dozens, and the book is filled with them. Here are other examples.On p. 18-19, the authors say that shaking the head from side to side to indicate 'no' is universal. Are they forgetting that in India it means 'yes' ? Over one billion people is not a minor exception.On p. 20, under the title Universal Gestures, the first example is the shoulder shrug to show that a person doesn't know or doesn't understand. In France it means that the person doesn't care or that it can't be helped. Perhaps their meaning of universal is not the one universally understood by English speakers ?On p. 109-110, they say that figures E and F are insults in Japan, and figure L means 5 in Japan and 1 in (continental) Europe. None of that is true.On the next page, under 'Why We are All Becoming American', they say that the middle finger raised is originally an American insult that became adopted in other countries because of American TV and movies. It actually originated in Ancient Greece and Rome and has been used in many European countries (especially Mediterranean ones) for a very long time. The authors claim that the American Ring gesture to mean OK is now recognised in many countries due to American influence. It may be recognised, but is hardly ever used in most of Europe and Asia, where it often has a different meaning. They carry on with the words for toilet becoming Americanised, but what does this have to do with body language ? It is also a fallacy, since most speakers of English today are non-native speakers, and Europeans are far more likely to use the word 'toilet' than 'bathroom' because the word 'toilet' exists in most European languages.On p.114, they claim that the French greet each others with a double kiss and the Belgians with a triple kiss. The truth is that the number varies from one to five in France, depending on the region and generation. In Belgium it is only once among French speakers, and usually none among Dutch speakers like in Britain.On p.119, they explain that the American OK sign means zero in France and money in Japan, but they are not done the same way and therefore cannot be misunderstood easily. The OK sign is done with the three other fingers open (pointing up). The French zero is done with the middle to little fingers closed, aligned on the index finger. The Japanese zero is done with the hand placed horizontally, open fingers pointing sideways, and the palm pointing towards the body.On p. 171, we read that the Japanese are the only ones that don't 'eyebrow flash'. Again it's not true. That's an East Asian thing.After the ignorance of other cultures come the scientific errors. On p. 171, the authors say that, contrarily to humans, ""apes lack eye-whites, which means that their prey don't know where the ape is looking or whether they have been spotted, giving the ape a greater chance of hunting success."" Really ? It's a surprising theory to say the least, since all apes aside from humans, and all monkeys are vegetarian.I also wonder what they mean when on p.192 they write ""by animals, birds, fish and primates"". Animals sound redundant here.In the section of personal space (p.193), they explain that lions have a territorial space of 30 miles or more, but that lions raised in captivity have a personal space of only several yards. They confuse personal space (safe distance between two individuals, even of the same family) and the lion's hunting territory, which isn't personal but used by all the lionesses (as it is the females that hunt) belong to the same clan. They make the same confusion afterwards by mentioning countries, cities and other non-personal boundaries. It's sounds highly unscientific and unprofessional on the authors' part to make such a simplification on a book about body language.I wasn't happier to read on the next page that they were going to compare the personal space radius in (and I quote) ""Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, North America, Northern Europe, Scandinavia, Canada or anywhere a culture is 'Westernised' such as Singapore, Guam or Iceland"". Wow ! What's the point of saying Great Britain and Scandinavia is they say Northern Europe ? Why say North America and Canada ? But much worse, why on earth would they consider that Iceland is not part of Scandinavia and believe it is not a Western country but a Westernised one like Singapore ? Do they have any idea of how uneducated that sounds ? On p.202 they insist again on saying ""Northern Europeans and Scandinavians"" as if Scandinavians weren't Northern Europeans. It might be useful for them to look at a world map some time.On p.199, trying to justify that people become more aggressive when their personal space is invaded, the authors claim that ""areas that have the highest human population density also have the highest crime and violence rates"". This is another factual mistake. Countries with very high population densities like Japan, the Netherlands, England, or even India, tend to be more peaceful and have lower crime rates than sparsely populated countries like most of Africa or South America, or even the USA.On p.268, Mr and Mrs Pease claim that ""Twice as many women smoke as men"". This is completely wrong. The WHO data shows that in average, worldwide, smoking is five times as prevalent among men than women. There is hardly any country where women smoke more than men, and in some Muslim countries the percentage of smoking men is one hundred times higher than for women (for example in Morocco and Algeria).After the factual mistakes come the dubious theories. On p.260-1, we read that one of the most common forms of mirroring is yawning, and that ""It was one thought that the purpose of yawning was to oxygenate the body but we now know that it's a form of mirroring that serves to create a rapport with others and to avoid aggression"". The problem with this theory is that yawning is most commonly done when people are alone or with close relatives at home, and therefore doesn't serve to avoid aggression.I also want to add that the quiz at the end of the book is terrible. The pictures are very unclear and it's hard to find all the signals even after reading the descriptions."
253,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/538517-alissa-thorne,4,"I found this book so useful, I decided to listen to it twice in a row.* When it became clear that much of the book was going to be a lengthy list of various subtle body language queues, I groaned at what I anticipated would be a lot of rote memorization. As it turned out, since body language is so tied up with emotions, almost all of the indicators were immediately recognizable. More importantly, they matched with an emotional understanding of what it feels like when exhibiting that indicator, and it feels like when I see others. This made information easy to absorb, and once it did it stuck.The most thought provoking concept in this book is what I mentioned earlier--emotional state and body language are mirrors of one another. That is to say, not only is your body language an expression of your emotion, but your feelings can be affected by changing your physical expressions. One of the more striking examples of this is the idea that if someone has a negative attitude, expressed with crossed arms, you can influence their emotional openness by handing them a pen or cup of coffee, requiring that they uncross their arms.So far, I am primarily becoming more aware of my own body language rather than reading others. That's fine by me--not only is it useful to know what messages you are subconsciousness sending others, it also makes me more aware of my own emotional state.One questionable bit about this book--it makes heavy use of bold claims about gender and other topics that contradict common wisdom. I don't know how supported these claims are, but I take much of the alleged science with a grain of salt.* In part, this is because I kept spacing out or losing my place, so I know I was missing bits."
254,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22787654-justin,4,"Nonverbal signals constitutes the majority of communication, and often gets overlooked. In any social aspect of life, being able to recognize and use knowledge of body language to our favor can make a difference. Allan and Barbara Pease use their business and research backgrounds to uncover a general overview of body language for use in personal and professional situations. They cover hands,arms, smiles and laguther, cultural differences, hand and thumb gestures, evaluation and deceit signals, eye signals, personal space, legs, thirteen most common gestures, mirroring, signals of cigarettes, glasses and makeup, how the body points, courtship/attraction signals, ownership/territory/height signals, seating arrangements, and interviews/office politics. They also include an assessment at the end. Reading this book brought to light many things I already knew, but never thought about, and gestures I never encountered. I enjoyed the straightforward read, and the helpful visuals accompanying the explanations. I would've preferred less emphasis on business when they assumed in several sections you're persuading someone to make a sale, and more on social situations though much of it is applicable. Also they cover gender differences quite a bit which is useful and link it to biology which I found interesting. Still from a social perspective it's helpful to keep in mind the varieties of each genders' differences rather than to accept the general assumption. That said, I also enjoyed the research studies cited.Overall, this book is a great resource for anyone looking to improve their communication and relationships personal or professional, and especially those in helping/people professions."

256,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1171505-princely,4,"I felt that this book was good, and had accurate things to say about WESTERN gestures. However, I live in Japan, and none of the quote *offensive* gestures mean anything to anyone under thirty five. The business relations section for Japanese was suprisingly off. I mean, every time someone bows, they inspect your shoes? Most of the folks I meet here change from their outside, nice shoes into crappy indoor ones, so everyone's shoes look kind of beaten up when we meet everyone inside :). I'm more suprised at the fact that they didn't research carefully or emphasize more useful Japanese mannerisms, that it is far harder to tell what the Japanese are thinking through body language. They behave differently than Westerners, and many body cues, such as hand gestures, don't apply. The feet gestures, however, are dead on. I find that section useful, but then again it was generally applicable to everybody. As for the book's style, of course, it could have been ghostwritten- it lacked a personal flavor for me that it would have had with an original author. Despite my complaints about its Japanese culture section and writing style, I still give this book a high score. I just found the information fascinating. So many things are being hidden by folks when they talk, but not when they move...it simply blows my mind."

At the time I didn't find it important; but in both personal and professional relationships, body language is crucial in understanding how the other person feels. This book provides a good overview of common body language gestures. I've been told by some, that reading body language can be contradictory. One sign another gives doesn't mean that's how they really feel. Luckily, this book reinforces this cautionary statement by teaching to read body language in clusters and to keep in mind the context in which the body language is given.This book is pretty well laid out in terms of grouping gestures by body part which are by chapter. It makes quick reference a little easier - although I don't feel this book is intended for a reference book. The read itself is really quite quick and easy. Toward the end, there's a self-test chapter to help solidify the knowledgeThe reason why I gave this book one 4 stars is because in some ways, a ""quick guide"" would have been nice. A quick study guide in this only means a smalll chapter recapping all the gestures discussed. A reference, if you will. That could be used to increase the utility of the book to a study guide too."

I bought this book from Amazon and read it before the book by Joe Navarro (also on my list)The authors appear to be sales/marketing people and conduct workshops and trainings on reading body language. There seems to be a bias such as ""this behavior equals this meaning."" I have a problem with this simplistic type of interpretation. However, I try to glean the basic underlying concepts and blend that with my own understanding of body language. There is some interesting information in the book. Since reading this book, I've tried to be more observant of people and their body language, but I tell you it's hard. I tend to lapse into my old ways of looking at the world.Anyway, some interesting information here, some of which I have found interesting.

Sometimes when it comes to words,people don't really say much & we always want to get to know the self that's behind these words. This book made me understand many things about body language that i've never known before to the extent where i started reading & highlighting almost everything! I found it extremely helpful,whether a person is too sure while stating his lie his body can give everything away starting from his eyes to his nose and his arm movements.

This book touches on human beings body language, such as how we cross our legs, touch our face, put things to our mouth such as pen chewing, etc. It decodes even the way we talk with our hands and what it means.

Topics include the basics of body language, and then to specific elements including hand and arm movement and gestures, facial expressions, eye signals, leg and body positioning.

I think parts are research based but claims like most women are not good at running and accountants don't have good social skills took away some of the book's credibility in my eyes not to mention somewhat insulted me.

275,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91977885-michael,4,"Body language is an outward reflection of a person's emotional condition. It's about matching what you see and hear in the environment in which it all happens and drawing a probable conclusion. However, most people only see the things they think they are seeing. Early research on communication shows that the total impact of a message is about 7% for spoken words and 38% for vocal, i.e., the voice's tone and 55% for non-verbal. This means that words are used primarily for conveying information and data. For example, a study done between 1970-80 revealed that a person with a strong argument usually wins in a phone conversation. However, in the round table encounter 60 to 80 percent accounts for body language, and usually, the people make initial impressions within 4 minutes of the conversation.According to the book, some people, especially women's, are more perceptive than men - 'women's intuition.' Being perceptive means able to spot the contradictions between someone's words and body language. When we say we have a hunch or gut feeling, we usually mean that their words and body language do not much. And overall, women are good at picking them. In addition, it is usually easy to read children than adults. This could be that adults have less muscle tone in the face. An interesting fact about body language is that it is easy to misread it, yet it is hard to fake it.While talking about body language, it's important to note that it can be different across different cultures, though some body languages like nodding the head, shoulder shrug, smiling are inborn and are usually the same across cultures. For accurately reading body language, the book presents 3 rules.	1. The reading of gestures should be in clusters. This is to mean that an individual gesture might not give or mislead. Gestures are words, and clusters are sentences in body language. To read them correctly, it needs at least three testers in a match. 	2. Look for congruence between gesture clusters and verbal language. If the gestures and the verbal language do not much, women tend to take the gestures. 	3. Gestures should be read in the context. For example, a person sitting in a cold bus waiting with hands crossed (defensive) and chin down (critical/hostile) should not be interpreted negatively.The HandsPalms of a hand are vocal cords of body language because they did more talking than any other body parts. Three are 3 main palm command testers	▪ Palm Up : is a used as a submissive non-threatening gesture.	▪ Palm Down : shows immediate authority.	▪ Palm Closed : shows the speaker figuratively beats his listeners to submission.Fingers also play a role, where a pointing finger gives negative feelings. Also, squeezing your finger into your thumb to make an OK gesture while giving public speech is considered authoritative, but not aggressive.Handshakes can also be used to show dominance- down Palm, submission-up Palm, and equality-vertical.While encountering power player giving down Palm the following two techniques help to disarm. 	1. Step into the left foot first and then move the right foot ahead of the left foot, then put the left foot again in the same position as the right foot. Practically this might be hard to use since most right-handed people tend to step their right leg first but helps a great deal because you are invading their private space. 	2. While a person presents a Palm up position, then put your left hand over his right to form a double handler and straighten the handshake. Also, while posing for a photo with a handshake, its always good to be on the right side as it gives a Palm down advantage. Touching while shaking hands, with the other hand, creates a powerful result. When you meet someone new and shake hands, extend your left arm, give a light touch on elbow or hand as you shake, and repeat their name to confirm you heard it correctly. Facial SmilesNatural smiles produce characteristic wrinkles around the eyes. The fleshy part of the eye between the eyebrow and the eyelid moves downward, and the end of the eyebrows dip slightly with open mouth for true similes. False smiles only pull back the mouth. Smiling attracts people and signifies a submission signal. Also, laughing simulates the body's natural pain killers and feel good enhancers, like the endorphins, helping relieve stress and heal the body. Thus is used as a therapy in hospitals. People who have trouble laughing at the tough things in life often turn to drugs and alcohol to achieve the same feeling that endorphin induced laughter produces.The 5 common types of smiles include: 1. The Tight-lipped Smile : is a kind that stretches the mouse tightly across the face to form a straight line concealing the teeth. This smile sends the message that the similer has withheld opinions or attitudes that will not be shared with you.  2. Twisted smile : is another kind where it shows opposite emotions on each side of the face, one happy one angry. This smile show sarcasm in the western world. 3. Drop-Jaw Smile : is when the lower jaw is dropped to show the person is laughing or playful. 4. Sideway looking up smile  is a playful and secretive pose that affects both genders. Its orientation is, head turned down and away while looking up with a tight-lipped smile. 5. Permanent Smirk is always smiling that everyone wonders what you have been up to.Laughing is more than 30 times as likely to occurs in participants in a social situation than in a solitary setting. This shows that laughing has less to do with jokes and funny stories and more to do with building relationships. Thus people tend to laugh more and longer in a social situation than each will last alone. Women will find a person that makes her laugh more attractive.Arm SignalsAny crossing of the arms in front of the body is perceived as unfavorable. By folding arms, a barrier is formed, i.e., unconscious attempt to block out what we perceive as a threat or undesirable circumstance. When a person has a nervous, negative, or defensive attitude, it will be manifested by folding the hands. Thus, it useful to avoid crossing your arms under any circumstances unless your intention is to show you don't agree or don't want to participate.Types of crossed arms are:	▪ The universal cross arms on the chest to show its defensive. So while giving speeches, if most of the listeners are crossing their arms, the speech needs to be turned to a kind where it turns to a receptive position. On another way to break this is to give the listeners something to hold in their hands like a notebook and pen. It's also good to use arm chaired to avoid people sitting this way, which in turn blocks their listening. 	▪ Fist Clenched Arm crossed shows hostility as well as defensiveness. A verbal or physical attack could happen if it is combined with a tight-lipped simile or clenched teeth and red face.	▪ Double Arm Grip is a self hugging position that shows a negative restrained attitude. It can be seen by doctors in the waiting room, first-time travelers on air. It depicts the person is feeling insecure and not buying what you are selling.	▪ Thumbs up cross arm shows defensiveness with a self-confident attitude. 	▪ Broken zipper position is used by men to protect their vulnerable area. It creates the feeling of having someone else holding your hand. Women's take hugging themselves position where one arm hung while the other takes hold or touches the other arm.	▪ Cuff Link Adjust is used by celebrities to disguise their nervousness.Hand and Thumb GesturesHumans have 27 small bones and dozens of tiny muscles to move the joints. There are more nerve connections between the hands and the brain than in any other part of the body. Because of that, hands can tell what is the person is thinking more easily. The common hand gestures include:	▪ Rubbing palms together to show positive expectancy. If it is slow, it looks sneaky or devious, but the faster shows excitement. 	▪ Thumb fingertip rub to show gesture about money. 	▪ Clenched hands placed centered to the face elbows resting to the desk while sitting shows frustration, restrained anxious or negative attitude. If placed on the desk centered to the body while elbows are at the same level, they show the same attitude with less degree and the less with standing position. 	▪ The Steeple used by superior to subordinate interaction and indicates a confident or self-assured attitude. As a general rule, this gesture should be avoided when you want to be persuasive or win others person confidence as it can sometimes be read as smugness. The Lowered steeple, hands-on thighs can be used to show assurance. 	▪ Face platter is used by ladies to show their faces, usually presenting themselves for a man. 	▪ Hands in the back with Palm-in-Palm show superiority and confidence. The gripping hand wrist shows frustration and anger. The higher it's up, the more the person is frustrated. 	▪ Thumps protrude is a sign of power authority. They can be in Arms folded with thumb us pointing upwards and thumbs out from the pocket.Evaluation and Deceit SignalsLying is the oil that greases our interactions with others and let us maintain friendly social relationships. Such are called White Lies because their goals are to make others feel comfortable instead of telling them the cold hard truth. Malicious Lies are, however, deliberate lies that set out to deceive another for personal benefit. When children lie, they use the hand to face gesture, i.e., putting the hand on the face. For adults, their umber of gulps of saliva increases, which is especially noticeable for a man as he has Adam apples. The following are the eight most common lying gestures. 1. The mouse cover : the hands cover the mouth as the brain subconsciously instructs it to try to suppress the deceitful words that are being said. While you are talking, if someone covers their mouse, it shows that they feel you are hiding something.  2. The nose touch : The human nose expands with blood during lying. This is followed by nose touching repossessed.  3. Itchy nose : is also a response like a nose touch that is used to disguise own deceit words or listener who doubts the speaker's words.  4. Eye rub : is the brain attempt to block it the deceit doubt or distasteful thing it sees, or to avoid having to look at the face of the person who is being lied to.  5. The Ear grab : is a signal that says, 'I don't want to hear it.' It is also a signal that the person heard enough and want to speak.  6. The Neck Scratch : is a gesture that shows doubt or uncertainty and is characteristic of the person to say, I'm not sure I agree. 7. The Collar Pull : is another gesture of telling lies.  8. Fingers in the mouse is an outward indication of an inner need for assurance, so giving a node guarantees a positive move. Evaluations gestures are shown by a closed hand resting on the chin or cheek, often the index finger pointing upward. Rubbing the back of the neck is also another reaction caused by feeling frustrated or fearful. Slapping the back of the neck tells your are being pain-in-the-neck for the issue while slapping the forehead shows reminding the forgotten thing and not intimidated by you mentioning it.Eye SignalsThe eyes are the most revealing and accurate of all human communication signals because they work independently of conscious control. In general, pupils will dilate or contract as your attitude and mood change from positive to negative and vice versa. When someone becomes excited, their pupils can dilate to up to four times their original size. Conversely, an angry, negative mood causes the pupils to contract to what is commonly known as beady little eyes.When people are lying, they are likely to dramatically increase their blinking rate, an unconscious attempt by the person's brain to block you from their sight because they have become bored or disinterested or feel superior to you. In such scenarios, to rattle the person while taking extended blink, quickly step a pace to your left or right.There are three geographical areas-gazing kinds, people look upon while talking to each other. 1. The social gaze : looks on the triangular area on the other persons face that is between the two eyes and noise. This gaze perceived as non-aggressive. 2. The Intimate gaze : looks at the lower body first to establish what sex it is and up between the eyes and below the chin. Women's has a wider peripheral vision that helps her to look at top to bottom while looking at the face. However, because of male tunnel vision, he needs to gaze up and down in a very obvious way. This is the reason why men are accused of ogling women's body at close range though research shows that women do more of it than men. 3. The Power gaze : looks at the triangular area between the eye and middle of the forehead. This gaze is used to treat a person who intimidates or the person you want to make shut up.Other gaze form, The power stare, gives more authority. It is done by looking at the person in narrow eyelids and without blinking. To perform this, move your eyeballs first and then let your head follow while making your shoulders remain still.Another interesting thing about the eyes is the movement they follow while trying to remember something. If a person recalls something that they saw, their eyes will move upward. If they recall something, they heard- they look to the side and tilt their head as if they are listening. If they are recalling a feeling or emotion they'll look down and to the right. And when they are talking to themselves, they look down and to the left.To keep control of where a person is looking while showing something, use a pen to point to the presentation and, at the same time, verbalize what he sees. Next, lift the pen from the presentation and hold it between his eyes and your eyes.continued in the comment section..."

277,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45626469-hadi-abedini,5,"It's really a definitive book about body language. simple and clear writing and perfect examples makes it easy to understand.as told in book, we should not interpret single gestures. gestures should be interpreted in clusters and this book could not cover this important aspect. I think another book should be appended so that we can analyse different real situations and put together all we know about body language in practice."
278,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71950414-mariagiulia,2,"A poorly written, not that accurate, superficial and even slightly sexist body language manual that I struggled to finish. What stopped me from giving it only 1 star is that despite the many things I disagreed with, I found anyway a couple of useful pieces of advice. Overall not recommended."
279,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17413971-jinkm,1,"I got this book from the library because I have problems reading another person's body language. However, from the first page I got the feeling this book wouldn't be for someone like me. I saw the other books the author's have written. Here is the list:Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read MapsWhy Men Lie and Women CryWhy Men Can Only do One Thing At A Time and Women Never Stop TalkingThe Little Book of Men and women In my opinion, it's obvious the authors probably subscribe to the belief that men and women are totally and inherently different. And that they probably also believe in inherent gender roles, which, again, in my opinion, is bollocks. But hey, I thought, let's not judge. People's opinions and beliefs evolve and everyone has questionable opinions. That doesn't mean they don't know what they are talking about when it come to body language. So, I decided to give it a try.Eleven pages in I see ""Body language is an outward reflection of a person's emotional condition""Now, as someone who others describe as very stoic and stone-faced and as someone who has trouble with expressing emotion, I found this to be a little narrow minded. I constantly have to explain to people that ""No, I am not angry, I am thinking."" ""No, I am not attacking you, I am trying to have a serious discussion with you, please ignore my angry looking eyeballs."" ""No I am not a serial killer, I just have a very intense face sometimes, okay?!"" XD However, I am willing to consider this is the case for most people and I came to learn about others, so I carry on!  Unfortunately, immediately below the above quote, as an illustrative image to show an example of body language, they inserted a conveniently angled picture of Prince Charles so that it looked like he was grasping a large-chested woman's breasts with the caption of ""Prince Charles finds a bosom buddy"". Now, I'm all for humor and recognize that it makes reading about scientific subjects easier to digest. However, I found this tasteless and inappropriate. Red flag #3. (And it wasn't even the only sexual innuendo :S) However x2 though, we don't require our 'experts' to have appropriate senses of humor, (NASA scientists as an example :D). They are there to make a point and instruct, not to tickle our funny bones SO, I read on. :/ (If you can't tell, I'm a little hard-headed and have trouble listening to my own intuition.) The Final Straw - Not knowing the definition of words- The authors say ""Women have an innate ability to pick up and decipher non verbal signals, as well as having an accurate eye for small details"" I disagree, but I've already decided to ignore their outdated gender opinions. Just in the next paragraph, though, they totally contradict themselves. The authors cite a Harvard study that showed that women have a greater ability to read emotions in situations. Okay, that is in line with what they said, BUT they go on to say in the very next sentence  that men in 'nurturing' careers, like art (what?), acting, and nursing, as well as gay men, scored as well as women. They then go on to say that women are so very good at reading emotions because they ""practice reading signals early"". Which to me, seems to be the exact opposite definition of 'innate'. That's a definite sign of a dodgy book. Now I have a logical reason to quit. Good, I quit. Best decision I've made today. I feel good about quitting. You can tell, because my stance is open and I'm smiling. No really, I'm smiling. It might only be slightly more curved than straight line, but it's a smile.  My recommendation: find a different book to read. One that is more up to date and perhaps is written by some one who is more interested in solid academics than telling crass jokes. Two thumbs down."
280,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6712675-lucas-leite,2,"More impressions  in my personal blog of reviewsNot So Evident Signs Certain gestural groups emitted by the body generate positive or negative influences in the unconscious of the interlocutor, this is the argument put forward by Allan and Barbara Pease in the book The Definitive Guide to Body Language. The authors, professionals with vast experience in business, use their professional experience, latest data and researches to, in a colloquial and brief language, expose to the general public importants tips to interpret behavior in the professional and personal situations. The book deals with meanings gestures offered by the eyes, hands, feet and other expressions and body parts. Moreover, it exposes how elements found in the environment can influence the course of a conversation: how, for example, the position of your chair in relation to the interviewer can assist you in gaining a place of employment or assist in selling a product or service. These tips are very important when you have the notion that the interlocutor form an opinion about the other in just 4 minutes of talking, appealing, unconsciously, much more to the visual attributes and gestures than the competencies inherent to the career or quality of the curriculum. In fact, you'll never get a second chance to make a good first impression.Although richly illustrated, the weak point of this simple language book is the lack of depth. The Definitive Guide to Body Language deal only with situations illustrating it without specifying or explain motivations, it is a behavioral manual. Let, therefore, gaps that can only be fulfilled if the reader looking for more technical books in the area. If the goal is get tips, this is a good book. But if the intention is to look hard into the study of body language, this is a book that can be considered only introductory.***Sinais pouco evidentesDeterminados grupos gestuais emitidos pelo corpo geram influências negativas ou positivas no inconsciente do interlocutor, esta é a tese defendida por Allan e Barbara Pease no livro Desvendando os segredos da linguagem corporal. Os autores, profissionais de vasta experiência no mundo empresarial, utilizam-se da sua vivência profissional, dados e mais recentes pesquisas para, numa linguagem coloquial e breve, passar para o grande público importantes dicas de interpretação e comportamento em situações no âmbito profissional e pessoal.O livro trata de significados gestuais oferecidos pelos olhos, mãos, pés entre outras expressões e partes do corpo. Além disso, expõem como os elementos encontrados no ambiente podem influenciar nos rumos de uma conversa: o quanto, por exemplo, a posição de sua cadeira em relação ao entrevistador pode auxiliá-lo na conquista de uma vaga de emprego ou auxiliá-lo na venda de um serviço/produto.Essas dicas são muito importantes quando se tem a noção de que o interlocutor forma uma opinião sobre o outro em apenas 4 minutos de conversa, apelando, inconscientemente, muito mais para os atributos visuais do que para as competências imanentes à carreira profissional ou qualidade do currículo. De fato, a primeira impressão muitas vezes é a que fica.Embora ricamente ilustrado, o ponto fraco deste livro de simples linguagem está na falta de profundidade. Desvendando os segredos da linguagem corporal limita-se a exemplificar situações sem especificar ou explicar motivações, trata-se de um manual comportamental. Deixa, por isso, lacunas que só podem ser preenchidas se o leitor procurar por livros mais técnicos dentro da área. Se o objetivo é captar dicas, este é um bom livro. Mas se a intenção é debruçar-se sobre o estudo da linguagem corporal, este é um livro que pode ser considerado apenas introdutório. "

He brings the different aspects into conscious thinking of how these things developed by evolution and have been hardwired into brain to interpret.I cannot emphasize more on how fantastic book it was! It has helped me immensely, especially the courtship gestures!"
282,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95025914-wilmington,2,"I have read and enjoyed Allan and Barbara Pease's other bestsellers Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps and Why Men Lie and Women Cry: How to Get What You Want Out of Life by Asking and therefore was really looking forward to reading this book. It was quite a disappointment. Half of the body language described seems perfectly obvious to me. Some of the explanations were useful, but others were dubious or downright mistaken.It didn't start well when on page 7 the caption under Schwarzenegger showing the thumb up explained that it meant five in Japan, which is utterly false. I can forgive one mistake, but not dozens, and the book is filled with them. Here are other examples.On p. 18-19, the authors say that shaking the head from side to side to indicate 'no' is universal. Are they forgetting that in India it means 'yes' ? Over one billion people is not a minor exception.On p. 20, under the title Universal Gestures, the first example is the shoulder shrug to show that a person doesn't know or doesn't understand. In France it means that the person doesn't care or that it can't be helped. Perhaps their meaning of universal is not the one universally understood by English speakers ?On p. 109-110, they say that figures E and F are insults in Japan, and figure L means 5 in Japan and 1 in (continental) Europe. None of that is true.On the next page, under 'Why We are All Becoming American', they say that the middle finger raised is originally an American insult that became adopted in other countries because of American TV and movies. It actually originated in Ancient Greece and Rome and has been used in many European countries (especially Mediterranean ones) for a very long time. The authors claim that the American Ring gesture to mean OK is now recognised in many countries due to American influence. It may be recognised, but is hardly ever used in most of Europe and Asia, where it often has a different meaning. They carry on with the words for toilet becoming Americanised, but what does this have to do with body language ? It is also a fallacy, since most speakers of English today are non-native speakers, and Europeans are far more likely to use the word 'toilet' than 'bathroom' because the word 'toilet' exists in most European languages.On p.114, they claim that the French greet each others with a double kiss and the Belgians with a triple kiss. The truth is that the number varies from one to five in France, depending on the region and generation. In Belgium it is only once among French speakers, and usually none among Dutch speakers like in Britain.On p.119, they explain that the American OK sign means zero in France and money in Japan, but they are not done the same way and therefore cannot be misunderstood easily. The OK sign is done with the three other fingers open (pointing up). The French zero is done with the middle to little fingers closed, aligned on the index finger. The Japanese zero is done with the hand placed horizontally, open fingers pointing sideways, and the palm pointing towards the body.On p. 171, we read that the Japanese are the only ones that don't 'eyebrow flash'. Again it's not true. That's an East Asian thing.After the ignorance of other cultures come the scientific errors. On p. 171, the authors say that, contrarily to humans, ""apes lack eye-whites, which means that their prey don't know where the ape is looking or whether they have been spotted, giving the ape a greater chance of hunting success."" Really ? It's a surprising theory to say the least, since all apes aside from humans, and all monkeys are vegetarian.I also wonder what they mean when on p.192 they write ""by animals, birds, fish and primates"". Animals sound redundant here.In the section of personal space (p.193), they explain that lions have a territorial space of 30 miles or more, but that lions raised in captivity have a personal space of only several yards. They confuse personal space (safe distance between two individuals, even of the same family) and the lion's hunting territory, which isn't personal but used by all the lionesses (as it is the females that hunt) belong to the same clan. They make the same confusion afterwards by mentioning countries, cities and other non-personal boundaries. It's sounds highly unscientific and unprofessional on the authors' part to make such a simplification on a book about body language.I wasn't happier to read on the next page that they were going to compare the personal space radius in (and I quote) ""Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, North America, Northern Europe, Scandinavia, Canada or anywhere a culture is 'Westernised' such as Singapore, Guam or Iceland"". Wow ! What's the point of saying Great Britain and Scandinavia is they say Northern Europe ? Why say North America and Canada ? But much worse, why on earth would they consider that Iceland is not part of Scandinavia and believe it is not a Western country but a Westernised one like Singapore ? Do they have any idea of how uneducated that sounds ? On p.202 they insist again on saying ""Northern Europeans and Scandinavians"" as if Scandinavians weren't Northern Europeans. It might be useful for them to look at a world map some time.On p.199, trying to justify that people become more aggressive when their personal space is invaded, the authors claim that ""areas that have the highest human population density also have the highest crime and violence rates"". This is another factual mistake. Countries with very high population densities like Japan, the Netherlands, England, or even India, tend to be more peaceful and have lower crime rates than sparsely populated countries like most of Africa or South America, or even the USA.On p.268, Mr and Mrs Pease claim that ""Twice as many women smoke as men"". This is completely wrong. The WHO data shows that in average, worldwide, smoking is five times as prevalent among men than women. There is hardly any country where women smoke more than men, and in some Muslim countries the percentage of smoking men is one hundred times higher than for women (for example in Morocco and Algeria).After the factual mistakes come the dubious theories. On p.260-1, we read that one of the most common forms of mirroring is yawning, and that ""It was one thought that the purpose of yawning was to oxygenate the body but we now know that it's a form of mirroring that serves to create a rapport with others and to avoid aggression"". The problem with this theory is that yawning is most commonly done when people are alone or with close relatives at home, and therefore doesn't serve to avoid aggression.I also want to add that the quiz at the end of the book is terrible. The pictures are very unclear and it's hard to find all the signals even after reading the descriptions."
283,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/538517-alissa-thorne,4,"I found this book so useful, I decided to listen to it twice in a row.* When it became clear that much of the book was going to be a lengthy list of various subtle body language queues, I groaned at what I anticipated would be a lot of rote memorization. As it turned out, since body language is so tied up with emotions, almost all of the indicators were immediately recognizable. More importantly, they matched with an emotional understanding of what it feels like when exhibiting that indicator, and it feels like when I see others. This made information easy to absorb, and once it did it stuck.The most thought provoking concept in this book is what I mentioned earlier--emotional state and body language are mirrors of one another. That is to say, not only is your body language an expression of your emotion, but your feelings can be affected by changing your physical expressions. One of the more striking examples of this is the idea that if someone has a negative attitude, expressed with crossed arms, you can influence their emotional openness by handing them a pen or cup of coffee, requiring that they uncross their arms.So far, I am primarily becoming more aware of my own body language rather than reading others. That's fine by me--not only is it useful to know what messages you are subconsciousness sending others, it also makes me more aware of my own emotional state.One questionable bit about this book--it makes heavy use of bold claims about gender and other topics that contradict common wisdom. I don't know how supported these claims are, but I take much of the alleged science with a grain of salt.* In part, this is because I kept spacing out or losing my place, so I know I was missing bits."
284,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22787654-justin,4,"Nonverbal signals constitutes the majority of communication, and often gets overlooked. In any social aspect of life, being able to recognize and use knowledge of body language to our favor can make a difference. Allan and Barbara Pease use their business and research backgrounds to uncover a general overview of body language for use in personal and professional situations. They cover hands,arms, smiles and laguther, cultural differences, hand and thumb gestures, evaluation and deceit signals, eye signals, personal space, legs, thirteen most common gestures, mirroring, signals of cigarettes, glasses and makeup, how the body points, courtship/attraction signals, ownership/territory/height signals, seating arrangements, and interviews/office politics. They also include an assessment at the end. Reading this book brought to light many things I already knew, but never thought about, and gestures I never encountered. I enjoyed the straightforward read, and the helpful visuals accompanying the explanations. I would've preferred less emphasis on business when they assumed in several sections you're persuading someone to make a sale, and more on social situations though much of it is applicable. Also they cover gender differences quite a bit which is useful and link it to biology which I found interesting. Still from a social perspective it's helpful to keep in mind the varieties of each genders' differences rather than to accept the general assumption. That said, I also enjoyed the research studies cited.Overall, this book is a great resource for anyone looking to improve their communication and relationships personal or professional, and especially those in helping/people professions."
285,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86966257-luana,5,"Bought this book at an airport years ago but never read it until now. Very interesting and probably useful if you’re a business person.I tried some of it out of curiosity, I’m not sure how accurate this is."
286,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1171505-princely,4,"I felt that this book was good, and had accurate things to say about WESTERN gestures. However, I live in Japan, and none of the quote *offensive* gestures mean anything to anyone under thirty five. The business relations section for Japanese was suprisingly off. I mean, every time someone bows, they inspect your shoes? Most of the folks I meet here change from their outside, nice shoes into crappy indoor ones, so everyone's shoes look kind of beaten up when we meet everyone inside :). I'm more suprised at the fact that they didn't research carefully or emphasize more useful Japanese mannerisms, that it is far harder to tell what the Japanese are thinking through body language. They behave differently than Westerners, and many body cues, such as hand gestures, don't apply. The feet gestures, however, are dead on. I find that section useful, but then again it was generally applicable to everybody. As for the book's style, of course, it could have been ghostwritten- it lacked a personal flavor for me that it would have had with an original author. Despite my complaints about its Japanese culture section and writing style, I still give this book a high score. I just found the information fascinating. So many things are being hidden by folks when they talk, but not when they move...it simply blows my mind."

At the time I didn't find it important; but in both personal and professional relationships, body language is crucial in understanding how the other person feels. This book provides a good overview of common body language gestures. I've been told by some, that reading body language can be contradictory. One sign another gives doesn't mean that's how they really feel. Luckily, this book reinforces this cautionary statement by teaching to read body language in clusters and to keep in mind the context in which the body language is given.This book is pretty well laid out in terms of grouping gestures by body part which are by chapter. It makes quick reference a little easier - although I don't feel this book is intended for a reference book. The read itself is really quite quick and easy. Toward the end, there's a self-test chapter to help solidify the knowledgeThe reason why I gave this book one 4 stars is because in some ways, a ""quick guide"" would have been nice. A quick study guide in this only means a smalll chapter recapping all the gestures discussed. A reference, if you will. That could be used to increase the utility of the book to a study guide too."

Is this an Honest Mistake or is it Mistake at first place?? there are American Muslims, British Muslims and there are Muslims from all nationalities? and the reaction mentioned in the book ""that they cover their face"" is totally a mistake??? Did you go around Toilets just searching for naked Women and how they React? The Authors are Simply ""SICK""Muslims have more dignity Than you Two and Just like any one who does... I'm not going to say any further. I don't feel this a subject to be discussed under any justification. But unfortunately your ""Tiny Minds"" couldn't help but to give such a sick example regardless of Nationality..."

I bought this book from Amazon and read it before the book by Joe Navarro (also on my list)The authors appear to be sales/marketing people and conduct workshops and trainings on reading body language. There seems to be a bias such as ""this behavior equals this meaning."" I have a problem with this simplistic type of interpretation. However, I try to glean the basic underlying concepts and blend that with my own understanding of body language. There is some interesting information in the book. Since reading this book, I've tried to be more observant of people and their body language, but I tell you it's hard. I tend to lapse into my old ways of looking at the world.Anyway, some interesting information here, some of which I have found interesting. If nothing, it has made me much more conscious of my own body language and how I hold myself!"
290,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23985784-shamma-a-140a512,5,"I completely fell in love with this book. It might not be your typical number one novel but it's still such a good read to me! I got so hooked on this book that i finished it in two days. Sometimes when it comes to words,people don't really say much & we always want to get to know the self that's behind these words. This book made me understand many things about body language that i've never known before to the extent where i started reading & highlighting almost everything! I found it extremely helpful,whether a person is too sure while stating his lie his body can give everything away starting from his eyes to his nose and his arm movements. I definitely would give this book 5 stars just because it doesn't sound 'sciency'at all,it was a really fun & humorous read filled with facts & helpful tips! I would surely recommend this book to all the people out there who are interested in psychology because this books is for you!"
291,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1412404-lolly-k-dandeneau,5,"I admit to this snarky behavior, I love to study people! This book was very interesting and certainly I will look at everyone differently. I am a people watcher and have always been good at spotting the 'real' situation in any room. Now I understand why I can go past what I hear and see what's true, for those of you that can't or those who want to improve decoding people, this is a must read. I will admit I have learned more. This book touches on human beings body language, such as how we cross our legs, touch our face, put things to our mouth such as pen chewing, etc. It decodes even the way we talk with our hands and what it means. There is some info too on hand gestures that the western world uses that offends in other countries. I highly enjoyed this novel and look forward to reading other books written by Allan and Barbara Pease. It must have been a ball researching for thid book. "
292,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23989769-shaikha-s-145510,0,"The Definitive Book of Body Language, by Allan and Barbara Pease, provides an interesting, informative content of how we communicate with reach other. It introduces body language from point of view of business and politics. Therefore, I loved this book as it would prepare me for my future major and career, which will be involving international affairs. Topics include the basics of body language, and then to specific elements including hand and arm movement and gestures, facial expressions, eye signals, leg and body positioning. I found the illustrations and images that come with the text to be very funny. In addition, I found it to be very nice and simple to understand the body language from a practical point of view. Therefore I recommend this book to people who would like to understand and communicate people in a better way. "
293,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/873788-badger,1,"Oh, lordy loo, what an awful book. After reading How to Speak Dog and noticing much of doggish is found in body language I thought it would be good to have a base level of knowledge about human body language as well. Unfortunately this book isn't really about that. It's a kind of misogynistic guide to the unhealthy world of Sales. Bloody damn and blast! I should have known something was amiss when I found myself in the marketing section of the library rather than social sciences!Really though, unless you're selling widgets, don't read this book. There are a few truths that I have since verified regarding human body language, but there's got to be a better book out there regarding the subject."
294,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4504589-boots,4,"I didn't realize how interesting I would find the subject of body language. This book is written to be entertaining and I would say the authors were fairly successful with that. One of the main issues I have with this book is that some of the authors interpretations of various studies are based on their own opinions, but stated as fact; which had me thinking, ""how did you come to that conclusion?"" Another issue that I found a bit annoying is the fact that the authors seem to shamelessly promote other books they have published. But even with those annoyances, I still might actually read this book again. "
295,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17486478-aziff,4,"There are many body language books out there but none have I found to be as illustrative, interesting or as informative as this. Body Language explores the subtle physical signs we let out and interprets them in sweeping ways, often using examples (public figures like Bill Clinton) to nail down points. And not only limited to body language, A. Pease also jabs in the usage of external accessories such as spectacles which I found amusing and also enlightening. The sitting arrangement in a meeting, how one positions their arms, where your foot points; these are among the different subject areas this book sheds light on."
296,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55164647-yousra,3,"	After studying this book you'll be able to read people better no doubt. Of course it takes some practice to really master the techniques you learn in this book, and you'll be a bit overwhelmed and confused at first...it gets better over time however. With this book you can connect better with people; communicate more effectively, and get across the nonverbal information you really want to convey in a variety of situations, from giving speeches or presentations to being in a job interview. Lot's of VERY valuable information in this book; highly recommended!"
297,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5368332-cole-oberndorfer,5,"Great insight on working with people and truly understanding what their body and what their mouths are saying and are not saying. I find myself constantly looking for the tell-tale clusters of body language and doing my best to interpret them. Truly interesting read and inspiring to find more information on the topic and become a self-taught expert. Lets be honest though, great thing to learn to manipulate and work people your way as well. "
298,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17570957-salma-a-240511,5," I have benefited greatly by reading this book, it helps to understand the behavior of people in various positions. The pictograms,they help a person to understand the idea and analyze body language before they help the reader to translate the situation and analyzed own style. This book helps to know around us more and what we must do in any case or situation. I advise the readers to read this book , because it help a lot and it's very useful too. "
299,0752858785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4458112-kelly,3,"I liked this book at the beginning and I definitely learned a few things but the more I read, the more it felt like the author was spouting generalizations as fact. I think parts are research based but claims like most women are not good at running and accountants don't have good social skills took away some of the book's credibility in my eyes not to mention somewhat insulted me. However, it is a light read, written without a serious tone so it is still worth reading in my opinion."
