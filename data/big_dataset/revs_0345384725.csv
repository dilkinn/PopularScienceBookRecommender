0,0345384725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2751053-bakari,4,"This is the fourteenth book I've read for my 52 in 52 project, and it's the only one so far that I finished reading in about one day. Saying that I could hardly put the book down is pretty accurate. But the authors, Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan made their writing and analysis so engaging and fairly easy to understand, that getting through was not a laborious task. Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors, as I wrote in one of my tweets tonight, puts the Bible to shame. The book is not a parody of the Bible, but it is a million times better and more plausible of a story about the origins of the universe (which the Bible doesn’t touch on) and who we are as Homo Sapiens. If you ever watched Sagan’s classic PBS series Cosmos, then you have an idea of what Shadows is all about. I’m not going to go into detail about what their book is about (there’s plenty reviews on Amazon.com and other places), but what struck me most about his book is the conclusion it makes. By comparing humans to our closest ancestors, the chimpanzees, babons and other primates, they contend we need to realize that we, though of higher “intelligence” are simply not that far removed from our cousins, and they/we are seriously not that special. This is not meant to be a put down on the human species, but it’s to put in perspective about who we are what our potential is.It’s interesting that they quote a bit of verse from Walt Whitman, whom I was considering reading a biography about for my next book, before reading this one. Walt wrote:I think I could turn and live with animals, they’re so placid and self-contain’d,I stand and look at them long and long.They do not sweat and whine about their condition,They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania  of owning things,Not one kneels to another, or to his kind that lived thousands of years ago,Not one respectful or unhappy over the whole earth.Whitman takes some poetic license in his critique of his fellow man, but the point of his and the authors’ analysis is that there are two sides to human beings. We are humbled by our existence, but we are also conceited, vicious, greedy, and selfish. On the one hand, we have great potential for love for one another; but on the other hand, we continue to do some very barbaric things to one another.The authors say it better than I do:“We must stop pretending we’re something we’re not. Somewhere between romantic, uncritical anthropomorphizing of the animals and an anxious, obdurate refusal to recognize our kinship with them—the latter made tellingly clear in the still-widespread notion of “special” creation—there is a broad middle ground on which we humans can take our stand.” Sagan and Druyan use essentially the second half of their book to develop the above conclusion. I think they take a little too long to prove their case, but I can understand the challenge to do so, given that most of humanity is still mucked and mired in religious mythology and in denial of our essential human nature, that it’s not inconceivable that were headed for destruction—not destruction of the planet, mind you, but of our ourselves and other living organisms.  We would do ourselves a great service by holding weekly meetings discussing books like this one rather than further deluding about some great omnipotent being that is supposed to be controlling everything. It’s really time we move past all that.#end"
1,0345384725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1145418-jordan,5,"This was an excellent book. I've been a big fan of Carl Sagan for the last couple of years now, he's a very good writer and scientist. It's amazing to me that despite how old his work is, it's still completely relevant to today, and he explains very difficult science so clearly and simply. Most people think of carl sagan as an astronomer, but this book is about evolution. And he does an amazing amount of research, just example after example. I'll try and write a little about what I learned:The genetic code has 4 symbols to code information. Similar to the way a computer stores 1's and 0s. There is a record of information stored in your DNA large enough to make your human body. And it's copied in each one of your cells. It's stored in a similar way to computer memory. That's a huge amount of information in just one teeny little cell. Far superior to even our most advanced computers of today. Sagan explains how the genetic code works very clearly. And he shows you just why this double helix is so fascinating. It truly is responsible for life on this planet. And shows that you have a common ancestor with a plant in a hotel lobby. Humans and trees and ants and fish and seaweed are all controlled by DNA. The difference is how the DNA is programmed. And we have just recently discovered it, and we found the key to what makes life. All coded in 4 symbols, (geneticists have named them AGC and T.) Sex and death are linked together. Before sex was invented, there was no natural death. Organisms basically just divided in half. But when sex was stumbled upon, then genetic codes could be mixed, and the old generations would die off in order to make room for the new generations. Older versions suffered from too much cell damage, probly likely to get eaten etc. And sex is what makes our world what it is. In a way sex is life. And it's why our psychology, and the psychology of many animals is based around sex. To a Deer or a Tick sex is almost all that matters, because if they don't have offspring then their genes will never be seen again. So each generation came from parents who actually had sex. For a Tick, with no eyesight, no ears, no touch, only a sense of smell, sex is inevitable, because if they didn't have sex, they wouldn't be here. So how does such a creature manage to find a female and mate. Well, it's fascinating, and it's in this book. And it's accompanied by many other stories of how animals mate, just as fascinating. When they hatched birds without a mother, and flew a shadow of almost anything over them, the birds wouldn't react, unless the shadow was in the shape of a flying hawk (this birds particular predator). Ever wondered why as kids we were all having nightmares and were afraid of the dark. This is felt by all species, and it has to do with recognizing predators, because if we get eaten, especially when we are young, we don't have children, then our genetic code doesn't live on. And he gives example after example of this stuff.The incest taboo, is not only felt by all humans, but all species. Incest and inbreeding result in bad off-spring. So all species have some way to cope with incest.It's really unfortunate that evolution must be such a taboo subject. This book really made me realize how real it is. And with that perspective, there are so many great things to learn about myself through evolution. Why I am who I am, and what really brought me here. So if you think about this stuff as much as I do, then I recommend this book. "

3,0345384725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/212533-al-rankin,5,"Carl Sagan forever lays to rest any doubts I had that Christianity and all religions in general are frauds, fakes, and myths. The need to grovel before imaginary gods and the need to have some of those gods encourage the sacrifice of godsons, first sons, virgin daughters or other virginal heroes on crosses, slaughter stones, or thrown into volcanoes to atone for “our sins”, transgressions or shortcomings seems to be hardwired into our brain cells/genes. These beliefs spring from primitive human needs to explain bad guesses about the unknown and to cope with imaginary “punishments” which we now know are simply the vagaries of nature.It’s wonderful to be free of religion. Nevertheless, it’s so ingrained I must admit it took more than a decade to deprogram religion out of my brain. Although most religionists seem to understand the concept of future eternity without end, they still think that there had to be some sort of “beginning” and thus cling to the idea of “God” creating the universe. Carl Sagan has helped me to accept the concept that there is neither a beginning nor an end. “Eternity” moves in both directions. There’s no need to try to explain a “beginning”. The COSMOS may coalesce or gravitate inward upon itself and then explode into a “Big Bang” from time to time over the course of megazillions of years, but in some form our universe has existed forever in the past and will continue to exist in some form forever in the future.

It spans creation of earth, evolution and is a solid attempt at explaining how it is that we are the way we are. It also dismantles the proposition that humans are special and unique from other beings. It is a difference in degree only. It is a humbling read that humans for all of our intelligence should be so cruel and arrogant in regards to our relatives. For we are related to every other living creature in the world and we were not put here to rule and subjugate ""lesser"" creatures. Things such as culture, language, tool use, consciousness are not unique qualities of human beings. The book is rife with examples, entertainingly written and highly recommended. For further reading, try Jared Diamond's ""the rise and fall of the third chimpanzee"". Another brilliant book to explain the nature of humans."

7,0345384725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5893808-jack,2,"I never thought I'd give a bad review of anything Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan wrote. The biggest problem I had with SoFA was threefold. Firstly, it cast an extremely wide net. The books begins by describing conversations between Sagan and Druyan about human nature and war and civilization and things like that. They believe that in order to get to the root cause of some problem, say the proliferation of nuclear weapons, they have to discuss how humans evolved. And that led to a topic further back which led them to another problem which led them further back and so on and so on. The lack of focus was frustrating and annoying. Seriously, in the Taoist philosophy or in some Sesame Street song, I understand that ""we're all connected"" but there's no need to elaborate at length about the Big Bang in order to discuss overpopulation and abortion. Secondly, the book was incredibly speculative and lacked specifics. Even when it was describing things like the Big Bang or human evolution, it didn't focus on specific fossils or anything like that. There was a lot of talk about ""primitive"" man and ""swirling clouds of gas"" and things like that, but it came out sounding like an extremely dumb down version of some pretty fascinating topics. It felt like the authors wanted to discuss them in greater detail, but didn't. It was pretty frustrating to not have the topics elaborated on. Either discuss them or don't, but don't settle on a watered down middle version. Thirdly, there was a really racist discussion of chimpanzee social dynamics using African American lingo. Seriously, it comes out of nowhere and it's incredibly offensive. It's like Sagan and Druyan were thinking, ""how do we personify how chimps and other apes interact with each other? Oh I know, we'll have them talk like black people from the hood! NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT."" Sagan and Druyan probably didn't realize what they were doing...but neither did Walt Disney when he created the Jim Crow character in Dumbo. I bet SoFA will age as well as that movie did. So yeah, casual racism aside, SoFA is good try but it lacks the specifics or the focus of Sagan's and Druyan's Cosmos. And it's racist, have I mentioned that?"
8,0345384725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5786985-timothy-davis,4,"After I read The Dragons of Eden, I learned that Carl Sagan explored more than cosmology. He also explored evolutionary biology-stimulated by his wife, the biologist Ann Druyan. Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors is a book that Sagan and Druyan wrote together. It is much more scientifically rigorous and sophisticated than The Dragons of Eden, and deals not with the evolution of the tripartite brain, but on the evolution of consciousness itself. Druyan and Sagan write that we are like babies left in a basket on a doorstep, never knowing and always wondering what our ancestry is. For me, the most influential of the book's explorations involve the study of the levels of consciousness in other animals, aside from the human animal. Through study after study, many amusing and all interesting, Druyan and Sagan emphasize that the difference between the consciousness of the human animal and other animals is ""a difference of degree rather than kind."" Indeed, some of the studies indicate that some of the other animals may have consciousness that surpasses in degree that that of the human animal. The book stresses that we will not understand who we are until we view ourselves as part of a continuum, and the book also explorers the history of human resistance to this idea. One or two of the chapters were too difficult for me to understand as a non-scientist, but I was basically able to understand the book while only skimming the difficult chapters about DNA construction and such. It was nice to know that rigorous science was part of the book. This is one of those books that will change your outlook on the world. "
9,0345384725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/565363-mark,5,"Shadows Of Forgotten Ancestors: A search for who we are (1992) Carl Sagan and Ann DruyanCarl Sagan and his wife attempt to inform “we” (humans) as to just who we are, how we came to be here, and what the future may bring. They do an excellent job up until the end. Endings are hard. They rightly state at the end: “We are almost ignorant of what is coming. Nothing is preordained.” (p.415) This book should be required reading for high school social studies. One problem is, however, the argument they make is open to interpretation – as is pretty much everything when it comes to science and philosophy. What this really is – is a study in cognitive dissonance. The Sagans dive deep into the human psyche and the history of Life on Earth – looking for a distinguishing characteristic trait that divides humans from apes. They conclude what distinguishes us from our closest relatives is only a matter of degree, not feature. I’ll offer this – the distinguishing characteristic is the ability to deceive ourselves/us, i.e. cognitive dissonance. And also, the ability to communicate over great distances, with anyone anywhere, instantaneously. And lastly, the ability to kill from a distance. But, the last two are the result, a byproduct perhaps, of the first one—our large brain and its capacity to imagine. The Sagans debunk the myth of scientists and philosophers that they ‘know’ what they’re talking about, when it comes to the human being and his condition. Sure, we can put a machine (a tool) on Mars, certainly we are the only animal that is capable of doing that, but we still can’t resolve: a cure for the common hangover or loneliness; or our basic differences with regard to who decides what, without committing mass murder and genocide, also unique to our species. (p. 413) We are uniquely the only animal that violates that basic rule of Life, and keep getting better at it; and so … . The book begins at the beginning, some 4+ billion years ago and takes us, the reader, through the Earth’s lifespan, as well as Life’s, to include its most complex organism, Homo sapien, aka we the people, the most dominant creature to yet evolve through the process of Evolution. Evolution on Earth, the process of Life’s growth from the simple to the complex, has only two tools in its toolbox—natural selection and sexual selection. The former is ruthless and conscious-less, and the latter unkind yet shows a semblance of forethought, and is responsible for all that we deem ‘human’ qualities. What natural selection did, and does do, is bring order to chaos. It provides Life with an ordered survival mechanism—competition for resources—so as to further life through replication and reproduction. Natural selection was The Decider. “Some died that others might live.” (p. 26) “The Earth is a vast graveyard.” (p.24) “Sex is expensive – a drain on energy resources.” In that, its act ultimately means death. (p.144) But, it, sex, also “brings an entire species together.” (p.151) And “confuses enemies and is the key to health.” (p.149) The selection process w/r/t mating necessitates different strategies for males and females and “introduces conflict between the sexes. The dominance/submissive hierarchy is what allows groups of animals of the same species to live together in community and cooperation—to survive, without killing each other and so avoids extinction. In other words, ‘peace through strength.’ The D/S hierarchy minimizes violence, which is distinct from aggression. (News flash: democracy doesn’t work.) Aggression, paradoxically, engenders peace within and between groups, allows for survival, and the sharing of resources without catastrophic destruction. “Trade [deal making] is at least a billion years old.” (p. 150) In other words, natural and sexual selection work—work incredibly well—to further Life on Earth. (Another news flash: the Universe and Earth are indifferent, i.e. they don’t care about Life, and more specifically – about you or I, we.) All of this happens without ‘thinking.’ It’s an unconscious mechanism that developed through millions of years of trial and error. Feelings, too, are preprogrammed—emotions are hardwired into animals because an emotive response (bio-chemical) benefited an individual creature in its unconscious quest to reproduce. “We are profoundly ignorant about what motivates us.” (p.172) “Common enemies work as a powerful unifying force—make the social machinery work.” (p.114, 197) Again, deal making.“Diversity [individual differences] is the raw material on which selection operates.” (p.255) — Selecting against the weak and selecting for the strong, engendering a population that thrives.Success of a species leads to overcrowding, which escalates conflict and then can lead to war—the “last remedy” – of which the Law of the Jungle determines who wins, and winning is all that matters in the game of Life. (p. 91) Enter intelligence and the large brained “thinking man” (eg. Sagan & his wife, and others); who believe that our intelligence will save us from extinction. The belief is that our superior intelligence is our finest tool, which if applied properly, can figure out how to live together despite ignoring the rules and laws (natural and sexual selection, and the D/S hierarchy) that Life developed (evolved) over its lifespan of several billion years. After all, we’re smart—we’ve figured out to defy gravity. So the ‘thinking’ goes.But what about loneliness?Enter cognitive dissonance. Maybe best described by David Foster Wallace, without even naming it, in his 1996 essay, in Premire, “David Lynch keeps his head.” Wallace rightly posits that “… in response to my discomfort I’m going to do one of two things: I’m either going to find some way to punish [x] for making me uncomfortable, or I’m going to interpret the [data] that eliminates as much of the discomfort as possible.” (p.208 in A supposedly fun thing I’ll never do again. Wallace goes on: “I can assure you that just about every established professional reviewer and critic [scientist and philosopher; professional and layman] has chosen one or the other of these responses.” But, as Sagan cautions: “We must stop pretending we’re something we are not—[a] ‘special’ creation. … We humans have a learning disability.” (p.413) So much for the ‘big-brain’ hypothesis. Moreover, the Sagans ‘think’ that the psychological mechanism of Repression is itself an evolved survival mechanism. (p. 378) In other words, ‘We can’t handle the truth.’ Which contradicts their ‘solution.’ My head might explode.We are slow dancing in Gallop, New Mexico.So what are we, really? Well, men are killers (hunters/predators & warriors) and pussy grabbers (assholes and motherf___ers, and selfish protectors); and women are nurturers, child bearers, and flirts – who put up with men because they have to, and/but also prefer their pets neutered so as to better control them. … And now, in the 21st Century, we’re running out of room, both in the real world (physical territory); and in cyberspace, where there are no boundaries and no territory can be safely protected, or defended. One survival strategy that evolved over time was migration – if a territory became overcrowded, some members of a population could migrate to a new territory, a new “hunting ground” if you will; and there, adapt to a new environment via mutation and/or innovation. Now, not only has all territory been claimed, but the Internet, the World Wide Web has increased, not only the feeling but also the reality of, overcrowding and thus conflict; but without the constraint, or fear, of actual violence and death. So we ‘think.’ Thus hostility and the threat of violence has increased by both real and virtual overcrowding. I’m not banking on the ‘big-brain’ hypothesis to save us. To date there is no evidence to support it. Over crowding leads to violence, between and within groups, unless there are sufficient resources for all. But then, the matter of who decides who gets what and how much still lingers. There are simply too many people. We have become too successful. In our ‘brilliance’ we have usurped the rules/laws of natural and sexual selection with artificial rules and laws – like human rights, courts, juries of ‘peers’ and ‘democracy.’ As if we’re “special” and have a right to Life.Of course, the laws of Nature’s still apply but we are so arrogant and smug that we ‘think’ they don’t. Democracy doesn’t work, but the sick, poor, & stupid, i.e. the weak, the majority, will surely vote for the person who tells them they’re special—equal to the healthy, wealthy, and smart – the strong and clever. The fulcrum, the pinnacle, the apex of Homo sapiens, the tipping point – may have been reached in the mid-nineties, at the O.J. Simpson trial, where the stupid overruled/over-turned the smart, where the evidence was ignored and the truth was undermined by emotion – by primitive feelings of “us versus them” trumping intelligence. It was ‘reverse Darwinism.’ That in itself is a strategy—a survival strategy—one that will be exploited by those out of power seeking power, to ascend to the “Big guy” (p.260-264) position; without the required natural traits, talents, or abilities to merit that position. That, in the long run, is not good for the survival of a group/species. This is one way in which democracy fails organisms. Which brings to point ‘Intersex’; or, humans not fully male or female but somewhere in between. Where do they land on the D/S hierarchy? Are they killers or nurturers? Dominant or submissive? More confusion.Between male and female there is a range of possible beings (especially w/r/t humans in the age of modern, hyper-‘advanced’ knowledge of molecular biology, treatments and medicine, w/r/t natural selection.) In other words, we have made natural selection moot. … And not only that, but are on the verge of making sexual selection moot also. Which is not to say that ‘queers’ don’t have a place in the hierarchy – I think they surely do. But not as dominant leaders. We are still organic creatures who inhabit a live, vibrant world on planet Earth. We should respect the process, the D/S hierarchy, and not attempt to usurp it. Sagan and his wife, Ann Druyan, tell a wonderful story—the greatest story ever told—that of Life; but in the end they can’t accept the reality that intelligence as a survival mechanism may have run its course, been too ‘successful.’ Now it seems that we are ceding our knowledge to machines and artificial intelligence. We can’t seem to overcome cognitive dissonance – the need to override, or misinterpret the data – to serve our own vanity and ‘specialness’ thinking. And, I think (I do) that AI will be as ruthless as natural selection in deciding who lives and who dies. AI just might decide we’re not worth the trouble, succumbing, in the end, to its own brand of vanity. And so, the solution just might be: let Trump be Trump. Let the “Alpha male” run the show. Respect the “big guy.” He ‘knows’ what he’s doing. He’s a mutant, manic, narcissist – the perfect creature for the times we live in, for ‘the times they are a changing.’ ‘Let the big dog eat.’ ‘Let the big horse run.’Post script:Of course, the Sagans go into much more detail than I can here, and touch on topics I haven’t, such as culture, religion, God, etc. Very important matters to be considered; as well as Descartes’ error, Hobbes’ cruel world, Darwin’s delay, Freud’s Oedipal complex, Skinner’s box, Morris’ naked ape, Ardrey’s territorial imperative, Hamilton’s kin selection, Dawkins’ selfish gene, Diamond’s third chimpanzee, and Wright’s moral animal. In short, if you think you’re heroic, you’re probably not; if you think you’re doing good, you might be doing more harm than good, in the long run. The Sagan’s point is that an individual’s behavior is most likely misinterpreted, and the ultimate consequences cannot be known. There was just Monday, 22 May, 2017, another mass murder in Manchester, England. The motives of the perpetrator debated; but the act can not be denied. It happened. Modern humans are as they have always been, the only animal who kills like this … which makes us ‘Special.’Mark Edward JabbourMay 25, 2017"
10,0345384725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39490422-lord-humungus,2,"Review in English and Spanish (below):Somewhat disappointing, I'm afraid. How you like a book depends a lot on how old you are when you read it and what books have you previously read.Carl Sagan is probably the second person who has intellectually influenced me most. I can say without much exaggeration that the series ""Cosmos"", which I saw as a child, changed my life. But it seems that Sagan was really ""a man of one book"". In this one he repeats many of his same old ideas. If you have read one of his classic books, such as ""Cosmos"" or ""The Cosmic Connection"", this really will not bring you much.Unless you are interested in the biology of the higher primates! That's what most of the book is about, to exhaustion. There are chapters and chapters, quite long, relating every detail of the life of the primates, especially of the chimpanzees. If someone wants to read a full repertoire of arguments in favor of the thesis that the difference between humans and other primates is of degree and not of kind, this is his book. Although it must be taken into account that the scientific data may be incomplete, as it was written several decades ago.There is a moment when Sagan repeats the phrase, which I also read in ""The Demon-Haunted World"", that ""the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence."" Actually, that is false. The absence of evidence is not definitive proof of absence, but it is evidence. That is why we think that unicorns do not exist: we have looked enough and we have not found any.The book contains good doses of quotations, and abundant bibliographical notes, but has no index.In short, little interesting and new in this book. If you've read ""Cosmos"" and ""The Selfish Gene"" by Dawkins, all you'll learn is a lot of details about the life and mind of the primates.Algo decepcionante, me temo. Lo que te guste un libro depende bastante de en qué edad lo lees y de qué libros has leído anteriormente.Carl Sagan es probablemente la segunda persona que más me ha influido intelectualmente. Puedo decir sin exagerar mucho que la serie “Cosmos”, que vi de pequeño, me cambió la vida. Pero parece que realmente Sagan era “un hombre de un solo libro”. En este repite muchas de las mismas ideas suyas de siempre. Si uno ha leído uno de sus libros clásicos, como “Cosmos” o “La Conexión Cósmica”, realmente este no le aportará mucho.¡A no ser que le interese mucho la biología de los primates superiores! Es de lo que trata la mayor parte del libro, hasta la extenuación. Hay capítulos y capítulos, bastante largos, relatando cada detalle de la vida de los primates, especialmente de los chimpancés. Si alguien quiere leer un repertorio completo de los argumentos a favor de que la diferencia entre los humanos y otros primates es de grado y no de clase, este es su libro. Aunque hay que tener en cuenta que los datos científicos pueden ser incompletos, pues se escribió hace ya algunas décadas.Hay un momento en que Sagan repite la frase, que ya leí en “El mundo y sus demonios” de que “la ausencia de evidencia no es evidencia de ausencia”. En realidad, eso es falso. La ausencia de evidencia no es prueba definitiva de ausencia, pero sí que es evidencia. Por eso pensamos que los unicornios no existen: hemos mirado bastante y no hemos encontrado ninguno.El libro contiene buenas dosis de citas, y abundantes notas bibliográficas, pero no tiene índice.En resumen, poca cosa interesante y nueva en este libro. Si has leído “Cosmos” y “The selfish gene”, de Dawkins, lo único que aprenderás será un montón de detalles sobre la vida y la mente de los primates."

In clearly understood scientific terms, the book explains the origins of the earth, the rise of life on our planet and the biological foundations for some of our deeply rooted drives including sex, politics and racism. This is a book I've re-read many times as a reference for my own writing.

12,0345384725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10176493-james-west,5,If I'm not mistaken this was the first Carl Sagan book I read and my first foray into evolution and related sciences. It was a game changer for me. A profound experience.
13,0345384725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51838183-isaac-carpenter,4,"The subtitle of the book is ""A Search for Who We Are"". I am not altogether sure of the purpose of SFA. My best guess is that S/D seeks to give an account of humanity from their worldview. However, if this is their purpose, then I think it is woefully incomplete. However, the book is worth reading. The writing is compelling, interesting and accessible for the lay reader. This is the first I've read Sagan and I can easily see why he is so popular.SFA begins with a brief overview of who humanity thinks it is and what S/D's worldview brings to the table. It then goes back in time to the beginning of all things -- the Big Bang and gives a brief account of our solar system and how it formed, then moves into focus on early planet earth. Here S/D paint a wonderfully written account of the early earth. They both transport you back into time where one is able to distantly observe the formation of the solar system and planets.S/D follow this with a couple chapters on Darwin's biography and some of his thought. Then, they move into the very small -- a brief introduction into the genetic code and how they believe early organisms might have functioned on the young earth and then into how these early organisms will propagate, eventually leading into issues of biological life (sex) and death.Then the authors take us into social structures of various animals, comparing and contrasting social hierarchies, which leads to the biological distinction of the sexes and an interesting and short chapter into what S/D perceive to be the thoughts of a chimp as it goes about its daily business. They then take the monkey theme and spend the next couple of chapters talking about chimp and baboon life while comparing them with human life. Finally, S/D ask the question of what it means to be human (ignoring what it means to `mean` anything). In their mind the answer is essentially a biological answer. Here they compare and contrast their worldview with various other answers to the question of what humanity's nature consists.Oddly enough the Sagan and Druyan note that the book began in an politically existential crisis during the arms race of the 1980's. They write, ""So we embarked on a study of the political and emotional roots of the nuclear arms race--which led us back to World War II, which of course had its origins in World War I, which was a consequence of the rise of the nation-state, which traces straight back to the very beginnings of civilization, which was a by-product of the invention of agriculture and the domestication of animals, which crystallized out of a very long period in which we humans we hunters and foragers. There was no sharp division along the way, no point at which we could say: Here are the roots of our predicament . . . Events of remote ages, long before humans came to be, are critical, we concluded, for an understanding of the trap that our species seems to be setting for itself"" (xiii).Due to this beginning of their work I am expecting something that accounts for not only the biological fact of humanity, but also the existential fact. The very purpose of the book purports to account for not only biological descriptions of humanity and their ancestors, but the origination of our `problems.' However, S/D give no explanation of what `problems' are -- or how there can be such things as `problems.' The fundamental goal of the book is therefore confusing. It seeks a descriptive, biological explanation to answer deep existential and moral questions for humanity. Somewhere along the line we have slipped into prescriptive statements and questions without the explanation of why this occurred and why anyone should listen to these `problems' or why one should view the nuclear arms race (for example) as anything more than describing what happened.Two big things are needed in this work: their belief on the origination of religion and morality. I say this because if one were to read the introduction, one would expect these things. Regardless of one's views on the nature of religion as a whole and morality, the atheist must give an accounting of these. And they are certainly `big enough' to need an accounting. Virtually the whole of humanity has overwhelmingly believed in some sort of religion and morality. And S/D's work actually begins here -- the existential question -- yet they in many ways largely ignore this question. Consider elsewhere: ""Who are we? Where do we come from? . . . Can we improve our societies? Can we leave our children a world better than the one that was left to us? Can we free them from the demons that torment us and haunt our civilization?"" (4). The metaphysical problem hinted at, but obviously outside the scope of a work like this is the tension between metaphysical necessity and biological freedom. S/D's position waffles between complete metaphysical necessity with spurts of randomness in places where we don't understand their function (a `randomness of the gaps' perhaps).I'm not saying that S/D never touch on the subject of religion and morality, but I am saying that for the effect that both have had on our species, they get too little treatment in SFA. At one point in chapter twenty, they do mention that a proposed difference between humans and animals has been religion. They then ask the question, ""But what is religion? How could we know whether animals have it? In The Descent of Man, Darwin cites the comment, `a dog looks on his master as a god.'"" Of course this is just a quick dismissal with a rather awkward leap of faith into the unknown. ""Perhaps if we were able to peer into the mind of the ape in a state of nature, we would find--among a flurry of other feelings--a sense of satisfaction about its apeness rivaling ours about our humanity."" Perhaps apes and other animals are just rather quiet about their religious beliefs. I'm betting modern day liberals would love to give animals voting rights, then, seeing as they apparently agree to keep their extremely private religion out of the public square.I do think this book should be on your shelf. It is a bit dated, but it's been so popular that it's very inexpensive and it's full of information. If you accept certain presuppositions and are comfortable straddling the fence of metaphysical necessity and randomness and comfortable reducing morality to biology (albeit when its convenient for you), then S/D's worldview has impressive explanatory scope. However, if you find it a bit odd that people seek to dismiss existential questions with biological answers (as the tension is never resolved in the book, nor is `morality' ever explained. Clearly the authors have moral frameworks. It is unclear why these moral frameworks aren't dismissed by biology as well), then you will find this book lacking in its answer as to who humanity is. But regardless, it is a trove of information worth owning. "
14,0345384725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69348187-xavier,5,"Carl Sagan and his wife Ann Druyan poetically present the humble beginnings of homo sapiens. They begin with the formulation of the universe and then with the many processes that went into the origination of our planet. The wonder that is DNA and genetics is then explained, showing how closely linked humans are to everything but just how intimately related we are to the great apes, mostly the chimpanzees.The book is 80% about chimpanzee and other ape behavior and how they relate to us. I found it fascinating how many of our social behaviors are nearly identical with the apes. They function as a family unit. Mothers breastfeed their young and the young learn by seeing what the elders do. Apes groom each other and we like to give massages or cuddle with our loved ones. Chimps like Lucy displayed intelligence and the ability to think abstractedly. They have emotion and use facial expressions to communicate.Apes are also highly sexual and can be really violent. Especially the Hamadrya baboon. Where the male chimps loosely guard their females when they are not ovulating, the male baboon treats the females like private property and will violently discipline them if they stray to another male. Apes will go patrolling in groups and are masters of stealth and strategy. The military branches of the world can take a page out of the chimp's playbook.I found it all to be engrossing and enlightening. Carl and Ann shed a sliver of light on the shadows of our ancestors and bring them to the forefront for us to appreciate. We can learn so much about our past if we can continue to study our great antecedents."
15,0345384725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21981319-rajkumar-pagey,5,It was a really good decision to pick this book. Reading about Darwin and evolution is nothing new but there were so many things discussed in this book that I was unaware of.Plus I really loved every second when the writers started discussing about apes and primates. Especially Kanzi. I'd to stop reading and go to Youtube and watch videos because a talking ape was a bit too incredulous for me. Lucy's story broke my heart though.Recommended to anyone who wants some good non-fiction
16,0345384725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68583290-jamie,4,"This book could have had an alternate title of something like Life, Sex, and Getting Along. It is a genial introduction to the big questions: earth’s origins, biogenesis, DNA, and sex, with short detours along the way that use specific incidents and experiments to illuminate the larger issues. The style is clear and conversational, and the level is pitched toward people unfamiliar with the subjects. For instance, Darwin gets a good deal of space, starting with his illustrious ancestors, and going through his undistinguished collegiate days as first a theological, then a medical student, and then the sudden blossoming of his interest in biology and geology. It then recounts his experiences on the Beagle and the long gestation process before he finally published Origin of Species in 1859. It is all well written, but if you know anything about Darwin it is well traveled ground.With evolution described, the story moves on to the discovery of DNA and its role in inheritance and mutations. Again, the level is introductory, with time spent describing A-G-C-T and the double helix, and how male and female reproductive cells are formed and then combine into new life.DNA leads to a discussion of sex, and several chapters are devoted to it. There is nothing titillating here; this is sex on the level of ticks and sea slugs. Still, evolution has provided life with a remarkable variety of reproductive strategies that are surprisingly sophisticated, especially in animals with brains the size of the head of a pin. Humans are mentioned in passing to demonstrate the strategies of males and females in their drive to pass along their genes: males will be most successful if they can inseminate as many females as possible, but females, who are limited in the number of offspring they can produce in their lives, and whose babies require expensive and time consuming maternal care, need to be more judicious in their choice of who gets to share DNA with them. This choosiness leads to the ridiculous male courtship displays and rituals of birds, beasts, and yes, humans as well. The game of ¿Quien es mas macho? goes back a long long time.And then, after all the evolution and sex, there is the issue of how to get along with one another, and the book has chapters on social adaptations. There is a good section on how various animals respond to overcrowding, referencing both field observations and lab experiments. This section leads to humankind, and the realization that we are not so different from our animal relatives after all. Although this point has been made many times in many different ways, it is always good to remind readers that we are not the product of some special creation, but just a different stop along the evolutionary line from bacteria to complex multicelluar creatures, to social animals. It begs the question of whether humans are more evolved. More evolved than what? The product of countless generations of natural selection, we fit nicely into our evolutionary niche, but an octopus is just as finely tuned for its environment as the grasshopper, the prairie dog, and the garden snail are for theirs.Lastly, there is a lot less separating humans from our primate relatives than many people would like to believe. Apes and monkeys have surprisingly sophisticated social structures and the closer we look the thinner the line separating us from them becomes. The things we always thought were uniquely human can be found in our nearest relatives if we try to see the world from their perspective. We can learn a lot from them, and they deserve to be treated with compassion and respect.If you already have a basic understanding of evolution, DNA, and social adaptation, there is no need to read this book, but it is a nice introduction for people new to these subjects, well researched and written. Anyone who watched Sagan’s documentaries can almost hear his soothing voice in these pages. Think of him saying, “Billions and billions...” and you will have the tone right."
17,0345384725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498095-mark,3,"Ambitious, interesting, daring, and a bit unevenly written. Using the metaphor of an orphan abandoned on a doorstep, trying to reconstruct the past, Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan look at human evolution from the formation of the solar system to the emergence of our species.""Shadows"" is at its best in the earliest chapters, covering the emergence of life and quite a bit about cells and DNA, interspersed with sections about how these facts were discovered. Charles Darwin in particular comes across as a very thoughtful and humane individual, uncomfortably aware of the distress the dissemination of his ideas would provoke and yet unable to turn away from the truth as he saw it.The book takes a bit of a turn just past midpoint with ""Gangland,"" a chapter written from the perspective of a few individuals of an unspecified semi- or early-human group. It is later revealed to be written from a chimpanzee viewpoint, but could stand in pretty effectively for any non-human primate or early human society. It errs on the side of shock value, going for a number of ""f-bombs"" and other crude language, which, while effective (how politically correct is a chimp?), tends to distract from the main point of the argument.From then until just before the end of the book, the higher primates are covered, and the subject gets rather uncomfortable, even for a committed evolutionist. It's definitely worth a read and worth thinking about, but it's not easy going,"
18,0345384725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16688564-edward-terblanche,4,"With this book Sagan takes you back to your origins and tells you in no uncertain terms exactly who and what you are, so if you harbour illusions about how special you are because of the fact that you are human this book will do a great job of putting you well on your way to understanding your absolute insignifigance in the greater scheme of things. Although rather dated by now (2015) I feel that this book is still extremely revalent as you will learn an immense amount about your kinship with every living being on our planet as well as have some emotions stimulated in a way that very few scientists can accomplish. If this type of subject matter is new to you I do recomend reading ""Origins"" by Niel degrasse Tyson or something similar before reading this as it will lend knowledge about the origins of our universe as a whole which serves as a great pretext to this book, it will also provide you with info of discoveries that have been made since Carl Sagan published this book. If instead of shoving religious text into the hands of our children we encouraged them to read these types of books we could have been in a better position on our way to co operation as a single species by now, instead of bickering about who's deity is the most important and killing each other all while destroying this pale blue dot in a universe so vast that the mind struggles to fathom it. This was the first time that I have read one of Sagan's books and I can guarentee you that his vast insight and knowledge base will blow your mind."

He writes, 'an exploration of who we are. How were we shaped by life's adventure on this planet, by a mysterious past that we are only just beginning to piece together? ""We humans are like a newborn baby left on a doorstep, with no note explaining who it is, where it came from, what hereditary cargo of attributes and disabilities it might be carrying, or who its antecedents might be."" Rising from amino acid goop to the diversity of life we see today, Sagan examines the 3.5 billion odd years this has taken place in a winding narrative that is comfortable to follow. The final chapters dig into our portion of the tree of life with a close look at the primates, our cousins! We must make the most of our time...“Each of us is a tiny being, permitted to ride on the outermost skin of one of the smaller planets for a few dozen trips around the local star.” We must grow up...“Maturity entails a readiness, painful and wrenching though it may be, to look squarely into the long dark places, into the fearsome shadows.” We have found the way to get answers....“Science exacts a substantial entry fee in effort and tedium in exchange for its insights.” With Carl Sagan, my journey continues. "
21,0345384725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35643641-andr-s-astudillo,5,"Outstanding.... there's no way to review this book in its whole glory. This one really, really makes you understand who we are, who we were and who has always been with us this entire time: every living thing that walked the Earth. We are not beautiful and unique snowflakes, we are not special, we are just another species, with a unique ego, that's all we have. We are foster children trying to take over what we were merely given. Earth was not handed to us alone, it was handed for everything and for everyone, the main concern here is that someone we are so over our asses that somehow, we despise even the fact that we may be (we definitely are) related to apes, gibbons, and other mammals; we certainly have punished and labeled people who said stuff like that, ""We are God's reflection and own image"" they keep saying. This is a book that is going to open your eyes whether you believe in something or not. Our ancestors are not just the names sitting near the family tree, our ancestors are everywhere, shapeshifted in many hideous or beautiful forms, hunting, jumping, playing, eating, sleeping and fucking just like we do."
22,0345384725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20989544-laura,3,"If a book is written by Sagan, I will always recommend it.This book has a lot of great things. It has history, biology, chemistry, anthropology, psychology and more. I’ve been reading a lot about these topics, so I didn’t learn anything new, maybe that’s why I didn’t find this book as enjoyable as the others. Also, I felt there wasn't a connection between some chapters, but that was just my reading experience. What matters is that conceptually, the book is remarkable. You will learn a lot about evolution and genetics (in some parts, I even felt like I was reading a Dawkins’ book) so if you still don’t understand the concepts behind evolution, natural selection and how our genes have to do with that, read this book, I assure you everything will be clear after reading this.My heart says 4 stars, but my head says 3, and well, according to Goodreads, that means ''liked it.''"

His wit and profound knowledge were immortalized into this books that he so well wrote. The world is in need of human beings like him."

When purchasing, I thought that the book would mainly be about human history, and what it tells us about our future. What I didn't account for is how far you have to go back to start evaluating ourselves as a species. To start to really ask the important questions regarding humans, we have to go back to the origin of our planet, and from then to now is a huge leap. So not only is this book poetic and honest, it is very educational, and walking away from it I feel more scientifically literate. If you want an extreme dose of humility, a perpetuating sense of awe and wonder, answers to questions you didn't even know you had and answers to questions you have always had, you've stumbled along the perfect book.

After a day or so of contemplation, I took away a star, but Shadows is, in truth, worthy of just over three stars. Not quite four, as Sagan goes to his special place with the obscurely listed DNA strand patterns that (for a layman like me) bamboozle and even bore for a much lengthier stint than is necessary. Even so, the poetry conveyed through his meticulous and impassioned ode to genealogical reason is inspired. As Jodie Foster whispers, gazing at the intergalactic spectra before her in the film adaptation of Contact, ""They should have sent a poet."" Well, in SOFA they did."
