And when Humanity lands there, it looks out, and, seeing a better country, sets sail. Progress is the realization of Utopias.”---Oscar Wilde.Rutger Bregman, the Dutch historian, first came to my attention when recently he got into a tiff with Tucker Carlson. The footage and audio was leaked, and though I wasn’t surprised to hear Carlson get upset with a guest, I was shocked to listen to the vehemence and the frankly crazed level of his response. I came away thinking, this Bregman really knows how to get under people’s skin. Of course, any time you even hint at a redistribution of wealth to a obscenely wealthy conservative, they get prickly and defensive. There never seems to be enough money for these type of people. They want it all. As prickly as they are about having to share their fortune with others, the stark truth is they took that wealth away from the rest of us in a variety of different ways. 62 people, at this very moment, are richer than 3.5 billion other people put together. Now really, it is laughable to consider. Why would anyone need that much wealth? Isn’t it a burden just to decide what to do with all of it? But I digress. The thing you will find as you read this book is that there will be frequent digressions. I ended up reading many parts of it out loud to my wife, and that led to looping, long discussions that really helped reshape some of our world views about what a real utopia would consist of. Bregman discusses three main points that will make a lot of sphincters tighten, including my own. Universal basic income, fifteen-hour work week, and a world without borders. Bregman is concerned about homelessness, as we all should be, but as I read about him talking about universal basic income, my first thought was for our overcrowded and expensive prison system. If those men have a basic income that will allow them to truly get on their feet, how much money will we save every year giving them the money directly instead of paying to keep them locked up? Now the first thought that most people will have is that something like this won’t work because why would people work? The studies that have been conducted on this concept show that people who don’t have to worry about where they are going to sleep or where their next meal is coming from start to think about educating themselves and finding worthwhile work. Of course, there are going to be failures, but as long as we are talking about the majority of participants showing a desire for achieving a better life, then we would be rehabilitating people instead of incarcerating them. Studies also found that, if they gave the money directly to the disadvantaged people, instead of putting it through the welfare department with all the red tape and hoops to jump through, the positive results skyrocketed. I’m all for eliminating the need for social services. You will hear people say that the disadvantaged are poor because they are lazy, and I think that those people really want to believe that, and no preponderance of evidence will change their minds, but for people with an open mind, this is pretty heady stuff to consider. Anybody want a 15 hour work week? I’m going to quote our friend Oscar Wilde again. ”Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do.” I understand that there are people who really enjoy their jobs, and they should work as many hours at those jobs as they want to, but for most of us, our jobs are dehumanizing, boring, and meaningless. We have Henry Ford to thank for being an instigator of the 40 hour work week, or all us would still be working 60 or 70 hours or more. He discovered that workers are more efficient working fewer hours. He also understood that, if people have leisure time to go do things, they will buy... cars. They will go spend money on activities, which boosts the economy, which makes it easier for more people to afford...cars. So in other words, he discovered it was in his best interest to allow his workers to have a life beyond just working. When you look at a company like Walmart who treats and pays their workers horribly, they obviously don’t understand that, the more money they pay their workers, the more money those workers are going to spend in their store. The really annoying thing about a company like Walmart is they pay so poorly that a large percentage of their workers are on food stamps or government assistance, so all of us are supporting Walmart to make billions in profit. See what I mean about digressing? When I was a kid and watching The Jetsons, like most other American kids, I really thought the future was going to be an amazing place with flying cars, underwater cities, and short work weeks. I thought we would be a world of scholars, painters, writers...creative people. It never occured to me that the advances in technology, like cell phones, a plentiful food supply, and robots, would actually lead to us working longer hours. Does that make any sense? Why do so few benefit from the natural resources of the planet or from the technological advancements? How did I get cut out of the pie? One of the points that Bregman makes, that really hit home for me, is what he calls shifter jobs. These are careers devoted to moving money, but not actually creating wealth. The perfect example is a stockbroker or even a banker. They take money and shift it around. Bregman will convince you that we really don’t need any of these people. So why do those shifters make extraordinarily large salaries, and the real wealth creators, such as teachers, police officers, and nurses, get paid on the lower end of the scale? Our society is upside down. The other loss to all of society is that our best minds, instead of going into science, teaching, and medicine, become stock brokers, lawyers, advertising agents, and bankers. They become shifters instead of creators. We have seen how destructive those shifters have been to our financial markets throughout history, but also very recently in 2008. We can solve that. We can encourage those shifters to become contributors to society by raising taxes on those fabulously wealthy incentive packages they receive. I’ve known stock brokers. Some of them were actually great people caught in a vortex of greed; almost every one of them will tell you that they wished they were doing something more meaningful. I wasn’t a stock broker, but I held down a very meaningless job for twenty years. One of those jobs that is hard to explain to my kids what exactly I do. It was lucrative. I made twice what my wife made as a teacher. The contribution that I was making to society paled to what my wife did on a daily basis. I’ve been asked hundreds of times by people, who are familiar with my voracious reading and philosophizing, why I wasn’t a teacher?My reply: Because I couldn’t afford the pay cut? Brainwashing cuts deeps. The open borders question is an ongoing political battle in the United States. The way WE THE PEOPLE resolve this will have an influence all over the world. Whether it is a good idea or not, the U.S. still is a heavy influencer on the rest of the world. This applies to all things, not just border walls, so all the points that Bregman is discussing in this book is aimed at the U.S. for that very reason. I thought this quote summarized the escalating wall issue very well. They will never go back.”This brings us to a fascinating paradox: Open borders promote immigrants’ return. Take the border between Mexico and the US. In the 1960s, seventy million Mexicans crossed it, but in time 85% returned home. Since the 1980s, and especially since 9/11, the US side of the border has been heavily militarized, with a 2,000 mile wall secured by cameras, sensors, drones, and 20,000 border patrol agents. Nowadays, only 7% of illegal Mexican immigrants ever go back.”We want them to go back, but we trap them here. Who would want to deal with those border control agents? Who would trust any outcome with our court system that is so biased against Mexican immigration? I live in a city where 60% of the population is Hispanic. ICE is a frequent visitor to town, and it isn’t just the illegal aliens who disappear when they show up in town. Bregman certainly gave me a lot to ponder. He has given me intelligent talking points that will help bolster my own arguments with conservatives about these progressive ideas that are actually based on conservative principles. Remember, Richard Nixon wanted to put through universal health care and a universal basic income. The Democrats actually killed both measures for different reasons (They wanted more money for the basic income, and Teddy Kennedy wanted health care passed under his presidential administration), but the fact that Nixon, of all people, put forth these concepts to me shows that, if we can smudge out the D and R behind politician’s names and really discuss these concepts, maybe progressive ideas actually can be seen as the most sane route to creating a better society. History will prove us right.

1,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8112800-mark,5,"What a painful book to read during the first week of Trump's administration. I swear every time I finished a chapter, a new policy would be announced that completely moved the needle of social progress in the other direction. Solving poverty with a universal basic income? Nope, here's a Secretary of Labor who thinks the minimum wage is already too high. Reform the banking system so it's not one of the largest drivers of the economy? Let me introduce you to the newest Goldman Sachs exec to run a department in Washington. Open our borders up to reduce both US and worldwide inequality? Don't even get me started on that one.Note to self: After civilization inevitably collapses, come back and re-read this for ideas on how to rebuild society. While some of Bregman's ideas seemed not fully fleshed out and some are even contradictory to each other, I think that's part of the point. A utopian future is unknown, and open to experimentation and trial. He does a good job presenting some of these potential scenarios and backs his ideas up with solid historical examples and current data."
2,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"If you like progressive, pro welfare state, social security, in a nutshell, the Nordic model praising nonfiction with hard facts and undeniable, logical argumentations, some of them the first time presented to a larger audience, this is your new favorite. After having read Klein, Chomsky, and Ziegler, who are all primarily talking about the problems and showing some ways out of the dilemma, I find this new approach towards less ranting and more solutions very positive. What it differentiates from many left/right, conservative/progressive, capitalist/socialist, etc. writings is that it´s really trying to be neutral, although the author is pro social democracy and Keynesian economics.I´ve read many, mostly left, thinkers, and do you know what happens all the time? Instead of talking about how to find a compromise, solutions, built a better future together, there is mostly bashing of the opponent, no matter who is right or wrong and yes, there are cases where leftist politics can´t immediately be implemented and other solutions have to be found. There is so much faith, belief, conditioning, coincidences who conditions and indoctrinates one to be on one side, that an open discussion gets more and more impossible, but building a brighter future is only possible together with the economy, companies, and conservative parties because, well, they have the cash.One of the most important messages of this book is to leave the comfort zone of the own ideology and try to find interdisciplinary approaches to solve some of the inevitable problems, some of the essential already screaming from the cover. I am really trying to see the immense positive effects on general wealth capitalism brought, before neoliberalism turned it in the creepiest and most destructive creature man ever made, and, older and wiser as I am, see that fixing and optimizing societies to create a more human, sustainable, and fair economic system can only be made possible by cooperation, respect, and willingness to change, not by insults and hate. I mean, look at the world, your country, each comment section on Amazon and Goodreads, that´s are no productive contentions, that´s just hate trolling and sh**storming by people who read nonfiction books. Does one get the irony, reading to get knowledge and behaving like that in comment sections of books one doesn´t like? Back to the topic: Bregman is, as said, pro-human and pro-environment and he has the intention to help the opponents to find a way out of the current dilemmas without losing their reputation and too much money money. You know, breakdown of civilization, pitchforks, and torches, military, and police deserting, all pretty bad for shareholder values, quotations, and stock indexes, possibly even the mansion could get damaged. Bergman uses history and very much data and sources to prove his theses.Some main points:Universal basic income instead of the prison system and mass incarceration. People have secure basic needs satisfied, don´t turn to crime, can have a free education, all the money for prison industry can be used to build the welfare state, less police is needed for that reasons and can fight organized crime and white-collar crime instead, cities are better places to live, ghettos and hoods disappear, no single parent mothers in poverty with kids growing up without fathers,…Social inequality has to be reducedhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_...Best minds get lost, as they go into banking, managing, become shifters of money in the financial sector, brokers,… earning very much, people doing real jobs with their hands or social work, get nothing. Instead the talented could work as doctors, engineers, scientists, etc., but don´t do it, because it would be stupid to go in jobs with more work and less cash.Counterintuitive, but true, if the borders are open, the people go back to their home countries. Take the rich EU, US, etc. where people can freely move around for work, but return home. If, on the other hand, it´s dangerous to deadly to get across a secured border, hardly anyone goes back. If the wealth is isolated behind death strips and not fairly distributed, organized crime, black economy, political extremism, and terrorism have many unnecessary breeding grounds and again, the military and police have to invest money that could be used for the welfare state. Happy people don´t kill other happy people. No bureaucratic disses and shenanigans to get social services, no stigmatization, no coercion to do precarious work to not get homeless or stay hungry.If there are no taxpayers anymore, if there is no redistribution by higher wages, reducing working time, taxation of robots and capital, UBI, the system collapses. The most successful, biggest companies have fewer and fewer workers and will have to keep automating anything to stay global market leaders and everyone will copy their behavior. More and more people, fewer and fewer jobs, that´s a real-life exponential process, looking at you, economics.Raising taxes for the very rich who are already getting immense, hidden amounts of money by public fundings and subsidies in the multi k billion dimension each year, tax reliefs, or just hiding the money in tax havens, while fighting against socialist leftist social politics. Taxes on financial speculation.Richard Nixon was pro universal health and UBI and the democrats successfully fought against it.What will lead to all of it is that robots don´t buy, algorithms don´t consume, and that the immense wealth will be destroyed if it´s not redistributed. Or back to the middle ages and feudalism, then it could be possible for you, honorable god emperors of mammon.Does anyone know an anachronism? When there was slavery, the king said the empire and economy would collapse without them and forced labor. When there was the first talk about democracy, the elites said it would lead to barbary and destruction of the state. What does this say about the current discussion, when UBI, open borders, less working hours, welfare state.. are defined as not possible, mad, dangerous, bad for the kids, communistic, and would lead to the breakdown of society (yet again) and degeneration of humankind (mission already accomplished). I am a layman, but let's say that for just one week all factories on earth would produce useful stuff instead of senseless consumer crap, and it´s equitably distributed to everyone, the basic needs of everyone could be provided, nobody had to suffer, and the 50 to 100 billionaires who own as much as 3,5 billion people possibly wouldn´t starve.Some final pessimism, because I can´t get out of my skin.The funny thing is that there is no hard evidence, just replication crisishttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replica...lies, and ultra soft economic and political, so called sciences, that are arguing pro destroying human lives and the planet for totally bonkers, not even real, reasons. Their arguments and attacks are a collection of propaganda methods, not a single thing that would be used in natural sciences, all just institutionalized madness that controls most of our lives. Do you know where else one old, white, not necessarily wise but demagogic, man tells a story and it gets viral and millions believe it and listen to everything and it escalates quickly? Yes, popular TV-talk shows with charismatic hosts.(view spoiler)[No, it´s of course politics.  (hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[No, it´s of course economics.  (hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[No, it´s of course faith.  (hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[No, it´s of course… Ha, nothing else here, what did you expect, but the clicking was fun, wasn´t it? And great to exhaust oneself to get rid of the anger.  (hide spoiler)]What stunned me, once again, is how a short book can contain so much knowledge, solutions, and proofs that all sides of the spectrum together already had and could thus have intentions to reinvent social order in the 21 century, while all mass media is ignoring it and instead repeating mantras of endless exponential growth and fake pseudo statistics and extrapolations. I´ll avoid those topics in the future, everything is said, probably I´ll edit, write, pimp, and post a few dozen reviews of books I´ve already read about the stuff, but read no new ones anymore. If one gets it, it´s fine, one more working for a better future, if not, I won´t feed the trolls and waste my time anymore with adults unable to self-reflection, introspection, and compromises. I see so many intelligent people wasting their time or even having wasted their lives that way, that could instead have used their knowledge and expertise to find connecting factors to moderate thinkers of the other side of the political spectrum for the sake of a consensus, instead of continuing the hardliner vs. hardliner squabble. You know, communism and capitalism, it can both be stupid, just depending on fine-tuning. Capitalism degenerated to neoliberalism, destroying the environment and deferring human development, marxism degenerated to communism, killing more people than any authoritarian government style before.A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_...I´ll set a good example by listing a bit of what is going wrong in the progressive, social democracy, green party, etc. spectrum and no, I am and will always be on the left side and know that this is the only way to realize utopias, by the way, proven by science and the numbers, but to know the weak spots is better than narcissism and megalomania.Arrogance and condescension, doing as if one has all the solutions, looking down jovially at the other party, making it impossible for them to be willing to change. To deter the youth, making them hate politics even more. Being offended when NGOs are more popular and successful, not questioning why Fridays for future has achieved more within months than they did in their whole career? Might it be that all people, no matter if they are conservatives or teenagers, hate it to be treated that way and automatically are against one?Pseudo intellectualism by playing around with unproven humanities, believing to have solutions by waving around theoretical concepts, bashing the other side for exactly the same behavior.A country with a fair, sustainable trade policy will not survive against the other predator states. The state has to use his companies as the weapons of the only possible conflict left between western states, the trade war, and help them in any way possible. Humans are not naturally nice, they are greedy, unicorn icecream lollypop is unrealistic. We all here are profiteers of this system, privileged as we are and there are young economists, entrepreneurs, and businessmen who want to find a solution or have disruptive business ideas and without their expertise, good ideas will be doomed to fail. The opposition is not even trying to take their hand, just as with tech and the ideas of their own youth, they play allmighty super brainer instead. Not investing in own education programs, without system propaganda, and enlightenment, the key element in the Nordic states, instead repeating the same political circle, not even daring to speak out the real problems, instead a bit of superficial environmental protection and pseudo reforms, instead just drops on the hot stone.Still hierarchical, no flat hierarchies, no open conversation, discussion, absolutely no difference to faith and ideology, unable to change opinion, revise, reflect, be open to new ideas. Doing as if all rich and all companies were evil, no differentiating between a Bill Gates with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (yes, he saves a lot of taxes, I know, but he does something) and a Rupert Murdoch with Foxnews. By the way, there is not much difference between Tucker Carlsons´ reaction to Bregman and how many leftists are reacting to conservatives. Not building a free, own press, as the right wingers and conservatives are doing it, although the internet would allow it for free without much money money. Technophobia: Giving nothing on the use of modern technology, not using direct democracy with all the internet options, fighting against genetic engineering and delaying one of the most important key technologies for the sake of humanity and against world hunger.Being unable to cooperate with and get funding by progressive companies that are interested in a change, because they have sustainable business models that are blocked by the current political system.I could tell much more, but it gets boring and yes, I am a true agnostic nihilist and meanwhile at the point where I despise all politicians the same, all part of the problem, not the solution, no matter what party. I, by the way, have a decade long history of activism, interest in politics, and talking to many people and that´s the result, don´t want to waste my time anymore. Try it yourself, it´s refreshing. And depressing. As said, I´m out, the ones in politics who are pretending to fight for these important ideals are incompetent wiseacres that aren´t able to read the 50 to 75 books that would be necessary to be visionary, realistic, and have an open mind although it would be essential for both their job and their so-called bigot hypocritical ideology to educate themselves. Or learn to open the mouth without insulting or belittling anyone and inhibiting a consensus this way. They are even worse than the opponents, because they occupy the important opposition that should normally speak out what´s the problem, a simulated educational political discussion in a classroom is doing more and finding more solutions, making it unable for the young ones to change something, even politicians like Trump are doing more for a positive change, because they mobilize a huge opposition by satirizing themselves and the system. Oh, yes, of course, those pseudo progressive wannabe Marxists are also unable to laugh about themselves. Thank the flying spaghetti monster this trash is finally out of my system. Engage in NGOs, politics is, at the moment, a waste of time and lifeblood, the ones who could change something are mostly anachronistic, anti paradigm shift dinosaurs that reached their position with nodding and following the wise path of the three monkeys of their own ideology, completely ignoring the world around them.For each party:right-wing: without wordsconservatives: backlashessocial democrats: without prospects, no real support for the Nordic modelgreen/liberal/alternative: see aboveYou didn´t expect I would rant against my own ideology, did you?I´ve added some extra information gossip about how I became so deeply cynical in the comments as message Nr. 7, titled BECAUSE THE REVIEW WAS TOO LONG AND I COULDN´T ADD IT:"
3,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28230750-adam,3,"Capitalist or communist, it all boils down to a pointless distinction between two types of poor, and to a major misconception that we almost managed to dispel some 40 years ago – the fallacy that a life without poverty is a privilege you have to work for, rather than a right we all deserve.A breezy read with ideas that are backed up by genuinely interesting statistics and anecdotes.Argues that we can better society and move towards utopia by implementing three ideas: a 15 hour workweek, a universal basic income (UBI) and open borders.The problem isn't the programs he's advocating, it's the neoliberal lens he's viewing them from (he grotesquely spends the last chapter blowing Hayek and Friedman). The 15 hour workweek, for example, sounds fantastic the way he lays it out – more time to play, to dedicate to art, to spend with family and enjoy life – but there's already plenty of people in the retail sector working a 15 hour workweek. Their lives aren't idyllic, they're struggling against poverty. It's called precarity and politicians can't come up with any way to soften its sting. Of course, a genuine labour movement along the lines of the one that brought us the forty hour workweek could go a long way to making the 15 hour week desirable. But the author doesn't even acknowledge it's a problem. The UBI is the same thing. It's easy to imagine how it would improve my own life, and very tempting to see it as a solves-all for poverty. But if a heartless ghoul like Dick Cheney and his neolizard pal Rumsfeld advocated for it, then it's just not that simple. I don't think a UBI can work unless we have a universal right to education, healthcare and housing. Those are the three things that everyone in our society needs but no one can realistically be expected to pay for them upfront. What good is a UBI if we're all bogged down in student loads, health insurance bills and rent payments? Of course, that's exactly why conservatives are tripping all over their dicks for a ubi, so they can gut and privatize everything else and bring us all back to feudalism.His case for open borders is so vague I don't know what to make of it. If he just means accepting more immigrants, sure, I'm all for it. My own country, Canada, needs them. Immigrants contribute to society and to the economy in countless ways. Refugees, too. If nothing else there was a boost of civic morale when we started taking in large numbers of Syrian refugees (though I suspect that's going to bite Trudeau in the ass now that's he trying to backpedal away from it all). But what Bregman is advocating seems to go beyond even the current Eurozone, which really does seem like a disaster. I mean, it ended the beggar-thy-neighbour trade policies that used to result in war, but it also created a new caste of democratically unaccountable elites who are uninterested in a proletariat that gets to choose between a life on welfare benefits or immigration away from home just to make a basic living. He points out that in Africa, more money is lost to tax evasion than is received in aid, but I don't see how open, checkpoint-free borders are going to change that. Africa doesn't need any Luxembourgs. There's nothing wrong with the mechanisms he's proposing. They can all work to make our lives better. It's the ""ideology-free"" ideology of neoliberalism that's at issue. With the managerial mindset, it's hard to see how life could improve. It'd be a brand new world at implementation and then back to managed decline. On the other hand, if these were road markers of a truly progressive, leftist campaign, backed up by a collective will for a better world – well then maybe they're ideas worth investigating after all. Highlights:Like KSR and Sanders he advocates for a tax on socially useless financial speculation to pay for social programs, which I'd be all for: (view spoiler)[The upshot is that we’ve all gotten poorer. For every dollar a bank earns, an estimated equivalent of 60 cents is destroyed elsewhere in the economic chain. Conversely, for every dollar a researcher earns, a value of at least $5 – and often much more – is pumped back into the economy. Higher taxes for top earners would serve, in Harvard science-speak, “to reallocate talented individuals from professions that cause negative externalities to those that cause positive externalities.” (hide spoiler)]Somehow I actually don't own a cellphone: (view spoiler)[By the year 2013, six billion of the globe’s seven billion inhabitants owned a cell phone. (By way of comparison, just 4.5 billion had a toilet.) And between 1994 and 2014, the number of people with Internet access worldwide leaped from 0.4% to 40.4% (hide spoiler)]I agree with this 100%, but it's the only time he mentions it and he glosses over what such a politics would look like: (view spoiler)[Lest there be any misunderstanding: It is capitalism that opened the gates to the Land of Plenty, but capitalism alone cannot sustain it. Progress has become synonymous with economic prosperity, but the 21st century will challenge us to find other ways of boosting our quality of life. And while young people in the West have largely come of age in an era of apolitical technocracy, we will have to return to politics again to find a new utopia. (hide spoiler)]His case for a ubi: (view spoiler)[The great milestones of civilization always have the whiff of utopia about them at first. According to renowned sociologist Albert Hirschman, utopias are initially attacked on three grounds: futility (it’s not possible), danger (the risks are too great), and perversity (it will degenerate into dystopia). But Hirschman also wrote that almost as soon as a utopia becomes a reality, it often comes to be seen as utterly commonplace.Not so very long ago, democracy still seemed a glorious utopia. Many a great mind, from the philosopher Plato (427–347 B.C.) to the statesman Edmund Burke (1729–1779), warned that democracy was futile (the masses were too foolish to handle it), dangerous (majority rule would be akin to playing with fire), and perverse (the “general interest” would soon be corrupted by the interests of some crafty general or other). Compare this with the arguments against basic income. It’s supposedly futile because we can’t pay for it, dangerous because people would quit working, and perverse because ultimately a minority would end up having to toil harder to support the majority.But… hold on a minute.Futile? For the first time in history, we are actually rich enough to finance a sizable basic income. We can get rid of the whole bureaucratic rigamarole designed to force assistance recipients into low-productivity jobs at any cost, and we can help finance the new simplified system by chucking the maze of tax credits and deductions, too. Any further necessary funds can be raised by taxing assets, waste, raw materials, and consumption. (hide spoiler)]On inequality: (view spoiler)[By now, inequality is ballooning in almost every developed country. In the U.S., the gap between rich and poor is already wider than it was in ancient Rome – an economy founded on slave labor.12 In Europe, too, there’s a growing divide between the haves and the have-nots. ... Granted, it all happened very fast. Whereas in 1964 each of the four largest American companies still had an average workforce of about 430,000 people, by 2011 they employed only a quarter that number, despite being worth twice as much.14 Or take the tragic fate of Kodak, inventor of the digital camera and a company that in the late 1980s had 145,000 people on its payroll. In 2012, it filed for bankruptcy, while Instagram – the free online mobile photo service staffed by 13 people at the time – was sold to Face-book for $1 billion.The reality is that it takes fewer and fewer people to create a successful business, meaning that when a business succeeds, fewer and fewer people benefit. (hide spoiler)]Obviously we need massive redistribution of wealth, but how is that ever going to happen? Bregman remains mum. (view spoiler)[The scenario of radical inequality that is taking shape in the U.S. is not our only option. The alternative is that at some point during this century, we reject the dogma that you have to work for a living. The richer we as a society become, the less effectively the labor market will be at distributing prosperity. If we want to hold onto the blessings of technology, ultimately there’s only one choice left, and that’s redistribution. Massive redistribution.Redistribution of money (basic income), time (a shorter working week), taxation (on capital instead of labor), and, of course, of robots. As far back as the 19th century, Oscar Wilde looked forward to the day when everybody would benefit from intelligent machines that were “the property of all.” However, technological progress may make a society more prosperous in aggregate, but there’s no economic law that says everyone will benefit.Not long ago, the French economist Thomas Piketty had people up in arms with his contention that if we continue down our current path we’ll soon find ourselves back in the rentier society of the Gilded Age. People who owned capital (stocks, houses, machines) enjoyed a much higher standard of living than folks who merely worked hard. For hundreds of years the return on capital was 4–5%, while annual economic growth lagged behind at under 2%. Barring a resurgence of strong, inclusive growth (rather unlikely), high taxation on capital (equally improbable), or World War III (let’s hope not), inequality could develop to frightening proportions once again.All the standard options – more schooling, regulation, austerity – will be a drop in the bucket. In the end, the only solution is a worldwide, progressive tax on wealth, says Professor Piketty, though he acknowledges this is merely a “useful utopia.” And yet, the future is not carved in stone. All throughout history, the march toward equality has always been steeped in politics. If a law of common progress fails to manifest itself of its own accord, there is nothing to stop us from enacting it ourselves.

(hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[This paradox is neatly summed up by an anecdote from the 1960s. When Henry Ford’s grandson gave labor union leader Walter Reuther a tour of the company’s new, automated factory, he jokingly asked, “Walter, how are you going to get those robots to pay your union dues?” Without missing a beat, Reuther answered, “Henry, how are you going to get them to buy your cars?” (hide spoiler)]He doesn't have a solution for what to replace GDP with, but I can't fault him for that. Inevitably you end up in the Tony Blair trap of measuring everything, and getting nothing done, like in that Adam Curtis doc: (view spoiler)[A great idea, admittedly. There’s no denying that GDP came in very handy during wartime, when the enemy was at the gates and a country’s very existence hinged on production, on churning out as many tanks, planes, bombs, and grenades as possible. During wartime, it’s perfectly reasonable to borrow from the future. During wartime, it makes sense to pollute the environment and go into debt. It can even be preferable to neglect your family, put your children to work on a production line, sacrifice your free time, and forget everything that makes life worth living.Indeed, during wartime, there’s no metric quite as useful as the GDP. ...The point, of course, is that the war is over. Our standard of progress was conceived for a different era with different problems. Our statistics no longer capture the shape of our economy. And this has consequences. Every era needs its own figures. In the 18th century, they concerned the size of the harvest. In the 19th century, the radius of the rail network, the number of factories, and the volume of coal mining. And in the 20th, industrial mass production within the boundaries of the nation-state.But today it’s no longer possible to express our prosperity in simple dollars, pounds, or euros. From healthcare to education, from journalism to finance, we’re all still fixated on “efficiency” and “gains,” as though society were nothing but one big production line. But it’s precisely in a service-based economy that simple quantitative targets fail. “The gross national product […] measures everything […] except that which makes life worthwhile,” said Robert Kennedy (hide spoiler)]On how to change people's minds and promote new ideas: (view spoiler)[James Kuklinski, a political scientist at the University of Illinois, discovered that people are most likely to change their opinions if you confront them with new and disagreeable facts as directly as possible. ... If it is true that that ideas don’t change things gradually but in fits and starts – in shocks – then the basic premise of our democracy, our journalism, and our education is all wrong. It would mean, in essence, that the Enlightenment model of how people change their opinions – through information-gathering and reasoned deliberation – is really a buttress for the status quo. It would mean that those who swear by rationality, nuance, and compromise fail to grasp how ideas govern the world.

They are logically presented and supported with facts and tons of research and history. It is an enlightening read, and I wish politicians and policy makers would read books like this.

The world will never be the same again. At that point in the conversation - and there are damned few conversations to be had right now, but nevertheless, at that point I tend to go a bit quiet. Because what I'm thinking is 'BULLSHIT'. (Which I'm too polite to say). 'Cos what I'm thinking is, actually, people have really, really short memories and those who haven't been left unemployed and homeless by the projected economic downturn will go back to Life As They Knew It, and in fact we'll have a sudden surge as everyone tries to catch up with all the holidays they missed and the stuff they didn't buy... Only this morning on German TV there was an idea that the car industry would need a government boost after the corona crisis (Really?!) Subsidies to encourage people to buy cars, and not, as was the case pre-pandemic, to encourage people to buy electric cars, no! The government proposes to use taxpayers' money to pay people to buy ANY kind of car. But then maybe the idea people are expressing is not so much a prediction as a fervent wish.And that is not bullshit, not at all, in fact it's reasonable and sensible, because, as Bregman points out in this dazzling work, a sudden shock CAN be a powerful instrument of change. The thing is though that the ideas for change have to already be flying around, like the famous roast chickens in Cockaigne, ready to be plucked from the air. I suppose the radical New Thinking that was gaining currency just before Covid 19 was Climate Change. And now we can all see that life still goes on with all planes grounded and minimal road traffic and a reduction in industrial manufacturing, and surprise! We get a reduction in CO2. Who'd have thought. But a total lockdown is not a viable model for the long term future, I imagine.So here are some ideas (nothing to do with the climate) to get us started in time for the NEXT crisis:1.

I'm a big fan of The Correspondent's journalism, and believe that basic income is an important idea whose time might have come. It was certainly interesting to learn more about the history, and the few studies that have been undertaken. Also fascinating to learn more about the history and failings of GDP as a measure.However the attempts to persuade seemed full of holes and contradictions. One minute the author is complaining about how technological progress has slowed to ""slightly improved iterations of the same phone we bought a couple of years ago"". The next he is championing how ""the average African with a cell phone has access to more information than President Clinton did in the 1990s"" and this fails to be reflected in GDP. On one page he's railing against ""bullshit jobs"" like HR managers (!*), then just a few pages later he's advocating a reformation of the education system to create more jobs for artists and philosophers. It's frustrating, especially when he's trying to sell such big and worthy ideas.* Maybe I would have agreed with him on this at one point, but if the past year or so has taught me anything it's that HR people are fucking important."

Why not support a universal basic income and a shorter work week! You'd also take a couple of steps towards gender equality to boot! By the time I finished Bregman's rousing epilogue about moving the Overton window, I turned to my husband and whispered, ""I think I'm a socialist now."""

The modern creed – or worse, the belief that there’s nothing left to believe in – makes us blind to the shortsightedness and injustice that still surround us every day. To give a few examples: Why have we been working harder and harder since the 1980s despite being richer than ever? Why are millions of people still living in poverty when we are more than rich enough to put an end to it once and for all? And why is more than 60% of your income depends on the country where you just happen to have been born?24 Utopias offer no ready-made answers, let alone solutions. But they do ask the right questions.
I’ve had this on my TBR since 2017. Upon watching the viral video of Bregman at Davos berating the billionaires for not paying their fair share of taxes, I felt I had to read his book. For those of you who haven’t seen that short speech here it is https://www.theguardian.com/business/... .As you can tell from my rating, I’m very happy I read this book. It was riveting, informative, and most importantly, it challenged and changed some of my ideas. I love when this happens.Bregman is starting to be known as the “universal basic income guy”. I don’t know about you, in the past year or so I’ve come across some articles about this notion, half dismissing it as undoable. Upon reading this book, I’ve changed my mind. It sounds like a far-fetched idea until you read more about it.In the past, the economists and other people in the know were predicting the working week will be around 15 hrs by 2030. Obviously, it didn’t happen, and it’s unlikely to, if anything, the opposite is true, especially for certain countries in the developed world, especially the USA, Japan, South Korea etc. But many of the more enlightened European countries are moving towards shorter and shorter weekly hours, the Netherlands is at the top with an average of 27.5 hrs/week followed very closely by Germany. Another thing that Bregman discusses in depth is poverty, homelessness and foreign aid to poor countries. I’m a proud and loud lefty, and even I have, better said, had, some misconceptions about poor people and poverty, and I was far from being one of those people who go on and on about “why don’t they just get a job and why do they keep having so many kids (well, I still think that about everyone – because of overpopulation) and they should stop drinking and smoking (I dislike drinking and smoking in everyone) etc. 
The big reason poor people are poor is because they don’t have enough money,” notes economist Charles Kenny, “and it shouldn’t come as a huge surprise that giving them money is a great way to reduce that problem.
Those more sceptical will probably huff and puff at all these utopian ideals, but guess what, most good things we take for granted today, such as democracy, women’s right to vote, birth control, you name it, they were all considered “undoable”, “unnecessary” in the beginning. Somebody, usually on the fringes, had an idea, a vision. Look, I can go on and on about this book. It’s by no means perfect, but it gave me food for thought and it whetted my appetite to read more books/articles on such important issues. If you have any suggestions/links do let me know.Highly recommended"
9,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49368027-adrian-hon,3,"A reasonably good summary of the history of universal basic income and the drive to a shorter working week, although if you've read a few long essays on those topics it's unlikely you'll learn much. Unfortunately the book is spoiled by a few things. Firstly, while I get that it has a point of view that it's conveying (one that I agree with!), I could've done with more opposing arguments, if only to arm myself in future.Secondly, one of the arguments is for open borders, which the author suggests would have next to no ill effects - not even in the short term. True, he suggests phasing it them slowly, but it seems to be that there *would* be problems for some people, and to just say 'redistribution!' is not an answer. Finally, he goes off on a bizarre rant at the end against identity politics and the left ""wallowing in moral superiority"" to which I say, FUCK THAT NOISE. Racism and sexism are no small things and it's good that people are upset about them. And why can't the left walk and chew gum at the same time? Striving towards utopia requires true equality and it's a real black eye that this book ends in such a childish manner."
10,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4440796-cristina,5,"Loved it. I'm going to share some of the excerpts I liked.1. Whether you look at the incidents of depression, burnout, drug abuse, high dropout rates, obesity, unhappy childhoods, low election turnout or social and political distrusts, the evidence points to the same culprit every time - inequality. But hold on -- what should it matter if some people are filthy rich if even those who are very poor are better off than the kings of centuries ago? A lot. Because it’s all about relative poverty. However wealthy a country gets, inequality always rains on the parade. Being poor in a rich country is a whole different story to being poor a couple centuries ago, when almost everybody, everywhere was a pauper. Take bullying. Countries with big disparities in wealth also have more bullying behavior because there are bigger status differences. (...) the psychosocial consequences are such that people living in unequal societies spend more time worrying about how others see them. This undercuts the quality of relationships, manifested in a distrust of strangers and status anxiety, for example. The resulting stress, in turn, is a major determinant of illness and chronic health problems. But shouldn’t we be more concerned with equal opportunities than with equal wealth? The fact is that they both matter. These two forms of inequality are inextricable. Just look at the global rankings -- when inequality goes up, social mobility goes down. There’s almost no country on earth where the American dream is less likely than come true than in the US of A. Anybody eager to work their way out from rags to riches is better off trying their luck in Sweden, where people born into poverty can still hold out hope of a brighter future. 2. Imagine this: A welfare mother has her income cut because she hasn’t developed sufficient job skills. The government saves a couple thousand bucks but the hidden costs of children who will consequently grow up poor, eat poor food, get poor grades at school, and be more likely to have a run-in with the law are many times greater. In fact, conservative criticism of the old nanny state hits the nail on the head. The current tangle of red tape keeps people trapped in poverty, it actually produces dependence. Whereas employees are expected to demonstrate their strengths, social services expect claimants to prove over and over that an illness is sufficiently debilitating and that chances at getting higher are sufficiently slim.3. Only Denmark has ever tried to quantify the value of breastfeeding in its GDP. In the US, the production of breastmilk has been estimated at an incredible 110 billion/year (!). About the size of China’s military budget. The GDP also does a poor job of calculating advances in knowledge. (...) If you were the GDP, your ideal citizen would be a drug addict who has cancer, goes through a divorce and pops fistfuls of Prozac and goes bezerk on Black Friday. Mental illness, pollution, crime - in terms of the GDP - the more, the better. That’s also why one of the countries with the highest per capita GDPs, the United States, also leads in social problems. By the standard of the GDP, the worst families in America are those that actually function as families, that cook their own meals, take walks after dinner, and talk together, instead of just farming the kids out to the commercial culture. We live in a world where the more vital your occupation - cleaning, nursing, teaching - the lower you rate in the GDP. 4. In overworked countries like Japan or the United States, people watch an absurd amount of television -- up to 5 hours a day in the US, WHICH ADDS UP TO 9 YEARS IN A LIFETIME. American children spend half more time in front of the TV as they do at school. True leisure, however, is neither a luxury nor a vice. It is as vital to our brains as vitamin C is to our bodies. There’s not a person in the world who on their deathbed thinks ‘had I only put in a few more hours at the office…’ or ‘sat in front of the Tube some more’. 5. Bullshit jobs. The economist John Maynard Keynes predicted that we’d all be working just 15 hours a week by 2030. That our prosperity would shoot through the roof and we’d exchange a sizeable chunk of our wealth for leisure time. In reality, that’s not at all what has happened. We’re plenty more prosperous, but we’re not exactly swimming in a sea of free time -- quite the reverse. We’re all working harder than ever. In the previous chapter, I described how we sacrificed our free time on the altar of consumerism. Keynes certainly didn’t see that coming. But there’s still one puzzle piece that still doesn’t fit. Most people play no part in the production of iPhone cases, in their panoply of colors, exotic shampoos containing botanical extracts, or mocker cookie crumble frappuccinos. Our addiction to consumption is enabled mostly by robots and third-world wage slaves. And although agricultural and manufacturing production capacity have grown exponentially over the past decades, employment in these industries has dropped. So is it really true that our overworked lifestyle all comes down to out of control consumerism?David Graeber wrote a fascinating piece that pinned the blame not on the stuff we buy but on the work we do. It’s titled aptly ‘on the phenomenon of bullshit jobs’. In Graber’s analysis, innumerable people spend their entire working life doing jobs they consider to be pointless. Jobs like telemarketer, HR manager, social media strategist, PR advisor, and a whole host of administrative positions at hospitals, universities and government offices. Bullshit jobs, Graeber calls them. They’re the jobs that even the people doing them admit are, in essence, superfluous. 6. A mere 62 people are richer than 3.5 billion people in the world. (!!!)"
11,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4,One of a spate of books to come out on the Basic Income idea to eliminate poverty and mitigate the coming automation economic crisis. I like the idea myself and the author marshalls studies to back up that a basic income would go a long way to reduce poverty. I am not sure that problem of a sense of purpose will be easier to tackle when robots start taking away large sectors of the labor force but it is better than letting people starve and the economy going to crap. the author also tackles the very large downsides to huge inequality in modern societies that lead to numerous pathologies. Definitely a good guide to the future of this argument.
12,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7381993-katia-n,2,"I was probably misguided as I thought this book would deal predominantly with the idea of a basic income. Specifically, i was intrested in the arguments pro and against it and, preferably, an analysis how it is possible to implement, the impact of automation and which steps might be taken right now. But this book is much broader in scope, and at the same time, pretty shallow. The book is more about the current state of the world with inequality, too much work for some and no for the others, the climate change etc.. It states that we need to have some new ideology to tackle these challenges. But it does not go far enough to define this ideology. It proposes 3 broad areas which hypothetically might improve the current state of the world:- basic income; - shorter work hours;- open borders;I am very sympathetic with all three of them. That was partly the reason why I’ve picked up this book. But though it provides the reader with some historic anecdotes, it does not go far enough to specify where are we specifically in terms of those 3 areas; and what has to be done to get us where we want to be. There are some interesting observations and facts. For example, there is a story how president Nixon was on the verge of introducing the basic income in the US but was stopped by another story of the nineteenth-century English Speenhamland plan. There is also information about the experiments in the 70s Canada and Seattle. But what about more current situation - not much! The main illustration is 13 homeless people in London in 2009. 9 of them apparently has reformed their ways (not sure what happened with another 6). There is no information about Swiss referendum on basic income (overwhelming rejected with 77% against) or the Finland experiment which is currently underway. They’ve just briefly mentioned at the end of the book. These discussions would be much more useful going forward than Nixon’s fiasco. It is not even totally clear whether the author proposes to replace all welfare state wth a regular lump sum payment (quite radical libertarian view) or he wants to give people money on the top of everything else.On the shorter work hours, quite a bit of a narrative is focused on criticising “bullshit jobs” (bankers of course, but also the lawyers (hopefully only the corporate ones), consultants, marketers etc - journalists as well?). vs very useful jobs of the NY cleaners. I am sure NY cleaners’ job satisfaction is great and they are all happy as ever. But would this very useful and fantastic job satisfy a bright young person on the basis of bringing the huge public value? I know that the bright kids should all start doing research how to solve the global problems instead of doing “bullshit jobs”. But the main question is “how” and “who would pay for it”? I did not find the answer in the book.The question of open borders is very close to my heart as i seriously believe in it. He is a bit more constructive. He defines 7 perceptive myths about the emigrants. And this discussion is a bit more concrete. But unfortunately, I did not find all of his debunking arguments very convincing. And in this case i cannot see how he can convince someone who is really against this idea. For example, he “debunks” the misconception that all immigrants are criminals. Specially, he talks about the youth crime of the second generation Maroccans in the Netherlands. Apparently, there is no correlation between the ethnicity and the levels of the criminal activity. But that was not the question! The question was is there a correlation between the status (second generation immigrant) and the criminal activity. It is not the same is it? I hope the answer is “no” as well. But such confusion undermines the whole credibility of the debate. And after all “debunking”, he is appeared to be not really very ambitions at all:“Opening our borders is not something we can do overnight, of course - not should it be. Unchecked migration would certainly corrode social cohesion in the Land of Plenty.” (That is after a few pages ago he debunked the misconception that the immigrants are undermining the social cohesion!”) So he is thinking just “making a crack in the door” - increase it on 3% (annually?) or something like that.I do not want to continue listing what i found unsatisfying about this book - you’ve got the picture. There are a lot of pathos and good rhetorics, but that is about it. Apart from a few interesting anecdotes and observations, it was useless for me. It definitely would not make you any wiser if you are interested to find out more about the current theory and practice in the area of basic income. And there are much better books on the state of the world. Even the latest Friedman’s endeavour is better Thank You for Being Late: An Optimist's Guide to Thriving in the Age of Accelerations. "
13,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6753400-gabrielle,5,"My father once told me that he felt I was very pessimistic, to which I replied that I was too much of a realist to be an optimist. Don’t get me wrong, when stuff is good, I am more than happy to celebrate it, but I’m also not the type to pretend everything is great when things are objectively terrible. The title “Utopia for Realists” grabbed me right away, because I’m pretty sure that if you ask any so-called realist, you’ll find they want nothing more than to believe the world could be a better place; they just can’t quite see how that might – realistically – happen.Rutger Bregman’s thesis of how to make the world a better place in a very concrete way is threefold: installing a basic universal income, putting the average working week at about 15 hours, and opening the borders. If you are the type that sees the Scandinavian model in a good light, you won’t need much convincing to hop on his bandwagon, but he’ll nevertheless illustrate his points with solid facts, detailed research and very convincing arguments. Considering that I am one of those weirdos who thinks everyone deserves to be healthy, well-fed, decently housed and properly educated, I found so many things in this book interesting and inspiring.Near the end of “Bullshit Jobs, A Theory” (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...), David Graeber mentions the idea of universal basic income as one way to solve this economic and existential crisis that is the BS job conundrum. Bregman explores the concept to demonstrate that when people’s basic needs are met without them having to worry about how to pay the bills, they are happier, healthier and more productive members of their society – which stimulates their local economy much better that letting them live hand to mouth and burden the healthcare system because all they can afford is terrible food. The money from such programs is most often used to go to school, fix residences in need of repair, support a family member’s parental leave and start small businesses. One his of key points in addressing the various ways we can reduce and even eliminate poverty is that when you take care of people, either by giving them cash or putting a roof over their heads, the state saves money and wealth is created. Ergo, all of society stands to benefit (side note: with the pandemic, I think the need for that kind of universal basic income is more obvious than ever because no one should put their or their family’s health and lives at risk to pay the bills).Bregman also sides with Graeber (he actually refers to his work in this section) on the topic of working fewer hours for greater productivity and a heathier amount of leisure – and thus time to do things that make life more enjoyable and meaningful. He addresses the “crisis” of automation, the disparity between what I’ll call useful jobs and somewhat less useful jobs.I learned a lot in his section about opening up the borders. I recently read a book that mentions the absolutely terrible practice of human trafficking, and how a lot of border and economic regulations make such a practice almost unavoidable (see “McMafia” https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...). Bregman looks at all the usual opposition to open borders, and why the overwhelming majority of them make no sense.By the time the book wrapped up, I could see how his three suggestions were the most logical and sane ways to eliminate poverty and generally fix a lot of systemic problems that trickle down into all of our lives. Following his recommendation would not lead to a perfect world, but it would certainly improve it significantly, and more importantly, communally.I appreciate that Bregman didn’t waste time or ink bashing his ideological opponents. Most books about making the world a better place tend to fill many pages describing why the conservatives are wrong and how terrible they are and offer very little in the way of concrete ideas, and this book is the refreshing opposite to that. I doubt that anyone picking it up needs to be convinced that people who think the poor are lazy are wrong, anyway. His tone is conversational, easy to follow and understand even if you don’t have a degree in economics – and he’s often quite funny. And sure, some elements are depressing to read about (like the story of how Nixon’s basic income bill was shot down by Randians using falsified science…), but those are things we need to talk about and think about if anything is going to change. The hardest thing, as he points out, is changing the way we think about certain problems. Cognitive dissonance is one of the biggest hurdle to overcome if the world is to change for the best.One has to be fair and acknowledge Bregman’s euro-centric bias; he clearly thinks that the USA is a failed experiment (and this book was published 4 years ago, so heaven knows his opinion can’t possibly have improved). It doesn’t really matter that I agree with him, but it has to be kept in mind while reading this book. He also clearly hates bankers – another sentiment I can understand, but that nevertheless colors parts of his analysis.Overall, a very interesting, easy to read and understand, engaging and ultimately hopeful book about the world we could have.

15,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28397995-nancy,4,"We have lost our vision, Rutger Bregman writes, mired in old paradigms and blind to the possibilities we should be imagining. We could be realizing the world predicted by 20th c thinkers.Subtitled ""How We Can Build The Ideal World,"" Utopia for Realists is an international best seller, first published in the Netherlands where it ignited a debate and inspired a movement.Bregman begins by reminding us of how recently life was a ""vale of tears,"" ""solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short,"" as philosophers wrote in the 16th c. With the explosion of new technology and prosperity over the last two hundred years, humanity has achieved a standard of living that Medieval folk would consider Utopia; indoor heat and cooling, flush toilets and clean water alone would make them marvel. So would obesity from an overabundance of easily obtained food, the magical ability to protect ourselves from smallpox and polio, and paved roads we travel at 70 mph--without fear of highwaymen robberies.Have we reached Utopia? Or is there something we can do to make life even better? How can we solve the problems that remain: fearfulness, unemployment, quality of life, poverty. The welfare state 'from a bygone era' doesn't work today. Globalization and the cost of higher education have impacted the stability of the Middle Class. Upward mobility for the poor no longer happens.Bregman wants to ""fling open the windows of our minds"" to discover ""a new lodestar."" He presents studies and experiments about how we treat the homeless and the poor and challenges our traditional mindset that people are to be blamed for their own poverty--they just have to work hard and save. We have created welfare programs for those in need, which are costly and do not solve the basic problem. What happened to the expectation of the 15-hour workweek? Why are we spending more time working, impacting our health and our families?Bregman wants us to dream new dreams and embrace ideas that can change the world for the better. Thinking outside the box has made a difference: abolition, universal voting rights, and same-sex marriage, he reminds, were all once considered impossible. All it takes is ""a single opposing voice.The basis of Bregman's new Utopia is a guaranteed basic income. He presents studies that demonstrate the success of such programs. In 1967 universal basic income was supported by 80% of Americans and President Nixon submitted a bill to eradicate poverty.Other changes he offers include shorter work hours, proven to increase productivity, reconsidering the importance of the Gross Domestic Product as our economic standard of success, improving quality of life, open borders, taxing capital instead of labor, and adjusting salary to a job's societal value. At a time when productivity is a record levels, there are fewer jobs and lower salaries. ""We have to devise a system to ensure that everybody benefits,"" he writes.There is an old saying: Insanity is doing the same thing over and expecting different results. Instead of holding more tightly to the old ways we need to envision innovation. Perhaps books like this will spur discussions and reevaluations.One can only hope.I received a free ebook from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for a fair and unbiased review."
16,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35434974-kevin,3,"How far can a Western Social Democrat go? This book reaches (runs into?) its limits…The Good:--Top marks for accessibility; engaging writing-style especially for Western audiences, like that of David Graeber and Matt Taibbi. --Dutch historian Bregman joins Development economist Ha-Joon Chang as leading Social Democrats; highlights from this book:1) UBI, automation, reducing work, and bullshit jobs: the core of the book, with engaging historical narrative and case studies. Also, useful chapter breaking down GDP (origins in war production capacity). Speaking of jobs, Green New Deal is missing here... 2) Open borders: this was the brightest highlight for me, as imperialism is my top critique of Social Democrats. --Bregman had me convinced he would spiral down the imperialist path by starting the chapter with “foreign aid”. Yes, within the framework of foreign aid, the process of using randomized controlled trials instead of intuition that Bregman details is transformative. But anyone who takes a step back and considers the big picture/magnitude of the world’s political economy, who considers imperialism (a word omitted by Social Democrats), understands that “foreign aid” is trivial compared to the systemic unequal exchange in the global division of labor. Some Social Dems engage with unequal exchange, like Ha-Joon Chang: Bad Samaritans: The Myth of Free Trade and the Secret History of Capitalism). Furthermore, challenges to unequal exchange are frequently met with starvation (economic sanctions) and bloodshed (funding terrorism, military interventions). ""Foreign aid"" has no place in a book on utopia.--Thus, Bregman suddenly changing gears by saying ""foreign aid"" is actually low on the economic food chain and supporting “open borders” was most unexpected. I wish he used the entire chapter to fully unpack “open borders”, particularly its economic myths. Still, Bregman tops my Social Dems list for this. 3) How do ideas change the world? Learn from the bad guys: Bregman uses the example of neoliberal think-tank Mont Pelerin Society (Hayek, Friedman) first setting the ideological groundwork, then the OPEC stagflation crisis allowing Thatcher/Reagan regimes to implement these ideas; slick way to tie this book together. No more “underdog socialism”, utopia is about dreaming big and winning. The Bad/Missing:--Social Democrats believe in the contradiction of democracy (one-person-one-vote) and capitalism (one-dollar-one-vote). How does someone pushing utopia still cling onto ""capitalism"" so fervently? Here, I will try an alternate approach to the Marxist surplus value exploitation argument: let us break down the key components of the economy, and you tell me how much ""capitalism"" belongs in utopia:1) Banking: this is where economics begins, going into debt to secure the capital required. Bregman lambastes bankers as parasitic on numerous occasions, but only offers regulations in response. That requires States powerful enough and willing to side with the public over private bankers. How does he not bring up public banking?! Why is credit not treated as a public utility? Why do we continue to give a cartel of private bankers the privilege to create money out of nothing (credit), lend feverishly until the bubble bursts, and get bailed out by taxpayers? People already distrust bankers; you do not need to shatter the heroic private profit-seeker fantasy with them. To explore:-The Public Bank Solution: From Austerity to Prosperity-Where Does Money Come From?: A Guide To The Uk Monetary And Banking System2) Monopolies/cartels: for natural monopolies like natural resources/utilities and many large-scale industries, these are already centrally-planned; they should be made public and operated democratically (worker cooperatives). If machines become so vital to the society, why continue to keep them in so few private hands and rely on States powerful enough to regulate this? Information technology further erodes private ownership: Postcapitalism: A Guide to Our Future. Worker co-ops further democracy into the workplace, a step towards economic democracy/participatory economics, instead of restricting democracy to political theater spectatorship (vote...). --If we stop here, the economy can no longer be described with the single word “capitalism”. Debate small businesses elsewhere, the productivity of the modern economy is built on banks and cartels of multinational corporations. --Overall avoidance of power relations/imperialism/class analysis leads to illusory reliance on State redistribution of private accumulation (and extremely concentrated at that!). Similarly, war is described as extremely costly and wasteful. But, as Michael Parenti reminds us to ask, cui bono?! (https://youtu.be/O8k0yO-deoA?t=26) ...These wars preserve capitalist profits, protecting the layers of power politics that unequal exchange resides on. Once again the proposed solution is State regulation, in this case taxing harmful externalities. Keep chasing the tail, keep faith in the gospel of private innovation (even Social Dems can point out innovation from public sector R&D). Social production but private accumulation has no place in utopia.--Lingering tone of Eurocentric history, “progress” (a Dutch historian, can you believe it). The extraordinary Amiya Kumar Bagchi dives into such illusions in Perilous Passage: Mankind and the Global Ascendancy of Capital..."

I've been trying my best to broaden my understanding of not only the problems facing the world, but reasonable solutions. Utopia for Realists proposes three concepts (universal basic income, a 15-hour work week, and open borders) that often come up during political debates for which I had little opinion prior to reading.Fortunately, I caught a cool talk at a pediatric conference discussing the benefits of eradicating poverty on child health that seemed to agree with a lot of what Bregman is suggesting. It was refreshing to hear material I often find dull spun into a message which I could easily appreciate. Though the main impediment seems to be well-worth ruts of political thought, it's hopeful to read optimistic messages that others openly share. It was also great to read Bregman's well-written and mostly colloquial language for what can quickly become a jargon-filled info dump.On a more personal level, this just isn't the type of thing that I live for. I mean, the concepts, sure, but it is not my favourite reading experience. Science writing, autobiography, and true crime tend to be my nonfiction niches and I found myself easily glazing over during extended reading. Though everything is well explained, I wasn't gripped by the historical fact the way some readers might be.In summary: a short primer that is an occasional snooze."

19,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49782194-conor-ahern,4,"I ended up really liking this book. It explores a lot of ideas that we reflexively reject, likely because they go against common sense. Ideas like ""just give poor people cash"" seem not only politically infeasible, but unwise. And sadly, our politics is dictated by soundbites and conventional wisdom, and we wonder why we only dig ourselves deeper into wealth inequality and dissatisfaction with government at all levels.This book explores concepts like universal basic income, open borders, and cash substitutes for our current forms of welfare/charity, in a way that makes me hopeful they might one day be implemented on a large scale, or at least experimented with. Not that ideas that make all the sense in the world for our peer countries have ever really prodded the United States into action--see, e.g., universal healthcare and noninterventionist military policy--but I might be able to dust off that Irish passport and decamp for one of the more enlightened countries once this one starts to really tear itself apart.Lest I leave it on that unsavory note, I wonder whether the silver lining from this Trump administration might just be that we are so screwed up or have such a political mandate that trying these things out becomes palatable, if not necessary. I just wonder why--when one political party is trying to drag us backward and the other one, overly proud of its respectability, insists on keeping us in stasis--there isn't more of a yen for something radical and outside the box. Here's hoping more of the 2020 candidates trade on the yen for something different and begin exploring these things through their platforms. Even if they don't implement them, this book correctly notes that the Overton Window would be shifted thereby. "
20,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/765636-ray,5,"Is it hyperbolic to say that this book may change the world? If you've already read about Universal Basic Income (UBI), or really anything by a good myth-busting economist which challenges our current era of capitalism, then Utopia for Realists may not teach you too much that you don't already know. Overall Rutger Bregman''s way is just to summarize some main big ideas into a readable paperback, and yet that is the whole point. There are plenty of graphs which will convince the reader that income inequality is a leading social problem, and even some surprising historical examples of how realistic giving away free money to alleviate poverty would be. (The now famous Nixon example! And Speenhamland, what an unfortuante misinterpretation ... Bregman is primarily a historian after all.) So read up to learn why value shouldn't actually be measured by a nation's GDP, and about how arbitrary it is that neoliberalism won out in the end because it could have gone so many other ways. Yet most of all, take this hopefully-important book as a manifesto. A call to stop accepting that the way it is now is the way it has to be, and instead embrace these valid possibilities for new utopias. That is ultimately the point. The world has changed for the better before, and it can change for the better again. In bigger ways than we think. This in essence is what's being called for, to inspire leaders and citizens to have more ambition and actually improve everyone's lives. Really, if we can't think harder about how to make life better then what's the point of civilization? I truly hope this book fulfils such potential and does have that big an impact, I really do. Therefore, of course, very recommended for everyone in the world to read. "

This book is NOT realistic AT ALL, the numbers just simply don't add up. If you know anything about macroeconomics and theory of markets, the alternative proposed in this book is just laughable. This guy is a journalist and ""historian"" (although not really a historian) so it's acceptable that he doesn't know anything about economics. Problem arouses when someone with no credentials and education starts writing about the topic. This is sadly prevalent in most ""humanities"" topics. (Although economics is a science, but it get's lumped up with humanities). Take physics for example, you simply CAN NOT write anything on the topic if you don't have the credentials, first of all, no one will publish it and then even if it's published, people will bash it to oblivion. But somehow it's okay if it's economics. You can right the most idealistic, unscientific, batshit insane things and there will be people who eat it up. This is just sad.

24,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12798350-andrew,5,"Utopia for Realists: How we Can Build the Ideal World, by Rutger Bregman, is a fascinating book about the idea of Utopia in a modern, realistic context. Early concepts of Utopia revolved around basic needs; food falling from the sky, safety and health, and so on. Bregman says we are there already. Food is no longer scarce in most countries, and poverty rates and crime is down globally - to the lowest levels in history. Instead, many nations are grappling with other issues - overwork, obesity, lack of leisure time, economic inequality that is reaching levels not seen since medieval times... and so on. How is society to tackle these issues? Bregman makes a few strong arguments, chiefly, a guaranteed annual income. This idea has been experimented and trialed before, notably in Canada and the US, with countries like Switzerland and the Netherlands tinkering with the idea of making it national policy. Bregman argues that giving people money with no strings attached in actually more efficient, encourages growth and productivity, and so much more. Bregman notes numerous studies and trials of monetary transfers like this. One notable example is a trial in London, England, where 13 homeless ""frequent flyers"" - in and out of hospitals, jail etc. - were given 3000 pounds flat out, no strings attached. Before, these 13 had been costing the state around 400000 pounds a year (yes, that much) in legal fees, jail costs, healthcare costs, social services costs, and so on. in comparison, 3000 pounds is a very small percentage of their total yearly cost to the taxpayer. This money made a huge impact on the lives of these 13 - in a small period of time, some had enrolled in courses, some were working, some in rehab, and some in new housing. Numerous other studies are cited within the book, pointing to the benefits of basic income and disproving many of the criticisms. Bregman argues that basic income does not make people lazy, but instead motivates them to go back to school, start small businesses, engage in creative passions, and just enjoy life a bit more. After all, nobody regrets not spending enough time at the office on there death beds. Instead, they regret not spending enough time with family and friends, or not pursuing their passions. Bregman's book is refreshing for a few reasons; first and foremost is the hopeful, upbeat tone. So many political books coming out in modern times are negative. They purport ideas that have little meaning, say almost nothing, and offer no innovation or invention in the field. So many jobs these days - as Bregman quotes, are bullshit. People's lives lack meaning. But this can all be easily changed by opening the door to a few innovative ideas. Basic income. Shorter work weeks. Paying public service workers like nurses, teachers, garbage collectors etc. more money, and paying lobbyists, corporate lawyers and hedge fund managers less. Encouraging banks to hold more assets. And so on. This book is fascinating, simple in conception, and very interesting. It is certainly a recommended read for those looking for a good introduction to the idea (not the quantitative analysis) of basic income. It is also a left leaning book that is not disparaging to the right, and has respect for other fields, ideologies and ideas. A great book. "

A few counterintuitive examples (which I like and enjoy) that changed the way I think about work and finance. n.b: if you take one thing from this book or review let it be this- 'Read the Epilogue'. It's good!In an ideal world we'd have this utopia (obviously!) but due to the narrowmindedness of low-information voters and their politicians (whom they think are looking out for them! Ha!) it's highly doubtful we'll see UBI succeed, let alone implemented. If it wasn't for the Koch-style Dark Money (from the ridiculous Citizens United SC decision - which maybe before 2030 will be overturned) and the nutty idealogues I might be more hopeful and optimistic. Unfortunately the damage is done and will take a long time to undo and recover. Nothing changed after the Panama Papers and now the Paradise Papers on tax havens, some entities (let's stop calling them humans or people, they're not like us) are just evil (and let's start just using the simple definition which is 'stopping the flow of good') and in that evil there is selfishness and greed of which magnitudes we've not seen in modern history (OK well the Gilded Age of the 1920s was a different time and inequality today is greater by most standards given that women can vote and work today). It's cringey seeing people that are outraged at inequality and yet are spending their hard earned money on products that go to funding and furthering tax cheats and inequality. The average person lacks insight, their ego is supreme. I just laugh at people that use Apple and Nike products, especially when they claim to be 'woke'. One day or some day I just pity them. I have given up gently pointing out how their market choices affect everyone and there are ethical options out there, perhaps I should just ignore it or find other ways. It's long past time caring or getting upset about it. The more things change, the more they stay the same - as the saying goes.

27,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71147186-justine,5,"This book blew me AWAY!! And I'm really not joking here. It changed my way of thinking: I didn't even know I was thinking this way until Rutger Bregman put his finger on the problem and showed me the way (okay, it sounds preachy told like this, but it's not!) I wanted to read this book because I wanted to believe there is more to this world than just the actual situation. I live in France, and it's not that glorious, be it personal or national. When I stumbled upon Utopia for Realists, I told myself: ""Well, why not? It can't harm me after all!"" Well, it could. Because this book is both depressing and motivating. First, depressing because the state of the world can't be but depressing, be it considering the situation in occidental countries or the one in African ones. We could have ended the poverty long ago, and even if we are far wealthier than in ""ancient times"", we are not happier. We are stuck in this that we can't go back to our former values, to what really matters in life, because we don't know how, or if we're allowed to. But, it's also super motivating, because, after finishing this book, I wanted to make things work like never before. I saw (warning, it's get dramatic) the light at the end of the tunnel. We can go out of this situation. We can make things better. It's in our hands! Otherwise, it is well written and fluid, the author explains things really well and he gives ALL his sources! There is nothing he says without quoting a book, an article, a study, and giving the reference for the reader to check, or to learn more about the topic! (so, I (obviously!) added some other books to my TBR!) Sometimes, it is quite light, which is refreshing considering the topic! Honestly, I really think everyone should read this book: we could really do something all together and it would clearly be a win-win situation for everyone!

I found the arguments for a basic wage most compelling, with some interesting history (who ever knew that Nixon would have got a basic wage passed in 1968 if not for the damn Democrats!? One has to wonder what would have happened to the US and the rise of Trump had he been successful). Three stars as the book seemed to petered out at the end, with none of the ideas put forward in enough depth to really make the arguments fundamentally convincing (esp. relating to open borders).

Imagine a pandemic hitting states who's citizens receive an universal basic income, securing their livelihood!In ""Utopia for Realists"" Rutger Bregman argues for his three visions for the future: a 15-hour working week, a world without borders and a universal basic income for everyone. Unfortunately the introduction of this book is really weak with enumerating inventions and conditions of our present to state under which high standards we would be living, desperately lacking reflection. He talks for example about medical technology enabling patients with spinal cord injuries to walk again but completely fails to mention, that health insurance companies refuse to provide them to patients due to high costs, that people are getting older due to medical care, but under conditions that are ethically questionable to say the least, or that the number of people committing suicide are three times as high as deaths from vehicle accidents. He does recognize depression though, which according to him is caused by our inability to imagine anything better than what we already have. I highly contradict that. Thankfully he then turns around and starts to recognize, that the empowerment of the individual doesn't just lead to more freedom but a constant feeling of failure when not being able to live up to the expectations.After this disappointing introduction he turns to the universal income for everyone where it get‘s interesting. He lingers between anecdote, academic research and statistics and highlights examples of how these policies have already been partially implemented in the past. For example how a universal basic income was almost introduced in the United States under Nixon, or how a Canadian basic annual income program barely dented the enthusiasm for work, but let to a drop in crime, truancy, hospital attendance, domestic violence and poverty. I believe that this topic needs to be on our politics agendas! I agree that the costs that we invest in our social system aren‘t just completely ineffective but also contra-productive. Because of our current pandemic we can‘t close our eyes to these options anymore and which consequences it would have if we already would have considered it!In the second part of the books he introduces his vision for a 15 hour work week in 2030, because our economy would be that wealthy, that no more was required. Even though he dedicates an entire chapter to it, he somehow fails to connect it to the basic income model. Also it completely ignores the variety of work fields, which seems ironic to me because he deprecates the work fields the biggest part of our society works in, as being unproductive, replaceable and unable to provide any value to society. Such as lawyer, bankers,economists,companies,media...vs. doctors, fire fighter, farmers. Those who would actually produce. But particularly in those areas, work times are in important factor of the ability to produce in the first place and practice is gained by long periods of training. While the concept wouldn't apply to self employers to begin with, those who would be able to instantly instate the concept are those the author diminishes.He then argues for a world without borders, which probably shows the biggest lack of reflection. More people migrating freely would require more energy, leading to more jobs, which is why they would start to produce more and ultimately invest more money back into the economy. But about which jobs are were talking about here? Particularly the jobs the author valued above as the only ones of worth require decades of education in difficult fields. Not only do they require a high level of adaption to our language to say the least, the areas themselves are also not able to adapt to sudden changes in requirements as well. Our current situation teaches us what happens, if there are suddenly more patients than ventilators available to us, but the same goes for housing, food production etc. Open borders always would be influences by sudden movements caused by political actions, natural catastrophes and poverty, it wouldn't just be a gradual floating state. And just as important: What about culture differences? What about religious believes that collide? What about language barriers? What about geographical space limitations? What about different legal systems? What about border controls in order to provide safety for let‘s say outbreaking viruses or prosecution? The author really couldn't convince me of this idea.A very thought provoking book. I obviously don‘t agree with a big part of what the author says but these topics need to be discussed. Particularly the basic income.PS: For me stars are a measurement of impact rather than liking. A five star book isn‘t necessarily one I entirely agree with, but can also mean that it provoked me to think intensely and forced me to form strong opinions, which can‘t even be measured in stars and is one of the main purposes I read books to begin with."
34,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47154315-ian,3,"This is a well-written, well-articulated treatise on the Utopian ideals of a shorter work week, a Universal Basic Income, and other rights for working class people.Unfortunately, although the author wrote well and supported the ideas with a wealth of statistics, there isn't really much new here. Social progressives have held these ideals for years--as Bregman himself demonstrates in his historical references to earlier experiments for the UBI--but society never seems to get any closer to realizing them. I had hoped the author would review these concepts and then explain in detail how to go about attaining them in practice, given that governments continually see overwhelming data of their merit but consistently fail to act.Bregman does briefly look at this stumbling-block near the end of the book in the chapter of How Ideas Change the World. As he states,The question is not CAN new ideas defeat old ones; the question is HOW.Other than reminding us that crises can often drive larger changes than small tentative, rational steps, Bregman disappointing has little to offer. This is a shame, especially given the current world crisis with Covid, where there do seem to be some current openings to such ideas. But without some strong leaders pointing the way, we instead seem destined to return to a (perhaps slightly newer) normal that may prove to be negligibly different than the recent status quo. Sadly, it seems built into human nature to be unable to change our minds and behaviours, even when the best evidence is staring us directly in the face. I deeply wish Bregman had a better answer and could have prescribed some more proactive steps forward.That said, the book is an important read, especially for those unfamiliar with the progressive Utopian concepts, such as a Universal Basic Income that historically has good hard data supporting its implementation. It is sad that Bregman somewhat infers in his own text that those who need to read and absorb the information will never do so."

He makes cases for specifics such as Universal Basic Income, a fifteen-hour workweek, open borders, and more, but also challenges us to confront our values, most importantly the ridiculously out of proportion worth that we as a society we give to jobs which don't create any value ( investment banks, speculators of all kinds, much of the service industries that don't actually provide any services ) compared to those things that are vital, fulfilling or actually create wealth. The best example he gives is the contrasting strikes of garbage collectors in New York in 1968 which brought that great city to its knees in ten days ( leaving 100, 000 tons of trash on the streets ) and that of bank workers in Ireland two years later, who the country managed without for six months with almost no effect on the nation's economy.Bergman, and his translator, write with clarity and concision and his arguments are based entirely on facts and numbers, but this doesn't mean it lacks passion."

Secondly, they are embedded in an ideological position that the reader can’t get along with, so it’s dismissed out of hand. Thirdly, the argument isn’t as coherent as it could be (partly because of the first and second points) so closer readers will find flaws within moments and miss some of the more salient points.I’m glad to say that this work doesn’t fall prey to those things. Firstly, while simplified, the ideas presented are relatively straight-forward and so they don’t need to be more complicated for its purpose. The author has written more academic work which can be explored, or he points in the direction of those texts that you should look into. It’s textbook stuff: make a point, show how your point might be wrong, defend your point. Job done.Likewise, there’s no clear ideological baggage here. It’s true that he defends neoliberalism (unashamedly) and has a dig at a current strand of defeatist socialism, but throughout the book we have equal nods given to Marx and Engels, the anarchist anthropologist David Graeber and a host of neoliberals that he doesn’t agree with. His point is not that neoliberalism and capitalism are the only games in town. He’s simply stating that neoliberalism can’t be used as a derogatory word when it can be used to do the same job as anti-capitalist positions (if done well). Finally, the argument is coherent and where he runs into dead ends, there is a clear acknowledgement of those problems. Obviously the biggest issue is not what to do but how to get politicians to do it- but that’s true of any book of philosophy, economics or politics that tries to do something radical.This book is hopeful because it shows us how the major changes we need to eradicate world poverty, produce more equality and produce a better quality of life are actually simple. It also reminds us that with enough push, the impossible can become actual. It’s really odd that his ideas echo so many points made by Zizek, despite their huge differences. Bergman is anti-high theory, anti-ideology and less critical of free markets than Zizek, whereas Zizek is entrenched in theory, admits we cannot avoid ideology and is highly critical of capitalism at every turn. However, both argue similar points: the belief that minor changes can be made to capitalism seems like Utopianism, pie-in-the-sky navel gazing nonsense, but all big ideas seemed this way at some point; ultimately, with the absence of a true change of the entire system, we have to radically change what already exists; the revolution is a revolution of ideas and thinking, not of seizing land and machines; Utopianism is not an end state, but a way of thinking- always with that expanding horizon in the distance; and finally, that the left enjoys defeat and has begun to identify with it too much. It’s nice to see two incredibly opposed individuals finding two ways of making the same points. Read it. This book is vital. Even if you don’t agree totally (from either a pro-capitalist or pro-socialist standpoint) you’ll find something in here to make you radically reassess what you already think."
42,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50270175-frances-maxwell,5,"I LOVED this book! The world seems so depressing at the moment, with the likes of Trump and Brexit and what feels to me like a constant threat of impending doom (maybe that's just my anxiety speaking!) This book reminds you that we are living RIGHT NOW in an incredible utopia compared to where we were in the past. This is the best time to be alive in human history. And what's more, there could be an even brighter future with equality for all and the abolition of poverty across the globe, if only we would dare to dream.I loved the ideas in it, which include universal basic income, a shorter worker week, and open borders, each of which he discusses at length. Open borders, in particular, is seriously radical, but morally his argument is sound - borders are a form of global apartheid! How terrible is it that your chances in life are determined by where you are born. We allow everything else to move freely about the world, but not people.I found it really interesting how major political movements tend only to occur after a crisis (before this happens, politicians will only suggest things that don't stray too far from the status quo), and how neoliberalism, for example, came into fruition after the Arab oil crisis in the 70s thanks to decades of simmering (a group of thinkers had been discussing it at length since the 30s). However after the 2008 crash which proved that that it wasn't infallible, there were no radical alternative ideas brewing (!) so we've stuck with the same flawed model. Thinking up and discussing new ideas is CRITICAL to moving forward.I loved the section on 'underdog' socialism, because it's so true! One of the successes of Trump's campaign is that he knows that people like to be on the 'winning' side and yet the branding of the left is all, 'sigh - welfare is expensive but a moral must' (basically, 'we're morally right but an economic disaster') whereas in fact the ideas the author discusses not only eradicate inequality and poverty but result in astonishing economic success. This is the message the voters need to hear.If you're thinking this is too good to be true, I get that. There was a stage in the book where even I - a total ignoramus - felt the arguments were naively optimistic, along the lines of, 'these ideas are the solution to everything and have no down sides', and I guess I was looking for more of a critical analysis, but towards the end I felt reassured that his work is rooted in extensive research, and that he himself is aware of the dangers of bias (he discusses this, including cognitive dissonance, in later chapters and gives an example of his own).In any case, a vision is a vision, and it should be radical. I loved his. I want to live in that world. And it actually feels feasible! Let's do this, people!Definitely read this book!"
43,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/442654-andrew,0,"Like many/most people, I first became aware of Rutger Bregman based on the fire he spit at Tucker Carlson, which was amusing not because it had any intrinsic value -- we live in a world that favors bitchslaps like that over long-form argument far too much -- but simply because it was funny and witty. I then found out that Rutger Bregman was also a real writer, and he told off the fuckers at Davos too. So let's have a look, I thought.First, he presents his ideas well, and presents them honestly, and I can certainly agree with all of his prescriptions, which, as a democratic socialist, shouldn't be surprising. My only regret is that his analysis is a bit skin-deep at points. He diagnoses several of the symptoms of late-stage capitalism correctly, and provides cures for those symptoms, but what of the underlying disease? A UBI could be disastrous if applied from a libertarian rather than a socialist perspective, and as for open borders, there's a difference between actual open borders (good idea, but it needs a phase-in) and Koch Brothers-styled open borders (like how a Romanian working in Germany can still legally be paid Romanian wages by a German employer). Simply put, good effort Rutger, but you'll need a bit more depth if you wanna achieve top Marx (sorry, couldn't resist)."

You would think that the eradication of poverty is something people can all agree on, but unfortunately that is not the case. I found it interesting how often the book discussed the US even though the author is not American. Reading this was so pleasant what with its talk of UBI, open borders, 15 hour work weeks, and the eradication of poverty, but then of course I had to go back to the real world and the clusterfuck we call the current political situation (bombs, war, border walls, eradication of human rights, elimination of healthcare, deportations, growing inequality) and I just can't understand why anyone would think this mess is the best we can do."

It was a very interesting experience. "

After watching him take on Tucker Carlson, I bumped it up my list and started reading it. Packed full of fascinating ideas, some of which came with data, some with anecdata and a couple which were just a little fanciful. I don’t think it’s quite rigorous enough to change minds, but there was plenty of eye opening material and I am starting to understand the concept of a universal basic wage."
47,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28514701-martin-fixman,1,Absolute garbage. The book doesn't show a single shred of actual research and has as much merit as a random Reddit comment rambling about flying cars in the future.

49,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31449816-zainab,4,"Using a primarily economic analysis, this book imagines a much more equal world – one that seems so near yet so far. Just as it says on the tin, this world is utopic but completely achievable. Rutger Bregman uses statistics and studies to expose the flaws of existing national budgets and priorities. His book is a fairly short read/listen that focuses mainly on the concept of Universal Basic Income (UBI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and “bullshit jobs”, as well as poverty and foreign aid. It also envisions what a future of leisure could look like for society. The text is written in a straightforward way, which is unsurprising as Bregman spends the final chapter critiquing an “aristocratic” left, or “underdog socialism”, which he argues is not accessible to a wider public and not invigorated with enough hope to catch on. I found it to be a useful listen with some compelling and entirely convincing arguments, particularly on tax evasion and open borders.However, for me, the book also felt like a repeat of many podcasts I listened to around the UK General Election of 2019 and a few years prior. UBI as the logical future and GDP as a farce are very familiar ideas. In fact, much of what Bregman imagines was proposed in the Labour Party’s manifesto, ideas which a global pandemic might help bring to reality. In addition, the book still felt quite Euro-centric in the framing of history/ideas, so it’s difficult to imagine, for instance, how a mineral-rich and currently impoverished country would transact within this utopia. The climate crisis, for me, also deserved a much more detailed mention in this imagined future. Rutger Bregman went viral alongside Winnie Byanyima at the Davos Conference of 2019 for confronting the billionaire tax evaders sitting before him. His book, Utopia for Realists, will explain why he knew what he was talking about."
50,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,4,"Let us be unreasonable and impossible, the author exhorts. But his book, short and sweet, is far from either. The idea of basic income fits into the paradigm of a realistic utopia, according to Rutger Bregman, whose penchant for popularizing penmanship and knack for narration keep the book interesting and informative, if not all that original. The book is best understood as an attempt to bring a whole bundle of progressive ideas into the mainstream, borrowing heavily from other classics. But what the book lacks in originality it makes up for in holistic vision.One of the most refreshing parts of the book is that the author does not demonize his political opponents, such as conservatives. And indeed, most of his strident criticisms are directed at his fellow leftists (""underdog socialists"") whom he accuses of wallowing in reactionary pessimism. As someone who is more libertarian economically, I found his criticism of the banking and the financial sectors to be embarrassingly misguided, although not any more so than your average left liberal economist. (He confuses corporatist kleptocracy with free markets.) And his implicit call for more regulation of the labour markets relies on a notion of collectivistic economic planning that confuses ideal theory with the predictable failure of public policy - thus betraying his own allegiance to REALISTIC utopias. Furthermore, Bregman's utopia seems too static and degrowth to really feel alive in the way that realistic utopians must live and grow.But overall I enjoyed his vision. The future belongs to those who can envision alternative possibilities and find the institutional means to bring them account. Universal Basic Income is a way to marry progressive and libertarian politics, and ""Utopia for Realists"" does a good job of showing the kind of vision that it inspires - even if there is still room for more realism in the mix."
51,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20228885-sreejith-puthanpurayil,5,"Humans have been dreaming and designing Utopias for a long time. It has stirred whole communities into action and wars have been fought over it. In this book, the author proposes a Utopia; the idea of a society where every individual is guaranteed a minimum basic income. No strings attached. I'm generally positive about such redistribution schemes, especially in light of the near future (AI, automation etc) but how do we pay for it? The author points out that we already spend an enormous amount in the war on poverty and social assistance programs. Eliminating this bureaucracy and red tape could save us a tremendous amount and make things more efficient at the same time. However, it won't be enough. A better way to think about this is to see it as an investment in humans. When humans can meet their basic needs, they can be more selective about which jobs they will sell their time and bodies to. They can take time off and invest in themselves. In a nutshell, we can eliminate poverty, redistribute wealth, and give people more agency in their lives. Well, what's the evidence that this can actually work? The author points out the example of Dauphin, a Canadian city where a minimum basic income experiment (the no strings attached kind) was tried out for 4 years and resulted in a drastic reduction in poverty and reduced hospitalisation rates. Honestly, I'd like more such experiments but the fact is that they're expensive and the results often take years to become visible. All in all, a perspective changing book."
52,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7599597-tom,3,"The book came out in an interesting time of a paradigm shift in political perspectives. The general population is increasingly disillusioned by the trickle-down economics in the Reagan era, and pushed into the ideal of equality. While the book presented many great statistics, evidences, and insights (compiled from many different sources), it presented a few weak arguments. And through the weak argument is where the author's intellectual elitism wafts out of the writing. The author considers himself to be an arbiter of value, despite being minimally trained in economics. Somehow careers such as financial services that involves studying efficient capital allocation or corporate councils who protect the legal integrity are pointed out as bullshit jobs, all the while artists, philosophers and social study group champions are the true creators of wealth and drivers of economy. I'm not against the idea of wealth redistribution, but discounting the drive and ambition of educated professionals, and forcefully assigning high economic value to liberal disciplines, shows that not only does the author have a very limited understanding of economics, but also the left-wings' resistance of something as basic as free market.

Around the world the mainstream left seems to have run out of steam and become mired in the minutiae of intersectional grievances and the right is either run by rich men for rich men or has been captured by racist lunatics. Bregman gives a list of new (though mostly old) ideas that seem counter-intuitive, but he presents them in a way that also makes them logical, sensible and doable. I recently saw a photo of Rupert Murdoch reading this book while lounging beside a swimming pool - perhaps so that he could work out how to prevent anything in it from happening. For the sake of the rest of us, I hope plenty of politicians are also reading it."

For anyone who needs a pick-me-up on this front: this book proposes several possibilities, in a fresh and upbeat way. I'm dying to discuss this with friends. Some of these ideas blew my mind; I'm a newbie when it comes to political theory/economics. It's left me curious and optimistic about the future.

It was pretty obvious that this started out as a book about UBI and the other issues were kind of tacked on, as they weren't as well researched or explained. There was also the long section on the economy and GDP that I didn't really need, because it didn't really help me understand the economy any better (I never will) and it was pretty long.This book was first published in 2014 in the Netherlands (I think), so there are some things that are more optimistic than I would be today. Also, a lot of the book focuses on the US, and it talks about inequality, but barely discusses race at all, which I think was a gross oversight. It's impossible to talk about inequality in the US without at least a cursory mention of the history of race. At one point, it used the US as a positive example for immigration bc of how the country was ""founded"" and all of the progress its made, which is great and all, but the mass immigration to this country wasn't so great for the people who were already here, so it's kind of a bad take, bro.I appreciated the last chapter's acknowledgement of studies that oppose the policies discussed in the book and how differing views can often entrench us further into a belief. I thought it made some interesting points about how change is actually achieved: laying groundwork for a policy and then a crisis activates it by showing that the new system would handle it better. Change can't be made if there's no alternative offered before the crisis, which is what happened in 2008. I think that mindset is especially relevant during present day's actual crisis and just hoping that we've laid some kind of groundwork for the change.Notes and Quotes:- ""you can't pull yourself up by your bootstraps if you have no boots."" -Joseph Hanlon- 80% of Americans were pro-UBI in the 60s- Henry Ford giving all his employees big raises in 1914: aww, sweet. him doing it bc then they'd be able to afford his cars: figures- “the inability to imagine a world in which things are different is evidence only of a poor imagination, not the impossibility of change”- ""... what is the value of free speech when we no longer have anything worthwhile to say? what's the point of freedom of association when we no longer feel any sense of affiliation?"""

Eləcə də biznes mütəxəssislərin böyük əksəriyyəti vəzifələrinin bir o qədər də əhəmiyyətli olmadığını düşünür. Biz acığımız gələn iş yerlərində bütün günü işlədikdən sonra bizə lazım olmayan şeyləri almağa başlayırıq. ""Realistlər üçün utopiya""da holland tarixçi və jurnalist Rutqer Breqman, bunların heç də belə olmamalı olduğunu qeyd edir. Beynəlminəllik və praqmatizm manifesti kimi Breqmanın kitabı əsas 3 ideya ətrafında formalaşıb: 15 saatlıq iş həftəsi, ""universal minimal gəlir"" və sərhədlərin olmadığı dünya. Bu iddialara dəstək məqsədi ilə kitabda ötən əsrin 70-ci illərində icra edilən ""Mincome"" təcrübəsi, evsizlərə verilən qarşılıqsız pul təcrübələri və müxtəlif çoxsayılı statistik faktlar yer alıb. Bəlkə də bu iddialar heç də qeyri-real deyil. Nəinki qeyri-real, cəsarətli olsaq, bəlkə də zəruridir deyə bilərik, çünki daha az saatlı iş həftəsi daha az iş xətası, ətraf-mühitə vurulan zərər, daha az stress, qəza və iqtisadi qeyri-bərabərlikdir. Breqman vurğulayır ki, dəyişiklik ideyalarla başlayır. Nə vaxtsa bizim bu günümüz keçmişdə yaşayan insanların utopiyası idi. Ona görə də ifrat istehsal və istehlak kimi problemlərin öhdəsindən gəlmək üçün gərək ilk növbədə qurduğumuz sistemlərə olan yanaşmamızı dəyişək. ""Realistlər üçün utopiya"" kitabı bizə cari iqtisadiyyatların qeyri-reallığını, ideal və ya utopik hesab edilən iqtisadi sistemlərin isə reallığını çox möhtəşəm və axıcı dil ilə izah edir. Məncə, kitabı oxuduqdan sonra heç kim bir daha düşündüyü ənənəvi fikirlərini və ya doqmaları yada salmayacaq. Kitabı axtarıb-tapıb oxumağıma əsas səbəb Rutqer Breqmanın öz kitabı haqqında The Economist-ə verdiyi müsahibəni dinləməyim olmuşdu (müsahibəni dinləmək üçün keçid: http://bit.ly/Ukutopia_Bregman). Bir iqtisadçı kimi mənə maraqlı gəlmişdi ki, görəsən yuxarı abzasda qeyd edilən məqamlar haqqında özünə belə inamla və güvənlə danışan şəxs nə dərəcədə ciddidir və nə dərəcədə real və yaxşı bilgilərin toplandığı kitab yaza bilib. Doqmalarımızı qıran ideyalar həmişə cəlbedici olur. Qısa müddət ərzində kitabı elektron olaraq tapdım və 1 ay ərzində yavaş-yavaş oxudum. Sonunda isə əsl düşüncə yenilənməsi yaşadım. ""Realistlər üçün utopiya"" kitabını sadəcə bəyənmək deyil, həm də onun faktuallığını nəzərə alıb qiymətləndirmək lazımdır. Son dövrlərin aktual məsələlərinə toxunan, müəyyən həll yolları göstərən və ən əsası fərziyələrlə deyil, real analitik yöntəmlərlə izahat aparan kitabı oxumağıma çox şad oldum. Sitat: ""Bəşəriyyətin möhtəşəm ölçü daşları olan utopiyalarla əlaqədar hər zaman şübhələr olub. Tanınmış sosioloq Albert Hirşmana görə, utopiyalar 3 səviyyədə hücuma məruz qalıblar: axırsızlıq (bu mümkün deyil), təhlükə (risklər çox böyükdür) və qüsurluluq (bu distopiyaya səbəb olacaq degenerasiyadır), amma Hirşman həm də yazır ki, necə ki utopiyalar gerçəkləşir, adi bir şey kimi qəbul olunmağa başlanılır"" (Breqman, Realistlər üçün utopiya, 2016) Kitab çox güclü kontrastlar üzərində qurulub. Bu o deməkdir ki, mövzular keçmiş dövrün gələcəyə olan yanaşmalarından hərəkətə gələrək, bu günümüzü də öz növbəsində hansısa gələcək zamanın keçmişi kimi qəbul edib, müxtəlif iqtisadi göstəriciləri ortaq məxrəcə gətirməyə çalışır. Məsələn, kitab ilk səhifələrində aydınlaşdırır ki, hələ Keynes 20-ci əsrin ilk rübündə daha az saata malik iş həftəsini iqtisadi cəhətdən məntiqli və düzgün hesab edirdi. Bundan əlavə, kasıb ölkələrin cəmiyyətlərin niyə görə kasıb olduqları ilə əlaqədar bir çox maraqlı təcrübə və məlumatlara əsasən səbəblər üzərində dayanılır. Qeyd edilir ki, kasıb ölkələr ona görə kasıbdır ki, onlarda sadəcə oalraq yetərincə nağd pul ehtiyatları yoxdur. Halbuki, həm media, həm də populist siyasətçilər kasıb cəmiyyətləri demokratiyanın olmamasında, insanların savadsızlığında və ya digər hansısa ictimai göstəricilərdə olduğunu deyirlər. Təbii ki, onların müəyyən əhəmiyyəti var, amma aparılan real təcrübələr və sahə araşdırmaları sübut edib ki, isanlara ilkin investisiyanı təmin edəndə, özləri həmin investisiyanı artırmağın yollarını axtarıb-tapırlar. Sitat: ""19-cu əsrdə bərabərsizlik sosial sinif məsələsi ilə əlaqədar idi. Bu günlərdə isə bu məkan ilə əlaqədardır. ""Bütün ölkələrin proletarları birləşin!"" uzun müddət müxtəlif yerlərin kasıb insanlarının əzabkeşliyini birləşdirən ideya olub. Bu gün isə, Dünya Bankının aparıcı iqtisadçısı Branko Milanoviç qeyd edir ki, ""Proletariat həmrəyliyi artıq ölüb, çünki artıq qlobal proletariat deyə bir şey qalmayıb.""""(Breqman, Realistlər üçün utopiya, 2016) İnsan özü özlüyündə çox qəribə canlıdır, çünki o xəyal edə bilir.

Onlardan bəziləri isə artıq reallaşıb, bəziləri reallşmaq üzərədir, digərlərinin reallaşması üçün isə az qalıb. Utopiya anlayışının özü əslində inkişaflar üçün mühüm zəmindir. İnsan təxəyyülündə özünə varlıq qazanan istənilən ideya, hətta utopiyalar belə nə vaxtsa gerçəkləşəcəklər, sadəcə o istiqamətdə kiçik addımlar irəliləmək yetərlidir. Sitat: ""Abstrakt ideallardan fərqli olaraq, çertyojlar nifaqa tolerantlıq göstərməyən dəyişməz qayda-qanunlardan ibarət olurlar.

57,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498454-h-kon-gunnarsson,5,"This is the second book I read about universal basic income, the first one was by Andrew Yang. Both of these books explain the idea very well, but they have different strengths just the same. I think Yang managed to show more clearly the urgency for this system at this point in time as we are entering into the forth industrial revolution, while Bergman explains the history, and the science behind this idea better.It is a radical idea, and I’m not sure if I would have taken it seriously a few years ago. In fact, I don’t think I would have given it much of a thought until I started to read up on the pending industrial revolution. That is what made it realistic for me. There just doesn’t seem to be a viable path into that new reality with out some version of universal basic income. But what surprised me about the history Bergman presents is that it is actually a much older idea, and it had some really surprising campaigner for it. The fact that Richard Nixon is the American president that has got closest to getting that kind of system into action was one of those surprises. From listening to his party these days one would hardly expect that, but he did it because it seemed, even then, to make good financial sense. This idea isn’t just a shot in the dark, there is a lot of research behind it. So when people say it will not work because people are so lazy they will never do anything if they get free money, they need to show evidence for that opinion. What this book shows is evidence from other research that point in the other direction. All in all, I think this is an interesting book, and the case for universal basic income is very well argued here."

We go to a doctor when we're sick, a therapist when we're sad, a dietitian when we're overweight, prison when we're convicted and a job coach when we're out of work. All these services cost vast sums of money, but with little to show for it. In the US, where the cost of healthcare is highest on the planet, the life expectancy for many is actually going down. All the while the market and commercial interests enjoy a free reign. The food industry supplies us with cheap garbage loaded with salt, sugar and fat, putting us on a fast track to the doctor and dietitian. Advancing technologies are laying waste to ever-more jobs sending us back again to the job coach and the ad industry encourages us to spend money we don't have on junk we don't need in order to impress people we can't stand.Then we can go and cry on our therapist's shoulder.That's the dystopia we're living in today."

Bregman certainly has thought-provoking ideas to share and makes you question, or at least wonder about how the world could be a different, better place. The book reads well, keeps you interested, and avoids being polarizing by building his arguments on ethical virtues. Instead he uses logical arguments and often refers research in favor of his viewpoints. The book obviously doesn't really tell you how to go about implementing his ideas; what could go wrong and neither talks about the not-so positive sides; maybe not for realists after all!"

63,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,4,"A book that definitely needs to be read and discussed! Imagine a pandemic hitting states who's citizens receive an universal basic income, securing their livelihood!In ""Utopia for Realists"" Rutger Bregman argues for his three visions for the future: a 15-hour working week, a world without borders and a universal basic income for everyone. Unfortunately the introduction of this book is really weak with enumerating inventions and conditions of our present to state under which high standards we would be living, desperately lacking reflection. He talks for example about medical technology enabling patients with spinal cord injuries to walk again but completely fails to mention, that health insurance companies refuse to provide them to patients due to high costs, that people are getting older due to medical care, but under conditions that are ethically questionable to say the least, or that the number of people committing suicide are three times as high as deaths from vehicle accidents. He does recognize depression though, which according to him is caused by our inability to imagine anything better than what we already have. I highly contradict that. Thankfully he then turns around and starts to recognize, that the empowerment of the individual doesn't just lead to more freedom but a constant feeling of failure when not being able to live up to the expectations.After this disappointing introduction he turns to the universal income for everyone where it get‘s interesting. He lingers between anecdote, academic research and statistics and highlights examples of how these policies have already been partially implemented in the past. For example how a universal basic income was almost introduced in the United States under Nixon, or how a Canadian basic annual income program barely dented the enthusiasm for work, but let to a drop in crime, truancy, hospital attendance, domestic violence and poverty. I believe that this topic needs to be on our politics agendas! I agree that the costs that we invest in our social system aren‘t just completely ineffective but also contra-productive. Because of our current pandemic we can‘t close our eyes to these options anymore and which consequences it would have if we already would have considered it!In the second part of the books he introduces his vision for a 15 hour work week in 2030, because our economy would be that wealthy, that no more was required. Even though he dedicates an entire chapter to it, he somehow fails to connect it to the basic income model. Also it completely ignores the variety of work fields, which seems ironic to me because he deprecates the work fields the biggest part of our society works in, as being unproductive, replaceable and unable to provide any value to society. Such as lawyer, bankers,economists,companies,media...vs. doctors, fire fighter, farmers. Those who would actually produce. But particularly in those areas, work times are in important factor of the ability to produce in the first place and practice is gained by long periods of training. While the concept wouldn't apply to self employers to begin with, those who would be able to instantly instate the concept are those the author diminishes.He then argues for a world without borders, which probably shows the biggest lack of reflection. More people migrating freely would require more energy, leading to more jobs, which is why they would start to produce more and ultimately invest more money back into the economy. But about which jobs are were talking about here? Particularly the jobs the author valued above as the only ones of worth require decades of education in difficult fields. Not only do they require a high level of adaption to our language to say the least, the areas themselves are also not able to adapt to sudden changes in requirements as well. Our current situation teaches us what happens, if there are suddenly more patients than ventilators available to us, but the same goes for housing, food production etc. Open borders always would be influences by sudden movements caused by political actions, natural catastrophes and poverty, it wouldn't just be a gradual floating state. And just as important: What about culture differences? What about religious believes that collide? What about language barriers? What about geographical space limitations? What about different legal systems? What about border controls in order to provide safety for let‘s say outbreaking viruses or prosecution? The author really couldn't convince me of this idea.A very thought provoking book. I obviously don‘t agree with a big part of what the author says but these topics need to be discussed. Particularly the basic income.PS: For me stars are a measurement of impact rather than liking. A five star book isn‘t necessarily one I entirely agree with, but can also mean that it provoked me to think intensely and forced me to form strong opinions, which can‘t even be measured in stars and is one of the main purposes I read books to begin with."
64,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47154315-ian,3,"This is a well-written, well-articulated treatise on the Utopian ideals of a shorter work week, a Universal Basic Income, and other rights for working class people.Unfortunately, although the author wrote well and supported the ideas with a wealth of statistics, there isn't really much new here. Social progressives have held these ideals for years--as Bregman himself demonstrates in his historical references to earlier experiments for the UBI--but society never seems to get any closer to realizing them. I had hoped the author would review these concepts and then explain in detail how to go about attaining them in practice, given that governments continually see overwhelming data of their merit but consistently fail to act.Bregman does briefly look at this stumbling-block near the end of the book in the chapter of How Ideas Change the World. As he states,The question is not CAN new ideas defeat old ones; the question is HOW.Other than reminding us that crises can often drive larger changes than small tentative, rational steps, Bregman disappointing has little to offer. This is a shame, especially given the current world crisis with Covid, where there do seem to be some current openings to such ideas. But without some strong leaders pointing the way, we instead seem destined to return to a (perhaps slightly newer) normal that may prove to be negligibly different than the recent status quo. Sadly, it seems built into human nature to be unable to change our minds and behaviours, even when the best evidence is staring us directly in the face. I deeply wish Bregman had a better answer and could have prescribed some more proactive steps forward.That said, the book is an important read, especially for those unfamiliar with the progressive Utopian concepts, such as a Universal Basic Income that historically has good hard data supporting its implementation. It is sad that Bregman somewhat infers in his own text that those who need to read and absorb the information will never do so."

Maybe this is why it was easy for me to agree with the main arguments presented in this paradigm shifting analysis of economic organization and the status quo. RB does not stop there but goes on to propose some pragmatic, semi-revolutionary solutions for our ailing world.I especially like his ideas on a universal basic income ( p31 free cash greases the wheels of the whole economy....) and the way he differentiates between and ""stable and meaningful work"" p147 and""bullshit jobs...that even the people doing them admit that they are superfluous"" p163 ""Instead of creating wealth, these jobs mostly just shift it around."" p155The gap between rich and poor is already wider than it was in ancient Rome- an economy based on slave labor. p184Perhaps crises isn't really the right word for our current condition.

He makes cases for specifics such as Universal Basic Income, a fifteen-hour workweek, open borders, and more, but also challenges us to confront our values, most importantly the ridiculously out of proportion worth that we as a society we give to jobs which don't create any value ( investment banks, speculators of all kinds, much of the service industries that don't actually provide any services ) compared to those things that are vital, fulfilling or actually create wealth. The best example he gives is the contrasting strikes of garbage collectors in New York in 1968 which brought that great city to its knees in ten days ( leaving 100, 000 tons of trash on the streets ) and that of bank workers in Ireland two years later, who the country managed without for six months with almost no effect on the nation's economy.Bergman, and his translator, write with clarity and concision and his arguments are based entirely on facts and numbers, but this doesn't mean it lacks passion."

A shorter work week and changing the way we look at, and compensate different kinds of work are other ideas discussed in the book that already resonated with me before. The book seems well researched, with a long list of references that can be looked up by those who want more details, although I found the outcome of some of the studies quite doubtful. The book is packed with information and yet, it is written in a colloquial and interesting way that turns reading it into a real pleasure."
71,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5879607-benjamin,5,"Simple works like this can often be overlooked for many reasons. Firstly, they oversimplify because they’re not an academic text. Secondly, they are embedded in an ideological position that the reader can’t get along with, so it’s dismissed out of hand. Thirdly, the argument isn’t as coherent as it could be (partly because of the first and second points) so closer readers will find flaws within moments and miss some of the more salient points.I’m glad to say that this work doesn’t fall prey to those things. Firstly, while simplified, the ideas presented are relatively straight-forward and so they don’t need to be more complicated for its purpose. The author has written more academic work which can be explored, or he points in the direction of those texts that you should look into. It’s textbook stuff: make a point, show how your point might be wrong, defend your point. Job done.Likewise, there’s no clear ideological baggage here. It’s true that he defends neoliberalism (unashamedly) and has a dig at a current strand of defeatist socialism, but throughout the book we have equal nods given to Marx and Engels, the anarchist anthropologist David Graeber and a host of neoliberals that he doesn’t agree with. His point is not that neoliberalism and capitalism are the only games in town. He’s simply stating that neoliberalism can’t be used as a derogatory word when it can be used to do the same job as anti-capitalist positions (if done well). Finally, the argument is coherent and where he runs into dead ends, there is a clear acknowledgement of those problems. Obviously the biggest issue is not what to do but how to get politicians to do it- but that’s true of any book of philosophy, economics or politics that tries to do something radical.This book is hopeful because it shows us how the major changes we need to eradicate world poverty, produce more equality and produce a better quality of life are actually simple. It also reminds us that with enough push, the impossible can become actual. It’s really odd that his ideas echo so many points made by Zizek, despite their huge differences. Bergman is anti-high theory, anti-ideology and less critical of free markets than Zizek, whereas Zizek is entrenched in theory, admits we cannot avoid ideology and is highly critical of capitalism at every turn. However, both argue similar points: the belief that minor changes can be made to capitalism seems like Utopianism, pie-in-the-sky navel gazing nonsense, but all big ideas seemed this way at some point; ultimately, with the absence of a true change of the entire system, we have to radically change what already exists; the revolution is a revolution of ideas and thinking, not of seizing land and machines; Utopianism is not an end state, but a way of thinking- always with that expanding horizon in the distance; and finally, that the left enjoys defeat and has begun to identify with it too much. It’s nice to see two incredibly opposed individuals finding two ways of making the same points. Read it. This book is vital. Even if you don’t agree totally (from either a pro-capitalist or pro-socialist standpoint) you’ll find something in here to make you radically reassess what you already think."
72,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50270175-frances-maxwell,5,"I LOVED this book! The world seems so depressing at the moment, with the likes of Trump and Brexit and what feels to me like a constant threat of impending doom (maybe that's just my anxiety speaking!) This book reminds you that we are living RIGHT NOW in an incredible utopia compared to where we were in the past. This is the best time to be alive in human history. And what's more, there could be an even brighter future with equality for all and the abolition of poverty across the globe, if only we would dare to dream.I loved the ideas in it, which include universal basic income, a shorter worker week, and open borders, each of which he discusses at length. Open borders, in particular, is seriously radical, but morally his argument is sound - borders are a form of global apartheid! How terrible is it that your chances in life are determined by where you are born. We allow everything else to move freely about the world, but not people.I found it really interesting how major political movements tend only to occur after a crisis (before this happens, politicians will only suggest things that don't stray too far from the status quo), and how neoliberalism, for example, came into fruition after the Arab oil crisis in the 70s thanks to decades of simmering (a group of thinkers had been discussing it at length since the 30s). However after the 2008 crash which proved that that it wasn't infallible, there were no radical alternative ideas brewing (!) so we've stuck with the same flawed model. Thinking up and discussing new ideas is CRITICAL to moving forward.I loved the section on 'underdog' socialism, because it's so true! One of the successes of Trump's campaign is that he knows that people like to be on the 'winning' side and yet the branding of the left is all, 'sigh - welfare is expensive but a moral must' (basically, 'we're morally right but an economic disaster') whereas in fact the ideas the author discusses not only eradicate inequality and poverty but result in astonishing economic success. This is the message the voters need to hear.If you're thinking this is too good to be true, I get that. There was a stage in the book where even I - a total ignoramus - felt the arguments were naively optimistic, along the lines of, 'these ideas are the solution to everything and have no down sides', and I guess I was looking for more of a critical analysis, but towards the end I felt reassured that his work is rooted in extensive research, and that he himself is aware of the dangers of bias (he discusses this, including cognitive dissonance, in later chapters and gives an example of his own).In any case, a vision is a vision, and it should be radical. I loved his. I want to live in that world. And it actually feels feasible! Let's do this, people!Definitely read this book!"

I then found out that Rutger Bregman was also a real writer, and he told off the fuckers at Davos too. So let's have a look, I thought.First, he presents his ideas well, and presents them honestly, and I can certainly agree with all of his prescriptions, which, as a democratic socialist, shouldn't be surprising. My only regret is that his analysis is a bit skin-deep at points. He diagnoses several of the symptoms of late-stage capitalism correctly, and provides cures for those symptoms, but what of the underlying disease? A UBI could be disastrous if applied from a libertarian rather than a socialist perspective, and as for open borders, there's a difference between actual open borders (good idea, but it needs a phase-in) and Koch Brothers-styled open borders (like how a Romanian working in Germany can still legally be paid Romanian wages by a German employer). Simply put, good effort Rutger, but you'll need a bit more depth if you wanna achieve top Marx (sorry, couldn't resist)."

You would think that the eradication of poverty is something people can all agree on, but unfortunately that is not the case. I found it interesting how often the book discussed the US even though the author is not American. Reading this was so pleasant what with its talk of UBI, open borders, 15 hour work weeks, and the eradication of poverty, but then of course I had to go back to the real world and the clusterfuck we call the current political situation (bombs, war, border walls, eradication of human rights, elimination of healthcare, deportations, growing inequality) and I just can't understand why anyone would think this mess is the best we can do."

79,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31449816-zainab,4,"Using a primarily economic analysis, this book imagines a much more equal world – one that seems so near yet so far. Just as it says on the tin, this world is utopic but completely achievable. Rutger Bregman uses statistics and studies to expose the flaws of existing national budgets and priorities. His book is a fairly short read/listen that focuses mainly on the concept of Universal Basic Income (UBI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and “bullshit jobs”, as well as poverty and foreign aid. It also envisions what a future of leisure could look like for society. The text is written in a straightforward way, which is unsurprising as Bregman spends the final chapter critiquing an “aristocratic” left, or “underdog socialism”, which he argues is not accessible to a wider public and not invigorated with enough hope to catch on. I found it to be a useful listen with some compelling and entirely convincing arguments, particularly on tax evasion and open borders.However, for me, the book also felt like a repeat of many podcasts I listened to around the UK General Election of 2019 and a few years prior. UBI as the logical future and GDP as a farce are very familiar ideas. In fact, much of what Bregman imagines was proposed in the Labour Party’s manifesto, ideas which a global pandemic might help bring to reality. In addition, the book still felt quite Euro-centric in the framing of history/ideas, so it’s difficult to imagine, for instance, how a mineral-rich and currently impoverished country would transact within this utopia. The climate crisis, for me, also deserved a much more detailed mention in this imagined future. Rutger Bregman went viral alongside Winnie Byanyima at the Davos Conference of 2019 for confronting the billionaire tax evaders sitting before him. His book, Utopia for Realists, will explain why he knew what he was talking about."
80,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,4,"Let us be unreasonable and impossible, the author exhorts. But his book, short and sweet, is far from either. The idea of basic income fits into the paradigm of a realistic utopia, according to Rutger Bregman, whose penchant for popularizing penmanship and knack for narration keep the book interesting and informative, if not all that original. The book is best understood as an attempt to bring a whole bundle of progressive ideas into the mainstream, borrowing heavily from other classics. But what the book lacks in originality it makes up for in holistic vision.One of the most refreshing parts of the book is that the author does not demonize his political opponents, such as conservatives. And indeed, most of his strident criticisms are directed at his fellow leftists (""underdog socialists"") whom he accuses of wallowing in reactionary pessimism. As someone who is more libertarian economically, I found his criticism of the banking and the financial sectors to be embarrassingly misguided, although not any more so than your average left liberal economist. (He confuses corporatist kleptocracy with free markets.) And his implicit call for more regulation of the labour markets relies on a notion of collectivistic economic planning that confuses ideal theory with the predictable failure of public policy - thus betraying his own allegiance to REALISTIC utopias. Furthermore, Bregman's utopia seems too static and degrowth to really feel alive in the way that realistic utopians must live and grow.But overall I enjoyed his vision. The future belongs to those who can envision alternative possibilities and find the institutional means to bring them account. Universal Basic Income is a way to marry progressive and libertarian politics, and ""Utopia for Realists"" does a good job of showing the kind of vision that it inspires - even if there is still room for more realism in the mix."

It has stirred whole communities into action and wars have been fought over it. In this book, the author proposes a Utopia; the idea of a society where every individual is guaranteed a minimum basic income. No strings attached. I'm generally positive about such redistribution schemes, especially in light of the near future (AI, automation etc) but how do we pay for it? The author points out that we already spend an enormous amount in the war on poverty and social assistance programs. Eliminating this bureaucracy and red tape could save us a tremendous amount and make things more efficient at the same time. However, it won't be enough. A better way to think about this is to see it as an investment in humans. When humans can meet their basic needs, they can be more selective about which jobs they will sell their time and bodies to. They can take time off and invest in themselves. In a nutshell, we can eliminate poverty, redistribute wealth, and give people more agency in their lives. Well, what's the evidence that this can actually work? The author points out the example of Dauphin, a Canadian city where a minimum basic income experiment (the no strings attached kind) was tried out for 4 years and resulted in a drastic reduction in poverty and reduced hospitalisation rates. Honestly, I'd like more such experiments but the fact is that they're expensive and the results often take years to become visible. All in all, a perspective changing book."
82,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7599597-tom,3,"The book came out in an interesting time of a paradigm shift in political perspectives. The general population is increasingly disillusioned by the trickle-down economics in the Reagan era, and pushed into the ideal of equality. While the book presented many great statistics, evidences, and insights (compiled from many different sources), it presented a few weak arguments. And through the weak argument is where the author's intellectual elitism wafts out of the writing. The author considers himself to be an arbiter of value, despite being minimally trained in economics. Somehow careers such as financial services that involves studying efficient capital allocation or corporate councils who protect the legal integrity are pointed out as bullshit jobs, all the while artists, philosophers and social study group champions are the true creators of wealth and drivers of economy. I'm not against the idea of wealth redistribution, but discounting the drive and ambition of educated professionals, and forcefully assigning high economic value to liberal disciplines, shows that not only does the author have a very limited understanding of economics, but also the left-wings' resistance of something as basic as free market.

Bregman gives a list of new (though mostly old) ideas that seem counter-intuitive, but he presents them in a way that also makes them logical, sensible and doable. I recently saw a photo of Rupert Murdoch reading this book while lounging beside a swimming pool - perhaps so that he could work out how to prevent anything in it from happening.

It was pretty obvious that this started out as a book about UBI and the other issues were kind of tacked on, as they weren't as well researched or explained. There was also the long section on the economy and GDP that I didn't really need, because it didn't really help me understand the economy any better (I never will) and it was pretty long.This book was first published in 2014 in the Netherlands (I think), so there are some things that are more optimistic than I would be today. Also, a lot of the book focuses on the US, and it talks about inequality, but barely discusses race at all, which I think was a gross oversight. It's impossible to talk about inequality in the US without at least a cursory mention of the history of race. At one point, it used the US as a positive example for immigration bc of how the country was ""founded"" and all of the progress its made, which is great and all, but the mass immigration to this country wasn't so great for the people who were already here, so it's kind of a bad take, bro.I appreciated the last chapter's acknowledgement of studies that oppose the policies discussed in the book and how differing views can often entrench us further into a belief. I thought it made some interesting points about how change is actually achieved: laying groundwork for a policy and then a crisis activates it by showing that the new system would handle it better. Change can't be made if there's no alternative offered before the crisis, which is what happened in 2008. I think that mindset is especially relevant during present day's actual crisis and just hoping that we've laid some kind of groundwork for the change.Notes and Quotes:- ""you can't pull yourself up by your bootstraps if you have no boots."" -Joseph Hanlon- 80% of Americans were pro-UBI in the 60s- Henry Ford giving all his employees big raises in 1914: aww, sweet. him doing it bc then they'd be able to afford his cars: figures- “the inability to imagine a world in which things are different is evidence only of a poor imagination, not the impossibility of change”- ""... what is the value of free speech when we no longer have anything worthwhile to say? what's the point of freedom of association when we no longer feel any sense of affiliation?"""

By starting to read this book I read about a lot of facts and concepts which were directly related to the economy and social life that were not obvious to me before. The style and format of the book are perfect. If you want to read this book, prepare yourself to face a vast number of relevant statistics. ---------AZE: Amerikalıların üçdə ikisi 2 həftəlik məzuniyyəti əlavə 2 həftənin məvacibindən üstün tuturlar. Eləcə də biznes mütəxəssislərin böyük əksəriyyəti vəzifələrinin bir o qədər də əhəmiyyətli olmadığını düşünür. Biz acığımız gələn iş yerlərində bütün günü işlədikdən sonra bizə lazım olmayan şeyləri almağa başlayırıq. ""Realistlər üçün utopiya""da holland tarixçi və jurnalist Rutqer Breqman, bunların heç də belə olmamalı olduğunu qeyd edir. Beynəlminəllik və praqmatizm manifesti kimi Breqmanın kitabı əsas 3 ideya ətrafında formalaşıb: 15 saatlıq iş həftəsi, ""universal minimal gəlir"" və sərhədlərin olmadığı dünya. Bu iddialara dəstək məqsədi ilə kitabda ötən əsrin 70-ci illərində icra edilən ""Mincome"" təcrübəsi, evsizlərə verilən qarşılıqsız pul təcrübələri və müxtəlif çoxsayılı statistik faktlar yer alıb. Bəlkə də bu iddialar heç də qeyri-real deyil. Nəinki qeyri-real, cəsarətli olsaq, bəlkə də zəruridir deyə bilərik, çünki daha az saatlı iş həftəsi daha az iş xətası, ətraf-mühitə vurulan zərər, daha az stress, qəza və iqtisadi qeyri-bərabərlikdir. Breqman vurğulayır ki, dəyişiklik ideyalarla başlayır. Nə vaxtsa bizim bu günümüz keçmişdə yaşayan insanların utopiyası idi. Ona görə də ifrat istehsal və istehlak kimi problemlərin öhdəsindən gəlmək üçün gərək ilk növbədə qurduğumuz sistemlərə olan yanaşmamızı dəyişək. ""Realistlər üçün utopiya"" kitabı bizə cari iqtisadiyyatların qeyri-reallığını, ideal və ya utopik hesab edilən iqtisadi sistemlərin isə reallığını çox möhtəşəm və axıcı dil ilə izah edir. Məncə, kitabı oxuduqdan sonra heç kim bir daha düşündüyü ənənəvi fikirlərini və ya doqmaları yada salmayacaq. Kitabı axtarıb-tapıb oxumağıma əsas səbəb Rutqer Breqmanın öz kitabı haqqında The Economist-ə verdiyi müsahibəni dinləməyim olmuşdu (müsahibəni dinləmək üçün keçid: http://bit.ly/Ukutopia_Bregman). Bir iqtisadçı kimi mənə maraqlı gəlmişdi ki, görəsən yuxarı abzasda qeyd edilən məqamlar haqqında özünə belə inamla və güvənlə danışan şəxs nə dərəcədə ciddidir və nə dərəcədə real və yaxşı bilgilərin toplandığı kitab yaza bilib. Doqmalarımızı qıran ideyalar həmişə cəlbedici olur. Qısa müddət ərzində kitabı elektron olaraq tapdım və 1 ay ərzində yavaş-yavaş oxudum. Sonunda isə əsl düşüncə yenilənməsi yaşadım. ""Realistlər üçün utopiya"" kitabını sadəcə bəyənmək deyil, həm də onun faktuallığını nəzərə alıb qiymətləndirmək lazımdır. Son dövrlərin aktual məsələlərinə toxunan, müəyyən həll yolları göstərən və ən əsası fərziyələrlə deyil, real analitik yöntəmlərlə izahat aparan kitabı oxumağıma çox şad oldum. Sitat: ""Bəşəriyyətin möhtəşəm ölçü daşları olan utopiyalarla əlaqədar hər zaman şübhələr olub. Tanınmış sosioloq Albert Hirşmana görə, utopiyalar 3 səviyyədə hücuma məruz qalıblar: axırsızlıq (bu mümkün deyil), təhlükə (risklər çox böyükdür) və qüsurluluq (bu distopiyaya səbəb olacaq degenerasiyadır), amma Hirşman həm də yazır ki, necə ki utopiyalar gerçəkləşir, adi bir şey kimi qəbul olunmağa başlanılır"" (Breqman, Realistlər üçün utopiya, 2016) Kitab çox güclü kontrastlar üzərində qurulub. Bu o deməkdir ki, mövzular keçmiş dövrün gələcəyə olan yanaşmalarından hərəkətə gələrək, bu günümüzü də öz növbəsində hansısa gələcək zamanın keçmişi kimi qəbul edib, müxtəlif iqtisadi göstəriciləri ortaq məxrəcə gətirməyə çalışır. Məsələn, kitab ilk səhifələrində aydınlaşdırır ki, hələ Keynes 20-ci əsrin ilk rübündə daha az saata malik iş həftəsini iqtisadi cəhətdən məntiqli və düzgün hesab edirdi. Bundan əlavə, kasıb ölkələrin cəmiyyətlərin niyə görə kasıb olduqları ilə əlaqədar bir çox maraqlı təcrübə və məlumatlara əsasən səbəblər üzərində dayanılır. Qeyd edilir ki, kasıb ölkələr ona görə kasıbdır ki, onlarda sadəcə oalraq yetərincə nağd pul ehtiyatları yoxdur. Halbuki, həm media, həm də populist siyasətçilər kasıb cəmiyyətləri demokratiyanın olmamasında, insanların savadsızlığında və ya digər hansısa ictimai göstəricilərdə olduğunu deyirlər. Təbii ki, onların müəyyən əhəmiyyəti var, amma aparılan real təcrübələr və sahə araşdırmaları sübut edib ki, isanlara ilkin investisiyanı təmin edəndə, özləri həmin investisiyanı artırmağın yollarını axtarıb-tapırlar. Sitat: ""19-cu əsrdə bərabərsizlik sosial sinif məsələsi ilə əlaqədar idi. Bu günlərdə isə bu məkan ilə əlaqədardır. ""Bütün ölkələrin proletarları birləşin!"" uzun müddət müxtəlif yerlərin kasıb insanlarının əzabkeşliyini birləşdirən ideya olub. Bu gün isə, Dünya Bankının aparıcı iqtisadçısı Branko Milanoviç qeyd edir ki, ""Proletariat həmrəyliyi artıq ölüb, çünki artıq qlobal proletariat deyə bir şey qalmayıb.""""(Breqman, Realistlər üçün utopiya, 2016) İnsan özü özlüyündə çox qəribə canlıdır, çünki o xəyal edə bilir. Kitabın ilk səhifələrindən müəllif göstərir ki, bütün bu fiosoflar, yazıçılar və alimlər utopiyaların vasitəsi ilə bəşəriyyətin inkişafa və firavanlığa nail ola biləcəyini qeyd edirmişlər. Onlardan bəziləri isə artıq reallaşıb, bəziləri reallşmaq üzərədir, digərlərinin reallaşması üçün isə az qalıb. Utopiya anlayışının özü əslində inkişaflar üçün mühüm zəmindir. İnsan təxəyyülündə özünə varlıq qazanan istənilən ideya, hətta utopiyalar belə nə vaxtsa gerçəkləşəcəklər, sadəcə o istiqamətdə kiçik addımlar irəliləmək yetərlidir. Sitat: ""Abstrakt ideallardan fərqli olaraq, çertyojlar nifaqa tolerantlıq göstərməyən dəyişməz qayda-qanunlardan ibarət olurlar. İtalyan şair Tomasso Kampanellanın ""Günəşin şəhəri (1602)"" çox yaxşı nümunə təklif edir. Bu utopiyada və ya distopiyada, fərdi mülkiyyət ciddi olaraq qadağan olunub, hamı bir-birini sevməyə məcbur edilib və dava-dalaş ölümlə cəzalandırılır. Özəl həyat, intim məqamlar da daxil olmaqla dövlət tərəfindən idarə olunur. Məsələn, ağıllı insanlar ancaq axmaq insanlarla yatağa girə bilər, kök insanlar isə arıqlarla.

87,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498454-h-kon-gunnarsson,5,"This is the second book I read about universal basic income, the first one was by Andrew Yang. Both of these books explain the idea very well, but they have different strengths just the same. I think Yang managed to show more clearly the urgency for this system at this point in time as we are entering into the forth industrial revolution, while Bergman explains the history, and the science behind this idea better.It is a radical idea, and I’m not sure if I would have taken it seriously a few years ago. In fact, I don’t think I would have given it much of a thought until I started to read up on the pending industrial revolution. That is what made it realistic for me. There just doesn’t seem to be a viable path into that new reality with out some version of universal basic income. But what surprised me about the history Bergman presents is that it is actually a much older idea, and it had some really surprising campaigner for it. The fact that Richard Nixon is the American president that has got closest to getting that kind of system into action was one of those surprises. From listening to his party these days one would hardly expect that, but he did it because it seemed, even then, to make good financial sense. This idea isn’t just a shot in the dark, there is a lot of research behind it. So when people say it will not work because people are so lazy they will never do anything if they get free money, they need to show evidence for that opinion. What this book shows is evidence from other research that point in the other direction. All in all, I think this is an interesting book, and the case for universal basic income is very well argued here."
88,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37925908-psychonout,4,"Meanwhile the welfare state has increasingly shifted its focus from the causes of our discontent to the symptoms. We go to a doctor when we're sick, a therapist when we're sad, a dietitian when we're overweight, prison when we're convicted and a job coach when we're out of work. All these services cost vast sums of money, but with little to show for it. In the US, where the cost of healthcare is highest on the planet, the life expectancy for many is actually going down. All the while the market and commercial interests enjoy a free reign. The food industry supplies us with cheap garbage loaded with salt, sugar and fat, putting us on a fast track to the doctor and dietitian. Advancing technologies are laying waste to ever-more jobs sending us back again to the job coach and the ad industry encourages us to spend money we don't have on junk we don't need in order to impress people we can't stand.Then we can go and cry on our therapist's shoulder.That's the dystopia we're living in today."
89,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108599067-wout-biesheuvel,4,"Interesting read. Bregman certainly has thought-provoking ideas to share and makes you question, or at least wonder about how the world could be a different, better place. The book reads well, keeps you interested, and avoids being polarizing by building his arguments on ethical virtues. Instead he uses logical arguments and often refers research in favor of his viewpoints. The book obviously doesn't really tell you how to go about implementing his ideas; what could go wrong and neither talks about the not-so positive sides; maybe not for realists after all!"

93,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,4,"A book that definitely needs to be read and discussed! Imagine a pandemic hitting states who's citizens receive an universal basic income, securing their livelihood!In ""Utopia for Realists"" Rutger Bregman argues for his three visions for the future: a 15-hour working week, a world without borders and a universal basic income for everyone. Unfortunately the introduction of this book is really weak with enumerating inventions and conditions of our present to state under which high standards we would be living, desperately lacking reflection. He talks for example about medical technology enabling patients with spinal cord injuries to walk again but completely fails to mention, that health insurance companies refuse to provide them to patients due to high costs, that people are getting older due to medical care, but under conditions that are ethically questionable to say the least, or that the number of people committing suicide are three times as high as deaths from vehicle accidents. He does recognize depression though, which according to him is caused by our inability to imagine anything better than what we already have. I highly contradict that. Thankfully he then turns around and starts to recognize, that the empowerment of the individual doesn't just lead to more freedom but a constant feeling of failure when not being able to live up to the expectations.After this disappointing introduction he turns to the universal income for everyone where it get‘s interesting. He lingers between anecdote, academic research and statistics and highlights examples of how these policies have already been partially implemented in the past. For example how a universal basic income was almost introduced in the United States under Nixon, or how a Canadian basic annual income program barely dented the enthusiasm for work, but let to a drop in crime, truancy, hospital attendance, domestic violence and poverty. I believe that this topic needs to be on our politics agendas! I agree that the costs that we invest in our social system aren‘t just completely ineffective but also contra-productive. Because of our current pandemic we can‘t close our eyes to these options anymore and which consequences it would have if we already would have considered it!In the second part of the books he introduces his vision for a 15 hour work week in 2030, because our economy would be that wealthy, that no more was required. Even though he dedicates an entire chapter to it, he somehow fails to connect it to the basic income model. Also it completely ignores the variety of work fields, which seems ironic to me because he deprecates the work fields the biggest part of our society works in, as being unproductive, replaceable and unable to provide any value to society. Such as lawyer, bankers,economists,companies,media...vs. doctors, fire fighter, farmers. Those who would actually produce. But particularly in those areas, work times are in important factor of the ability to produce in the first place and practice is gained by long periods of training. While the concept wouldn't apply to self employers to begin with, those who would be able to instantly instate the concept are those the author diminishes.He then argues for a world without borders, which probably shows the biggest lack of reflection. More people migrating freely would require more energy, leading to more jobs, which is why they would start to produce more and ultimately invest more money back into the economy. But about which jobs are were talking about here? Particularly the jobs the author valued above as the only ones of worth require decades of education in difficult fields. Not only do they require a high level of adaption to our language to say the least, the areas themselves are also not able to adapt to sudden changes in requirements as well. Our current situation teaches us what happens, if there are suddenly more patients than ventilators available to us, but the same goes for housing, food production etc. Open borders always would be influences by sudden movements caused by political actions, natural catastrophes and poverty, it wouldn't just be a gradual floating state. And just as important: What about culture differences? What about religious believes that collide? What about language barriers? What about geographical space limitations? What about different legal systems? What about border controls in order to provide safety for let‘s say outbreaking viruses or prosecution? The author really couldn't convince me of this idea.A very thought provoking book. I obviously don‘t agree with a big part of what the author says but these topics need to be discussed. Particularly the basic income.PS: For me stars are a measurement of impact rather than liking. A five star book isn‘t necessarily one I entirely agree with, but can also mean that it provoked me to think intensely and forced me to form strong opinions, which can‘t even be measured in stars and is one of the main purposes I read books to begin with."
94,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47154315-ian,3,"This is a well-written, well-articulated treatise on the Utopian ideals of a shorter work week, a Universal Basic Income, and other rights for working class people.Unfortunately, although the author wrote well and supported the ideas with a wealth of statistics, there isn't really much new here. Social progressives have held these ideals for years--as Bregman himself demonstrates in his historical references to earlier experiments for the UBI--but society never seems to get any closer to realizing them. I had hoped the author would review these concepts and then explain in detail how to go about attaining them in practice, given that governments continually see overwhelming data of their merit but consistently fail to act.Bregman does briefly look at this stumbling-block near the end of the book in the chapter of How Ideas Change the World. As he states,The question is not CAN new ideas defeat old ones; the question is HOW.Other than reminding us that crises can often drive larger changes than small tentative, rational steps, Bregman disappointing has little to offer. This is a shame, especially given the current world crisis with Covid, where there do seem to be some current openings to such ideas. But without some strong leaders pointing the way, we instead seem destined to return to a (perhaps slightly newer) normal that may prove to be negligibly different than the recent status quo. Sadly, it seems built into human nature to be unable to change our minds and behaviours, even when the best evidence is staring us directly in the face. I deeply wish Bregman had a better answer and could have prescribed some more proactive steps forward.That said, the book is an important read, especially for those unfamiliar with the progressive Utopian concepts, such as a Universal Basic Income that historically has good hard data supporting its implementation. It is sad that Bregman somewhat infers in his own text that those who need to read and absorb the information will never do so."

No, the real crises is we cannot come up with something better. p11An idealist and dreamer from the get go, I have never been taken for a realist. Maybe this is why it was easy for me to agree with the main arguments presented in this paradigm shifting analysis of economic organization and the status quo. RB does not stop there but goes on to propose some pragmatic, semi-revolutionary solutions for our ailing world.I especially like his ideas on a universal basic income ( p31 free cash greases the wheels of the whole economy....) and the way he differentiates between and ""stable and meaningful work"" p147 and""bullshit jobs...that even the people doing them admit that they are superfluous"" p163 ""Instead of creating wealth, these jobs mostly just shift it around."" p155The gap between rich and poor is already wider than it was in ancient Rome- an economy based on slave labor. p184Perhaps crises isn't really the right word for our current condition. It's like we're in a deep coma, we'd rather re calibrate reality than amend our world viewp243RB may not go far enough for me, but the 4 stars is for putting these issues on the table.If we want to change the world, we need to be unrealistic, unreasonable, and impossible. p263"

He makes cases for specifics such as Universal Basic Income, a fifteen-hour workweek, open borders, and more, but also challenges us to confront our values, most importantly the ridiculously out of proportion worth that we as a society we give to jobs which don't create any value ( investment banks, speculators of all kinds, much of the service industries that don't actually provide any services ) compared to those things that are vital, fulfilling or actually create wealth. The best example he gives is the contrasting strikes of garbage collectors in New York in 1968 which brought that great city to its knees in ten days ( leaving 100, 000 tons of trash on the streets ) and that of bank workers in Ireland two years later, who the country managed without for six months with almost no effect on the nation's economy.Bergman, and his translator, write with clarity and concision and his arguments are based entirely on facts and numbers, but this doesn't mean it lacks passion."

I had heard about universal income before and found it a bizarre idea, but Bregman provides information on several practical experiments that had me rethinking the whole thing. A shorter work week and changing the way we look at, and compensate different kinds of work are other ideas discussed in the book that already resonated with me before. The book seems well researched, with a long list of references that can be looked up by those who want more details, although I found the outcome of some of the studies quite doubtful. The book is packed with information and yet, it is written in a colloquial and interesting way that turns reading it into a real pleasure."
101,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5879607-benjamin,5,"Simple works like this can often be overlooked for many reasons. Firstly, they oversimplify because they’re not an academic text. Secondly, they are embedded in an ideological position that the reader can’t get along with, so it’s dismissed out of hand. Thirdly, the argument isn’t as coherent as it could be (partly because of the first and second points) so closer readers will find flaws within moments and miss some of the more salient points.I’m glad to say that this work doesn’t fall prey to those things. Firstly, while simplified, the ideas presented are relatively straight-forward and so they don’t need to be more complicated for its purpose. The author has written more academic work which can be explored, or he points in the direction of those texts that you should look into. It’s textbook stuff: make a point, show how your point might be wrong, defend your point. Job done.Likewise, there’s no clear ideological baggage here. It’s true that he defends neoliberalism (unashamedly) and has a dig at a current strand of defeatist socialism, but throughout the book we have equal nods given to Marx and Engels, the anarchist anthropologist David Graeber and a host of neoliberals that he doesn’t agree with. His point is not that neoliberalism and capitalism are the only games in town. He’s simply stating that neoliberalism can’t be used as a derogatory word when it can be used to do the same job as anti-capitalist positions (if done well). Finally, the argument is coherent and where he runs into dead ends, there is a clear acknowledgement of those problems. Obviously the biggest issue is not what to do but how to get politicians to do it- but that’s true of any book of philosophy, economics or politics that tries to do something radical.This book is hopeful because it shows us how the major changes we need to eradicate world poverty, produce more equality and produce a better quality of life are actually simple. It also reminds us that with enough push, the impossible can become actual. It’s really odd that his ideas echo so many points made by Zizek, despite their huge differences. Bergman is anti-high theory, anti-ideology and less critical of free markets than Zizek, whereas Zizek is entrenched in theory, admits we cannot avoid ideology and is highly critical of capitalism at every turn. However, both argue similar points: the belief that minor changes can be made to capitalism seems like Utopianism, pie-in-the-sky navel gazing nonsense, but all big ideas seemed this way at some point; ultimately, with the absence of a true change of the entire system, we have to radically change what already exists; the revolution is a revolution of ideas and thinking, not of seizing land and machines; Utopianism is not an end state, but a way of thinking- always with that expanding horizon in the distance; and finally, that the left enjoys defeat and has begun to identify with it too much. It’s nice to see two incredibly opposed individuals finding two ways of making the same points. Read it. This book is vital. Even if you don’t agree totally (from either a pro-capitalist or pro-socialist standpoint) you’ll find something in here to make you radically reassess what you already think."
102,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50270175-frances-maxwell,5,"I LOVED this book! The world seems so depressing at the moment, with the likes of Trump and Brexit and what feels to me like a constant threat of impending doom (maybe that's just my anxiety speaking!) This book reminds you that we are living RIGHT NOW in an incredible utopia compared to where we were in the past. This is the best time to be alive in human history. And what's more, there could be an even brighter future with equality for all and the abolition of poverty across the globe, if only we would dare to dream.I loved the ideas in it, which include universal basic income, a shorter worker week, and open borders, each of which he discusses at length. Open borders, in particular, is seriously radical, but morally his argument is sound - borders are a form of global apartheid! How terrible is it that your chances in life are determined by where you are born. We allow everything else to move freely about the world, but not people.I found it really interesting how major political movements tend only to occur after a crisis (before this happens, politicians will only suggest things that don't stray too far from the status quo), and how neoliberalism, for example, came into fruition after the Arab oil crisis in the 70s thanks to decades of simmering (a group of thinkers had been discussing it at length since the 30s). However after the 2008 crash which proved that that it wasn't infallible, there were no radical alternative ideas brewing (!) so we've stuck with the same flawed model. Thinking up and discussing new ideas is CRITICAL to moving forward.I loved the section on 'underdog' socialism, because it's so true! One of the successes of Trump's campaign is that he knows that people like to be on the 'winning' side and yet the branding of the left is all, 'sigh - welfare is expensive but a moral must' (basically, 'we're morally right but an economic disaster') whereas in fact the ideas the author discusses not only eradicate inequality and poverty but result in astonishing economic success. This is the message the voters need to hear.If you're thinking this is too good to be true, I get that. There was a stage in the book where even I - a total ignoramus - felt the arguments were naively optimistic, along the lines of, 'these ideas are the solution to everything and have no down sides', and I guess I was looking for more of a critical analysis, but towards the end I felt reassured that his work is rooted in extensive research, and that he himself is aware of the dangers of bias (he discusses this, including cognitive dissonance, in later chapters and gives an example of his own).In any case, a vision is a vision, and it should be radical. I loved his. I want to live in that world. And it actually feels feasible! Let's do this, people!Definitely read this book!"
103,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/442654-andrew,0,"Like many/most people, I first became aware of Rutger Bregman based on the fire he spit at Tucker Carlson, which was amusing not because it had any intrinsic value -- we live in a world that favors bitchslaps like that over long-form argument far too much -- but simply because it was funny and witty. I then found out that Rutger Bregman was also a real writer, and he told off the fuckers at Davos too. So let's have a look, I thought.First, he presents his ideas well, and presents them honestly, and I can certainly agree with all of his prescriptions, which, as a democratic socialist, shouldn't be surprising. My only regret is that his analysis is a bit skin-deep at points. He diagnoses several of the symptoms of late-stage capitalism correctly, and provides cures for those symptoms, but what of the underlying disease? A UBI could be disastrous if applied from a libertarian rather than a socialist perspective, and as for open borders, there's a difference between actual open borders (good idea, but it needs a phase-in) and Koch Brothers-styled open borders (like how a Romanian working in Germany can still legally be paid Romanian wages by a German employer). Simply put, good effort Rutger, but you'll need a bit more depth if you wanna achieve top Marx (sorry, couldn't resist)."

You would think that the eradication of poverty is something people can all agree on, but unfortunately that is not the case. I found it interesting how often the book discussed the US even though the author is not American. Reading this was so pleasant what with its talk of UBI, open borders, 15 hour work weeks, and the eradication of poverty, but then of course I had to go back to the real world and the clusterfuck we call the current political situation (bombs, war, border walls, eradication of human rights, elimination of healthcare, deportations, growing inequality) and I just can't understand why anyone would think this mess is the best we can do."

After watching him take on Tucker Carlson, I bumped it up my list and started reading it. Packed full of fascinating ideas, some of which came with data, some with anecdata and a couple which were just a little fanciful. I don’t think it’s quite rigorous enough to change minds, but there was plenty of eye opening material and I am starting to understand the concept of a universal basic wage."

109,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31449816-zainab,4,"Using a primarily economic analysis, this book imagines a much more equal world – one that seems so near yet so far. Just as it says on the tin, this world is utopic but completely achievable. Rutger Bregman uses statistics and studies to expose the flaws of existing national budgets and priorities. His book is a fairly short read/listen that focuses mainly on the concept of Universal Basic Income (UBI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and “bullshit jobs”, as well as poverty and foreign aid. It also envisions what a future of leisure could look like for society. The text is written in a straightforward way, which is unsurprising as Bregman spends the final chapter critiquing an “aristocratic” left, or “underdog socialism”, which he argues is not accessible to a wider public and not invigorated with enough hope to catch on. I found it to be a useful listen with some compelling and entirely convincing arguments, particularly on tax evasion and open borders.However, for me, the book also felt like a repeat of many podcasts I listened to around the UK General Election of 2019 and a few years prior. UBI as the logical future and GDP as a farce are very familiar ideas. In fact, much of what Bregman imagines was proposed in the Labour Party’s manifesto, ideas which a global pandemic might help bring to reality. In addition, the book still felt quite Euro-centric in the framing of history/ideas, so it’s difficult to imagine, for instance, how a mineral-rich and currently impoverished country would transact within this utopia. The climate crisis, for me, also deserved a much more detailed mention in this imagined future. Rutger Bregman went viral alongside Winnie Byanyima at the Davos Conference of 2019 for confronting the billionaire tax evaders sitting before him. His book, Utopia for Realists, will explain why he knew what he was talking about."
110,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,4,"Let us be unreasonable and impossible, the author exhorts. But his book, short and sweet, is far from either. The idea of basic income fits into the paradigm of a realistic utopia, according to Rutger Bregman, whose penchant for popularizing penmanship and knack for narration keep the book interesting and informative, if not all that original. The book is best understood as an attempt to bring a whole bundle of progressive ideas into the mainstream, borrowing heavily from other classics. But what the book lacks in originality it makes up for in holistic vision.One of the most refreshing parts of the book is that the author does not demonize his political opponents, such as conservatives. And indeed, most of his strident criticisms are directed at his fellow leftists (""underdog socialists"") whom he accuses of wallowing in reactionary pessimism. As someone who is more libertarian economically, I found his criticism of the banking and the financial sectors to be embarrassingly misguided, although not any more so than your average left liberal economist. (He confuses corporatist kleptocracy with free markets.) And his implicit call for more regulation of the labour markets relies on a notion of collectivistic economic planning that confuses ideal theory with the predictable failure of public policy - thus betraying his own allegiance to REALISTIC utopias. Furthermore, Bregman's utopia seems too static and degrowth to really feel alive in the way that realistic utopians must live and grow.But overall I enjoyed his vision. The future belongs to those who can envision alternative possibilities and find the institutional means to bring them account. Universal Basic Income is a way to marry progressive and libertarian politics, and ""Utopia for Realists"" does a good job of showing the kind of vision that it inspires - even if there is still room for more realism in the mix."
111,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20228885-sreejith-puthanpurayil,5,"Humans have been dreaming and designing Utopias for a long time. It has stirred whole communities into action and wars have been fought over it. In this book, the author proposes a Utopia; the idea of a society where every individual is guaranteed a minimum basic income. No strings attached. I'm generally positive about such redistribution schemes, especially in light of the near future (AI, automation etc) but how do we pay for it? The author points out that we already spend an enormous amount in the war on poverty and social assistance programs. Eliminating this bureaucracy and red tape could save us a tremendous amount and make things more efficient at the same time. However, it won't be enough. A better way to think about this is to see it as an investment in humans. When humans can meet their basic needs, they can be more selective about which jobs they will sell their time and bodies to. They can take time off and invest in themselves. In a nutshell, we can eliminate poverty, redistribute wealth, and give people more agency in their lives. Well, what's the evidence that this can actually work? The author points out the example of Dauphin, a Canadian city where a minimum basic income experiment (the no strings attached kind) was tried out for 4 years and resulted in a drastic reduction in poverty and reduced hospitalisation rates. Honestly, I'd like more such experiments but the fact is that they're expensive and the results often take years to become visible. All in all, a perspective changing book."
112,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7599597-tom,3,"The book came out in an interesting time of a paradigm shift in political perspectives. The general population is increasingly disillusioned by the trickle-down economics in the Reagan era, and pushed into the ideal of equality. While the book presented many great statistics, evidences, and insights (compiled from many different sources), it presented a few weak arguments. And through the weak argument is where the author's intellectual elitism wafts out of the writing. The author considers himself to be an arbiter of value, despite being minimally trained in economics. Somehow careers such as financial services that involves studying efficient capital allocation or corporate councils who protect the legal integrity are pointed out as bullshit jobs, all the while artists, philosophers and social study group champions are the true creators of wealth and drivers of economy. I'm not against the idea of wealth redistribution, but discounting the drive and ambition of educated professionals, and forcefully assigning high economic value to liberal disciplines, shows that not only does the author have a very limited understanding of economics, but also the left-wings' resistance of something as basic as free market.

Around the world the mainstream left seems to have run out of steam and become mired in the minutiae of intersectional grievances and the right is either run by rich men for rich men or has been captured by racist lunatics. Bregman gives a list of new (though mostly old) ideas that seem counter-intuitive, but he presents them in a way that also makes them logical, sensible and doable. I recently saw a photo of Rupert Murdoch reading this book while lounging beside a swimming pool - perhaps so that he could work out how to prevent anything in it from happening. For the sake of the rest of us, I hope plenty of politicians are also reading it."

Some of these ideas blew my mind; I'm a newbie when it comes to political theory/economics. It's left me curious and optimistic about the future.

It was pretty obvious that this started out as a book about UBI and the other issues were kind of tacked on, as they weren't as well researched or explained. There was also the long section on the economy and GDP that I didn't really need, because it didn't really help me understand the economy any better (I never will) and it was pretty long.This book was first published in 2014 in the Netherlands (I think), so there are some things that are more optimistic than I would be today. Also, a lot of the book focuses on the US, and it talks about inequality, but barely discusses race at all, which I think was a gross oversight. It's impossible to talk about inequality in the US without at least a cursory mention of the history of race. At one point, it used the US as a positive example for immigration bc of how the country was ""founded"" and all of the progress its made, which is great and all, but the mass immigration to this country wasn't so great for the people who were already here, so it's kind of a bad take, bro.I appreciated the last chapter's acknowledgement of studies that oppose the policies discussed in the book and how differing views can often entrench us further into a belief. I thought it made some interesting points about how change is actually achieved: laying groundwork for a policy and then a crisis activates it by showing that the new system would handle it better. Change can't be made if there's no alternative offered before the crisis, which is what happened in 2008. I think that mindset is especially relevant during present day's actual crisis and just hoping that we've laid some kind of groundwork for the change.Notes and Quotes:- ""you can't pull yourself up by your bootstraps if you have no boots."" -Joseph Hanlon- 80% of Americans were pro-UBI in the 60s- Henry Ford giving all his employees big raises in 1914: aww, sweet. him doing it bc then they'd be able to afford his cars: figures- “the inability to imagine a world in which things are different is evidence only of a poor imagination, not the impossibility of change”- ""... what is the value of free speech when we no longer have anything worthwhile to say? what's the point of freedom of association when we no longer feel any sense of affiliation?"""

Eləcə də biznes mütəxəssislərin böyük əksəriyyəti vəzifələrinin bir o qədər də əhəmiyyətli olmadığını düşünür. Biz acığımız gələn iş yerlərində bütün günü işlədikdən sonra bizə lazım olmayan şeyləri almağa başlayırıq. ""Realistlər üçün utopiya""da holland tarixçi və jurnalist Rutqer Breqman, bunların heç də belə olmamalı olduğunu qeyd edir. Beynəlminəllik və praqmatizm manifesti kimi Breqmanın kitabı əsas 3 ideya ətrafında formalaşıb: 15 saatlıq iş həftəsi, ""universal minimal gəlir"" və sərhədlərin olmadığı dünya. Bu iddialara dəstək məqsədi ilə kitabda ötən əsrin 70-ci illərində icra edilən ""Mincome"" təcrübəsi, evsizlərə verilən qarşılıqsız pul təcrübələri və müxtəlif çoxsayılı statistik faktlar yer alıb. Bəlkə də bu iddialar heç də qeyri-real deyil. Nəinki qeyri-real, cəsarətli olsaq, bəlkə də zəruridir deyə bilərik, çünki daha az saatlı iş həftəsi daha az iş xətası, ətraf-mühitə vurulan zərər, daha az stress, qəza və iqtisadi qeyri-bərabərlikdir. Breqman vurğulayır ki, dəyişiklik ideyalarla başlayır. Nə vaxtsa bizim bu günümüz keçmişdə yaşayan insanların utopiyası idi. Ona görə də ifrat istehsal və istehlak kimi problemlərin öhdəsindən gəlmək üçün gərək ilk növbədə qurduğumuz sistemlərə olan yanaşmamızı dəyişək. ""Realistlər üçün utopiya"" kitabı bizə cari iqtisadiyyatların qeyri-reallığını, ideal və ya utopik hesab edilən iqtisadi sistemlərin isə reallığını çox möhtəşəm və axıcı dil ilə izah edir. Məncə, kitabı oxuduqdan sonra heç kim bir daha düşündüyü ənənəvi fikirlərini və ya doqmaları yada salmayacaq. Kitabı axtarıb-tapıb oxumağıma əsas səbəb Rutqer Breqmanın öz kitabı haqqında The Economist-ə verdiyi müsahibəni dinləməyim olmuşdu (müsahibəni dinləmək üçün keçid: http://bit.ly/Ukutopia_Bregman). Bir iqtisadçı kimi mənə maraqlı gəlmişdi ki, görəsən yuxarı abzasda qeyd edilən məqamlar haqqında özünə belə inamla və güvənlə danışan şəxs nə dərəcədə ciddidir və nə dərəcədə real və yaxşı bilgilərin toplandığı kitab yaza bilib. Doqmalarımızı qıran ideyalar həmişə cəlbedici olur. Qısa müddət ərzində kitabı elektron olaraq tapdım və 1 ay ərzində yavaş-yavaş oxudum. Sonunda isə əsl düşüncə yenilənməsi yaşadım. ""Realistlər üçün utopiya"" kitabını sadəcə bəyənmək deyil, həm də onun faktuallığını nəzərə alıb qiymətləndirmək lazımdır. Son dövrlərin aktual məsələlərinə toxunan, müəyyən həll yolları göstərən və ən əsası fərziyələrlə deyil, real analitik yöntəmlərlə izahat aparan kitabı oxumağıma çox şad oldum. Sitat: ""Bəşəriyyətin möhtəşəm ölçü daşları olan utopiyalarla əlaqədar hər zaman şübhələr olub. Tanınmış sosioloq Albert Hirşmana görə, utopiyalar 3 səviyyədə hücuma məruz qalıblar: axırsızlıq (bu mümkün deyil), təhlükə (risklər çox böyükdür) və qüsurluluq (bu distopiyaya səbəb olacaq degenerasiyadır), amma Hirşman həm də yazır ki, necə ki utopiyalar gerçəkləşir, adi bir şey kimi qəbul olunmağa başlanılır"" (Breqman, Realistlər üçün utopiya, 2016) Kitab çox güclü kontrastlar üzərində qurulub. Bu o deməkdir ki, mövzular keçmiş dövrün gələcəyə olan yanaşmalarından hərəkətə gələrək, bu günümüzü də öz növbəsində hansısa gələcək zamanın keçmişi kimi qəbul edib, müxtəlif iqtisadi göstəriciləri ortaq məxrəcə gətirməyə çalışır. Məsələn, kitab ilk səhifələrində aydınlaşdırır ki, hələ Keynes 20-ci əsrin ilk rübündə daha az saata malik iş həftəsini iqtisadi cəhətdən məntiqli və düzgün hesab edirdi. Bundan əlavə, kasıb ölkələrin cəmiyyətlərin niyə görə kasıb olduqları ilə əlaqədar bir çox maraqlı təcrübə və məlumatlara əsasən səbəblər üzərində dayanılır. Qeyd edilir ki, kasıb ölkələr ona görə kasıbdır ki, onlarda sadəcə oalraq yetərincə nağd pul ehtiyatları yoxdur. Halbuki, həm media, həm də populist siyasətçilər kasıb cəmiyyətləri demokratiyanın olmamasında, insanların savadsızlığında və ya digər hansısa ictimai göstəricilərdə olduğunu deyirlər. Təbii ki, onların müəyyən əhəmiyyəti var, amma aparılan real təcrübələr və sahə araşdırmaları sübut edib ki, isanlara ilkin investisiyanı təmin edəndə, özləri həmin investisiyanı artırmağın yollarını axtarıb-tapırlar. Sitat: ""19-cu əsrdə bərabərsizlik sosial sinif məsələsi ilə əlaqədar idi. Bu günlərdə isə bu məkan ilə əlaqədardır. ""Bütün ölkələrin proletarları birləşin!"" uzun müddət müxtəlif yerlərin kasıb insanlarının əzabkeşliyini birləşdirən ideya olub. Bu gün isə, Dünya Bankının aparıcı iqtisadçısı Branko Milanoviç qeyd edir ki, ""Proletariat həmrəyliyi artıq ölüb, çünki artıq qlobal proletariat deyə bir şey qalmayıb.""""(Breqman, Realistlər üçün utopiya, 2016) İnsan özü özlüyündə çox qəribə canlıdır, çünki o xəyal edə bilir. Kitabın ilk səhifələrindən müəllif göstərir ki, bütün bu fiosoflar, yazıçılar və alimlər utopiyaların vasitəsi ilə bəşəriyyətin inkişafa və firavanlığa nail ola biləcəyini qeyd edirmişlər. Onlardan bəziləri isə artıq reallaşıb, bəziləri reallşmaq üzərədir, digərlərinin reallaşması üçün isə az qalıb. Utopiya anlayışının özü əslində inkişaflar üçün mühüm zəmindir. İnsan təxəyyülündə özünə varlıq qazanan istənilən ideya, hətta utopiyalar belə nə vaxtsa gerçəkləşəcəklər, sadəcə o istiqamətdə kiçik addımlar irəliləmək yetərlidir. Sitat: ""Abstrakt ideallardan fərqli olaraq, çertyojlar nifaqa tolerantlıq göstərməyən dəyişməz qayda-qanunlardan ibarət olurlar. İtalyan şair Tomasso Kampanellanın ""Günəşin şəhəri (1602)"" çox yaxşı nümunə təklif edir. Bu utopiyada və ya distopiyada, fərdi mülkiyyət ciddi olaraq qadağan olunub, hamı bir-birini sevməyə məcbur edilib və dava-dalaş ölümlə cəzalandırılır.

117,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498454-h-kon-gunnarsson,5,"This is the second book I read about universal basic income, the first one was by Andrew Yang. Both of these books explain the idea very well, but they have different strengths just the same. I think Yang managed to show more clearly the urgency for this system at this point in time as we are entering into the forth industrial revolution, while Bergman explains the history, and the science behind this idea better.It is a radical idea, and I’m not sure if I would have taken it seriously a few years ago. In fact, I don’t think I would have given it much of a thought until I started to read up on the pending industrial revolution. That is what made it realistic for me. There just doesn’t seem to be a viable path into that new reality with out some version of universal basic income. But what surprised me about the history Bergman presents is that it is actually a much older idea, and it had some really surprising campaigner for it. The fact that Richard Nixon is the American president that has got closest to getting that kind of system into action was one of those surprises. From listening to his party these days one would hardly expect that, but he did it because it seemed, even then, to make good financial sense. This idea isn’t just a shot in the dark, there is a lot of research behind it. So when people say it will not work because people are so lazy they will never do anything if they get free money, they need to show evidence for that opinion. What this book shows is evidence from other research that point in the other direction. All in all, I think this is an interesting book, and the case for universal basic income is very well argued here."

We go to a doctor when we're sick, a therapist when we're sad, a dietitian when we're overweight, prison when we're convicted and a job coach when we're out of work. All these services cost vast sums of money, but with little to show for it. In the US, where the cost of healthcare is highest on the planet, the life expectancy for many is actually going down. All the while the market and commercial interests enjoy a free reign. The food industry supplies us with cheap garbage loaded with salt, sugar and fat, putting us on a fast track to the doctor and dietitian. Advancing technologies are laying waste to ever-more jobs sending us back again to the job coach and the ad industry encourages us to spend money we don't have on junk we don't need in order to impress people we can't stand.Then we can go and cry on our therapist's shoulder.That's the dystopia we're living in today."

Bregman certainly has thought-provoking ideas to share and makes you question, or at least wonder about how the world could be a different, better place. The book reads well, keeps you interested, and avoids being polarizing by building his arguments on ethical virtues.

Imagine a pandemic hitting states who's citizens receive an universal basic income, securing their livelihood!In ""Utopia for Realists"" Rutger Bregman argues for his three visions for the future: a 15-hour working week, a world without borders and a universal basic income for everyone. Unfortunately the introduction of this book is really weak with enumerating inventions and conditions of our present to state under which high standards we would be living, desperately lacking reflection. He talks for example about medical technology enabling patients with spinal cord injuries to walk again but completely fails to mention, that health insurance companies refuse to provide them to patients due to high costs, that people are getting older due to medical care, but under conditions that are ethically questionable to say the least, or that the number of people committing suicide are three times as high as deaths from vehicle accidents. He does recognize depression though, which according to him is caused by our inability to imagine anything better than what we already have. I highly contradict that. Thankfully he then turns around and starts to recognize, that the empowerment of the individual doesn't just lead to more freedom but a constant feeling of failure when not being able to live up to the expectations.After this disappointing introduction he turns to the universal income for everyone where it get‘s interesting. He lingers between anecdote, academic research and statistics and highlights examples of how these policies have already been partially implemented in the past. For example how a universal basic income was almost introduced in the United States under Nixon, or how a Canadian basic annual income program barely dented the enthusiasm for work, but let to a drop in crime, truancy, hospital attendance, domestic violence and poverty. I believe that this topic needs to be on our politics agendas! I agree that the costs that we invest in our social system aren‘t just completely ineffective but also contra-productive. Because of our current pandemic we can‘t close our eyes to these options anymore and which consequences it would have if we already would have considered it!In the second part of the books he introduces his vision for a 15 hour work week in 2030, because our economy would be that wealthy, that no more was required. Even though he dedicates an entire chapter to it, he somehow fails to connect it to the basic income model. Also it completely ignores the variety of work fields, which seems ironic to me because he deprecates the work fields the biggest part of our society works in, as being unproductive, replaceable and unable to provide any value to society. Such as lawyer, bankers,economists,companies,media...vs. doctors, fire fighter, farmers. Those who would actually produce. But particularly in those areas, work times are in important factor of the ability to produce in the first place and practice is gained by long periods of training. While the concept wouldn't apply to self employers to begin with, those who would be able to instantly instate the concept are those the author diminishes.He then argues for a world without borders, which probably shows the biggest lack of reflection. More people migrating freely would require more energy, leading to more jobs, which is why they would start to produce more and ultimately invest more money back into the economy. But about which jobs are were talking about here? Particularly the jobs the author valued above as the only ones of worth require decades of education in difficult fields. Not only do they require a high level of adaption to our language to say the least, the areas themselves are also not able to adapt to sudden changes in requirements as well. Our current situation teaches us what happens, if there are suddenly more patients than ventilators available to us, but the same goes for housing, food production etc. Open borders always would be influences by sudden movements caused by political actions, natural catastrophes and poverty, it wouldn't just be a gradual floating state. And just as important: What about culture differences? What about religious believes that collide? What about language barriers? What about geographical space limitations? What about different legal systems? What about border controls in order to provide safety for let‘s say outbreaking viruses or prosecution? The author really couldn't convince me of this idea.A very thought provoking book. I obviously don‘t agree with a big part of what the author says but these topics need to be discussed. Particularly the basic income.PS: For me stars are a measurement of impact rather than liking. A five star book isn‘t necessarily one I entirely agree with, but can also mean that it provoked me to think intensely and forced me to form strong opinions, which can‘t even be measured in stars and is one of the main purposes I read books to begin with."
124,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47154315-ian,3,"This is a well-written, well-articulated treatise on the Utopian ideals of a shorter work week, a Universal Basic Income, and other rights for working class people.Unfortunately, although the author wrote well and supported the ideas with a wealth of statistics, there isn't really much new here. Social progressives have held these ideals for years--as Bregman himself demonstrates in his historical references to earlier experiments for the UBI--but society never seems to get any closer to realizing them. I had hoped the author would review these concepts and then explain in detail how to go about attaining them in practice, given that governments continually see overwhelming data of their merit but consistently fail to act.Bregman does briefly look at this stumbling-block near the end of the book in the chapter of How Ideas Change the World. As he states,The question is not CAN new ideas defeat old ones; the question is HOW.Other than reminding us that crises can often drive larger changes than small tentative, rational steps, Bregman disappointing has little to offer. This is a shame, especially given the current world crisis with Covid, where there do seem to be some current openings to such ideas. But without some strong leaders pointing the way, we instead seem destined to return to a (perhaps slightly newer) normal that may prove to be negligibly different than the recent status quo. Sadly, it seems built into human nature to be unable to change our minds and behaviours, even when the best evidence is staring us directly in the face. I deeply wish Bregman had a better answer and could have prescribed some more proactive steps forward.That said, the book is an important read, especially for those unfamiliar with the progressive Utopian concepts, such as a Universal Basic Income that historically has good hard data supporting its implementation. It is sad that Bregman somewhat infers in his own text that those who need to read and absorb the information will never do so."

No, the real crises is we cannot come up with something better. p11An idealist and dreamer from the get go, I have never been taken for a realist. Maybe this is why it was easy for me to agree with the main arguments presented in this paradigm shifting analysis of economic organization and the status quo. RB does not stop there but goes on to propose some pragmatic, semi-revolutionary solutions for our ailing world.I especially like his ideas on a universal basic income ( p31 free cash greases the wheels of the whole economy....) and the way he differentiates between and ""stable and meaningful work"" p147 and""bullshit jobs...that even the people doing them admit that they are superfluous"" p163 ""Instead of creating wealth, these jobs mostly just shift it around."" p155The gap between rich and poor is already wider than it was in ancient Rome- an economy based on slave labor. p184Perhaps crises isn't really the right word for our current condition.

He makes cases for specifics such as Universal Basic Income, a fifteen-hour workweek, open borders, and more, but also challenges us to confront our values, most importantly the ridiculously out of proportion worth that we as a society we give to jobs which don't create any value ( investment banks, speculators of all kinds, much of the service industries that don't actually provide any services ) compared to those things that are vital, fulfilling or actually create wealth. The best example he gives is the contrasting strikes of garbage collectors in New York in 1968 which brought that great city to its knees in ten days ( leaving 100, 000 tons of trash on the streets ) and that of bank workers in Ireland two years later, who the country managed without for six months with almost no effect on the nation's economy.Bergman, and his translator, write with clarity and concision and his arguments are based entirely on facts and numbers, but this doesn't mean it lacks passion."

But I found the section on world developments, immigration and open borders the strongest (I particularly liked the citing of theBook of Daniel as the first written record of a test with a control group). Full of fascinating stories and strong ideas, with lots of notes to follow up.

A shorter work week and changing the way we look at, and compensate different kinds of work are other ideas discussed in the book that already resonated with me before. The book seems well researched, with a long list of references that can be looked up by those who want more details, although I found the outcome of some of the studies quite doubtful. The book is packed with information and yet, it is written in a colloquial and interesting way that turns reading it into a real pleasure."
131,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5879607-benjamin,5,"Simple works like this can often be overlooked for many reasons. Firstly, they oversimplify because they’re not an academic text. Secondly, they are embedded in an ideological position that the reader can’t get along with, so it’s dismissed out of hand. Thirdly, the argument isn’t as coherent as it could be (partly because of the first and second points) so closer readers will find flaws within moments and miss some of the more salient points.I’m glad to say that this work doesn’t fall prey to those things. Firstly, while simplified, the ideas presented are relatively straight-forward and so they don’t need to be more complicated for its purpose. The author has written more academic work which can be explored, or he points in the direction of those texts that you should look into. It’s textbook stuff: make a point, show how your point might be wrong, defend your point. Job done.Likewise, there’s no clear ideological baggage here. It’s true that he defends neoliberalism (unashamedly) and has a dig at a current strand of defeatist socialism, but throughout the book we have equal nods given to Marx and Engels, the anarchist anthropologist David Graeber and a host of neoliberals that he doesn’t agree with. His point is not that neoliberalism and capitalism are the only games in town. He’s simply stating that neoliberalism can’t be used as a derogatory word when it can be used to do the same job as anti-capitalist positions (if done well). Finally, the argument is coherent and where he runs into dead ends, there is a clear acknowledgement of those problems. Obviously the biggest issue is not what to do but how to get politicians to do it- but that’s true of any book of philosophy, economics or politics that tries to do something radical.This book is hopeful because it shows us how the major changes we need to eradicate world poverty, produce more equality and produce a better quality of life are actually simple. It also reminds us that with enough push, the impossible can become actual. It’s really odd that his ideas echo so many points made by Zizek, despite their huge differences. Bergman is anti-high theory, anti-ideology and less critical of free markets than Zizek, whereas Zizek is entrenched in theory, admits we cannot avoid ideology and is highly critical of capitalism at every turn. However, both argue similar points: the belief that minor changes can be made to capitalism seems like Utopianism, pie-in-the-sky navel gazing nonsense, but all big ideas seemed this way at some point; ultimately, with the absence of a true change of the entire system, we have to radically change what already exists; the revolution is a revolution of ideas and thinking, not of seizing land and machines; Utopianism is not an end state, but a way of thinking- always with that expanding horizon in the distance; and finally, that the left enjoys defeat and has begun to identify with it too much. It’s nice to see two incredibly opposed individuals finding two ways of making the same points. Read it. This book is vital. Even if you don’t agree totally (from either a pro-capitalist or pro-socialist standpoint) you’ll find something in here to make you radically reassess what you already think."
132,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50270175-frances-maxwell,5,"I LOVED this book! The world seems so depressing at the moment, with the likes of Trump and Brexit and what feels to me like a constant threat of impending doom (maybe that's just my anxiety speaking!) This book reminds you that we are living RIGHT NOW in an incredible utopia compared to where we were in the past. This is the best time to be alive in human history. And what's more, there could be an even brighter future with equality for all and the abolition of poverty across the globe, if only we would dare to dream.I loved the ideas in it, which include universal basic income, a shorter worker week, and open borders, each of which he discusses at length. Open borders, in particular, is seriously radical, but morally his argument is sound - borders are a form of global apartheid! How terrible is it that your chances in life are determined by where you are born. We allow everything else to move freely about the world, but not people.I found it really interesting how major political movements tend only to occur after a crisis (before this happens, politicians will only suggest things that don't stray too far from the status quo), and how neoliberalism, for example, came into fruition after the Arab oil crisis in the 70s thanks to decades of simmering (a group of thinkers had been discussing it at length since the 30s). However after the 2008 crash which proved that that it wasn't infallible, there were no radical alternative ideas brewing (!) so we've stuck with the same flawed model. Thinking up and discussing new ideas is CRITICAL to moving forward.I loved the section on 'underdog' socialism, because it's so true! One of the successes of Trump's campaign is that he knows that people like to be on the 'winning' side and yet the branding of the left is all, 'sigh - welfare is expensive but a moral must' (basically, 'we're morally right but an economic disaster') whereas in fact the ideas the author discusses not only eradicate inequality and poverty but result in astonishing economic success. This is the message the voters need to hear.If you're thinking this is too good to be true, I get that. There was a stage in the book where even I - a total ignoramus - felt the arguments were naively optimistic, along the lines of, 'these ideas are the solution to everything and have no down sides', and I guess I was looking for more of a critical analysis, but towards the end I felt reassured that his work is rooted in extensive research, and that he himself is aware of the dangers of bias (he discusses this, including cognitive dissonance, in later chapters and gives an example of his own).In any case, a vision is a vision, and it should be radical. I loved his. I want to live in that world. And it actually feels feasible! Let's do this, people!Definitely read this book!"
133,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/442654-andrew,0,"Like many/most people, I first became aware of Rutger Bregman based on the fire he spit at Tucker Carlson, which was amusing not because it had any intrinsic value -- we live in a world that favors bitchslaps like that over long-form argument far too much -- but simply because it was funny and witty. I then found out that Rutger Bregman was also a real writer, and he told off the fuckers at Davos too. So let's have a look, I thought.First, he presents his ideas well, and presents them honestly, and I can certainly agree with all of his prescriptions, which, as a democratic socialist, shouldn't be surprising. My only regret is that his analysis is a bit skin-deep at points. He diagnoses several of the symptoms of late-stage capitalism correctly, and provides cures for those symptoms, but what of the underlying disease? A UBI could be disastrous if applied from a libertarian rather than a socialist perspective, and as for open borders, there's a difference between actual open borders (good idea, but it needs a phase-in) and Koch Brothers-styled open borders (like how a Romanian working in Germany can still legally be paid Romanian wages by a German employer). Simply put, good effort Rutger, but you'll need a bit more depth if you wanna achieve top Marx (sorry, couldn't resist)."

You would think that the eradication of poverty is something people can all agree on, but unfortunately that is not the case. I found it interesting how often the book discussed the US even though the author is not American. Reading this was so pleasant what with its talk of UBI, open borders, 15 hour work weeks, and the eradication of poverty, but then of course I had to go back to the real world and the clusterfuck we call the current political situation (bombs, war, border walls, eradication of human rights, elimination of healthcare, deportations, growing inequality) and I just can't understand why anyone would think this mess is the best we can do."

139,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31449816-zainab,4,"Using a primarily economic analysis, this book imagines a much more equal world – one that seems so near yet so far. Just as it says on the tin, this world is utopic but completely achievable. Rutger Bregman uses statistics and studies to expose the flaws of existing national budgets and priorities. His book is a fairly short read/listen that focuses mainly on the concept of Universal Basic Income (UBI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and “bullshit jobs”, as well as poverty and foreign aid. It also envisions what a future of leisure could look like for society. The text is written in a straightforward way, which is unsurprising as Bregman spends the final chapter critiquing an “aristocratic” left, or “underdog socialism”, which he argues is not accessible to a wider public and not invigorated with enough hope to catch on. I found it to be a useful listen with some compelling and entirely convincing arguments, particularly on tax evasion and open borders.However, for me, the book also felt like a repeat of many podcasts I listened to around the UK General Election of 2019 and a few years prior. UBI as the logical future and GDP as a farce are very familiar ideas. In fact, much of what Bregman imagines was proposed in the Labour Party’s manifesto, ideas which a global pandemic might help bring to reality. In addition, the book still felt quite Euro-centric in the framing of history/ideas, so it’s difficult to imagine, for instance, how a mineral-rich and currently impoverished country would transact within this utopia. The climate crisis, for me, also deserved a much more detailed mention in this imagined future. Rutger Bregman went viral alongside Winnie Byanyima at the Davos Conference of 2019 for confronting the billionaire tax evaders sitting before him. His book, Utopia for Realists, will explain why he knew what he was talking about."
140,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,4,"Let us be unreasonable and impossible, the author exhorts. But his book, short and sweet, is far from either. The idea of basic income fits into the paradigm of a realistic utopia, according to Rutger Bregman, whose penchant for popularizing penmanship and knack for narration keep the book interesting and informative, if not all that original. The book is best understood as an attempt to bring a whole bundle of progressive ideas into the mainstream, borrowing heavily from other classics. But what the book lacks in originality it makes up for in holistic vision.One of the most refreshing parts of the book is that the author does not demonize his political opponents, such as conservatives. And indeed, most of his strident criticisms are directed at his fellow leftists (""underdog socialists"") whom he accuses of wallowing in reactionary pessimism. As someone who is more libertarian economically, I found his criticism of the banking and the financial sectors to be embarrassingly misguided, although not any more so than your average left liberal economist. (He confuses corporatist kleptocracy with free markets.) And his implicit call for more regulation of the labour markets relies on a notion of collectivistic economic planning that confuses ideal theory with the predictable failure of public policy - thus betraying his own allegiance to REALISTIC utopias. Furthermore, Bregman's utopia seems too static and degrowth to really feel alive in the way that realistic utopians must live and grow.But overall I enjoyed his vision. The future belongs to those who can envision alternative possibilities and find the institutional means to bring them account. Universal Basic Income is a way to marry progressive and libertarian politics, and ""Utopia for Realists"" does a good job of showing the kind of vision that it inspires - even if there is still room for more realism in the mix."

It has stirred whole communities into action and wars have been fought over it. In this book, the author proposes a Utopia; the idea of a society where every individual is guaranteed a minimum basic income. No strings attached. I'm generally positive about such redistribution schemes, especially in light of the near future (AI, automation etc) but how do we pay for it? The author points out that we already spend an enormous amount in the war on poverty and social assistance programs. Eliminating this bureaucracy and red tape could save us a tremendous amount and make things more efficient at the same time. However, it won't be enough. A better way to think about this is to see it as an investment in humans. When humans can meet their basic needs, they can be more selective about which jobs they will sell their time and bodies to. They can take time off and invest in themselves. In a nutshell, we can eliminate poverty, redistribute wealth, and give people more agency in their lives. Well, what's the evidence that this can actually work? The author points out the example of Dauphin, a Canadian city where a minimum basic income experiment (the no strings attached kind) was tried out for 4 years and resulted in a drastic reduction in poverty and reduced hospitalisation rates. Honestly, I'd like more such experiments but the fact is that they're expensive and the results often take years to become visible. All in all, a perspective changing book."
142,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7599597-tom,3,"The book came out in an interesting time of a paradigm shift in political perspectives. The general population is increasingly disillusioned by the trickle-down economics in the Reagan era, and pushed into the ideal of equality. While the book presented many great statistics, evidences, and insights (compiled from many different sources), it presented a few weak arguments. And through the weak argument is where the author's intellectual elitism wafts out of the writing. The author considers himself to be an arbiter of value, despite being minimally trained in economics. Somehow careers such as financial services that involves studying efficient capital allocation or corporate councils who protect the legal integrity are pointed out as bullshit jobs, all the while artists, philosophers and social study group champions are the true creators of wealth and drivers of economy. I'm not against the idea of wealth redistribution, but discounting the drive and ambition of educated professionals, and forcefully assigning high economic value to liberal disciplines, shows that not only does the author have a very limited understanding of economics, but also the left-wings' resistance of something as basic as free market.

Around the world the mainstream left seems to have run out of steam and become mired in the minutiae of intersectional grievances and the right is either run by rich men for rich men or has been captured by racist lunatics. Bregman gives a list of new (though mostly old) ideas that seem counter-intuitive, but he presents them in a way that also makes them logical, sensible and doable. I recently saw a photo of Rupert Murdoch reading this book while lounging beside a swimming pool - perhaps so that he could work out how to prevent anything in it from happening.

It was pretty obvious that this started out as a book about UBI and the other issues were kind of tacked on, as they weren't as well researched or explained. There was also the long section on the economy and GDP that I didn't really need, because it didn't really help me understand the economy any better (I never will) and it was pretty long.This book was first published in 2014 in the Netherlands (I think), so there are some things that are more optimistic than I would be today. Also, a lot of the book focuses on the US, and it talks about inequality, but barely discusses race at all, which I think was a gross oversight. It's impossible to talk about inequality in the US without at least a cursory mention of the history of race. At one point, it used the US as a positive example for immigration bc of how the country was ""founded"" and all of the progress its made, which is great and all, but the mass immigration to this country wasn't so great for the people who were already here, so it's kind of a bad take, bro.I appreciated the last chapter's acknowledgement of studies that oppose the policies discussed in the book and how differing views can often entrench us further into a belief. I thought it made some interesting points about how change is actually achieved: laying groundwork for a policy and then a crisis activates it by showing that the new system would handle it better. Change can't be made if there's no alternative offered before the crisis, which is what happened in 2008. I think that mindset is especially relevant during present day's actual crisis and just hoping that we've laid some kind of groundwork for the change.Notes and Quotes:- ""you can't pull yourself up by your bootstraps if you have no boots."" -Joseph Hanlon- 80% of Americans were pro-UBI in the 60s- Henry Ford giving all his employees big raises in 1914: aww, sweet. him doing it bc then they'd be able to afford his cars: figures- “the inability to imagine a world in which things are different is evidence only of a poor imagination, not the impossibility of change”- ""... what is the value of free speech when we no longer have anything worthwhile to say? what's the point of freedom of association when we no longer feel any sense of affiliation?"""

Bir iqtisadçı kimi mənə maraqlı gəlmişdi ki, görəsən yuxarı abzasda qeyd edilən məqamlar haqqında özünə belə inamla və güvənlə danışan şəxs nə dərəcədə ciddidir və nə dərəcədə real və yaxşı bilgilərin toplandığı kitab yaza bilib. Doqmalarımızı qıran ideyalar həmişə cəlbedici olur. Qısa müddət ərzində kitabı elektron olaraq tapdım və 1 ay ərzində yavaş-yavaş oxudum. Sonunda isə əsl düşüncə yenilənməsi yaşadım. ""Realistlər üçün utopiya"" kitabını sadəcə bəyənmək deyil, həm də onun faktuallığını nəzərə alıb qiymətləndirmək lazımdır. Son dövrlərin aktual məsələlərinə toxunan, müəyyən həll yolları göstərən və ən əsası fərziyələrlə deyil, real analitik yöntəmlərlə izahat aparan kitabı oxumağıma çox şad oldum. Sitat: ""Bəşəriyyətin möhtəşəm ölçü daşları olan utopiyalarla əlaqədar hər zaman şübhələr olub. Tanınmış sosioloq Albert Hirşmana görə, utopiyalar 3 səviyyədə hücuma məruz qalıblar: axırsızlıq (bu mümkün deyil), təhlükə (risklər çox böyükdür) və qüsurluluq (bu distopiyaya səbəb olacaq degenerasiyadır), amma Hirşman həm də yazır ki, necə ki utopiyalar gerçəkləşir, adi bir şey kimi qəbul olunmağa başlanılır"" (Breqman, Realistlər üçün utopiya, 2016) Kitab çox güclü kontrastlar üzərində qurulub. Bu o deməkdir ki, mövzular keçmiş dövrün gələcəyə olan yanaşmalarından hərəkətə gələrək, bu günümüzü də öz növbəsində hansısa gələcək zamanın keçmişi kimi qəbul edib, müxtəlif iqtisadi göstəriciləri ortaq məxrəcə gətirməyə çalışır. Məsələn, kitab ilk səhifələrində aydınlaşdırır ki, hələ Keynes 20-ci əsrin ilk rübündə daha az saata malik iş həftəsini iqtisadi cəhətdən məntiqli və düzgün hesab edirdi. Bundan əlavə, kasıb ölkələrin cəmiyyətlərin niyə görə kasıb olduqları ilə əlaqədar bir çox maraqlı təcrübə və məlumatlara əsasən səbəblər üzərində dayanılır. Qeyd edilir ki, kasıb ölkələr ona görə kasıbdır ki, onlarda sadəcə oalraq yetərincə nağd pul ehtiyatları yoxdur. Halbuki, həm media, həm də populist siyasətçilər kasıb cəmiyyətləri demokratiyanın olmamasında, insanların savadsızlığında və ya digər hansısa ictimai göstəricilərdə olduğunu deyirlər. Təbii ki, onların müəyyən əhəmiyyəti var, amma aparılan real təcrübələr və sahə araşdırmaları sübut edib ki, isanlara ilkin investisiyanı təmin edəndə, özləri həmin investisiyanı artırmağın yollarını axtarıb-tapırlar. Sitat: ""19-cu əsrdə bərabərsizlik sosial sinif məsələsi ilə əlaqədar idi. Bu günlərdə isə bu məkan ilə əlaqədardır. ""Bütün ölkələrin proletarları birləşin!"" uzun müddət müxtəlif yerlərin kasıb insanlarının əzabkeşliyini birləşdirən ideya olub. Bu gün isə, Dünya Bankının aparıcı iqtisadçısı Branko Milanoviç qeyd edir ki, ""Proletariat həmrəyliyi artıq ölüb, çünki artıq qlobal proletariat deyə bir şey qalmayıb.""""(Breqman, Realistlər üçün utopiya, 2016) İnsan özü özlüyündə çox qəribə canlıdır, çünki o xəyal edə bilir. Kitabın ilk səhifələrindən müəllif göstərir ki, bütün bu fiosoflar, yazıçılar və alimlər utopiyaların vasitəsi ilə bəşəriyyətin inkişafa və firavanlığa nail ola biləcəyini qeyd edirmişlər. Onlardan bəziləri isə artıq reallaşıb, bəziləri reallşmaq üzərədir, digərlərinin reallaşması üçün isə az qalıb. Utopiya anlayışının özü əslində inkişaflar üçün mühüm zəmindir. İnsan təxəyyülündə özünə varlıq qazanan istənilən ideya, hətta utopiyalar belə nə vaxtsa gerçəkləşəcəklər, sadəcə o istiqamətdə kiçik addımlar irəliləmək yetərlidir. Sitat: ""Abstrakt ideallardan fərqli olaraq, çertyojlar nifaqa tolerantlıq göstərməyən dəyişməz qayda-qanunlardan ibarət olurlar. İtalyan şair Tomasso Kampanellanın ""Günəşin şəhəri (1602)"" çox yaxşı nümunə təklif edir. Bu utopiyada və ya distopiyada, fərdi mülkiyyət ciddi olaraq qadağan olunub, hamı bir-birini sevməyə məcbur edilib və dava-dalaş ölümlə cəzalandırılır. Özəl həyat, intim məqamlar da daxil olmaqla dövlət tərəfindən idarə olunur. Məsələn, ağıllı insanlar ancaq axmaq insanlarla yatağa girə bilər, kök insanlar isə arıqlarla. Hər bir təklif arzuolunan ortalamaya nail olmaq üçün tənzimlənir. Ən əsası isə, hər bir insan inanılmaz dərəcə çoxsayılı informatorlar vasitəsi ilə nəzarət altındadır. Əgər bir kimsə qanunları pozarsa, özünün könüllü surətdə pis vətəndaş olduğunu qəbul edəcək və başqaları tərəfindən daşlanacağına razı olacağı həddədək qorxudulurdu"" (Breqman, Realistlər üçün utopiya, 2016) Kitabı oxumaq qərarını verən şəxs bol rəqəmlərə və nümunələrə hazır olmalıdır. Belə kitabların mütaliəsi paradiqmadəyişdirici xarakterə malikdir və çox faydalı ola bilər. Rutqer Breqmanın ""Realistlər üçün utopiya"" kitabı birmənalı olaraq oxumağa dəyərlidir.

147,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498454-h-kon-gunnarsson,5,"This is the second book I read about universal basic income, the first one was by Andrew Yang. Both of these books explain the idea very well, but they have different strengths just the same. I think Yang managed to show more clearly the urgency for this system at this point in time as we are entering into the forth industrial revolution, while Bergman explains the history, and the science behind this idea better.It is a radical idea, and I’m not sure if I would have taken it seriously a few years ago. In fact, I don’t think I would have given it much of a thought until I started to read up on the pending industrial revolution. That is what made it realistic for me. There just doesn’t seem to be a viable path into that new reality with out some version of universal basic income. But what surprised me about the history Bergman presents is that it is actually a much older idea, and it had some really surprising campaigner for it. The fact that Richard Nixon is the American president that has got closest to getting that kind of system into action was one of those surprises. From listening to his party these days one would hardly expect that, but he did it because it seemed, even then, to make good financial sense. This idea isn’t just a shot in the dark, there is a lot of research behind it. So when people say it will not work because people are so lazy they will never do anything if they get free money, they need to show evidence for that opinion. What this book shows is evidence from other research that point in the other direction. All in all, I think this is an interesting book, and the case for universal basic income is very well argued here."
148,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37925908-psychonout,4,"Meanwhile the welfare state has increasingly shifted its focus from the causes of our discontent to the symptoms. We go to a doctor when we're sick, a therapist when we're sad, a dietitian when we're overweight, prison when we're convicted and a job coach when we're out of work. All these services cost vast sums of money, but with little to show for it. In the US, where the cost of healthcare is highest on the planet, the life expectancy for many is actually going down. All the while the market and commercial interests enjoy a free reign. The food industry supplies us with cheap garbage loaded with salt, sugar and fat, putting us on a fast track to the doctor and dietitian. Advancing technologies are laying waste to ever-more jobs sending us back again to the job coach and the ad industry encourages us to spend money we don't have on junk we don't need in order to impress people we can't stand.Then we can go and cry on our therapist's shoulder.That's the dystopia we're living in today."
149,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108599067-wout-biesheuvel,4,"Interesting read. Bregman certainly has thought-provoking ideas to share and makes you question, or at least wonder about how the world could be a different, better place. The book reads well, keeps you interested, and avoids being polarizing by building his arguments on ethical virtues. Instead he uses logical arguments and often refers research in favor of his viewpoints. The book obviously doesn't really tell you how to go about implementing his ideas; what could go wrong and neither talks about the not-so positive sides; maybe not for realists after all!"

153,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,4,"A book that definitely needs to be read and discussed! Imagine a pandemic hitting states who's citizens receive an universal basic income, securing their livelihood!In ""Utopia for Realists"" Rutger Bregman argues for his three visions for the future: a 15-hour working week, a world without borders and a universal basic income for everyone. Unfortunately the introduction of this book is really weak with enumerating inventions and conditions of our present to state under which high standards we would be living, desperately lacking reflection. He talks for example about medical technology enabling patients with spinal cord injuries to walk again but completely fails to mention, that health insurance companies refuse to provide them to patients due to high costs, that people are getting older due to medical care, but under conditions that are ethically questionable to say the least, or that the number of people committing suicide are three times as high as deaths from vehicle accidents. He does recognize depression though, which according to him is caused by our inability to imagine anything better than what we already have. I highly contradict that. Thankfully he then turns around and starts to recognize, that the empowerment of the individual doesn't just lead to more freedom but a constant feeling of failure when not being able to live up to the expectations.After this disappointing introduction he turns to the universal income for everyone where it get‘s interesting. He lingers between anecdote, academic research and statistics and highlights examples of how these policies have already been partially implemented in the past. For example how a universal basic income was almost introduced in the United States under Nixon, or how a Canadian basic annual income program barely dented the enthusiasm for work, but let to a drop in crime, truancy, hospital attendance, domestic violence and poverty. I believe that this topic needs to be on our politics agendas! I agree that the costs that we invest in our social system aren‘t just completely ineffective but also contra-productive. Because of our current pandemic we can‘t close our eyes to these options anymore and which consequences it would have if we already would have considered it!In the second part of the books he introduces his vision for a 15 hour work week in 2030, because our economy would be that wealthy, that no more was required. Even though he dedicates an entire chapter to it, he somehow fails to connect it to the basic income model. Also it completely ignores the variety of work fields, which seems ironic to me because he deprecates the work fields the biggest part of our society works in, as being unproductive, replaceable and unable to provide any value to society. Such as lawyer, bankers,economists,companies,media...vs. doctors, fire fighter, farmers. Those who would actually produce. But particularly in those areas, work times are in important factor of the ability to produce in the first place and practice is gained by long periods of training. While the concept wouldn't apply to self employers to begin with, those who would be able to instantly instate the concept are those the author diminishes.He then argues for a world without borders, which probably shows the biggest lack of reflection. More people migrating freely would require more energy, leading to more jobs, which is why they would start to produce more and ultimately invest more money back into the economy. But about which jobs are were talking about here? Particularly the jobs the author valued above as the only ones of worth require decades of education in difficult fields. Not only do they require a high level of adaption to our language to say the least, the areas themselves are also not able to adapt to sudden changes in requirements as well. Our current situation teaches us what happens, if there are suddenly more patients than ventilators available to us, but the same goes for housing, food production etc. Open borders always would be influences by sudden movements caused by political actions, natural catastrophes and poverty, it wouldn't just be a gradual floating state. And just as important: What about culture differences? What about religious believes that collide? What about language barriers? What about geographical space limitations? What about different legal systems? What about border controls in order to provide safety for let‘s say outbreaking viruses or prosecution? The author really couldn't convince me of this idea.A very thought provoking book. I obviously don‘t agree with a big part of what the author says but these topics need to be discussed. Particularly the basic income.PS: For me stars are a measurement of impact rather than liking. A five star book isn‘t necessarily one I entirely agree with, but can also mean that it provoked me to think intensely and forced me to form strong opinions, which can‘t even be measured in stars and is one of the main purposes I read books to begin with."
154,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47154315-ian,3,"This is a well-written, well-articulated treatise on the Utopian ideals of a shorter work week, a Universal Basic Income, and other rights for working class people.Unfortunately, although the author wrote well and supported the ideas with a wealth of statistics, there isn't really much new here. Social progressives have held these ideals for years--as Bregman himself demonstrates in his historical references to earlier experiments for the UBI--but society never seems to get any closer to realizing them. I had hoped the author would review these concepts and then explain in detail how to go about attaining them in practice, given that governments continually see overwhelming data of their merit but consistently fail to act.Bregman does briefly look at this stumbling-block near the end of the book in the chapter of How Ideas Change the World. As he states,The question is not CAN new ideas defeat old ones; the question is HOW.Other than reminding us that crises can often drive larger changes than small tentative, rational steps, Bregman disappointing has little to offer. This is a shame, especially given the current world crisis with Covid, where there do seem to be some current openings to such ideas. But without some strong leaders pointing the way, we instead seem destined to return to a (perhaps slightly newer) normal that may prove to be negligibly different than the recent status quo. Sadly, it seems built into human nature to be unable to change our minds and behaviours, even when the best evidence is staring us directly in the face. I deeply wish Bregman had a better answer and could have prescribed some more proactive steps forward.That said, the book is an important read, especially for those unfamiliar with the progressive Utopian concepts, such as a Universal Basic Income that historically has good hard data supporting its implementation. It is sad that Bregman somewhat infers in his own text that those who need to read and absorb the information will never do so."

No, the real crises is we cannot come up with something better. p11An idealist and dreamer from the get go, I have never been taken for a realist. Maybe this is why it was easy for me to agree with the main arguments presented in this paradigm shifting analysis of economic organization and the status quo. RB does not stop there but goes on to propose some pragmatic, semi-revolutionary solutions for our ailing world.I especially like his ideas on a universal basic income ( p31 free cash greases the wheels of the whole economy....) and the way he differentiates between and ""stable and meaningful work"" p147 and""bullshit jobs...that even the people doing them admit that they are superfluous"" p163 ""Instead of creating wealth, these jobs mostly just shift it around."" p155The gap between rich and poor is already wider than it was in ancient Rome- an economy based on slave labor. p184Perhaps crises isn't really the right word for our current condition.

He makes cases for specifics such as Universal Basic Income, a fifteen-hour workweek, open borders, and more, but also challenges us to confront our values, most importantly the ridiculously out of proportion worth that we as a society we give to jobs which don't create any value ( investment banks, speculators of all kinds, much of the service industries that don't actually provide any services ) compared to those things that are vital, fulfilling or actually create wealth. The best example he gives is the contrasting strikes of garbage collectors in New York in 1968 which brought that great city to its knees in ten days ( leaving 100, 000 tons of trash on the streets ) and that of bank workers in Ireland two years later, who the country managed without for six months with almost no effect on the nation's economy.Bergman, and his translator, write with clarity and concision and his arguments are based entirely on facts and numbers, but this doesn't mean it lacks passion."

But I found the section on world developments, immigration and open borders the strongest (I particularly liked the citing of theBook of Daniel as the first written record of a test with a control group). Full of fascinating stories and strong ideas, with lots of notes to follow up.

I had heard about universal income before and found it a bizarre idea, but Bregman provides information on several practical experiments that had me rethinking the whole thing. A shorter work week and changing the way we look at, and compensate different kinds of work are other ideas discussed in the book that already resonated with me before. The book seems well researched, with a long list of references that can be looked up by those who want more details, although I found the outcome of some of the studies quite doubtful. The book is packed with information and yet, it is written in a colloquial and interesting way that turns reading it into a real pleasure."
161,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5879607-benjamin,5,"Simple works like this can often be overlooked for many reasons. Firstly, they oversimplify because they’re not an academic text. Secondly, they are embedded in an ideological position that the reader can’t get along with, so it’s dismissed out of hand. Thirdly, the argument isn’t as coherent as it could be (partly because of the first and second points) so closer readers will find flaws within moments and miss some of the more salient points.I’m glad to say that this work doesn’t fall prey to those things. Firstly, while simplified, the ideas presented are relatively straight-forward and so they don’t need to be more complicated for its purpose. The author has written more academic work which can be explored, or he points in the direction of those texts that you should look into. It’s textbook stuff: make a point, show how your point might be wrong, defend your point. Job done.Likewise, there’s no clear ideological baggage here. It’s true that he defends neoliberalism (unashamedly) and has a dig at a current strand of defeatist socialism, but throughout the book we have equal nods given to Marx and Engels, the anarchist anthropologist David Graeber and a host of neoliberals that he doesn’t agree with. His point is not that neoliberalism and capitalism are the only games in town. He’s simply stating that neoliberalism can’t be used as a derogatory word when it can be used to do the same job as anti-capitalist positions (if done well). Finally, the argument is coherent and where he runs into dead ends, there is a clear acknowledgement of those problems. Obviously the biggest issue is not what to do but how to get politicians to do it- but that’s true of any book of philosophy, economics or politics that tries to do something radical.This book is hopeful because it shows us how the major changes we need to eradicate world poverty, produce more equality and produce a better quality of life are actually simple. It also reminds us that with enough push, the impossible can become actual. It’s really odd that his ideas echo so many points made by Zizek, despite their huge differences. Bergman is anti-high theory, anti-ideology and less critical of free markets than Zizek, whereas Zizek is entrenched in theory, admits we cannot avoid ideology and is highly critical of capitalism at every turn. However, both argue similar points: the belief that minor changes can be made to capitalism seems like Utopianism, pie-in-the-sky navel gazing nonsense, but all big ideas seemed this way at some point; ultimately, with the absence of a true change of the entire system, we have to radically change what already exists; the revolution is a revolution of ideas and thinking, not of seizing land and machines; Utopianism is not an end state, but a way of thinking- always with that expanding horizon in the distance; and finally, that the left enjoys defeat and has begun to identify with it too much. It’s nice to see two incredibly opposed individuals finding two ways of making the same points. Read it. This book is vital. Even if you don’t agree totally (from either a pro-capitalist or pro-socialist standpoint) you’ll find something in here to make you radically reassess what you already think."
162,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50270175-frances-maxwell,5,"I LOVED this book! The world seems so depressing at the moment, with the likes of Trump and Brexit and what feels to me like a constant threat of impending doom (maybe that's just my anxiety speaking!) This book reminds you that we are living RIGHT NOW in an incredible utopia compared to where we were in the past. This is the best time to be alive in human history. And what's more, there could be an even brighter future with equality for all and the abolition of poverty across the globe, if only we would dare to dream.I loved the ideas in it, which include universal basic income, a shorter worker week, and open borders, each of which he discusses at length. Open borders, in particular, is seriously radical, but morally his argument is sound - borders are a form of global apartheid! How terrible is it that your chances in life are determined by where you are born. We allow everything else to move freely about the world, but not people.I found it really interesting how major political movements tend only to occur after a crisis (before this happens, politicians will only suggest things that don't stray too far from the status quo), and how neoliberalism, for example, came into fruition after the Arab oil crisis in the 70s thanks to decades of simmering (a group of thinkers had been discussing it at length since the 30s). However after the 2008 crash which proved that that it wasn't infallible, there were no radical alternative ideas brewing (!) so we've stuck with the same flawed model. Thinking up and discussing new ideas is CRITICAL to moving forward.I loved the section on 'underdog' socialism, because it's so true! One of the successes of Trump's campaign is that he knows that people like to be on the 'winning' side and yet the branding of the left is all, 'sigh - welfare is expensive but a moral must' (basically, 'we're morally right but an economic disaster') whereas in fact the ideas the author discusses not only eradicate inequality and poverty but result in astonishing economic success. This is the message the voters need to hear.If you're thinking this is too good to be true, I get that. There was a stage in the book where even I - a total ignoramus - felt the arguments were naively optimistic, along the lines of, 'these ideas are the solution to everything and have no down sides', and I guess I was looking for more of a critical analysis, but towards the end I felt reassured that his work is rooted in extensive research, and that he himself is aware of the dangers of bias (he discusses this, including cognitive dissonance, in later chapters and gives an example of his own).In any case, a vision is a vision, and it should be radical. I loved his. I want to live in that world. And it actually feels feasible! Let's do this, people!Definitely read this book!"

I then found out that Rutger Bregman was also a real writer, and he told off the fuckers at Davos too. So let's have a look, I thought.First, he presents his ideas well, and presents them honestly, and I can certainly agree with all of his prescriptions, which, as a democratic socialist, shouldn't be surprising. My only regret is that his analysis is a bit skin-deep at points. He diagnoses several of the symptoms of late-stage capitalism correctly, and provides cures for those symptoms, but what of the underlying disease? A UBI could be disastrous if applied from a libertarian rather than a socialist perspective, and as for open borders, there's a difference between actual open borders (good idea, but it needs a phase-in) and Koch Brothers-styled open borders (like how a Romanian working in Germany can still legally be paid Romanian wages by a German employer). Simply put, good effort Rutger, but you'll need a bit more depth if you wanna achieve top Marx (sorry, couldn't resist)."

You would think that the eradication of poverty is something people can all agree on, but unfortunately that is not the case. I found it interesting how often the book discussed the US even though the author is not American. Reading this was so pleasant what with its talk of UBI, open borders, 15 hour work weeks, and the eradication of poverty, but then of course I had to go back to the real world and the clusterfuck we call the current political situation (bombs, war, border walls, eradication of human rights, elimination of healthcare, deportations, growing inequality) and I just can't understand why anyone would think this mess is the best we can do."

I don’t think it’s quite rigorous enough to change minds, but there was plenty of eye opening material and I am starting to understand the concept of a universal basic wage."

169,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31449816-zainab,4,"Using a primarily economic analysis, this book imagines a much more equal world – one that seems so near yet so far. Just as it says on the tin, this world is utopic but completely achievable. Rutger Bregman uses statistics and studies to expose the flaws of existing national budgets and priorities. His book is a fairly short read/listen that focuses mainly on the concept of Universal Basic Income (UBI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and “bullshit jobs”, as well as poverty and foreign aid. It also envisions what a future of leisure could look like for society. The text is written in a straightforward way, which is unsurprising as Bregman spends the final chapter critiquing an “aristocratic” left, or “underdog socialism”, which he argues is not accessible to a wider public and not invigorated with enough hope to catch on. I found it to be a useful listen with some compelling and entirely convincing arguments, particularly on tax evasion and open borders.However, for me, the book also felt like a repeat of many podcasts I listened to around the UK General Election of 2019 and a few years prior. UBI as the logical future and GDP as a farce are very familiar ideas. In fact, much of what Bregman imagines was proposed in the Labour Party’s manifesto, ideas which a global pandemic might help bring to reality. In addition, the book still felt quite Euro-centric in the framing of history/ideas, so it’s difficult to imagine, for instance, how a mineral-rich and currently impoverished country would transact within this utopia. The climate crisis, for me, also deserved a much more detailed mention in this imagined future. Rutger Bregman went viral alongside Winnie Byanyima at the Davos Conference of 2019 for confronting the billionaire tax evaders sitting before him. His book, Utopia for Realists, will explain why he knew what he was talking about."
170,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,4,"Let us be unreasonable and impossible, the author exhorts. But his book, short and sweet, is far from either. The idea of basic income fits into the paradigm of a realistic utopia, according to Rutger Bregman, whose penchant for popularizing penmanship and knack for narration keep the book interesting and informative, if not all that original. The book is best understood as an attempt to bring a whole bundle of progressive ideas into the mainstream, borrowing heavily from other classics. But what the book lacks in originality it makes up for in holistic vision.One of the most refreshing parts of the book is that the author does not demonize his political opponents, such as conservatives. And indeed, most of his strident criticisms are directed at his fellow leftists (""underdog socialists"") whom he accuses of wallowing in reactionary pessimism. As someone who is more libertarian economically, I found his criticism of the banking and the financial sectors to be embarrassingly misguided, although not any more so than your average left liberal economist. (He confuses corporatist kleptocracy with free markets.) And his implicit call for more regulation of the labour markets relies on a notion of collectivistic economic planning that confuses ideal theory with the predictable failure of public policy - thus betraying his own allegiance to REALISTIC utopias. Furthermore, Bregman's utopia seems too static and degrowth to really feel alive in the way that realistic utopians must live and grow.But overall I enjoyed his vision. The future belongs to those who can envision alternative possibilities and find the institutional means to bring them account. Universal Basic Income is a way to marry progressive and libertarian politics, and ""Utopia for Realists"" does a good job of showing the kind of vision that it inspires - even if there is still room for more realism in the mix."
171,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20228885-sreejith-puthanpurayil,5,"Humans have been dreaming and designing Utopias for a long time. It has stirred whole communities into action and wars have been fought over it. In this book, the author proposes a Utopia; the idea of a society where every individual is guaranteed a minimum basic income. No strings attached. I'm generally positive about such redistribution schemes, especially in light of the near future (AI, automation etc) but how do we pay for it? The author points out that we already spend an enormous amount in the war on poverty and social assistance programs. Eliminating this bureaucracy and red tape could save us a tremendous amount and make things more efficient at the same time. However, it won't be enough. A better way to think about this is to see it as an investment in humans. When humans can meet their basic needs, they can be more selective about which jobs they will sell their time and bodies to. They can take time off and invest in themselves. In a nutshell, we can eliminate poverty, redistribute wealth, and give people more agency in their lives. Well, what's the evidence that this can actually work? The author points out the example of Dauphin, a Canadian city where a minimum basic income experiment (the no strings attached kind) was tried out for 4 years and resulted in a drastic reduction in poverty and reduced hospitalisation rates. Honestly, I'd like more such experiments but the fact is that they're expensive and the results often take years to become visible. All in all, a perspective changing book."
172,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7599597-tom,3,"The book came out in an interesting time of a paradigm shift in political perspectives. The general population is increasingly disillusioned by the trickle-down economics in the Reagan era, and pushed into the ideal of equality. While the book presented many great statistics, evidences, and insights (compiled from many different sources), it presented a few weak arguments. And through the weak argument is where the author's intellectual elitism wafts out of the writing. The author considers himself to be an arbiter of value, despite being minimally trained in economics. Somehow careers such as financial services that involves studying efficient capital allocation or corporate councils who protect the legal integrity are pointed out as bullshit jobs, all the while artists, philosophers and social study group champions are the true creators of wealth and drivers of economy. I'm not against the idea of wealth redistribution, but discounting the drive and ambition of educated professionals, and forcefully assigning high economic value to liberal disciplines, shows that not only does the author have a very limited understanding of economics, but also the left-wings' resistance of something as basic as free market.

Around the world the mainstream left seems to have run out of steam and become mired in the minutiae of intersectional grievances and the right is either run by rich men for rich men or has been captured by racist lunatics. Bregman gives a list of new (though mostly old) ideas that seem counter-intuitive, but he presents them in a way that also makes them logical, sensible and doable. I recently saw a photo of Rupert Murdoch reading this book while lounging beside a swimming pool - perhaps so that he could work out how to prevent anything in it from happening. For the sake of the rest of us, I hope plenty of politicians are also reading it."

Some of these ideas blew my mind; I'm a newbie when it comes to political theory/economics. It's left me curious and optimistic about the future.

It was pretty obvious that this started out as a book about UBI and the other issues were kind of tacked on, as they weren't as well researched or explained. There was also the long section on the economy and GDP that I didn't really need, because it didn't really help me understand the economy any better (I never will) and it was pretty long.This book was first published in 2014 in the Netherlands (I think), so there are some things that are more optimistic than I would be today. Also, a lot of the book focuses on the US, and it talks about inequality, but barely discusses race at all, which I think was a gross oversight. It's impossible to talk about inequality in the US without at least a cursory mention of the history of race. At one point, it used the US as a positive example for immigration bc of how the country was ""founded"" and all of the progress its made, which is great and all, but the mass immigration to this country wasn't so great for the people who were already here, so it's kind of a bad take, bro.I appreciated the last chapter's acknowledgement of studies that oppose the policies discussed in the book and how differing views can often entrench us further into a belief. I thought it made some interesting points about how change is actually achieved: laying groundwork for a policy and then a crisis activates it by showing that the new system would handle it better. Change can't be made if there's no alternative offered before the crisis, which is what happened in 2008. I think that mindset is especially relevant during present day's actual crisis and just hoping that we've laid some kind of groundwork for the change.Notes and Quotes:- ""you can't pull yourself up by your bootstraps if you have no boots."" -Joseph Hanlon- 80% of Americans were pro-UBI in the 60s- Henry Ford giving all his employees big raises in 1914: aww, sweet. him doing it bc then they'd be able to afford his cars: figures- “the inability to imagine a world in which things are different is evidence only of a poor imagination, not the impossibility of change”- ""... what is the value of free speech when we no longer have anything worthwhile to say? what's the point of freedom of association when we no longer feel any sense of affiliation?"""

Eləcə də biznes mütəxəssislərin böyük əksəriyyəti vəzifələrinin bir o qədər də əhəmiyyətli olmadığını düşünür. Biz acığımız gələn iş yerlərində bütün günü işlədikdən sonra bizə lazım olmayan şeyləri almağa başlayırıq. ""Realistlər üçün utopiya""da holland tarixçi və jurnalist Rutqer Breqman, bunların heç də belə olmamalı olduğunu qeyd edir. Beynəlminəllik və praqmatizm manifesti kimi Breqmanın kitabı əsas 3 ideya ətrafında formalaşıb: 15 saatlıq iş həftəsi, ""universal minimal gəlir"" və sərhədlərin olmadığı dünya. Bu iddialara dəstək məqsədi ilə kitabda ötən əsrin 70-ci illərində icra edilən ""Mincome"" təcrübəsi, evsizlərə verilən qarşılıqsız pul təcrübələri və müxtəlif çoxsayılı statistik faktlar yer alıb. Bəlkə də bu iddialar heç də qeyri-real deyil. Nəinki qeyri-real, cəsarətli olsaq, bəlkə də zəruridir deyə bilərik, çünki daha az saatlı iş həftəsi daha az iş xətası, ətraf-mühitə vurulan zərər, daha az stress, qəza və iqtisadi qeyri-bərabərlikdir. Breqman vurğulayır ki, dəyişiklik ideyalarla başlayır. Nə vaxtsa bizim bu günümüz keçmişdə yaşayan insanların utopiyası idi. Ona görə də ifrat istehsal və istehlak kimi problemlərin öhdəsindən gəlmək üçün gərək ilk növbədə qurduğumuz sistemlərə olan yanaşmamızı dəyişək. ""Realistlər üçün utopiya"" kitabı bizə cari iqtisadiyyatların qeyri-reallığını, ideal və ya utopik hesab edilən iqtisadi sistemlərin isə reallığını çox möhtəşəm və axıcı dil ilə izah edir. Məncə, kitabı oxuduqdan sonra heç kim bir daha düşündüyü ənənəvi fikirlərini və ya doqmaları yada salmayacaq. Kitabı axtarıb-tapıb oxumağıma əsas səbəb Rutqer Breqmanın öz kitabı haqqında The Economist-ə verdiyi müsahibəni dinləməyim olmuşdu (müsahibəni dinləmək üçün keçid: http://bit.ly/Ukutopia_Bregman). Bir iqtisadçı kimi mənə maraqlı gəlmişdi ki, görəsən yuxarı abzasda qeyd edilən məqamlar haqqında özünə belə inamla və güvənlə danışan şəxs nə dərəcədə ciddidir və nə dərəcədə real və yaxşı bilgilərin toplandığı kitab yaza bilib. Doqmalarımızı qıran ideyalar həmişə cəlbedici olur. Qısa müddət ərzində kitabı elektron olaraq tapdım və 1 ay ərzində yavaş-yavaş oxudum. Sonunda isə əsl düşüncə yenilənməsi yaşadım. ""Realistlər üçün utopiya"" kitabını sadəcə bəyənmək deyil, həm də onun faktuallığını nəzərə alıb qiymətləndirmək lazımdır. Son dövrlərin aktual məsələlərinə toxunan, müəyyən həll yolları göstərən və ən əsası fərziyələrlə deyil, real analitik yöntəmlərlə izahat aparan kitabı oxumağıma çox şad oldum. Sitat: ""Bəşəriyyətin möhtəşəm ölçü daşları olan utopiyalarla əlaqədar hər zaman şübhələr olub. Tanınmış sosioloq Albert Hirşmana görə, utopiyalar 3 səviyyədə hücuma məruz qalıblar: axırsızlıq (bu mümkün deyil), təhlükə (risklər çox böyükdür) və qüsurluluq (bu distopiyaya səbəb olacaq degenerasiyadır), amma Hirşman həm də yazır ki, necə ki utopiyalar gerçəkləşir, adi bir şey kimi qəbul olunmağa başlanılır"" (Breqman, Realistlər üçün utopiya, 2016) Kitab çox güclü kontrastlar üzərində qurulub. Bu o deməkdir ki, mövzular keçmiş dövrün gələcəyə olan yanaşmalarından hərəkətə gələrək, bu günümüzü də öz növbəsində hansısa gələcək zamanın keçmişi kimi qəbul edib, müxtəlif iqtisadi göstəriciləri ortaq məxrəcə gətirməyə çalışır. Məsələn, kitab ilk səhifələrində aydınlaşdırır ki, hələ Keynes 20-ci əsrin ilk rübündə daha az saata malik iş həftəsini iqtisadi cəhətdən məntiqli və düzgün hesab edirdi. Bundan əlavə, kasıb ölkələrin cəmiyyətlərin niyə görə kasıb olduqları ilə əlaqədar bir çox maraqlı təcrübə və məlumatlara əsasən səbəblər üzərində dayanılır. Qeyd edilir ki, kasıb ölkələr ona görə kasıbdır ki, onlarda sadəcə oalraq yetərincə nağd pul ehtiyatları yoxdur. Halbuki, həm media, həm də populist siyasətçilər kasıb cəmiyyətləri demokratiyanın olmamasında, insanların savadsızlığında və ya digər hansısa ictimai göstəricilərdə olduğunu deyirlər. Təbii ki, onların müəyyən əhəmiyyəti var, amma aparılan real təcrübələr və sahə araşdırmaları sübut edib ki, isanlara ilkin investisiyanı təmin edəndə, özləri həmin investisiyanı artırmağın yollarını axtarıb-tapırlar. Sitat: ""19-cu əsrdə bərabərsizlik sosial sinif məsələsi ilə əlaqədar idi. Bu günlərdə isə bu məkan ilə əlaqədardır. ""Bütün ölkələrin proletarları birləşin!"" uzun müddət müxtəlif yerlərin kasıb insanlarının əzabkeşliyini birləşdirən ideya olub. Bu gün isə, Dünya Bankının aparıcı iqtisadçısı Branko Milanoviç qeyd edir ki, ""Proletariat həmrəyliyi artıq ölüb, çünki artıq qlobal proletariat deyə bir şey qalmayıb.""""(Breqman, Realistlər üçün utopiya, 2016) İnsan özü özlüyündə çox qəribə canlıdır, çünki o xəyal edə bilir. Kitabın ilk səhifələrindən müəllif göstərir ki, bütün bu fiosoflar, yazıçılar və alimlər utopiyaların vasitəsi ilə bəşəriyyətin inkişafa və firavanlığa nail ola biləcəyini qeyd edirmişlər. Onlardan bəziləri isə artıq reallaşıb, bəziləri reallşmaq üzərədir, digərlərinin reallaşması üçün isə az qalıb. Utopiya anlayışının özü əslində inkişaflar üçün mühüm zəmindir. İnsan təxəyyülündə özünə varlıq qazanan istənilən ideya, hətta utopiyalar belə nə vaxtsa gerçəkləşəcəklər, sadəcə o istiqamətdə kiçik addımlar irəliləmək yetərlidir. Sitat: ""Abstrakt ideallardan fərqli olaraq, çertyojlar nifaqa tolerantlıq göstərməyən dəyişməz qayda-qanunlardan ibarət olurlar. İtalyan şair Tomasso Kampanellanın ""Günəşin şəhəri (1602)"" çox yaxşı nümunə təklif edir. Bu utopiyada və ya distopiyada, fərdi mülkiyyət ciddi olaraq qadağan olunub, hamı bir-birini sevməyə məcbur edilib və dava-dalaş ölümlə cəzalandırılır. Özəl həyat, intim məqamlar da daxil olmaqla dövlət tərəfindən idarə olunur. Məsələn, ağıllı insanlar ancaq axmaq insanlarla yatağa girə bilər, kök insanlar isə arıqlarla.

177,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498454-h-kon-gunnarsson,5,"This is the second book I read about universal basic income, the first one was by Andrew Yang. Both of these books explain the idea very well, but they have different strengths just the same. I think Yang managed to show more clearly the urgency for this system at this point in time as we are entering into the forth industrial revolution, while Bergman explains the history, and the science behind this idea better.It is a radical idea, and I’m not sure if I would have taken it seriously a few years ago. In fact, I don’t think I would have given it much of a thought until I started to read up on the pending industrial revolution. That is what made it realistic for me. There just doesn’t seem to be a viable path into that new reality with out some version of universal basic income. But what surprised me about the history Bergman presents is that it is actually a much older idea, and it had some really surprising campaigner for it. The fact that Richard Nixon is the American president that has got closest to getting that kind of system into action was one of those surprises. From listening to his party these days one would hardly expect that, but he did it because it seemed, even then, to make good financial sense. This idea isn’t just a shot in the dark, there is a lot of research behind it. So when people say it will not work because people are so lazy they will never do anything if they get free money, they need to show evidence for that opinion. What this book shows is evidence from other research that point in the other direction. All in all, I think this is an interesting book, and the case for universal basic income is very well argued here."
178,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37925908-psychonout,4,"Meanwhile the welfare state has increasingly shifted its focus from the causes of our discontent to the symptoms. We go to a doctor when we're sick, a therapist when we're sad, a dietitian when we're overweight, prison when we're convicted and a job coach when we're out of work. All these services cost vast sums of money, but with little to show for it. In the US, where the cost of healthcare is highest on the planet, the life expectancy for many is actually going down. All the while the market and commercial interests enjoy a free reign. The food industry supplies us with cheap garbage loaded with salt, sugar and fat, putting us on a fast track to the doctor and dietitian. Advancing technologies are laying waste to ever-more jobs sending us back again to the job coach and the ad industry encourages us to spend money we don't have on junk we don't need in order to impress people we can't stand.Then we can go and cry on our therapist's shoulder.That's the dystopia we're living in today."

Bregman certainly has thought-provoking ideas to share and makes you question, or at least wonder about how the world could be a different, better place. The book reads well, keeps you interested, and avoids being polarizing by building his arguments on ethical virtues. Instead he uses logical arguments and often refers research in favor of his viewpoints. The book obviously doesn't really tell you how to go about implementing his ideas; what could go wrong and neither talks about the not-so positive sides; maybe not for realists after all!"

183,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,4,"A book that definitely needs to be read and discussed! Imagine a pandemic hitting states who's citizens receive an universal basic income, securing their livelihood!In ""Utopia for Realists"" Rutger Bregman argues for his three visions for the future: a 15-hour working week, a world without borders and a universal basic income for everyone. Unfortunately the introduction of this book is really weak with enumerating inventions and conditions of our present to state under which high standards we would be living, desperately lacking reflection. He talks for example about medical technology enabling patients with spinal cord injuries to walk again but completely fails to mention, that health insurance companies refuse to provide them to patients due to high costs, that people are getting older due to medical care, but under conditions that are ethically questionable to say the least, or that the number of people committing suicide are three times as high as deaths from vehicle accidents. He does recognize depression though, which according to him is caused by our inability to imagine anything better than what we already have. I highly contradict that. Thankfully he then turns around and starts to recognize, that the empowerment of the individual doesn't just lead to more freedom but a constant feeling of failure when not being able to live up to the expectations.After this disappointing introduction he turns to the universal income for everyone where it get‘s interesting. He lingers between anecdote, academic research and statistics and highlights examples of how these policies have already been partially implemented in the past. For example how a universal basic income was almost introduced in the United States under Nixon, or how a Canadian basic annual income program barely dented the enthusiasm for work, but let to a drop in crime, truancy, hospital attendance, domestic violence and poverty. I believe that this topic needs to be on our politics agendas! I agree that the costs that we invest in our social system aren‘t just completely ineffective but also contra-productive. Because of our current pandemic we can‘t close our eyes to these options anymore and which consequences it would have if we already would have considered it!In the second part of the books he introduces his vision for a 15 hour work week in 2030, because our economy would be that wealthy, that no more was required. Even though he dedicates an entire chapter to it, he somehow fails to connect it to the basic income model. Also it completely ignores the variety of work fields, which seems ironic to me because he deprecates the work fields the biggest part of our society works in, as being unproductive, replaceable and unable to provide any value to society. Such as lawyer, bankers,economists,companies,media...vs. doctors, fire fighter, farmers. Those who would actually produce. But particularly in those areas, work times are in important factor of the ability to produce in the first place and practice is gained by long periods of training. While the concept wouldn't apply to self employers to begin with, those who would be able to instantly instate the concept are those the author diminishes.He then argues for a world without borders, which probably shows the biggest lack of reflection. More people migrating freely would require more energy, leading to more jobs, which is why they would start to produce more and ultimately invest more money back into the economy. But about which jobs are were talking about here? Particularly the jobs the author valued above as the only ones of worth require decades of education in difficult fields. Not only do they require a high level of adaption to our language to say the least, the areas themselves are also not able to adapt to sudden changes in requirements as well. Our current situation teaches us what happens, if there are suddenly more patients than ventilators available to us, but the same goes for housing, food production etc. Open borders always would be influences by sudden movements caused by political actions, natural catastrophes and poverty, it wouldn't just be a gradual floating state. And just as important: What about culture differences? What about religious believes that collide? What about language barriers? What about geographical space limitations? What about different legal systems? What about border controls in order to provide safety for let‘s say outbreaking viruses or prosecution? The author really couldn't convince me of this idea.A very thought provoking book. I obviously don‘t agree with a big part of what the author says but these topics need to be discussed. Particularly the basic income.PS: For me stars are a measurement of impact rather than liking. A five star book isn‘t necessarily one I entirely agree with, but can also mean that it provoked me to think intensely and forced me to form strong opinions, which can‘t even be measured in stars and is one of the main purposes I read books to begin with."
184,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47154315-ian,3,"This is a well-written, well-articulated treatise on the Utopian ideals of a shorter work week, a Universal Basic Income, and other rights for working class people.Unfortunately, although the author wrote well and supported the ideas with a wealth of statistics, there isn't really much new here. Social progressives have held these ideals for years--as Bregman himself demonstrates in his historical references to earlier experiments for the UBI--but society never seems to get any closer to realizing them. I had hoped the author would review these concepts and then explain in detail how to go about attaining them in practice, given that governments continually see overwhelming data of their merit but consistently fail to act.Bregman does briefly look at this stumbling-block near the end of the book in the chapter of How Ideas Change the World. As he states,The question is not CAN new ideas defeat old ones; the question is HOW.Other than reminding us that crises can often drive larger changes than small tentative, rational steps, Bregman disappointing has little to offer. This is a shame, especially given the current world crisis with Covid, where there do seem to be some current openings to such ideas. But without some strong leaders pointing the way, we instead seem destined to return to a (perhaps slightly newer) normal that may prove to be negligibly different than the recent status quo. Sadly, it seems built into human nature to be unable to change our minds and behaviours, even when the best evidence is staring us directly in the face. I deeply wish Bregman had a better answer and could have prescribed some more proactive steps forward.That said, the book is an important read, especially for those unfamiliar with the progressive Utopian concepts, such as a Universal Basic Income that historically has good hard data supporting its implementation. It is sad that Bregman somewhat infers in his own text that those who need to read and absorb the information will never do so."

No, the real crises is we cannot come up with something better. p11An idealist and dreamer from the get go, I have never been taken for a realist. Maybe this is why it was easy for me to agree with the main arguments presented in this paradigm shifting analysis of economic organization and the status quo. RB does not stop there but goes on to propose some pragmatic, semi-revolutionary solutions for our ailing world.I especially like his ideas on a universal basic income ( p31 free cash greases the wheels of the whole economy....) and the way he differentiates between and ""stable and meaningful work"" p147 and""bullshit jobs...that even the people doing them admit that they are superfluous"" p163 ""Instead of creating wealth, these jobs mostly just shift it around."" p155The gap between rich and poor is already wider than it was in ancient Rome- an economy based on slave labor. p184Perhaps crises isn't really the right word for our current condition. It's like we're in a deep coma, we'd rather re calibrate reality than amend our world viewp243RB may not go far enough for me, but the 4 stars is for putting these issues on the table.If we want to change the world, we need to be unrealistic, unreasonable, and impossible. p263"

He makes cases for specifics such as Universal Basic Income, a fifteen-hour workweek, open borders, and more, but also challenges us to confront our values, most importantly the ridiculously out of proportion worth that we as a society we give to jobs which don't create any value ( investment banks, speculators of all kinds, much of the service industries that don't actually provide any services ) compared to those things that are vital, fulfilling or actually create wealth. The best example he gives is the contrasting strikes of garbage collectors in New York in 1968 which brought that great city to its knees in ten days ( leaving 100, 000 tons of trash on the streets ) and that of bank workers in Ireland two years later, who the country managed without for six months with almost no effect on the nation's economy.Bergman, and his translator, write with clarity and concision and his arguments are based entirely on facts and numbers, but this doesn't mean it lacks passion."

But I found the section on world developments, immigration and open borders the strongest (I particularly liked the citing of theBook of Daniel as the first written record of a test with a control group). Full of fascinating stories and strong ideas, with lots of notes to follow up. Also very prescient that he calls current socialists ""dull as a doorknob with no story to tell"" which is partly how Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump. "

I had heard about universal income before and found it a bizarre idea, but Bregman provides information on several practical experiments that had me rethinking the whole thing. A shorter work week and changing the way we look at, and compensate different kinds of work are other ideas discussed in the book that already resonated with me before. The book seems well researched, with a long list of references that can be looked up by those who want more details, although I found the outcome of some of the studies quite doubtful. The book is packed with information and yet, it is written in a colloquial and interesting way that turns reading it into a real pleasure."
191,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5879607-benjamin,5,"Simple works like this can often be overlooked for many reasons. Firstly, they oversimplify because they’re not an academic text. Secondly, they are embedded in an ideological position that the reader can’t get along with, so it’s dismissed out of hand. Thirdly, the argument isn’t as coherent as it could be (partly because of the first and second points) so closer readers will find flaws within moments and miss some of the more salient points.I’m glad to say that this work doesn’t fall prey to those things. Firstly, while simplified, the ideas presented are relatively straight-forward and so they don’t need to be more complicated for its purpose. The author has written more academic work which can be explored, or he points in the direction of those texts that you should look into. It’s textbook stuff: make a point, show how your point might be wrong, defend your point. Job done.Likewise, there’s no clear ideological baggage here. It’s true that he defends neoliberalism (unashamedly) and has a dig at a current strand of defeatist socialism, but throughout the book we have equal nods given to Marx and Engels, the anarchist anthropologist David Graeber and a host of neoliberals that he doesn’t agree with. His point is not that neoliberalism and capitalism are the only games in town. He’s simply stating that neoliberalism can’t be used as a derogatory word when it can be used to do the same job as anti-capitalist positions (if done well). Finally, the argument is coherent and where he runs into dead ends, there is a clear acknowledgement of those problems. Obviously the biggest issue is not what to do but how to get politicians to do it- but that’s true of any book of philosophy, economics or politics that tries to do something radical.This book is hopeful because it shows us how the major changes we need to eradicate world poverty, produce more equality and produce a better quality of life are actually simple. It also reminds us that with enough push, the impossible can become actual. It’s really odd that his ideas echo so many points made by Zizek, despite their huge differences. Bergman is anti-high theory, anti-ideology and less critical of free markets than Zizek, whereas Zizek is entrenched in theory, admits we cannot avoid ideology and is highly critical of capitalism at every turn. However, both argue similar points: the belief that minor changes can be made to capitalism seems like Utopianism, pie-in-the-sky navel gazing nonsense, but all big ideas seemed this way at some point; ultimately, with the absence of a true change of the entire system, we have to radically change what already exists; the revolution is a revolution of ideas and thinking, not of seizing land and machines; Utopianism is not an end state, but a way of thinking- always with that expanding horizon in the distance; and finally, that the left enjoys defeat and has begun to identify with it too much. It’s nice to see two incredibly opposed individuals finding two ways of making the same points. Read it. This book is vital. Even if you don’t agree totally (from either a pro-capitalist or pro-socialist standpoint) you’ll find something in here to make you radically reassess what you already think."
192,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50270175-frances-maxwell,5,"I LOVED this book! The world seems so depressing at the moment, with the likes of Trump and Brexit and what feels to me like a constant threat of impending doom (maybe that's just my anxiety speaking!) This book reminds you that we are living RIGHT NOW in an incredible utopia compared to where we were in the past. This is the best time to be alive in human history. And what's more, there could be an even brighter future with equality for all and the abolition of poverty across the globe, if only we would dare to dream.I loved the ideas in it, which include universal basic income, a shorter worker week, and open borders, each of which he discusses at length. Open borders, in particular, is seriously radical, but morally his argument is sound - borders are a form of global apartheid! How terrible is it that your chances in life are determined by where you are born. We allow everything else to move freely about the world, but not people.I found it really interesting how major political movements tend only to occur after a crisis (before this happens, politicians will only suggest things that don't stray too far from the status quo), and how neoliberalism, for example, came into fruition after the Arab oil crisis in the 70s thanks to decades of simmering (a group of thinkers had been discussing it at length since the 30s). However after the 2008 crash which proved that that it wasn't infallible, there were no radical alternative ideas brewing (!) so we've stuck with the same flawed model. Thinking up and discussing new ideas is CRITICAL to moving forward.I loved the section on 'underdog' socialism, because it's so true! One of the successes of Trump's campaign is that he knows that people like to be on the 'winning' side and yet the branding of the left is all, 'sigh - welfare is expensive but a moral must' (basically, 'we're morally right but an economic disaster') whereas in fact the ideas the author discusses not only eradicate inequality and poverty but result in astonishing economic success. This is the message the voters need to hear.If you're thinking this is too good to be true, I get that. There was a stage in the book where even I - a total ignoramus - felt the arguments were naively optimistic, along the lines of, 'these ideas are the solution to everything and have no down sides', and I guess I was looking for more of a critical analysis, but towards the end I felt reassured that his work is rooted in extensive research, and that he himself is aware of the dangers of bias (he discusses this, including cognitive dissonance, in later chapters and gives an example of his own).In any case, a vision is a vision, and it should be radical. I loved his. I want to live in that world. And it actually feels feasible! Let's do this, people!Definitely read this book!"
193,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/442654-andrew,0,"Like many/most people, I first became aware of Rutger Bregman based on the fire he spit at Tucker Carlson, which was amusing not because it had any intrinsic value -- we live in a world that favors bitchslaps like that over long-form argument far too much -- but simply because it was funny and witty. I then found out that Rutger Bregman was also a real writer, and he told off the fuckers at Davos too. So let's have a look, I thought.First, he presents his ideas well, and presents them honestly, and I can certainly agree with all of his prescriptions, which, as a democratic socialist, shouldn't be surprising. My only regret is that his analysis is a bit skin-deep at points. He diagnoses several of the symptoms of late-stage capitalism correctly, and provides cures for those symptoms, but what of the underlying disease? A UBI could be disastrous if applied from a libertarian rather than a socialist perspective, and as for open borders, there's a difference between actual open borders (good idea, but it needs a phase-in) and Koch Brothers-styled open borders (like how a Romanian working in Germany can still legally be paid Romanian wages by a German employer). Simply put, good effort Rutger, but you'll need a bit more depth if you wanna achieve top Marx (sorry, couldn't resist)."

You would think that the eradication of poverty is something people can all agree on, but unfortunately that is not the case. I found it interesting how often the book discussed the US even though the author is not American. Reading this was so pleasant what with its talk of UBI, open borders, 15 hour work weeks, and the eradication of poverty, but then of course I had to go back to the real world and the clusterfuck we call the current political situation (bombs, war, border walls, eradication of human rights, elimination of healthcare, deportations, growing inequality) and I just can't understand why anyone would think this mess is the best we can do."

199,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31449816-zainab,4,"Using a primarily economic analysis, this book imagines a much more equal world – one that seems so near yet so far. Just as it says on the tin, this world is utopic but completely achievable. Rutger Bregman uses statistics and studies to expose the flaws of existing national budgets and priorities. His book is a fairly short read/listen that focuses mainly on the concept of Universal Basic Income (UBI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and “bullshit jobs”, as well as poverty and foreign aid. It also envisions what a future of leisure could look like for society. The text is written in a straightforward way, which is unsurprising as Bregman spends the final chapter critiquing an “aristocratic” left, or “underdog socialism”, which he argues is not accessible to a wider public and not invigorated with enough hope to catch on. I found it to be a useful listen with some compelling and entirely convincing arguments, particularly on tax evasion and open borders.However, for me, the book also felt like a repeat of many podcasts I listened to around the UK General Election of 2019 and a few years prior. UBI as the logical future and GDP as a farce are very familiar ideas. In fact, much of what Bregman imagines was proposed in the Labour Party’s manifesto, ideas which a global pandemic might help bring to reality. In addition, the book still felt quite Euro-centric in the framing of history/ideas, so it’s difficult to imagine, for instance, how a mineral-rich and currently impoverished country would transact within this utopia. The climate crisis, for me, also deserved a much more detailed mention in this imagined future. Rutger Bregman went viral alongside Winnie Byanyima at the Davos Conference of 2019 for confronting the billionaire tax evaders sitting before him. His book, Utopia for Realists, will explain why he knew what he was talking about."
200,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,4,"Let us be unreasonable and impossible, the author exhorts. But his book, short and sweet, is far from either. The idea of basic income fits into the paradigm of a realistic utopia, according to Rutger Bregman, whose penchant for popularizing penmanship and knack for narration keep the book interesting and informative, if not all that original. The book is best understood as an attempt to bring a whole bundle of progressive ideas into the mainstream, borrowing heavily from other classics. But what the book lacks in originality it makes up for in holistic vision.One of the most refreshing parts of the book is that the author does not demonize his political opponents, such as conservatives. And indeed, most of his strident criticisms are directed at his fellow leftists (""underdog socialists"") whom he accuses of wallowing in reactionary pessimism. As someone who is more libertarian economically, I found his criticism of the banking and the financial sectors to be embarrassingly misguided, although not any more so than your average left liberal economist. (He confuses corporatist kleptocracy with free markets.) And his implicit call for more regulation of the labour markets relies on a notion of collectivistic economic planning that confuses ideal theory with the predictable failure of public policy - thus betraying his own allegiance to REALISTIC utopias. Furthermore, Bregman's utopia seems too static and degrowth to really feel alive in the way that realistic utopians must live and grow.But overall I enjoyed his vision. The future belongs to those who can envision alternative possibilities and find the institutional means to bring them account. Universal Basic Income is a way to marry progressive and libertarian politics, and ""Utopia for Realists"" does a good job of showing the kind of vision that it inspires - even if there is still room for more realism in the mix."
201,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20228885-sreejith-puthanpurayil,5,"Humans have been dreaming and designing Utopias for a long time. It has stirred whole communities into action and wars have been fought over it. In this book, the author proposes a Utopia; the idea of a society where every individual is guaranteed a minimum basic income. No strings attached. I'm generally positive about such redistribution schemes, especially in light of the near future (AI, automation etc) but how do we pay for it? The author points out that we already spend an enormous amount in the war on poverty and social assistance programs. Eliminating this bureaucracy and red tape could save us a tremendous amount and make things more efficient at the same time. However, it won't be enough. A better way to think about this is to see it as an investment in humans. When humans can meet their basic needs, they can be more selective about which jobs they will sell their time and bodies to. They can take time off and invest in themselves. In a nutshell, we can eliminate poverty, redistribute wealth, and give people more agency in their lives. Well, what's the evidence that this can actually work? The author points out the example of Dauphin, a Canadian city where a minimum basic income experiment (the no strings attached kind) was tried out for 4 years and resulted in a drastic reduction in poverty and reduced hospitalisation rates. Honestly, I'd like more such experiments but the fact is that they're expensive and the results often take years to become visible. All in all, a perspective changing book."
202,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7599597-tom,3,"The book came out in an interesting time of a paradigm shift in political perspectives. The general population is increasingly disillusioned by the trickle-down economics in the Reagan era, and pushed into the ideal of equality. While the book presented many great statistics, evidences, and insights (compiled from many different sources), it presented a few weak arguments. And through the weak argument is where the author's intellectual elitism wafts out of the writing. The author considers himself to be an arbiter of value, despite being minimally trained in economics. Somehow careers such as financial services that involves studying efficient capital allocation or corporate councils who protect the legal integrity are pointed out as bullshit jobs, all the while artists, philosophers and social study group champions are the true creators of wealth and drivers of economy. I'm not against the idea of wealth redistribution, but discounting the drive and ambition of educated professionals, and forcefully assigning high economic value to liberal disciplines, shows that not only does the author have a very limited understanding of economics, but also the left-wings' resistance of something as basic as free market.

Around the world the mainstream left seems to have run out of steam and become mired in the minutiae of intersectional grievances and the right is either run by rich men for rich men or has been captured by racist lunatics. Bregman gives a list of new (though mostly old) ideas that seem counter-intuitive, but he presents them in a way that also makes them logical, sensible and doable. I recently saw a photo of Rupert Murdoch reading this book while lounging beside a swimming pool - perhaps so that he could work out how to prevent anything in it from happening.

It was pretty obvious that this started out as a book about UBI and the other issues were kind of tacked on, as they weren't as well researched or explained. There was also the long section on the economy and GDP that I didn't really need, because it didn't really help me understand the economy any better (I never will) and it was pretty long.This book was first published in 2014 in the Netherlands (I think), so there are some things that are more optimistic than I would be today. Also, a lot of the book focuses on the US, and it talks about inequality, but barely discusses race at all, which I think was a gross oversight. It's impossible to talk about inequality in the US without at least a cursory mention of the history of race. At one point, it used the US as a positive example for immigration bc of how the country was ""founded"" and all of the progress its made, which is great and all, but the mass immigration to this country wasn't so great for the people who were already here, so it's kind of a bad take, bro.I appreciated the last chapter's acknowledgement of studies that oppose the policies discussed in the book and how differing views can often entrench us further into a belief. I thought it made some interesting points about how change is actually achieved: laying groundwork for a policy and then a crisis activates it by showing that the new system would handle it better. Change can't be made if there's no alternative offered before the crisis, which is what happened in 2008. I think that mindset is especially relevant during present day's actual crisis and just hoping that we've laid some kind of groundwork for the change.Notes and Quotes:- ""you can't pull yourself up by your bootstraps if you have no boots."" -Joseph Hanlon- 80% of Americans were pro-UBI in the 60s- Henry Ford giving all his employees big raises in 1914: aww, sweet. him doing it bc then they'd be able to afford his cars: figures- “the inability to imagine a world in which things are different is evidence only of a poor imagination, not the impossibility of change”- ""... what is the value of free speech when we no longer have anything worthwhile to say? what's the point of freedom of association when we no longer feel any sense of affiliation?"""

Eləcə də biznes mütəxəssislərin böyük əksəriyyəti vəzifələrinin bir o qədər də əhəmiyyətli olmadığını düşünür. Biz acığımız gələn iş yerlərində bütün günü işlədikdən sonra bizə lazım olmayan şeyləri almağa başlayırıq. ""Realistlər üçün utopiya""da holland tarixçi və jurnalist Rutqer Breqman, bunların heç də belə olmamalı olduğunu qeyd edir. Beynəlminəllik və praqmatizm manifesti kimi Breqmanın kitabı əsas 3 ideya ətrafında formalaşıb: 15 saatlıq iş həftəsi, ""universal minimal gəlir"" və sərhədlərin olmadığı dünya. Bu iddialara dəstək məqsədi ilə kitabda ötən əsrin 70-ci illərində icra edilən ""Mincome"" təcrübəsi, evsizlərə verilən qarşılıqsız pul təcrübələri və müxtəlif çoxsayılı statistik faktlar yer alıb. Bəlkə də bu iddialar heç də qeyri-real deyil. Nəinki qeyri-real, cəsarətli olsaq, bəlkə də zəruridir deyə bilərik, çünki daha az saatlı iş həftəsi daha az iş xətası, ətraf-mühitə vurulan zərər, daha az stress, qəza və iqtisadi qeyri-bərabərlikdir. Breqman vurğulayır ki, dəyişiklik ideyalarla başlayır. Nə vaxtsa bizim bu günümüz keçmişdə yaşayan insanların utopiyası idi. Ona görə də ifrat istehsal və istehlak kimi problemlərin öhdəsindən gəlmək üçün gərək ilk növbədə qurduğumuz sistemlərə olan yanaşmamızı dəyişək. ""Realistlər üçün utopiya"" kitabı bizə cari iqtisadiyyatların qeyri-reallığını, ideal və ya utopik hesab edilən iqtisadi sistemlərin isə reallığını çox möhtəşəm və axıcı dil ilə izah edir. Məncə, kitabı oxuduqdan sonra heç kim bir daha düşündüyü ənənəvi fikirlərini və ya doqmaları yada salmayacaq. Kitabı axtarıb-tapıb oxumağıma əsas səbəb Rutqer Breqmanın öz kitabı haqqında The Economist-ə verdiyi müsahibəni dinləməyim olmuşdu (müsahibəni dinləmək üçün keçid: http://bit.ly/Ukutopia_Bregman). Bir iqtisadçı kimi mənə maraqlı gəlmişdi ki, görəsən yuxarı abzasda qeyd edilən məqamlar haqqında özünə belə inamla və güvənlə danışan şəxs nə dərəcədə ciddidir və nə dərəcədə real və yaxşı bilgilərin toplandığı kitab yaza bilib. Doqmalarımızı qıran ideyalar həmişə cəlbedici olur. Qısa müddət ərzində kitabı elektron olaraq tapdım və 1 ay ərzində yavaş-yavaş oxudum. Sonunda isə əsl düşüncə yenilənməsi yaşadım. ""Realistlər üçün utopiya"" kitabını sadəcə bəyənmək deyil, həm də onun faktuallığını nəzərə alıb qiymətləndirmək lazımdır. Son dövrlərin aktual məsələlərinə toxunan, müəyyən həll yolları göstərən və ən əsası fərziyələrlə deyil, real analitik yöntəmlərlə izahat aparan kitabı oxumağıma çox şad oldum. Sitat: ""Bəşəriyyətin möhtəşəm ölçü daşları olan utopiyalarla əlaqədar hər zaman şübhələr olub. Tanınmış sosioloq Albert Hirşmana görə, utopiyalar 3 səviyyədə hücuma məruz qalıblar: axırsızlıq (bu mümkün deyil), təhlükə (risklər çox böyükdür) və qüsurluluq (bu distopiyaya səbəb olacaq degenerasiyadır), amma Hirşman həm də yazır ki, necə ki utopiyalar gerçəkləşir, adi bir şey kimi qəbul olunmağa başlanılır"" (Breqman, Realistlər üçün utopiya, 2016) Kitab çox güclü kontrastlar üzərində qurulub. Bu o deməkdir ki, mövzular keçmiş dövrün gələcəyə olan yanaşmalarından hərəkətə gələrək, bu günümüzü də öz növbəsində hansısa gələcək zamanın keçmişi kimi qəbul edib, müxtəlif iqtisadi göstəriciləri ortaq məxrəcə gətirməyə çalışır. Məsələn, kitab ilk səhifələrində aydınlaşdırır ki, hələ Keynes 20-ci əsrin ilk rübündə daha az saata malik iş həftəsini iqtisadi cəhətdən məntiqli və düzgün hesab edirdi. Bundan əlavə, kasıb ölkələrin cəmiyyətlərin niyə görə kasıb olduqları ilə əlaqədar bir çox maraqlı təcrübə və məlumatlara əsasən səbəblər üzərində dayanılır. Qeyd edilir ki, kasıb ölkələr ona görə kasıbdır ki, onlarda sadəcə oalraq yetərincə nağd pul ehtiyatları yoxdur. Halbuki, həm media, həm də populist siyasətçilər kasıb cəmiyyətləri demokratiyanın olmamasında, insanların savadsızlığında və ya digər hansısa ictimai göstəricilərdə olduğunu deyirlər. Təbii ki, onların müəyyən əhəmiyyəti var, amma aparılan real təcrübələr və sahə araşdırmaları sübut edib ki, isanlara ilkin investisiyanı təmin edəndə, özləri həmin investisiyanı artırmağın yollarını axtarıb-tapırlar.

207,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498454-h-kon-gunnarsson,5,"This is the second book I read about universal basic income, the first one was by Andrew Yang. Both of these books explain the idea very well, but they have different strengths just the same. I think Yang managed to show more clearly the urgency for this system at this point in time as we are entering into the forth industrial revolution, while Bergman explains the history, and the science behind this idea better.It is a radical idea, and I’m not sure if I would have taken it seriously a few years ago. In fact, I don’t think I would have given it much of a thought until I started to read up on the pending industrial revolution. That is what made it realistic for me. There just doesn’t seem to be a viable path into that new reality with out some version of universal basic income. But what surprised me about the history Bergman presents is that it is actually a much older idea, and it had some really surprising campaigner for it. The fact that Richard Nixon is the American president that has got closest to getting that kind of system into action was one of those surprises. From listening to his party these days one would hardly expect that, but he did it because it seemed, even then, to make good financial sense. This idea isn’t just a shot in the dark, there is a lot of research behind it. So when people say it will not work because people are so lazy they will never do anything if they get free money, they need to show evidence for that opinion. What this book shows is evidence from other research that point in the other direction. All in all, I think this is an interesting book, and the case for universal basic income is very well argued here."
208,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37925908-psychonout,4,"Meanwhile the welfare state has increasingly shifted its focus from the causes of our discontent to the symptoms. We go to a doctor when we're sick, a therapist when we're sad, a dietitian when we're overweight, prison when we're convicted and a job coach when we're out of work. All these services cost vast sums of money, but with little to show for it. In the US, where the cost of healthcare is highest on the planet, the life expectancy for many is actually going down. All the while the market and commercial interests enjoy a free reign. The food industry supplies us with cheap garbage loaded with salt, sugar and fat, putting us on a fast track to the doctor and dietitian. Advancing technologies are laying waste to ever-more jobs sending us back again to the job coach and the ad industry encourages us to spend money we don't have on junk we don't need in order to impress people we can't stand.Then we can go and cry on our therapist's shoulder.That's the dystopia we're living in today."

Bregman certainly has thought-provoking ideas to share and makes you question, or at least wonder about how the world could be a different, better place. The book reads well, keeps you interested, and avoids being polarizing by building his arguments on ethical virtues. Instead he uses logical arguments and often refers research in favor of his viewpoints. The book obviously doesn't really tell you how to go about implementing his ideas; what could go wrong and neither talks about the not-so positive sides; maybe not for realists after all!"

213,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,4,"A book that definitely needs to be read and discussed! Imagine a pandemic hitting states who's citizens receive an universal basic income, securing their livelihood!In ""Utopia for Realists"" Rutger Bregman argues for his three visions for the future: a 15-hour working week, a world without borders and a universal basic income for everyone. Unfortunately the introduction of this book is really weak with enumerating inventions and conditions of our present to state under which high standards we would be living, desperately lacking reflection. He talks for example about medical technology enabling patients with spinal cord injuries to walk again but completely fails to mention, that health insurance companies refuse to provide them to patients due to high costs, that people are getting older due to medical care, but under conditions that are ethically questionable to say the least, or that the number of people committing suicide are three times as high as deaths from vehicle accidents. He does recognize depression though, which according to him is caused by our inability to imagine anything better than what we already have. I highly contradict that. Thankfully he then turns around and starts to recognize, that the empowerment of the individual doesn't just lead to more freedom but a constant feeling of failure when not being able to live up to the expectations.After this disappointing introduction he turns to the universal income for everyone where it get‘s interesting. He lingers between anecdote, academic research and statistics and highlights examples of how these policies have already been partially implemented in the past. For example how a universal basic income was almost introduced in the United States under Nixon, or how a Canadian basic annual income program barely dented the enthusiasm for work, but let to a drop in crime, truancy, hospital attendance, domestic violence and poverty. I believe that this topic needs to be on our politics agendas! I agree that the costs that we invest in our social system aren‘t just completely ineffective but also contra-productive. Because of our current pandemic we can‘t close our eyes to these options anymore and which consequences it would have if we already would have considered it!In the second part of the books he introduces his vision for a 15 hour work week in 2030, because our economy would be that wealthy, that no more was required. Even though he dedicates an entire chapter to it, he somehow fails to connect it to the basic income model. Also it completely ignores the variety of work fields, which seems ironic to me because he deprecates the work fields the biggest part of our society works in, as being unproductive, replaceable and unable to provide any value to society. Such as lawyer, bankers,economists,companies,media...vs. doctors, fire fighter, farmers. Those who would actually produce. But particularly in those areas, work times are in important factor of the ability to produce in the first place and practice is gained by long periods of training. While the concept wouldn't apply to self employers to begin with, those who would be able to instantly instate the concept are those the author diminishes.He then argues for a world without borders, which probably shows the biggest lack of reflection. More people migrating freely would require more energy, leading to more jobs, which is why they would start to produce more and ultimately invest more money back into the economy. But about which jobs are were talking about here? Particularly the jobs the author valued above as the only ones of worth require decades of education in difficult fields. Not only do they require a high level of adaption to our language to say the least, the areas themselves are also not able to adapt to sudden changes in requirements as well. Our current situation teaches us what happens, if there are suddenly more patients than ventilators available to us, but the same goes for housing, food production etc. Open borders always would be influences by sudden movements caused by political actions, natural catastrophes and poverty, it wouldn't just be a gradual floating state. And just as important: What about culture differences? What about religious believes that collide? What about language barriers? What about geographical space limitations? What about different legal systems? What about border controls in order to provide safety for let‘s say outbreaking viruses or prosecution? The author really couldn't convince me of this idea.A very thought provoking book. I obviously don‘t agree with a big part of what the author says but these topics need to be discussed. Particularly the basic income.PS: For me stars are a measurement of impact rather than liking. A five star book isn‘t necessarily one I entirely agree with, but can also mean that it provoked me to think intensely and forced me to form strong opinions, which can‘t even be measured in stars and is one of the main purposes I read books to begin with."
214,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47154315-ian,3,"This is a well-written, well-articulated treatise on the Utopian ideals of a shorter work week, a Universal Basic Income, and other rights for working class people.Unfortunately, although the author wrote well and supported the ideas with a wealth of statistics, there isn't really much new here. Social progressives have held these ideals for years--as Bregman himself demonstrates in his historical references to earlier experiments for the UBI--but society never seems to get any closer to realizing them. I had hoped the author would review these concepts and then explain in detail how to go about attaining them in practice, given that governments continually see overwhelming data of their merit but consistently fail to act.Bregman does briefly look at this stumbling-block near the end of the book in the chapter of How Ideas Change the World. As he states,The question is not CAN new ideas defeat old ones; the question is HOW.Other than reminding us that crises can often drive larger changes than small tentative, rational steps, Bregman disappointing has little to offer. This is a shame, especially given the current world crisis with Covid, where there do seem to be some current openings to such ideas. But without some strong leaders pointing the way, we instead seem destined to return to a (perhaps slightly newer) normal that may prove to be negligibly different than the recent status quo. Sadly, it seems built into human nature to be unable to change our minds and behaviours, even when the best evidence is staring us directly in the face. I deeply wish Bregman had a better answer and could have prescribed some more proactive steps forward.That said, the book is an important read, especially for those unfamiliar with the progressive Utopian concepts, such as a Universal Basic Income that historically has good hard data supporting its implementation. It is sad that Bregman somewhat infers in his own text that those who need to read and absorb the information will never do so."

No, the real crises is we cannot come up with something better. p11An idealist and dreamer from the get go, I have never been taken for a realist. Maybe this is why it was easy for me to agree with the main arguments presented in this paradigm shifting analysis of economic organization and the status quo. RB does not stop there but goes on to propose some pragmatic, semi-revolutionary solutions for our ailing world.I especially like his ideas on a universal basic income ( p31 free cash greases the wheels of the whole economy....) and the way he differentiates between and ""stable and meaningful work"" p147 and""bullshit jobs...that even the people doing them admit that they are superfluous"" p163 ""Instead of creating wealth, these jobs mostly just shift it around."" p155The gap between rich and poor is already wider than it was in ancient Rome- an economy based on slave labor. p184Perhaps crises isn't really the right word for our current condition.

He makes cases for specifics such as Universal Basic Income, a fifteen-hour workweek, open borders, and more, but also challenges us to confront our values, most importantly the ridiculously out of proportion worth that we as a society we give to jobs which don't create any value ( investment banks, speculators of all kinds, much of the service industries that don't actually provide any services ) compared to those things that are vital, fulfilling or actually create wealth. The best example he gives is the contrasting strikes of garbage collectors in New York in 1968 which brought that great city to its knees in ten days ( leaving 100, 000 tons of trash on the streets ) and that of bank workers in Ireland two years later, who the country managed without for six months with almost no effect on the nation's economy.Bergman, and his translator, write with clarity and concision and his arguments are based entirely on facts and numbers, but this doesn't mean it lacks passion."

Full of fascinating stories and strong ideas, with lots of notes to follow up.

I had heard about universal income before and found it a bizarre idea, but Bregman provides information on several practical experiments that had me rethinking the whole thing. A shorter work week and changing the way we look at, and compensate different kinds of work are other ideas discussed in the book that already resonated with me before. The book seems well researched, with a long list of references that can be looked up by those who want more details, although I found the outcome of some of the studies quite doubtful. The book is packed with information and yet, it is written in a colloquial and interesting way that turns reading it into a real pleasure."
221,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5879607-benjamin,5,"Simple works like this can often be overlooked for many reasons. Firstly, they oversimplify because they’re not an academic text. Secondly, they are embedded in an ideological position that the reader can’t get along with, so it’s dismissed out of hand. Thirdly, the argument isn’t as coherent as it could be (partly because of the first and second points) so closer readers will find flaws within moments and miss some of the more salient points.I’m glad to say that this work doesn’t fall prey to those things. Firstly, while simplified, the ideas presented are relatively straight-forward and so they don’t need to be more complicated for its purpose. The author has written more academic work which can be explored, or he points in the direction of those texts that you should look into. It’s textbook stuff: make a point, show how your point might be wrong, defend your point. Job done.Likewise, there’s no clear ideological baggage here. It’s true that he defends neoliberalism (unashamedly) and has a dig at a current strand of defeatist socialism, but throughout the book we have equal nods given to Marx and Engels, the anarchist anthropologist David Graeber and a host of neoliberals that he doesn’t agree with. His point is not that neoliberalism and capitalism are the only games in town. He’s simply stating that neoliberalism can’t be used as a derogatory word when it can be used to do the same job as anti-capitalist positions (if done well). Finally, the argument is coherent and where he runs into dead ends, there is a clear acknowledgement of those problems. Obviously the biggest issue is not what to do but how to get politicians to do it- but that’s true of any book of philosophy, economics or politics that tries to do something radical.This book is hopeful because it shows us how the major changes we need to eradicate world poverty, produce more equality and produce a better quality of life are actually simple. It also reminds us that with enough push, the impossible can become actual. It’s really odd that his ideas echo so many points made by Zizek, despite their huge differences. Bergman is anti-high theory, anti-ideology and less critical of free markets than Zizek, whereas Zizek is entrenched in theory, admits we cannot avoid ideology and is highly critical of capitalism at every turn. However, both argue similar points: the belief that minor changes can be made to capitalism seems like Utopianism, pie-in-the-sky navel gazing nonsense, but all big ideas seemed this way at some point; ultimately, with the absence of a true change of the entire system, we have to radically change what already exists; the revolution is a revolution of ideas and thinking, not of seizing land and machines; Utopianism is not an end state, but a way of thinking- always with that expanding horizon in the distance; and finally, that the left enjoys defeat and has begun to identify with it too much. It’s nice to see two incredibly opposed individuals finding two ways of making the same points. Read it. This book is vital. Even if you don’t agree totally (from either a pro-capitalist or pro-socialist standpoint) you’ll find something in here to make you radically reassess what you already think."
222,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50270175-frances-maxwell,5,"I LOVED this book! The world seems so depressing at the moment, with the likes of Trump and Brexit and what feels to me like a constant threat of impending doom (maybe that's just my anxiety speaking!) This book reminds you that we are living RIGHT NOW in an incredible utopia compared to where we were in the past. This is the best time to be alive in human history. And what's more, there could be an even brighter future with equality for all and the abolition of poverty across the globe, if only we would dare to dream.I loved the ideas in it, which include universal basic income, a shorter worker week, and open borders, each of which he discusses at length. Open borders, in particular, is seriously radical, but morally his argument is sound - borders are a form of global apartheid! How terrible is it that your chances in life are determined by where you are born. We allow everything else to move freely about the world, but not people.I found it really interesting how major political movements tend only to occur after a crisis (before this happens, politicians will only suggest things that don't stray too far from the status quo), and how neoliberalism, for example, came into fruition after the Arab oil crisis in the 70s thanks to decades of simmering (a group of thinkers had been discussing it at length since the 30s). However after the 2008 crash which proved that that it wasn't infallible, there were no radical alternative ideas brewing (!) so we've stuck with the same flawed model. Thinking up and discussing new ideas is CRITICAL to moving forward.I loved the section on 'underdog' socialism, because it's so true! One of the successes of Trump's campaign is that he knows that people like to be on the 'winning' side and yet the branding of the left is all, 'sigh - welfare is expensive but a moral must' (basically, 'we're morally right but an economic disaster') whereas in fact the ideas the author discusses not only eradicate inequality and poverty but result in astonishing economic success. This is the message the voters need to hear.If you're thinking this is too good to be true, I get that. There was a stage in the book where even I - a total ignoramus - felt the arguments were naively optimistic, along the lines of, 'these ideas are the solution to everything and have no down sides', and I guess I was looking for more of a critical analysis, but towards the end I felt reassured that his work is rooted in extensive research, and that he himself is aware of the dangers of bias (he discusses this, including cognitive dissonance, in later chapters and gives an example of his own).In any case, a vision is a vision, and it should be radical. I loved his. I want to live in that world. And it actually feels feasible! Let's do this, people!Definitely read this book!"

I then found out that Rutger Bregman was also a real writer, and he told off the fuckers at Davos too. So let's have a look, I thought.First, he presents his ideas well, and presents them honestly, and I can certainly agree with all of his prescriptions, which, as a democratic socialist, shouldn't be surprising. My only regret is that his analysis is a bit skin-deep at points. He diagnoses several of the symptoms of late-stage capitalism correctly, and provides cures for those symptoms, but what of the underlying disease? A UBI could be disastrous if applied from a libertarian rather than a socialist perspective, and as for open borders, there's a difference between actual open borders (good idea, but it needs a phase-in) and Koch Brothers-styled open borders (like how a Romanian working in Germany can still legally be paid Romanian wages by a German employer). Simply put, good effort Rutger, but you'll need a bit more depth if you wanna achieve top Marx (sorry, couldn't resist)."

You would think that the eradication of poverty is something people can all agree on, but unfortunately that is not the case. I found it interesting how often the book discussed the US even though the author is not American. Reading this was so pleasant what with its talk of UBI, open borders, 15 hour work weeks, and the eradication of poverty, but then of course I had to go back to the real world and the clusterfuck we call the current political situation (bombs, war, border walls, eradication of human rights, elimination of healthcare, deportations, growing inequality) and I just can't understand why anyone would think this mess is the best we can do."

229,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31449816-zainab,4,"Using a primarily economic analysis, this book imagines a much more equal world – one that seems so near yet so far. Just as it says on the tin, this world is utopic but completely achievable. Rutger Bregman uses statistics and studies to expose the flaws of existing national budgets and priorities. His book is a fairly short read/listen that focuses mainly on the concept of Universal Basic Income (UBI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and “bullshit jobs”, as well as poverty and foreign aid. It also envisions what a future of leisure could look like for society. The text is written in a straightforward way, which is unsurprising as Bregman spends the final chapter critiquing an “aristocratic” left, or “underdog socialism”, which he argues is not accessible to a wider public and not invigorated with enough hope to catch on. I found it to be a useful listen with some compelling and entirely convincing arguments, particularly on tax evasion and open borders.However, for me, the book also felt like a repeat of many podcasts I listened to around the UK General Election of 2019 and a few years prior. UBI as the logical future and GDP as a farce are very familiar ideas. In fact, much of what Bregman imagines was proposed in the Labour Party’s manifesto, ideas which a global pandemic might help bring to reality. In addition, the book still felt quite Euro-centric in the framing of history/ideas, so it’s difficult to imagine, for instance, how a mineral-rich and currently impoverished country would transact within this utopia. The climate crisis, for me, also deserved a much more detailed mention in this imagined future. Rutger Bregman went viral alongside Winnie Byanyima at the Davos Conference of 2019 for confronting the billionaire tax evaders sitting before him. His book, Utopia for Realists, will explain why he knew what he was talking about."
230,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,4,"Let us be unreasonable and impossible, the author exhorts. But his book, short and sweet, is far from either. The idea of basic income fits into the paradigm of a realistic utopia, according to Rutger Bregman, whose penchant for popularizing penmanship and knack for narration keep the book interesting and informative, if not all that original. The book is best understood as an attempt to bring a whole bundle of progressive ideas into the mainstream, borrowing heavily from other classics. But what the book lacks in originality it makes up for in holistic vision.One of the most refreshing parts of the book is that the author does not demonize his political opponents, such as conservatives. And indeed, most of his strident criticisms are directed at his fellow leftists (""underdog socialists"") whom he accuses of wallowing in reactionary pessimism. As someone who is more libertarian economically, I found his criticism of the banking and the financial sectors to be embarrassingly misguided, although not any more so than your average left liberal economist. (He confuses corporatist kleptocracy with free markets.) And his implicit call for more regulation of the labour markets relies on a notion of collectivistic economic planning that confuses ideal theory with the predictable failure of public policy - thus betraying his own allegiance to REALISTIC utopias. Furthermore, Bregman's utopia seems too static and degrowth to really feel alive in the way that realistic utopians must live and grow.But overall I enjoyed his vision. The future belongs to those who can envision alternative possibilities and find the institutional means to bring them account. Universal Basic Income is a way to marry progressive and libertarian politics, and ""Utopia for Realists"" does a good job of showing the kind of vision that it inspires - even if there is still room for more realism in the mix."

It has stirred whole communities into action and wars have been fought over it. In this book, the author proposes a Utopia; the idea of a society where every individual is guaranteed a minimum basic income. No strings attached. I'm generally positive about such redistribution schemes, especially in light of the near future (AI, automation etc) but how do we pay for it? The author points out that we already spend an enormous amount in the war on poverty and social assistance programs. Eliminating this bureaucracy and red tape could save us a tremendous amount and make things more efficient at the same time. However, it won't be enough. A better way to think about this is to see it as an investment in humans. When humans can meet their basic needs, they can be more selective about which jobs they will sell their time and bodies to. They can take time off and invest in themselves. In a nutshell, we can eliminate poverty, redistribute wealth, and give people more agency in their lives. Well, what's the evidence that this can actually work? The author points out the example of Dauphin, a Canadian city where a minimum basic income experiment (the no strings attached kind) was tried out for 4 years and resulted in a drastic reduction in poverty and reduced hospitalisation rates. Honestly, I'd like more such experiments but the fact is that they're expensive and the results often take years to become visible. All in all, a perspective changing book."
232,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7599597-tom,3,"The book came out in an interesting time of a paradigm shift in political perspectives. The general population is increasingly disillusioned by the trickle-down economics in the Reagan era, and pushed into the ideal of equality. While the book presented many great statistics, evidences, and insights (compiled from many different sources), it presented a few weak arguments. And through the weak argument is where the author's intellectual elitism wafts out of the writing. The author considers himself to be an arbiter of value, despite being minimally trained in economics. Somehow careers such as financial services that involves studying efficient capital allocation or corporate councils who protect the legal integrity are pointed out as bullshit jobs, all the while artists, philosophers and social study group champions are the true creators of wealth and drivers of economy. I'm not against the idea of wealth redistribution, but discounting the drive and ambition of educated professionals, and forcefully assigning high economic value to liberal disciplines, shows that not only does the author have a very limited understanding of economics, but also the left-wings' resistance of something as basic as free market.

Around the world the mainstream left seems to have run out of steam and become mired in the minutiae of intersectional grievances and the right is either run by rich men for rich men or has been captured by racist lunatics. Bregman gives a list of new (though mostly old) ideas that seem counter-intuitive, but he presents them in a way that also makes them logical, sensible and doable. I recently saw a photo of Rupert Murdoch reading this book while lounging beside a swimming pool - perhaps so that he could work out how to prevent anything in it from happening. For the sake of the rest of us, I hope plenty of politicians are also reading it."

It was pretty obvious that this started out as a book about UBI and the other issues were kind of tacked on, as they weren't as well researched or explained. There was also the long section on the economy and GDP that I didn't really need, because it didn't really help me understand the economy any better (I never will) and it was pretty long.This book was first published in 2014 in the Netherlands (I think), so there are some things that are more optimistic than I would be today. Also, a lot of the book focuses on the US, and it talks about inequality, but barely discusses race at all, which I think was a gross oversight. It's impossible to talk about inequality in the US without at least a cursory mention of the history of race. At one point, it used the US as a positive example for immigration bc of how the country was ""founded"" and all of the progress its made, which is great and all, but the mass immigration to this country wasn't so great for the people who were already here, so it's kind of a bad take, bro.I appreciated the last chapter's acknowledgement of studies that oppose the policies discussed in the book and how differing views can often entrench us further into a belief. I thought it made some interesting points about how change is actually achieved: laying groundwork for a policy and then a crisis activates it by showing that the new system would handle it better. Change can't be made if there's no alternative offered before the crisis, which is what happened in 2008. I think that mindset is especially relevant during present day's actual crisis and just hoping that we've laid some kind of groundwork for the change.Notes and Quotes:- ""you can't pull yourself up by your bootstraps if you have no boots."" -Joseph Hanlon- 80% of Americans were pro-UBI in the 60s- Henry Ford giving all his employees big raises in 1914: aww, sweet. him doing it bc then they'd be able to afford his cars: figures- “the inability to imagine a world in which things are different is evidence only of a poor imagination, not the impossibility of change”- ""... what is the value of free speech when we no longer have anything worthwhile to say? what's the point of freedom of association when we no longer feel any sense of affiliation?"""

Eləcə də biznes mütəxəssislərin böyük əksəriyyəti vəzifələrinin bir o qədər də əhəmiyyətli olmadığını düşünür. Biz acığımız gələn iş yerlərində bütün günü işlədikdən sonra bizə lazım olmayan şeyləri almağa başlayırıq. ""Realistlər üçün utopiya""da holland tarixçi və jurnalist Rutqer Breqman, bunların heç də belə olmamalı olduğunu qeyd edir. Beynəlminəllik və praqmatizm manifesti kimi Breqmanın kitabı əsas 3 ideya ətrafında formalaşıb: 15 saatlıq iş həftəsi, ""universal minimal gəlir"" və sərhədlərin olmadığı dünya. Bu iddialara dəstək məqsədi ilə kitabda ötən əsrin 70-ci illərində icra edilən ""Mincome"" təcrübəsi, evsizlərə verilən qarşılıqsız pul təcrübələri və müxtəlif çoxsayılı statistik faktlar yer alıb. Bəlkə də bu iddialar heç də qeyri-real deyil. Nəinki qeyri-real, cəsarətli olsaq, bəlkə də zəruridir deyə bilərik, çünki daha az saatlı iş həftəsi daha az iş xətası, ətraf-mühitə vurulan zərər, daha az stress, qəza və iqtisadi qeyri-bərabərlikdir. Breqman vurğulayır ki, dəyişiklik ideyalarla başlayır. Nə vaxtsa bizim bu günümüz keçmişdə yaşayan insanların utopiyası idi. Ona görə də ifrat istehsal və istehlak kimi problemlərin öhdəsindən gəlmək üçün gərək ilk növbədə qurduğumuz sistemlərə olan yanaşmamızı dəyişək. ""Realistlər üçün utopiya"" kitabı bizə cari iqtisadiyyatların qeyri-reallığını, ideal və ya utopik hesab edilən iqtisadi sistemlərin isə reallığını çox möhtəşəm və axıcı dil ilə izah edir. Məncə, kitabı oxuduqdan sonra heç kim bir daha düşündüyü ənənəvi fikirlərini və ya doqmaları yada salmayacaq. Kitabı axtarıb-tapıb oxumağıma əsas səbəb Rutqer Breqmanın öz kitabı haqqında The Economist-ə verdiyi müsahibəni dinləməyim olmuşdu (müsahibəni dinləmək üçün keçid: http://bit.ly/Ukutopia_Bregman). Bir iqtisadçı kimi mənə maraqlı gəlmişdi ki, görəsən yuxarı abzasda qeyd edilən məqamlar haqqında özünə belə inamla və güvənlə danışan şəxs nə dərəcədə ciddidir və nə dərəcədə real və yaxşı bilgilərin toplandığı kitab yaza bilib. Doqmalarımızı qıran ideyalar həmişə cəlbedici olur. Qısa müddət ərzində kitabı elektron olaraq tapdım və 1 ay ərzində yavaş-yavaş oxudum. Sonunda isə əsl düşüncə yenilənməsi yaşadım. ""Realistlər üçün utopiya"" kitabını sadəcə bəyənmək deyil, həm də onun faktuallığını nəzərə alıb qiymətləndirmək lazımdır. Son dövrlərin aktual məsələlərinə toxunan, müəyyən həll yolları göstərən və ən əsası fərziyələrlə deyil, real analitik yöntəmlərlə izahat aparan kitabı oxumağıma çox şad oldum. Sitat: ""Bəşəriyyətin möhtəşəm ölçü daşları olan utopiyalarla əlaqədar hər zaman şübhələr olub. Tanınmış sosioloq Albert Hirşmana görə, utopiyalar 3 səviyyədə hücuma məruz qalıblar: axırsızlıq (bu mümkün deyil), təhlükə (risklər çox böyükdür) və qüsurluluq (bu distopiyaya səbəb olacaq degenerasiyadır), amma Hirşman həm də yazır ki, necə ki utopiyalar gerçəkləşir, adi bir şey kimi qəbul olunmağa başlanılır"" (Breqman, Realistlər üçün utopiya, 2016) Kitab çox güclü kontrastlar üzərində qurulub. Bu o deməkdir ki, mövzular keçmiş dövrün gələcəyə olan yanaşmalarından hərəkətə gələrək, bu günümüzü də öz növbəsində hansısa gələcək zamanın keçmişi kimi qəbul edib, müxtəlif iqtisadi göstəriciləri ortaq məxrəcə gətirməyə çalışır. Məsələn, kitab ilk səhifələrində aydınlaşdırır ki, hələ Keynes 20-ci əsrin ilk rübündə daha az saata malik iş həftəsini iqtisadi cəhətdən məntiqli və düzgün hesab edirdi. Bundan əlavə, kasıb ölkələrin cəmiyyətlərin niyə görə kasıb olduqları ilə əlaqədar bir çox maraqlı təcrübə və məlumatlara əsasən səbəblər üzərində dayanılır. Qeyd edilir ki, kasıb ölkələr ona görə kasıbdır ki, onlarda sadəcə oalraq yetərincə nağd pul ehtiyatları yoxdur. Halbuki, həm media, həm də populist siyasətçilər kasıb cəmiyyətləri demokratiyanın olmamasında, insanların savadsızlığında və ya digər hansısa ictimai göstəricilərdə olduğunu deyirlər. Təbii ki, onların müəyyən əhəmiyyəti var, amma aparılan real təcrübələr və sahə araşdırmaları sübut edib ki, isanlara ilkin investisiyanı təmin edəndə, özləri həmin investisiyanı artırmağın yollarını axtarıb-tapırlar. Sitat: ""19-cu əsrdə bərabərsizlik sosial sinif məsələsi ilə əlaqədar idi. Bu günlərdə isə bu məkan ilə əlaqədardır. ""Bütün ölkələrin proletarları birləşin!"" uzun müddət müxtəlif yerlərin kasıb insanlarının əzabkeşliyini birləşdirən ideya olub. Bu gün isə, Dünya Bankının aparıcı iqtisadçısı Branko Milanoviç qeyd edir ki, ""Proletariat həmrəyliyi artıq ölüb, çünki artıq qlobal proletariat deyə bir şey qalmayıb.""""(Breqman, Realistlər üçün utopiya, 2016) İnsan özü özlüyündə çox qəribə canlıdır, çünki o xəyal edə bilir. Kitabın ilk səhifələrindən müəllif göstərir ki, bütün bu fiosoflar, yazıçılar və alimlər utopiyaların vasitəsi ilə bəşəriyyətin inkişafa və firavanlığa nail ola biləcəyini qeyd edirmişlər. Onlardan bəziləri isə artıq reallaşıb, bəziləri reallşmaq üzərədir, digərlərinin reallaşması üçün isə az qalıb. Utopiya anlayışının özü əslində inkişaflar üçün mühüm zəmindir. İnsan təxəyyülündə özünə varlıq qazanan istənilən ideya, hətta utopiyalar belə nə vaxtsa gerçəkləşəcəklər, sadəcə o istiqamətdə kiçik addımlar irəliləmək yetərlidir. Sitat: ""Abstrakt ideallardan fərqli olaraq, çertyojlar nifaqa tolerantlıq göstərməyən dəyişməz qayda-qanunlardan ibarət olurlar. İtalyan şair Tomasso Kampanellanın ""Günəşin şəhəri (1602)"" çox yaxşı nümunə təklif edir. Bu utopiyada və ya distopiyada, fərdi mülkiyyət ciddi olaraq qadağan olunub, hamı bir-birini sevməyə məcbur edilib və dava-dalaş ölümlə cəzalandırılır. Özəl həyat, intim məqamlar da daxil olmaqla dövlət tərəfindən idarə olunur. Məsələn, ağıllı insanlar ancaq axmaq insanlarla yatağa girə bilər, kök insanlar isə arıqlarla.

237,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498454-h-kon-gunnarsson,5,"This is the second book I read about universal basic income, the first one was by Andrew Yang. Both of these books explain the idea very well, but they have different strengths just the same. I think Yang managed to show more clearly the urgency for this system at this point in time as we are entering into the forth industrial revolution, while Bergman explains the history, and the science behind this idea better.It is a radical idea, and I’m not sure if I would have taken it seriously a few years ago. In fact, I don’t think I would have given it much of a thought until I started to read up on the pending industrial revolution. That is what made it realistic for me. There just doesn’t seem to be a viable path into that new reality with out some version of universal basic income. But what surprised me about the history Bergman presents is that it is actually a much older idea, and it had some really surprising campaigner for it. The fact that Richard Nixon is the American president that has got closest to getting that kind of system into action was one of those surprises. From listening to his party these days one would hardly expect that, but he did it because it seemed, even then, to make good financial sense. This idea isn’t just a shot in the dark, there is a lot of research behind it. So when people say it will not work because people are so lazy they will never do anything if they get free money, they need to show evidence for that opinion. What this book shows is evidence from other research that point in the other direction. All in all, I think this is an interesting book, and the case for universal basic income is very well argued here."
238,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37925908-psychonout,4,"Meanwhile the welfare state has increasingly shifted its focus from the causes of our discontent to the symptoms. We go to a doctor when we're sick, a therapist when we're sad, a dietitian when we're overweight, prison when we're convicted and a job coach when we're out of work. All these services cost vast sums of money, but with little to show for it. In the US, where the cost of healthcare is highest on the planet, the life expectancy for many is actually going down. All the while the market and commercial interests enjoy a free reign. The food industry supplies us with cheap garbage loaded with salt, sugar and fat, putting us on a fast track to the doctor and dietitian. Advancing technologies are laying waste to ever-more jobs sending us back again to the job coach and the ad industry encourages us to spend money we don't have on junk we don't need in order to impress people we can't stand.Then we can go and cry on our therapist's shoulder.That's the dystopia we're living in today."

Bregman certainly has thought-provoking ideas to share and makes you question, or at least wonder about how the world could be a different, better place. The book reads well, keeps you interested, and avoids being polarizing by building his arguments on ethical virtues. Instead he uses logical arguments and often refers research in favor of his viewpoints. The book obviously doesn't really tell you how to go about implementing his ideas; what could go wrong and neither talks about the not-so positive sides; maybe not for realists after all!"

243,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,4,"A book that definitely needs to be read and discussed! Imagine a pandemic hitting states who's citizens receive an universal basic income, securing their livelihood!In ""Utopia for Realists"" Rutger Bregman argues for his three visions for the future: a 15-hour working week, a world without borders and a universal basic income for everyone. Unfortunately the introduction of this book is really weak with enumerating inventions and conditions of our present to state under which high standards we would be living, desperately lacking reflection. He talks for example about medical technology enabling patients with spinal cord injuries to walk again but completely fails to mention, that health insurance companies refuse to provide them to patients due to high costs, that people are getting older due to medical care, but under conditions that are ethically questionable to say the least, or that the number of people committing suicide are three times as high as deaths from vehicle accidents. He does recognize depression though, which according to him is caused by our inability to imagine anything better than what we already have. I highly contradict that. Thankfully he then turns around and starts to recognize, that the empowerment of the individual doesn't just lead to more freedom but a constant feeling of failure when not being able to live up to the expectations.After this disappointing introduction he turns to the universal income for everyone where it get‘s interesting. He lingers between anecdote, academic research and statistics and highlights examples of how these policies have already been partially implemented in the past. For example how a universal basic income was almost introduced in the United States under Nixon, or how a Canadian basic annual income program barely dented the enthusiasm for work, but let to a drop in crime, truancy, hospital attendance, domestic violence and poverty. I believe that this topic needs to be on our politics agendas! I agree that the costs that we invest in our social system aren‘t just completely ineffective but also contra-productive. Because of our current pandemic we can‘t close our eyes to these options anymore and which consequences it would have if we already would have considered it!In the second part of the books he introduces his vision for a 15 hour work week in 2030, because our economy would be that wealthy, that no more was required. Even though he dedicates an entire chapter to it, he somehow fails to connect it to the basic income model. Also it completely ignores the variety of work fields, which seems ironic to me because he deprecates the work fields the biggest part of our society works in, as being unproductive, replaceable and unable to provide any value to society. Such as lawyer, bankers,economists,companies,media...vs. doctors, fire fighter, farmers. Those who would actually produce. But particularly in those areas, work times are in important factor of the ability to produce in the first place and practice is gained by long periods of training. While the concept wouldn't apply to self employers to begin with, those who would be able to instantly instate the concept are those the author diminishes.He then argues for a world without borders, which probably shows the biggest lack of reflection. More people migrating freely would require more energy, leading to more jobs, which is why they would start to produce more and ultimately invest more money back into the economy. But about which jobs are were talking about here? Particularly the jobs the author valued above as the only ones of worth require decades of education in difficult fields. Not only do they require a high level of adaption to our language to say the least, the areas themselves are also not able to adapt to sudden changes in requirements as well. Our current situation teaches us what happens, if there are suddenly more patients than ventilators available to us, but the same goes for housing, food production etc. Open borders always would be influences by sudden movements caused by political actions, natural catastrophes and poverty, it wouldn't just be a gradual floating state. And just as important: What about culture differences? What about religious believes that collide? What about language barriers? What about geographical space limitations? What about different legal systems? What about border controls in order to provide safety for let‘s say outbreaking viruses or prosecution? The author really couldn't convince me of this idea.A very thought provoking book. I obviously don‘t agree with a big part of what the author says but these topics need to be discussed. Particularly the basic income.PS: For me stars are a measurement of impact rather than liking. A five star book isn‘t necessarily one I entirely agree with, but can also mean that it provoked me to think intensely and forced me to form strong opinions, which can‘t even be measured in stars and is one of the main purposes I read books to begin with."
244,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47154315-ian,3,"This is a well-written, well-articulated treatise on the Utopian ideals of a shorter work week, a Universal Basic Income, and other rights for working class people.Unfortunately, although the author wrote well and supported the ideas with a wealth of statistics, there isn't really much new here. Social progressives have held these ideals for years--as Bregman himself demonstrates in his historical references to earlier experiments for the UBI--but society never seems to get any closer to realizing them. I had hoped the author would review these concepts and then explain in detail how to go about attaining them in practice, given that governments continually see overwhelming data of their merit but consistently fail to act.Bregman does briefly look at this stumbling-block near the end of the book in the chapter of How Ideas Change the World. As he states,The question is not CAN new ideas defeat old ones; the question is HOW.Other than reminding us that crises can often drive larger changes than small tentative, rational steps, Bregman disappointing has little to offer. This is a shame, especially given the current world crisis with Covid, where there do seem to be some current openings to such ideas. But without some strong leaders pointing the way, we instead seem destined to return to a (perhaps slightly newer) normal that may prove to be negligibly different than the recent status quo. Sadly, it seems built into human nature to be unable to change our minds and behaviours, even when the best evidence is staring us directly in the face. I deeply wish Bregman had a better answer and could have prescribed some more proactive steps forward.That said, the book is an important read, especially for those unfamiliar with the progressive Utopian concepts, such as a Universal Basic Income that historically has good hard data supporting its implementation. It is sad that Bregman somewhat infers in his own text that those who need to read and absorb the information will never do so."

No, the real crises is we cannot come up with something better. p11An idealist and dreamer from the get go, I have never been taken for a realist. Maybe this is why it was easy for me to agree with the main arguments presented in this paradigm shifting analysis of economic organization and the status quo. RB does not stop there but goes on to propose some pragmatic, semi-revolutionary solutions for our ailing world.I especially like his ideas on a universal basic income ( p31 free cash greases the wheels of the whole economy....) and the way he differentiates between and ""stable and meaningful work"" p147 and""bullshit jobs...that even the people doing them admit that they are superfluous"" p163 ""Instead of creating wealth, these jobs mostly just shift it around."" p155The gap between rich and poor is already wider than it was in ancient Rome- an economy based on slave labor. p184Perhaps crises isn't really the right word for our current condition.

He makes cases for specifics such as Universal Basic Income, a fifteen-hour workweek, open borders, and more, but also challenges us to confront our values, most importantly the ridiculously out of proportion worth that we as a society we give to jobs which don't create any value ( investment banks, speculators of all kinds, much of the service industries that don't actually provide any services ) compared to those things that are vital, fulfilling or actually create wealth. The best example he gives is the contrasting strikes of garbage collectors in New York in 1968 which brought that great city to its knees in ten days ( leaving 100, 000 tons of trash on the streets ) and that of bank workers in Ireland two years later, who the country managed without for six months with almost no effect on the nation's economy.Bergman, and his translator, write with clarity and concision and his arguments are based entirely on facts and numbers, but this doesn't mean it lacks passion."

250,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1192324-ana,4,"A good read full of (not that much) utopian ideas. I had heard about universal income before and found it a bizarre idea, but Bregman provides information on several practical experiments that had me rethinking the whole thing. A shorter work week and changing the way we look at, and compensate different kinds of work are other ideas discussed in the book that already resonated with me before. The book seems well researched, with a long list of references that can be looked up by those who want more details, although I found the outcome of some of the studies quite doubtful. The book is packed with information and yet, it is written in a colloquial and interesting way that turns reading it into a real pleasure."
251,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5879607-benjamin,5,"Simple works like this can often be overlooked for many reasons. Firstly, they oversimplify because they’re not an academic text. Secondly, they are embedded in an ideological position that the reader can’t get along with, so it’s dismissed out of hand. Thirdly, the argument isn’t as coherent as it could be (partly because of the first and second points) so closer readers will find flaws within moments and miss some of the more salient points.I’m glad to say that this work doesn’t fall prey to those things. Firstly, while simplified, the ideas presented are relatively straight-forward and so they don’t need to be more complicated for its purpose. The author has written more academic work which can be explored, or he points in the direction of those texts that you should look into. It’s textbook stuff: make a point, show how your point might be wrong, defend your point. Job done.Likewise, there’s no clear ideological baggage here. It’s true that he defends neoliberalism (unashamedly) and has a dig at a current strand of defeatist socialism, but throughout the book we have equal nods given to Marx and Engels, the anarchist anthropologist David Graeber and a host of neoliberals that he doesn’t agree with. His point is not that neoliberalism and capitalism are the only games in town. He’s simply stating that neoliberalism can’t be used as a derogatory word when it can be used to do the same job as anti-capitalist positions (if done well). Finally, the argument is coherent and where he runs into dead ends, there is a clear acknowledgement of those problems. Obviously the biggest issue is not what to do but how to get politicians to do it- but that’s true of any book of philosophy, economics or politics that tries to do something radical.This book is hopeful because it shows us how the major changes we need to eradicate world poverty, produce more equality and produce a better quality of life are actually simple. It also reminds us that with enough push, the impossible can become actual. It’s really odd that his ideas echo so many points made by Zizek, despite their huge differences. Bergman is anti-high theory, anti-ideology and less critical of free markets than Zizek, whereas Zizek is entrenched in theory, admits we cannot avoid ideology and is highly critical of capitalism at every turn. However, both argue similar points: the belief that minor changes can be made to capitalism seems like Utopianism, pie-in-the-sky navel gazing nonsense, but all big ideas seemed this way at some point; ultimately, with the absence of a true change of the entire system, we have to radically change what already exists; the revolution is a revolution of ideas and thinking, not of seizing land and machines; Utopianism is not an end state, but a way of thinking- always with that expanding horizon in the distance; and finally, that the left enjoys defeat and has begun to identify with it too much. It’s nice to see two incredibly opposed individuals finding two ways of making the same points. Read it. This book is vital. Even if you don’t agree totally (from either a pro-capitalist or pro-socialist standpoint) you’ll find something in here to make you radically reassess what you already think."
252,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50270175-frances-maxwell,5,"I LOVED this book! The world seems so depressing at the moment, with the likes of Trump and Brexit and what feels to me like a constant threat of impending doom (maybe that's just my anxiety speaking!) This book reminds you that we are living RIGHT NOW in an incredible utopia compared to where we were in the past. This is the best time to be alive in human history. And what's more, there could be an even brighter future with equality for all and the abolition of poverty across the globe, if only we would dare to dream.I loved the ideas in it, which include universal basic income, a shorter worker week, and open borders, each of which he discusses at length. Open borders, in particular, is seriously radical, but morally his argument is sound - borders are a form of global apartheid! How terrible is it that your chances in life are determined by where you are born. We allow everything else to move freely about the world, but not people.I found it really interesting how major political movements tend only to occur after a crisis (before this happens, politicians will only suggest things that don't stray too far from the status quo), and how neoliberalism, for example, came into fruition after the Arab oil crisis in the 70s thanks to decades of simmering (a group of thinkers had been discussing it at length since the 30s). However after the 2008 crash which proved that that it wasn't infallible, there were no radical alternative ideas brewing (!) so we've stuck with the same flawed model. Thinking up and discussing new ideas is CRITICAL to moving forward.I loved the section on 'underdog' socialism, because it's so true! One of the successes of Trump's campaign is that he knows that people like to be on the 'winning' side and yet the branding of the left is all, 'sigh - welfare is expensive but a moral must' (basically, 'we're morally right but an economic disaster') whereas in fact the ideas the author discusses not only eradicate inequality and poverty but result in astonishing economic success. This is the message the voters need to hear.If you're thinking this is too good to be true, I get that. There was a stage in the book where even I - a total ignoramus - felt the arguments were naively optimistic, along the lines of, 'these ideas are the solution to everything and have no down sides', and I guess I was looking for more of a critical analysis, but towards the end I felt reassured that his work is rooted in extensive research, and that he himself is aware of the dangers of bias (he discusses this, including cognitive dissonance, in later chapters and gives an example of his own).In any case, a vision is a vision, and it should be radical. I loved his. I want to live in that world. And it actually feels feasible! Let's do this, people!Definitely read this book!"
253,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/442654-andrew,0,"Like many/most people, I first became aware of Rutger Bregman based on the fire he spit at Tucker Carlson, which was amusing not because it had any intrinsic value -- we live in a world that favors bitchslaps like that over long-form argument far too much -- but simply because it was funny and witty. I then found out that Rutger Bregman was also a real writer, and he told off the fuckers at Davos too. So let's have a look, I thought.First, he presents his ideas well, and presents them honestly, and I can certainly agree with all of his prescriptions, which, as a democratic socialist, shouldn't be surprising. My only regret is that his analysis is a bit skin-deep at points. He diagnoses several of the symptoms of late-stage capitalism correctly, and provides cures for those symptoms, but what of the underlying disease? A UBI could be disastrous if applied from a libertarian rather than a socialist perspective, and as for open borders, there's a difference between actual open borders (good idea, but it needs a phase-in) and Koch Brothers-styled open borders (like how a Romanian working in Germany can still legally be paid Romanian wages by a German employer). Simply put, good effort Rutger, but you'll need a bit more depth if you wanna achieve top Marx (sorry, couldn't resist)."
254,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1806587-a,4,"I'm always interested in alternative political and economic theories due to my overwhelming unhappiness with the current state of the world and my own life.I really felt like this book put forth a lot of ideas in a coherent and meaningful way. You would think that the eradication of poverty is something people can all agree on, but unfortunately that is not the case. I found it interesting how often the book discussed the US even though the author is not American. Reading this was so pleasant what with its talk of UBI, open borders, 15 hour work weeks, and the eradication of poverty, but then of course I had to go back to the real world and the clusterfuck we call the current political situation (bombs, war, border walls, eradication of human rights, elimination of healthcare, deportations, growing inequality) and I just can't understand why anyone would think this mess is the best we can do."

It was a very interesting experience. "

After watching him take on Tucker Carlson, I bumped it up my list and started reading it. Packed full of fascinating ideas, some of which came with data, some with anecdata and a couple which were just a little fanciful. I don’t think it’s quite rigorous enough to change minds, but there was plenty of eye opening material and I am starting to understand the concept of a universal basic wage."
257,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28514701-martin-fixman,1,Absolute garbage. The book doesn't show a single shred of actual research and has as much merit as a random Reddit comment rambling about flying cars in the future.

259,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31449816-zainab,4,"Using a primarily economic analysis, this book imagines a much more equal world – one that seems so near yet so far. Just as it says on the tin, this world is utopic but completely achievable. Rutger Bregman uses statistics and studies to expose the flaws of existing national budgets and priorities. His book is a fairly short read/listen that focuses mainly on the concept of Universal Basic Income (UBI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and “bullshit jobs”, as well as poverty and foreign aid. It also envisions what a future of leisure could look like for society. The text is written in a straightforward way, which is unsurprising as Bregman spends the final chapter critiquing an “aristocratic” left, or “underdog socialism”, which he argues is not accessible to a wider public and not invigorated with enough hope to catch on. I found it to be a useful listen with some compelling and entirely convincing arguments, particularly on tax evasion and open borders.However, for me, the book also felt like a repeat of many podcasts I listened to around the UK General Election of 2019 and a few years prior. UBI as the logical future and GDP as a farce are very familiar ideas. In fact, much of what Bregman imagines was proposed in the Labour Party’s manifesto, ideas which a global pandemic might help bring to reality. In addition, the book still felt quite Euro-centric in the framing of history/ideas, so it’s difficult to imagine, for instance, how a mineral-rich and currently impoverished country would transact within this utopia. The climate crisis, for me, also deserved a much more detailed mention in this imagined future. Rutger Bregman went viral alongside Winnie Byanyima at the Davos Conference of 2019 for confronting the billionaire tax evaders sitting before him. His book, Utopia for Realists, will explain why he knew what he was talking about."
260,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,4,"Let us be unreasonable and impossible, the author exhorts. But his book, short and sweet, is far from either. The idea of basic income fits into the paradigm of a realistic utopia, according to Rutger Bregman, whose penchant for popularizing penmanship and knack for narration keep the book interesting and informative, if not all that original. The book is best understood as an attempt to bring a whole bundle of progressive ideas into the mainstream, borrowing heavily from other classics. But what the book lacks in originality it makes up for in holistic vision.One of the most refreshing parts of the book is that the author does not demonize his political opponents, such as conservatives. And indeed, most of his strident criticisms are directed at his fellow leftists (""underdog socialists"") whom he accuses of wallowing in reactionary pessimism. As someone who is more libertarian economically, I found his criticism of the banking and the financial sectors to be embarrassingly misguided, although not any more so than your average left liberal economist. (He confuses corporatist kleptocracy with free markets.) And his implicit call for more regulation of the labour markets relies on a notion of collectivistic economic planning that confuses ideal theory with the predictable failure of public policy - thus betraying his own allegiance to REALISTIC utopias. Furthermore, Bregman's utopia seems too static and degrowth to really feel alive in the way that realistic utopians must live and grow.But overall I enjoyed his vision. The future belongs to those who can envision alternative possibilities and find the institutional means to bring them account. Universal Basic Income is a way to marry progressive and libertarian politics, and ""Utopia for Realists"" does a good job of showing the kind of vision that it inspires - even if there is still room for more realism in the mix."
261,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20228885-sreejith-puthanpurayil,5,"Humans have been dreaming and designing Utopias for a long time. It has stirred whole communities into action and wars have been fought over it. In this book, the author proposes a Utopia; the idea of a society where every individual is guaranteed a minimum basic income. No strings attached. I'm generally positive about such redistribution schemes, especially in light of the near future (AI, automation etc) but how do we pay for it? The author points out that we already spend an enormous amount in the war on poverty and social assistance programs. Eliminating this bureaucracy and red tape could save us a tremendous amount and make things more efficient at the same time. However, it won't be enough. A better way to think about this is to see it as an investment in humans. When humans can meet their basic needs, they can be more selective about which jobs they will sell their time and bodies to. They can take time off and invest in themselves. In a nutshell, we can eliminate poverty, redistribute wealth, and give people more agency in their lives. Well, what's the evidence that this can actually work? The author points out the example of Dauphin, a Canadian city where a minimum basic income experiment (the no strings attached kind) was tried out for 4 years and resulted in a drastic reduction in poverty and reduced hospitalisation rates. Honestly, I'd like more such experiments but the fact is that they're expensive and the results often take years to become visible. All in all, a perspective changing book."
262,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7599597-tom,3,"The book came out in an interesting time of a paradigm shift in political perspectives. The general population is increasingly disillusioned by the trickle-down economics in the Reagan era, and pushed into the ideal of equality. While the book presented many great statistics, evidences, and insights (compiled from many different sources), it presented a few weak arguments. And through the weak argument is where the author's intellectual elitism wafts out of the writing. The author considers himself to be an arbiter of value, despite being minimally trained in economics. Somehow careers such as financial services that involves studying efficient capital allocation or corporate councils who protect the legal integrity are pointed out as bullshit jobs, all the while artists, philosophers and social study group champions are the true creators of wealth and drivers of economy. I'm not against the idea of wealth redistribution, but discounting the drive and ambition of educated professionals, and forcefully assigning high economic value to liberal disciplines, shows that not only does the author have a very limited understanding of economics, but also the left-wings' resistance of something as basic as free market.

Around the world the mainstream left seems to have run out of steam and become mired in the minutiae of intersectional grievances and the right is either run by rich men for rich men or has been captured by racist lunatics. Bregman gives a list of new (though mostly old) ideas that seem counter-intuitive, but he presents them in a way that also makes them logical, sensible and doable. I recently saw a photo of Rupert Murdoch reading this book while lounging beside a swimming pool - perhaps so that he could work out how to prevent anything in it from happening. For the sake of the rest of us, I hope plenty of politicians are also reading it."

For anyone who needs a pick-me-up on this front: this book proposes several possibilities, in a fresh and upbeat way. I'm dying to discuss this with friends. Some of these ideas blew my mind; I'm a newbie when it comes to political theory/economics. It's left me curious and optimistic about the future. I also think it's a fascinating companion to A Whole New Mind by Daniel Pink. "

It was pretty obvious that this started out as a book about UBI and the other issues were kind of tacked on, as they weren't as well researched or explained. There was also the long section on the economy and GDP that I didn't really need, because it didn't really help me understand the economy any better (I never will) and it was pretty long.This book was first published in 2014 in the Netherlands (I think), so there are some things that are more optimistic than I would be today. Also, a lot of the book focuses on the US, and it talks about inequality, but barely discusses race at all, which I think was a gross oversight. It's impossible to talk about inequality in the US without at least a cursory mention of the history of race. At one point, it used the US as a positive example for immigration bc of how the country was ""founded"" and all of the progress its made, which is great and all, but the mass immigration to this country wasn't so great for the people who were already here, so it's kind of a bad take, bro.I appreciated the last chapter's acknowledgement of studies that oppose the policies discussed in the book and how differing views can often entrench us further into a belief. I thought it made some interesting points about how change is actually achieved: laying groundwork for a policy and then a crisis activates it by showing that the new system would handle it better. Change can't be made if there's no alternative offered before the crisis, which is what happened in 2008. I think that mindset is especially relevant during present day's actual crisis and just hoping that we've laid some kind of groundwork for the change.Notes and Quotes:- ""you can't pull yourself up by your bootstraps if you have no boots."" -Joseph Hanlon- 80% of Americans were pro-UBI in the 60s- Henry Ford giving all his employees big raises in 1914: aww, sweet. him doing it bc then they'd be able to afford his cars: figures- “the inability to imagine a world in which things are different is evidence only of a poor imagination, not the impossibility of change”- ""... what is the value of free speech when we no longer have anything worthwhile to say? what's the point of freedom of association when we no longer feel any sense of affiliation?"""

Eləcə də biznes mütəxəssislərin böyük əksəriyyəti vəzifələrinin bir o qədər də əhəmiyyətli olmadığını düşünür. Biz acığımız gələn iş yerlərində bütün günü işlədikdən sonra bizə lazım olmayan şeyləri almağa başlayırıq. ""Realistlər üçün utopiya""da holland tarixçi və jurnalist Rutqer Breqman, bunların heç də belə olmamalı olduğunu qeyd edir. Beynəlminəllik və praqmatizm manifesti kimi Breqmanın kitabı əsas 3 ideya ətrafında formalaşıb: 15 saatlıq iş həftəsi, ""universal minimal gəlir"" və sərhədlərin olmadığı dünya. Bu iddialara dəstək məqsədi ilə kitabda ötən əsrin 70-ci illərində icra edilən ""Mincome"" təcrübəsi, evsizlərə verilən qarşılıqsız pul təcrübələri və müxtəlif çoxsayılı statistik faktlar yer alıb. Bəlkə də bu iddialar heç də qeyri-real deyil. Nəinki qeyri-real, cəsarətli olsaq, bəlkə də zəruridir deyə bilərik, çünki daha az saatlı iş həftəsi daha az iş xətası, ətraf-mühitə vurulan zərər, daha az stress, qəza və iqtisadi qeyri-bərabərlikdir. Breqman vurğulayır ki, dəyişiklik ideyalarla başlayır. Nə vaxtsa bizim bu günümüz keçmişdə yaşayan insanların utopiyası idi. Ona görə də ifrat istehsal və istehlak kimi problemlərin öhdəsindən gəlmək üçün gərək ilk növbədə qurduğumuz sistemlərə olan yanaşmamızı dəyişək. ""Realistlər üçün utopiya"" kitabı bizə cari iqtisadiyyatların qeyri-reallığını, ideal və ya utopik hesab edilən iqtisadi sistemlərin isə reallığını çox möhtəşəm və axıcı dil ilə izah edir. Məncə, kitabı oxuduqdan sonra heç kim bir daha düşündüyü ənənəvi fikirlərini və ya doqmaları yada salmayacaq. Kitabı axtarıb-tapıb oxumağıma əsas səbəb Rutqer Breqmanın öz kitabı haqqında The Economist-ə verdiyi müsahibəni dinləməyim olmuşdu (müsahibəni dinləmək üçün keçid: http://bit.ly/Ukutopia_Bregman). Bir iqtisadçı kimi mənə maraqlı gəlmişdi ki, görəsən yuxarı abzasda qeyd edilən məqamlar haqqında özünə belə inamla və güvənlə danışan şəxs nə dərəcədə ciddidir və nə dərəcədə real və yaxşı bilgilərin toplandığı kitab yaza bilib. Doqmalarımızı qıran ideyalar həmişə cəlbedici olur. Qısa müddət ərzində kitabı elektron olaraq tapdım və 1 ay ərzində yavaş-yavaş oxudum. Sonunda isə əsl düşüncə yenilənməsi yaşadım. ""Realistlər üçün utopiya"" kitabını sadəcə bəyənmək deyil, həm də onun faktuallığını nəzərə alıb qiymətləndirmək lazımdır. Son dövrlərin aktual məsələlərinə toxunan, müəyyən həll yolları göstərən və ən əsası fərziyələrlə deyil, real analitik yöntəmlərlə izahat aparan kitabı oxumağıma çox şad oldum. Sitat: ""Bəşəriyyətin möhtəşəm ölçü daşları olan utopiyalarla əlaqədar hər zaman şübhələr olub. Tanınmış sosioloq Albert Hirşmana görə, utopiyalar 3 səviyyədə hücuma məruz qalıblar: axırsızlıq (bu mümkün deyil), təhlükə (risklər çox böyükdür) və qüsurluluq (bu distopiyaya səbəb olacaq degenerasiyadır), amma Hirşman həm də yazır ki, necə ki utopiyalar gerçəkləşir, adi bir şey kimi qəbul olunmağa başlanılır"" (Breqman, Realistlər üçün utopiya, 2016) Kitab çox güclü kontrastlar üzərində qurulub. Bu o deməkdir ki, mövzular keçmiş dövrün gələcəyə olan yanaşmalarından hərəkətə gələrək, bu günümüzü də öz növbəsində hansısa gələcək zamanın keçmişi kimi qəbul edib, müxtəlif iqtisadi göstəriciləri ortaq məxrəcə gətirməyə çalışır. Məsələn, kitab ilk səhifələrində aydınlaşdırır ki, hələ Keynes 20-ci əsrin ilk rübündə daha az saata malik iş həftəsini iqtisadi cəhətdən məntiqli və düzgün hesab edirdi. Bundan əlavə, kasıb ölkələrin cəmiyyətlərin niyə görə kasıb olduqları ilə əlaqədar bir çox maraqlı təcrübə və məlumatlara əsasən səbəblər üzərində dayanılır. Qeyd edilir ki, kasıb ölkələr ona görə kasıbdır ki, onlarda sadəcə oalraq yetərincə nağd pul ehtiyatları yoxdur. Halbuki, həm media, həm də populist siyasətçilər kasıb cəmiyyətləri demokratiyanın olmamasında, insanların savadsızlığında və ya digər hansısa ictimai göstəricilərdə olduğunu deyirlər. Təbii ki, onların müəyyən əhəmiyyəti var, amma aparılan real təcrübələr və sahə araşdırmaları sübut edib ki, isanlara ilkin investisiyanı təmin edəndə, özləri həmin investisiyanı artırmağın yollarını axtarıb-tapırlar. Sitat: ""19-cu əsrdə bərabərsizlik sosial sinif məsələsi ilə əlaqədar idi. Bu günlərdə isə bu məkan ilə əlaqədardır. ""Bütün ölkələrin proletarları birləşin!"" uzun müddət müxtəlif yerlərin kasıb insanlarının əzabkeşliyini birləşdirən ideya olub. Bu gün isə, Dünya Bankının aparıcı iqtisadçısı Branko Milanoviç qeyd edir ki, ""Proletariat həmrəyliyi artıq ölüb, çünki artıq qlobal proletariat deyə bir şey qalmayıb.""""(Breqman, Realistlər üçün utopiya, 2016) İnsan özü özlüyündə çox qəribə canlıdır, çünki o xəyal edə bilir. Kitabın ilk səhifələrindən müəllif göstərir ki, bütün bu fiosoflar, yazıçılar və alimlər utopiyaların vasitəsi ilə bəşəriyyətin inkişafa və firavanlığa nail ola biləcəyini qeyd edirmişlər. Onlardan bəziləri isə artıq reallaşıb, bəziləri reallşmaq üzərədir, digərlərinin reallaşması üçün isə az qalıb. Utopiya anlayışının özü əslində inkişaflar üçün mühüm zəmindir. İnsan təxəyyülündə özünə varlıq qazanan istənilən ideya, hətta utopiyalar belə nə vaxtsa gerçəkləşəcəklər, sadəcə o istiqamətdə kiçik addımlar irəliləmək yetərlidir. Sitat: ""Abstrakt ideallardan fərqli olaraq, çertyojlar nifaqa tolerantlıq göstərməyən dəyişməz qayda-qanunlardan ibarət olurlar. İtalyan şair Tomasso Kampanellanın ""Günəşin şəhəri (1602)"" çox yaxşı nümunə təklif edir. Bu utopiyada və ya distopiyada, fərdi mülkiyyət ciddi olaraq qadağan olunub, hamı bir-birini sevməyə məcbur edilib və dava-dalaş ölümlə cəzalandırılır.

I think Yang managed to show more clearly the urgency for this system at this point in time as we are entering into the forth industrial revolution, while Bergman explains the history, and the science behind this idea better.It is a radical idea, and I’m not sure if I would have taken it seriously a few years ago. In fact, I don’t think I would have given it much of a thought until I started to read up on the pending industrial revolution. That is what made it realistic for me. There just doesn’t seem to be a viable path into that new reality with out some version of universal basic income. But what surprised me about the history Bergman presents is that it is actually a much older idea, and it had some really surprising campaigner for it. The fact that Richard Nixon is the American president that has got closest to getting that kind of system into action was one of those surprises. From listening to his party these days one would hardly expect that, but he did it because it seemed, even then, to make good financial sense. This idea isn’t just a shot in the dark, there is a lot of research behind it. So when people say it will not work because people are so lazy they will never do anything if they get free money, they need to show evidence for that opinion. What this book shows is evidence from other research that point in the other direction. All in all, I think this is an interesting book, and the case for universal basic income is very well argued here."

We go to a doctor when we're sick, a therapist when we're sad, a dietitian when we're overweight, prison when we're convicted and a job coach when we're out of work. All these services cost vast sums of money, but with little to show for it. In the US, where the cost of healthcare is highest on the planet, the life expectancy for many is actually going down. All the while the market and commercial interests enjoy a free reign. The food industry supplies us with cheap garbage loaded with salt, sugar and fat, putting us on a fast track to the doctor and dietitian. Advancing technologies are laying waste to ever-more jobs sending us back again to the job coach and the ad industry encourages us to spend money we don't have on junk we don't need in order to impress people we can't stand.Then we can go and cry on our therapist's shoulder.That's the dystopia we're living in today."

Bregman certainly has thought-provoking ideas to share and makes you question, or at least wonder about how the world could be a different, better place. The book reads well, keeps you interested, and avoids being polarizing by building his arguments on ethical virtues. Instead he uses logical arguments and often refers research in favor of his viewpoints. The book obviously doesn't really tell you how to go about implementing his ideas; what could go wrong and neither talks about the not-so positive sides; maybe not for realists after all!"

273,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,4,"A book that definitely needs to be read and discussed! Imagine a pandemic hitting states who's citizens receive an universal basic income, securing their livelihood!In ""Utopia for Realists"" Rutger Bregman argues for his three visions for the future: a 15-hour working week, a world without borders and a universal basic income for everyone. Unfortunately the introduction of this book is really weak with enumerating inventions and conditions of our present to state under which high standards we would be living, desperately lacking reflection. He talks for example about medical technology enabling patients with spinal cord injuries to walk again but completely fails to mention, that health insurance companies refuse to provide them to patients due to high costs, that people are getting older due to medical care, but under conditions that are ethically questionable to say the least, or that the number of people committing suicide are three times as high as deaths from vehicle accidents. He does recognize depression though, which according to him is caused by our inability to imagine anything better than what we already have. I highly contradict that. Thankfully he then turns around and starts to recognize, that the empowerment of the individual doesn't just lead to more freedom but a constant feeling of failure when not being able to live up to the expectations.After this disappointing introduction he turns to the universal income for everyone where it get‘s interesting. He lingers between anecdote, academic research and statistics and highlights examples of how these policies have already been partially implemented in the past. For example how a universal basic income was almost introduced in the United States under Nixon, or how a Canadian basic annual income program barely dented the enthusiasm for work, but let to a drop in crime, truancy, hospital attendance, domestic violence and poverty. I believe that this topic needs to be on our politics agendas! I agree that the costs that we invest in our social system aren‘t just completely ineffective but also contra-productive. Because of our current pandemic we can‘t close our eyes to these options anymore and which consequences it would have if we already would have considered it!In the second part of the books he introduces his vision for a 15 hour work week in 2030, because our economy would be that wealthy, that no more was required. Even though he dedicates an entire chapter to it, he somehow fails to connect it to the basic income model. Also it completely ignores the variety of work fields, which seems ironic to me because he deprecates the work fields the biggest part of our society works in, as being unproductive, replaceable and unable to provide any value to society. Such as lawyer, bankers,economists,companies,media...vs. doctors, fire fighter, farmers. Those who would actually produce. But particularly in those areas, work times are in important factor of the ability to produce in the first place and practice is gained by long periods of training. While the concept wouldn't apply to self employers to begin with, those who would be able to instantly instate the concept are those the author diminishes.He then argues for a world without borders, which probably shows the biggest lack of reflection. More people migrating freely would require more energy, leading to more jobs, which is why they would start to produce more and ultimately invest more money back into the economy. But about which jobs are were talking about here? Particularly the jobs the author valued above as the only ones of worth require decades of education in difficult fields. Not only do they require a high level of adaption to our language to say the least, the areas themselves are also not able to adapt to sudden changes in requirements as well. Our current situation teaches us what happens, if there are suddenly more patients than ventilators available to us, but the same goes for housing, food production etc. Open borders always would be influences by sudden movements caused by political actions, natural catastrophes and poverty, it wouldn't just be a gradual floating state. And just as important: What about culture differences? What about religious believes that collide? What about language barriers? What about geographical space limitations? What about different legal systems? What about border controls in order to provide safety for let‘s say outbreaking viruses or prosecution? The author really couldn't convince me of this idea.A very thought provoking book. I obviously don‘t agree with a big part of what the author says but these topics need to be discussed. Particularly the basic income.PS: For me stars are a measurement of impact rather than liking. A five star book isn‘t necessarily one I entirely agree with, but can also mean that it provoked me to think intensely and forced me to form strong opinions, which can‘t even be measured in stars and is one of the main purposes I read books to begin with."
274,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47154315-ian,3,"This is a well-written, well-articulated treatise on the Utopian ideals of a shorter work week, a Universal Basic Income, and other rights for working class people.Unfortunately, although the author wrote well and supported the ideas with a wealth of statistics, there isn't really much new here. Social progressives have held these ideals for years--as Bregman himself demonstrates in his historical references to earlier experiments for the UBI--but society never seems to get any closer to realizing them. I had hoped the author would review these concepts and then explain in detail how to go about attaining them in practice, given that governments continually see overwhelming data of their merit but consistently fail to act.Bregman does briefly look at this stumbling-block near the end of the book in the chapter of How Ideas Change the World. As he states,The question is not CAN new ideas defeat old ones; the question is HOW.Other than reminding us that crises can often drive larger changes than small tentative, rational steps, Bregman disappointing has little to offer. This is a shame, especially given the current world crisis with Covid, where there do seem to be some current openings to such ideas. But without some strong leaders pointing the way, we instead seem destined to return to a (perhaps slightly newer) normal that may prove to be negligibly different than the recent status quo. Sadly, it seems built into human nature to be unable to change our minds and behaviours, even when the best evidence is staring us directly in the face. I deeply wish Bregman had a better answer and could have prescribed some more proactive steps forward.That said, the book is an important read, especially for those unfamiliar with the progressive Utopian concepts, such as a Universal Basic Income that historically has good hard data supporting its implementation. It is sad that Bregman somewhat infers in his own text that those who need to read and absorb the information will never do so."

Maybe this is why it was easy for me to agree with the main arguments presented in this paradigm shifting analysis of economic organization and the status quo. RB does not stop there but goes on to propose some pragmatic, semi-revolutionary solutions for our ailing world.I especially like his ideas on a universal basic income ( p31 free cash greases the wheels of the whole economy....) and the way he differentiates between and ""stable and meaningful work"" p147 and""bullshit jobs...that even the people doing them admit that they are superfluous"" p163 ""Instead of creating wealth, these jobs mostly just shift it around."" p155The gap between rich and poor is already wider than it was in ancient Rome- an economy based on slave labor. p184Perhaps crises isn't really the right word for our current condition.

He makes cases for specifics such as Universal Basic Income, a fifteen-hour workweek, open borders, and more, but also challenges us to confront our values, most importantly the ridiculously out of proportion worth that we as a society we give to jobs which don't create any value ( investment banks, speculators of all kinds, much of the service industries that don't actually provide any services ) compared to those things that are vital, fulfilling or actually create wealth. The best example he gives is the contrasting strikes of garbage collectors in New York in 1968 which brought that great city to its knees in ten days ( leaving 100, 000 tons of trash on the streets ) and that of bank workers in Ireland two years later, who the country managed without for six months with almost no effect on the nation's economy.Bergman, and his translator, write with clarity and concision and his arguments are based entirely on facts and numbers, but this doesn't mean it lacks passion."

A shorter work week and changing the way we look at, and compensate different kinds of work are other ideas discussed in the book that already resonated with me before. The book seems well researched, with a long list of references that can be looked up by those who want more details, although I found the outcome of some of the studies quite doubtful. The book is packed with information and yet, it is written in a colloquial and interesting way that turns reading it into a real pleasure."
281,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5879607-benjamin,5,"Simple works like this can often be overlooked for many reasons. Firstly, they oversimplify because they’re not an academic text. Secondly, they are embedded in an ideological position that the reader can’t get along with, so it’s dismissed out of hand. Thirdly, the argument isn’t as coherent as it could be (partly because of the first and second points) so closer readers will find flaws within moments and miss some of the more salient points.I’m glad to say that this work doesn’t fall prey to those things. Firstly, while simplified, the ideas presented are relatively straight-forward and so they don’t need to be more complicated for its purpose. The author has written more academic work which can be explored, or he points in the direction of those texts that you should look into. It’s textbook stuff: make a point, show how your point might be wrong, defend your point. Job done.Likewise, there’s no clear ideological baggage here. It’s true that he defends neoliberalism (unashamedly) and has a dig at a current strand of defeatist socialism, but throughout the book we have equal nods given to Marx and Engels, the anarchist anthropologist David Graeber and a host of neoliberals that he doesn’t agree with. His point is not that neoliberalism and capitalism are the only games in town. He’s simply stating that neoliberalism can’t be used as a derogatory word when it can be used to do the same job as anti-capitalist positions (if done well). Finally, the argument is coherent and where he runs into dead ends, there is a clear acknowledgement of those problems. Obviously the biggest issue is not what to do but how to get politicians to do it- but that’s true of any book of philosophy, economics or politics that tries to do something radical.This book is hopeful because it shows us how the major changes we need to eradicate world poverty, produce more equality and produce a better quality of life are actually simple. It also reminds us that with enough push, the impossible can become actual. It’s really odd that his ideas echo so many points made by Zizek, despite their huge differences. Bergman is anti-high theory, anti-ideology and less critical of free markets than Zizek, whereas Zizek is entrenched in theory, admits we cannot avoid ideology and is highly critical of capitalism at every turn. However, both argue similar points: the belief that minor changes can be made to capitalism seems like Utopianism, pie-in-the-sky navel gazing nonsense, but all big ideas seemed this way at some point; ultimately, with the absence of a true change of the entire system, we have to radically change what already exists; the revolution is a revolution of ideas and thinking, not of seizing land and machines; Utopianism is not an end state, but a way of thinking- always with that expanding horizon in the distance; and finally, that the left enjoys defeat and has begun to identify with it too much. It’s nice to see two incredibly opposed individuals finding two ways of making the same points. Read it. This book is vital. Even if you don’t agree totally (from either a pro-capitalist or pro-socialist standpoint) you’ll find something in here to make you radically reassess what you already think."
282,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50270175-frances-maxwell,5,"I LOVED this book! The world seems so depressing at the moment, with the likes of Trump and Brexit and what feels to me like a constant threat of impending doom (maybe that's just my anxiety speaking!) This book reminds you that we are living RIGHT NOW in an incredible utopia compared to where we were in the past. This is the best time to be alive in human history. And what's more, there could be an even brighter future with equality for all and the abolition of poverty across the globe, if only we would dare to dream.I loved the ideas in it, which include universal basic income, a shorter worker week, and open borders, each of which he discusses at length. Open borders, in particular, is seriously radical, but morally his argument is sound - borders are a form of global apartheid! How terrible is it that your chances in life are determined by where you are born. We allow everything else to move freely about the world, but not people.I found it really interesting how major political movements tend only to occur after a crisis (before this happens, politicians will only suggest things that don't stray too far from the status quo), and how neoliberalism, for example, came into fruition after the Arab oil crisis in the 70s thanks to decades of simmering (a group of thinkers had been discussing it at length since the 30s). However after the 2008 crash which proved that that it wasn't infallible, there were no radical alternative ideas brewing (!) so we've stuck with the same flawed model. Thinking up and discussing new ideas is CRITICAL to moving forward.I loved the section on 'underdog' socialism, because it's so true! One of the successes of Trump's campaign is that he knows that people like to be on the 'winning' side and yet the branding of the left is all, 'sigh - welfare is expensive but a moral must' (basically, 'we're morally right but an economic disaster') whereas in fact the ideas the author discusses not only eradicate inequality and poverty but result in astonishing economic success. This is the message the voters need to hear.If you're thinking this is too good to be true, I get that. There was a stage in the book where even I - a total ignoramus - felt the arguments were naively optimistic, along the lines of, 'these ideas are the solution to everything and have no down sides', and I guess I was looking for more of a critical analysis, but towards the end I felt reassured that his work is rooted in extensive research, and that he himself is aware of the dangers of bias (he discusses this, including cognitive dissonance, in later chapters and gives an example of his own).In any case, a vision is a vision, and it should be radical. I loved his. I want to live in that world. And it actually feels feasible! Let's do this, people!Definitely read this book!"

I then found out that Rutger Bregman was also a real writer, and he told off the fuckers at Davos too. So let's have a look, I thought.First, he presents his ideas well, and presents them honestly, and I can certainly agree with all of his prescriptions, which, as a democratic socialist, shouldn't be surprising. My only regret is that his analysis is a bit skin-deep at points. He diagnoses several of the symptoms of late-stage capitalism correctly, and provides cures for those symptoms, but what of the underlying disease? A UBI could be disastrous if applied from a libertarian rather than a socialist perspective, and as for open borders, there's a difference between actual open borders (good idea, but it needs a phase-in) and Koch Brothers-styled open borders (like how a Romanian working in Germany can still legally be paid Romanian wages by a German employer). Simply put, good effort Rutger, but you'll need a bit more depth if you wanna achieve top Marx (sorry, couldn't resist)."

I found it interesting how often the book discussed the US even though the author is not American. Reading this was so pleasant what with its talk of UBI, open borders, 15 hour work weeks, and the eradication of poverty, but then of course I had to go back to the real world and the clusterfuck we call the current political situation (bombs, war, border walls, eradication of human rights, elimination of healthcare, deportations, growing inequality) and I just can't understand why anyone would think this mess is the best we can do."

289,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31449816-zainab,4,"Using a primarily economic analysis, this book imagines a much more equal world – one that seems so near yet so far. Just as it says on the tin, this world is utopic but completely achievable. Rutger Bregman uses statistics and studies to expose the flaws of existing national budgets and priorities. His book is a fairly short read/listen that focuses mainly on the concept of Universal Basic Income (UBI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and “bullshit jobs”, as well as poverty and foreign aid. It also envisions what a future of leisure could look like for society. The text is written in a straightforward way, which is unsurprising as Bregman spends the final chapter critiquing an “aristocratic” left, or “underdog socialism”, which he argues is not accessible to a wider public and not invigorated with enough hope to catch on. I found it to be a useful listen with some compelling and entirely convincing arguments, particularly on tax evasion and open borders.However, for me, the book also felt like a repeat of many podcasts I listened to around the UK General Election of 2019 and a few years prior. UBI as the logical future and GDP as a farce are very familiar ideas. In fact, much of what Bregman imagines was proposed in the Labour Party’s manifesto, ideas which a global pandemic might help bring to reality. In addition, the book still felt quite Euro-centric in the framing of history/ideas, so it’s difficult to imagine, for instance, how a mineral-rich and currently impoverished country would transact within this utopia. The climate crisis, for me, also deserved a much more detailed mention in this imagined future. Rutger Bregman went viral alongside Winnie Byanyima at the Davos Conference of 2019 for confronting the billionaire tax evaders sitting before him. His book, Utopia for Realists, will explain why he knew what he was talking about."
290,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,4,"Let us be unreasonable and impossible, the author exhorts. But his book, short and sweet, is far from either. The idea of basic income fits into the paradigm of a realistic utopia, according to Rutger Bregman, whose penchant for popularizing penmanship and knack for narration keep the book interesting and informative, if not all that original. The book is best understood as an attempt to bring a whole bundle of progressive ideas into the mainstream, borrowing heavily from other classics. But what the book lacks in originality it makes up for in holistic vision.One of the most refreshing parts of the book is that the author does not demonize his political opponents, such as conservatives. And indeed, most of his strident criticisms are directed at his fellow leftists (""underdog socialists"") whom he accuses of wallowing in reactionary pessimism. As someone who is more libertarian economically, I found his criticism of the banking and the financial sectors to be embarrassingly misguided, although not any more so than your average left liberal economist. (He confuses corporatist kleptocracy with free markets.) And his implicit call for more regulation of the labour markets relies on a notion of collectivistic economic planning that confuses ideal theory with the predictable failure of public policy - thus betraying his own allegiance to REALISTIC utopias. Furthermore, Bregman's utopia seems too static and degrowth to really feel alive in the way that realistic utopians must live and grow.But overall I enjoyed his vision. The future belongs to those who can envision alternative possibilities and find the institutional means to bring them account. Universal Basic Income is a way to marry progressive and libertarian politics, and ""Utopia for Realists"" does a good job of showing the kind of vision that it inspires - even if there is still room for more realism in the mix."

It has stirred whole communities into action and wars have been fought over it. In this book, the author proposes a Utopia; the idea of a society where every individual is guaranteed a minimum basic income. No strings attached. I'm generally positive about such redistribution schemes, especially in light of the near future (AI, automation etc) but how do we pay for it? The author points out that we already spend an enormous amount in the war on poverty and social assistance programs. Eliminating this bureaucracy and red tape could save us a tremendous amount and make things more efficient at the same time. However, it won't be enough. A better way to think about this is to see it as an investment in humans. When humans can meet their basic needs, they can be more selective about which jobs they will sell their time and bodies to. They can take time off and invest in themselves. In a nutshell, we can eliminate poverty, redistribute wealth, and give people more agency in their lives. Well, what's the evidence that this can actually work? The author points out the example of Dauphin, a Canadian city where a minimum basic income experiment (the no strings attached kind) was tried out for 4 years and resulted in a drastic reduction in poverty and reduced hospitalisation rates. Honestly, I'd like more such experiments but the fact is that they're expensive and the results often take years to become visible. All in all, a perspective changing book."
292,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7599597-tom,3,"The book came out in an interesting time of a paradigm shift in political perspectives. The general population is increasingly disillusioned by the trickle-down economics in the Reagan era, and pushed into the ideal of equality. While the book presented many great statistics, evidences, and insights (compiled from many different sources), it presented a few weak arguments. And through the weak argument is where the author's intellectual elitism wafts out of the writing. The author considers himself to be an arbiter of value, despite being minimally trained in economics. Somehow careers such as financial services that involves studying efficient capital allocation or corporate councils who protect the legal integrity are pointed out as bullshit jobs, all the while artists, philosophers and social study group champions are the true creators of wealth and drivers of economy. I'm not against the idea of wealth redistribution, but discounting the drive and ambition of educated professionals, and forcefully assigning high economic value to liberal disciplines, shows that not only does the author have a very limited understanding of economics, but also the left-wings' resistance of something as basic as free market.

Bregman gives a list of new (though mostly old) ideas that seem counter-intuitive, but he presents them in a way that also makes them logical, sensible and doable.

I also think it's a fascinating companion to A Whole New Mind by Daniel Pink. "

It was pretty obvious that this started out as a book about UBI and the other issues were kind of tacked on, as they weren't as well researched or explained. There was also the long section on the economy and GDP that I didn't really need, because it didn't really help me understand the economy any better (I never will) and it was pretty long.This book was first published in 2014 in the Netherlands (I think), so there are some things that are more optimistic than I would be today. Also, a lot of the book focuses on the US, and it talks about inequality, but barely discusses race at all, which I think was a gross oversight. It's impossible to talk about inequality in the US without at least a cursory mention of the history of race. At one point, it used the US as a positive example for immigration bc of how the country was ""founded"" and all of the progress its made, which is great and all, but the mass immigration to this country wasn't so great for the people who were already here, so it's kind of a bad take, bro.I appreciated the last chapter's acknowledgement of studies that oppose the policies discussed in the book and how differing views can often entrench us further into a belief. I thought it made some interesting points about how change is actually achieved: laying groundwork for a policy and then a crisis activates it by showing that the new system would handle it better. Change can't be made if there's no alternative offered before the crisis, which is what happened in 2008. I think that mindset is especially relevant during present day's actual crisis and just hoping that we've laid some kind of groundwork for the change.Notes and Quotes:- ""you can't pull yourself up by your bootstraps if you have no boots."" -Joseph Hanlon- 80% of Americans were pro-UBI in the 60s- Henry Ford giving all his employees big raises in 1914: aww, sweet. him doing it bc then they'd be able to afford his cars: figures- “the inability to imagine a world in which things are different is evidence only of a poor imagination, not the impossibility of change”- ""... what is the value of free speech when we no longer have anything worthwhile to say? what's the point of freedom of association when we no longer feel any sense of affiliation?"""

By starting to read this book I read about a lot of facts and concepts which were directly related to the economy and social life that were not obvious to me before. The style and format of the book are perfect. If you want to read this book, prepare yourself to face a vast number of relevant statistics. ---------AZE: Amerikalıların üçdə ikisi 2 həftəlik məzuniyyəti əlavə 2 həftənin məvacibindən üstün tuturlar. Eləcə də biznes mütəxəssislərin böyük əksəriyyəti vəzifələrinin bir o qədər də əhəmiyyətli olmadığını düşünür. Biz acığımız gələn iş yerlərində bütün günü işlədikdən sonra bizə lazım olmayan şeyləri almağa başlayırıq. ""Realistlər üçün utopiya""da holland tarixçi və jurnalist Rutqer Breqman, bunların heç də belə olmamalı olduğunu qeyd edir. Beynəlminəllik və praqmatizm manifesti kimi Breqmanın kitabı əsas 3 ideya ətrafında formalaşıb: 15 saatlıq iş həftəsi, ""universal minimal gəlir"" və sərhədlərin olmadığı dünya. Bu iddialara dəstək məqsədi ilə kitabda ötən əsrin 70-ci illərində icra edilən ""Mincome"" təcrübəsi, evsizlərə verilən qarşılıqsız pul təcrübələri və müxtəlif çoxsayılı statistik faktlar yer alıb. Bəlkə də bu iddialar heç də qeyri-real deyil. Nəinki qeyri-real, cəsarətli olsaq, bəlkə də zəruridir deyə bilərik, çünki daha az saatlı iş həftəsi daha az iş xətası, ətraf-mühitə vurulan zərər, daha az stress, qəza və iqtisadi qeyri-bərabərlikdir. Breqman vurğulayır ki, dəyişiklik ideyalarla başlayır. Nə vaxtsa bizim bu günümüz keçmişdə yaşayan insanların utopiyası idi. Ona görə də ifrat istehsal və istehlak kimi problemlərin öhdəsindən gəlmək üçün gərək ilk növbədə qurduğumuz sistemlərə olan yanaşmamızı dəyişək. ""Realistlər üçün utopiya"" kitabı bizə cari iqtisadiyyatların qeyri-reallığını, ideal və ya utopik hesab edilən iqtisadi sistemlərin isə reallığını çox möhtəşəm və axıcı dil ilə izah edir. Məncə, kitabı oxuduqdan sonra heç kim bir daha düşündüyü ənənəvi fikirlərini və ya doqmaları yada salmayacaq. Kitabı axtarıb-tapıb oxumağıma əsas səbəb Rutqer Breqmanın öz kitabı haqqında The Economist-ə verdiyi müsahibəni dinləməyim olmuşdu (müsahibəni dinləmək üçün keçid: http://bit.ly/Ukutopia_Bregman). Bir iqtisadçı kimi mənə maraqlı gəlmişdi ki, görəsən yuxarı abzasda qeyd edilən məqamlar haqqında özünə belə inamla və güvənlə danışan şəxs nə dərəcədə ciddidir və nə dərəcədə real və yaxşı bilgilərin toplandığı kitab yaza bilib. Doqmalarımızı qıran ideyalar həmişə cəlbedici olur. Qısa müddət ərzində kitabı elektron olaraq tapdım və 1 ay ərzində yavaş-yavaş oxudum. Sonunda isə əsl düşüncə yenilənməsi yaşadım. ""Realistlər üçün utopiya"" kitabını sadəcə bəyənmək deyil, həm də onun faktuallığını nəzərə alıb qiymətləndirmək lazımdır. Son dövrlərin aktual məsələlərinə toxunan, müəyyən həll yolları göstərən və ən əsası fərziyələrlə deyil, real analitik yöntəmlərlə izahat aparan kitabı oxumağıma çox şad oldum. Sitat: ""Bəşəriyyətin möhtəşəm ölçü daşları olan utopiyalarla əlaqədar hər zaman şübhələr olub. Tanınmış sosioloq Albert Hirşmana görə, utopiyalar 3 səviyyədə hücuma məruz qalıblar: axırsızlıq (bu mümkün deyil), təhlükə (risklər çox böyükdür) və qüsurluluq (bu distopiyaya səbəb olacaq degenerasiyadır), amma Hirşman həm də yazır ki, necə ki utopiyalar gerçəkləşir, adi bir şey kimi qəbul olunmağa başlanılır"" (Breqman, Realistlər üçün utopiya, 2016) Kitab çox güclü kontrastlar üzərində qurulub. Bu o deməkdir ki, mövzular keçmiş dövrün gələcəyə olan yanaşmalarından hərəkətə gələrək, bu günümüzü də öz növbəsində hansısa gələcək zamanın keçmişi kimi qəbul edib, müxtəlif iqtisadi göstəriciləri ortaq məxrəcə gətirməyə çalışır. Məsələn, kitab ilk səhifələrində aydınlaşdırır ki, hələ Keynes 20-ci əsrin ilk rübündə daha az saata malik iş həftəsini iqtisadi cəhətdən məntiqli və düzgün hesab edirdi. Bundan əlavə, kasıb ölkələrin cəmiyyətlərin niyə görə kasıb olduqları ilə əlaqədar bir çox maraqlı təcrübə və məlumatlara əsasən səbəblər üzərində dayanılır. Qeyd edilir ki, kasıb ölkələr ona görə kasıbdır ki, onlarda sadəcə oalraq yetərincə nağd pul ehtiyatları yoxdur. Halbuki, həm media, həm də populist siyasətçilər kasıb cəmiyyətləri demokratiyanın olmamasında, insanların savadsızlığında və ya digər hansısa ictimai göstəricilərdə olduğunu deyirlər. Təbii ki, onların müəyyən əhəmiyyəti var, amma aparılan real təcrübələr və sahə araşdırmaları sübut edib ki, isanlara ilkin investisiyanı təmin edəndə, özləri həmin investisiyanı artırmağın yollarını axtarıb-tapırlar. Sitat: ""19-cu əsrdə bərabərsizlik sosial sinif məsələsi ilə əlaqədar idi. Bu günlərdə isə bu məkan ilə əlaqədardır. ""Bütün ölkələrin proletarları birləşin!"" uzun müddət müxtəlif yerlərin kasıb insanlarının əzabkeşliyini birləşdirən ideya olub. Bu gün isə, Dünya Bankının aparıcı iqtisadçısı Branko Milanoviç qeyd edir ki, ""Proletariat həmrəyliyi artıq ölüb, çünki artıq qlobal proletariat deyə bir şey qalmayıb.""""(Breqman, Realistlər üçün utopiya, 2016) İnsan özü özlüyündə çox qəribə canlıdır, çünki o xəyal edə bilir. Kitabın ilk səhifələrindən müəllif göstərir ki, bütün bu fiosoflar, yazıçılar və alimlər utopiyaların vasitəsi ilə bəşəriyyətin inkişafa və firavanlığa nail ola biləcəyini qeyd edirmişlər. Onlardan bəziləri isə artıq reallaşıb, bəziləri reallşmaq üzərədir, digərlərinin reallaşması üçün isə az qalıb. Utopiya anlayışının özü əslində inkişaflar üçün mühüm zəmindir. İnsan təxəyyülündə özünə varlıq qazanan istənilən ideya, hətta utopiyalar belə nə vaxtsa gerçəkləşəcəklər, sadəcə o istiqamətdə kiçik addımlar irəliləmək yetərlidir. Sitat: ""Abstrakt ideallardan fərqli olaraq, çertyojlar nifaqa tolerantlıq göstərməyən dəyişməz qayda-qanunlardan ibarət olurlar. İtalyan şair Tomasso Kampanellanın ""Günəşin şəhəri (1602)"" çox yaxşı nümunə təklif edir. Bu utopiyada və ya distopiyada, fərdi mülkiyyət ciddi olaraq qadağan olunub, hamı bir-birini sevməyə məcbur edilib və dava-dalaş ölümlə cəzalandırılır. Özəl həyat, intim məqamlar da daxil olmaqla dövlət tərəfindən idarə olunur. Məsələn, ağıllı insanlar ancaq axmaq insanlarla yatağa girə bilər, kök insanlar isə arıqlarla. Hər bir təklif arzuolunan ortalamaya nail olmaq üçün tənzimlənir. Ən əsası isə, hər bir insan inanılmaz dərəcə çoxsayılı informatorlar vasitəsi ilə nəzarət altındadır. Əgər bir kimsə qanunları pozarsa, özünün könüllü surətdə pis vətəndaş olduğunu qəbul edəcək və başqaları tərəfindən daşlanacağına razı olacağı həddədək qorxudulurdu"" (Breqman, Realistlər üçün utopiya, 2016) Kitabı oxumaq qərarını verən şəxs bol rəqəmlərə və nümunələrə hazır olmalıdır. Belə kitabların mütaliəsi paradiqmadəyişdirici xarakterə malikdir və çox faydalı ola bilər. Rutqer Breqmanın ""Realistlər üçün utopiya"" kitabı birmənalı olaraq oxumağa dəyərlidir. Kitabı internetdə elektron versiyada axtarıb-tapmaq kifayət qədər çətin oldu. Əgər kitabı oxumaq istəsəniz, zəhmət olmasa aşağdakı keçidi istifadə edin. Keçiddə həm, pdf, həm də mobi versiyada kitabı yerləşdirmişəm. "

Both of these books explain the idea very well, but they have different strengths just the same. I think Yang managed to show more clearly the urgency for this system at this point in time as we are entering into the forth industrial revolution, while Bergman explains the history, and the science behind this idea better.It is a radical idea, and I’m not sure if I would have taken it seriously a few years ago. In fact, I don’t think I would have given it much of a thought until I started to read up on the pending industrial revolution. That is what made it realistic for me. There just doesn’t seem to be a viable path into that new reality with out some version of universal basic income. But what surprised me about the history Bergman presents is that it is actually a much older idea, and it had some really surprising campaigner for it. The fact that Richard Nixon is the American president that has got closest to getting that kind of system into action was one of those surprises. From listening to his party these days one would hardly expect that, but he did it because it seemed, even then, to make good financial sense. This idea isn’t just a shot in the dark, there is a lot of research behind it. So when people say it will not work because people are so lazy they will never do anything if they get free money, they need to show evidence for that opinion. What this book shows is evidence from other research that point in the other direction. All in all, I think this is an interesting book, and the case for universal basic income is very well argued here."
298,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37925908-psychonout,4,"Meanwhile the welfare state has increasingly shifted its focus from the causes of our discontent to the symptoms. We go to a doctor when we're sick, a therapist when we're sad, a dietitian when we're overweight, prison when we're convicted and a job coach when we're out of work. All these services cost vast sums of money, but with little to show for it. In the US, where the cost of healthcare is highest on the planet, the life expectancy for many is actually going down. All the while the market and commercial interests enjoy a free reign. The food industry supplies us with cheap garbage loaded with salt, sugar and fat, putting us on a fast track to the doctor and dietitian. Advancing technologies are laying waste to ever-more jobs sending us back again to the job coach and the ad industry encourages us to spend money we don't have on junk we don't need in order to impress people we can't stand.Then we can go and cry on our therapist's shoulder.That's the dystopia we're living in today."
299,0316471895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108599067-wout-biesheuvel,4,"Interesting read. Bregman certainly has thought-provoking ideas to share and makes you question, or at least wonder about how the world could be a different, better place. The book reads well, keeps you interested, and avoids being polarizing by building his arguments on ethical virtues. Instead he uses logical arguments and often refers research in favor of his viewpoints. The book obviously doesn't really tell you how to go about implementing his ideas; what could go wrong and neither talks about the not-so positive sides; maybe not for realists after all!"
