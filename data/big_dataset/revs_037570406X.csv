0,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/547639-collin-shea,4,"This book was originally written in 1970 with subsequent revisions in '85 and '92. Given that it's slightly outdated I wasn't sure how relevant it would be, especially considering all the different migraine medications they have now. I couldn't have been more wrong!The wonderful thing about Dr. Sacks is that he's not all about standardized, generalized drug-treatment and he has a full respect for nature. He considers each case and patient as an individual human being with all the uniqueness that implies.In addition, I was fascinated to read historical perspectives on migraine and realize that some of the insights from hundreds, if not thousands, of years ago are relevant and spot-on today.As someone who grew up with a neurologist father and watched my mother suffer terrible migraines only to develop them myself at age 12, I obviously had a selfish, personal interest in this book. When in my mid-30s I developed a migraine that wouldn't go away (Sacks writes ""migraine gathers identity from stage to stage, for it starts as a reflex, but can become a creation"") and spent the next two years going to the top migraine neurologists (one of whom Dr. Sacks quotes) and taking countless drugs. Eventually, realizing that the drugs were making me feel worse than the migraine, I stopped it all and have been developing ways to manage it on my own.In reading Dr. Sacks' book, I now realize that it was not the drugs alone that were exacerbating my situation...it was the doctors! ""The physician must not dominate or be dogmatic to the patient, must not play the expert, insist ""I know best""; he must listen to the patient; listen beneath words; listen to what his illness, the migraine, is ""saying"".My biggest frustration was that these ""experts"" that I sought help from did dominate and did insist that they knew best, to the point of literally telling me that some of the symptoms I described were not possible! If I could have Dr. Sacks as my doc, I might actually consider seeking medical advice again. Of further interest, Sacks provides numerous case histories and artistic renderings of what migraine aura look like as experienced by the migraineur. What a validation this was! I now have an actual picture I can point to and say ""that's what it's like"" when people ask me to describe my auras.Lastly, he provides a brief appendix discussing the ""visions of Hildegard"" and how there's ""no room for doubt concerning their nature: they were indisputably migrainous"". The excerpts from Hildegard's writings provided, once again, great validation and a beautiful new way in which to envision my migraine auras/visions.In the end, an excellent book for somone with migraines, but more importantly, for those who treat people with migraines to read. Sacks is a physician, so at times the book can be a bit heavy on the medical jargon, but not so much as to overwhelm. In addition to being a thoughtful, empathetic, and extremely knowlegeable physician, Dr. Sacks is also an excellent writer who uses language beautifully."
1,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/664309-vintagebarrio,1,"As a chronic migraine sufferer, I found Sack's work to be a huge disappointment. His information was outdated and biased towards the traditional attitude that migraines are stress induced. Migraines are so much more complicated than originally thought, a complex chemical and electrical reaction that can be set in motion by extremely diverse causes from brain tumors to multiple sclerosis to spinal injury, not to mention hormonal changes, trigger exposure, and altitude sickness, just to name a few. I would have expected a more enlightened, better researched book from such a luminary. Don't bother."
2,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5894339-greg,4,"The book synopsis pretty much says it all. I read this years ago. I remember it well because I could relate to a lot of what Sacks was saying. Still, it was somewhat frustrating and disappointing not getting a definite medical description or definition for migraine, and realising that there is no cure. And all migraineurs have different triggers and different physical symptoms. I have since found a real gem a book on the subject, The Keeler Migraine Method: A Groundbreaking, Individualized Treatment Program from the RenownedHeadache Clinic which explains migraine as a physical disability. It is a disfunction of sensory processing. "
3,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/576645-chet,5,"Visual migraines are terrifying experiences that physicians (and eye doctors) do not typically treat. This book was recommended by bloggers reporting on their own experiences, so I bought the book. The author gives an in-depth scientific treatment of migraines in general and visual migraines (auras) in particular. The book is written on a college science level.Some famous people with auras are mentioned and numerous artistic representations of auras are shown. Biological explanations are given and potential medications are discussed, as well as other strategies for dealing with auras. Some myths are dispelled.The biological explanations of aura are complex and no known cure exists. Various medications work for different people in different ways, and so are not generally recommended. ""Knowing your enemy"" helps remove the fear and cope with the situation.I am glad that I bought the book because it at least provided validation. ""Yeah, that's what it's like."" ""Oh, lots of other people are experiencing the same thing."" ""These other people have historically coped with this and I can cope with it, too."""
4,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2715247-james-klagge,3,"Recently I had what was diagnosed as an ophthalmic migraine, or a scintillating scotoma. This was the second event in about 2 months. There was no pain associated with it, and apparently it is not a dangerous condition, but it was certainly attention-getting. I had been interested in this book for several years, so I took the occasion to read it. While I am an Oliver Sacks fan, this is my least favorite of his books so far (I've read almost all of them). His strength is when he looks at some case study and follows it deep and wide. He is unequalled at that. Here he undertakes something else--to give an account of a wide-ranging phenomenon. Ideally this would amount to a theory of migraine--its cause, nature, and treatment. He fortunately is wary and honest enough to know that the phenomena of migraine are extremely wide-ranging, so the prospects of saying something both interesting and applicable to the full range of phenomena are small. But the desire to do so nevertheless opens one to the temptation of saying things that are vague or untestable. Sacks does not avoid these temptations. But for the most part he is true to the phenomena. The deepest problem comes from the title of the book itself. We have this word ""migraine,"" and so we suppose there must be something in reality that corresponds to it, about which we could have a theory. But when we are told that while ""classical"" migraines include headache and auras, and ""common"" migraines include headache but not auras, and auras by themselves can be ""migrainous"" phenomena even without pain (which is what I had), I wonder what you can do with that. One could take Wittgenstein's approach that a concept (like ""migraine"") can have a family-resemblance unity, that depends only on a variety of connections, none of which is necessary or common. Or one could take Socrates' approach that there must be some underlying unity of necessary and sufficient conditions (which seems awfully unlikely in this case). Or one could hold that the term ""migraine"" has just gotten out of hand, and is in need of some cleaning-up. This is the view sometimes called ""eliminativism""--in that the term should be eliminated, and replaced by other more specific terms. This was the fate of earlier terms like ""consumption"" (the medical term, not the economic term--which was jettisoned in favor of more specific conditions such as pleurisy, lung cancer, emphysema, and tuberculosis). It would seem more profitable to separate out the variety of phenomena that go under the label of migraine, rather than persevering in a search for what holds it all together. This search for what holds it all together leads Sacks to emphasize the psychological over the physical aspects, since it's pretty clear there isn't a physical unity. Sacks may be right that we should not ignore the psychological aspects, but that may be more a consequence of his search for a unity--somewhere, somehow."
5,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239063-john,4,"I read this book when I was in college, suffering from multiple classical migraines every week. It taught me to treat my migraines by hitting them hard with aspirin and coffee, just as I started to see the visual disturbance. I still get migraines from time to time, but never get a headache.Interestingly, Excedrin is an implementation of the Sacks treatment, because it contains aspirin, caffeine, and acetaminophen."
6,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175480-helen-helena-nell,3,"I've been reading quite a bit of Oliver Sacks lately and now I realise I've been reading the populist works. He can do easy read and he can do medical. This one is medical.However, I read it all the way through and I found it very interesting, even though there were quite a few medical terms that went right over my head. I think I was able to read the whole book simply because I do have migraines, so it all seemed personal, even the bits I didn't find entertaining and didn't really understand.What I most like about Sacks is the fact that he clearly finds everything he writes about so intensely interesting. He must have been thinking about migraine for decades.I don't think reading this book changed my understanding of what migraine is and how it affects people. Although it probably did tell me things I didn't know, it didn't tell me them in a way I could carry away with me. But I'm glad I read it."
7,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/569190-judy-vasseur,4,"I just briefly started reading this book on the subway, until I feared the swaying motion, screeching, piercing lights, incessant babble, and ear-splitting singing of the blind beggar might bring on a migraine.We can't blame it on florescent lighting, traffic jams, or the office because it’s been around at least since Hippocrates.If you experience migraines, either occasionally or constantly, this book can be an eye-opener to better understanding and coping with this mysterious complex event.Hint: having all your teeth (or other organs) removed and/or blood-letting probably won’t be affective. But some strong coffee and/or a shrink might be helpful!And go ahead and draw those blinking geometric lights... aura art seems to be all the rage. "
8,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17185512-jennifer,1,"At one time may have been cutting edge. I did enjoy the historical aspects of it, although Mr. Sacks is not a gifted writer so you slog and swamp through his writing. The information is outdated and you will not find a cure or a treatment plan. Anyone who says Mr. Sacks is empathic to the migraine sufferer, has never truly had a migraine. He does what doctors have done for centuries and subtly blames the patient, or implies they are a little crazy or off in ""the head"". Read it by all means, but than get some real information from a headache clinic or a neurologist & get the real help you need."
9,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5898097-fiona-robson,5,"Anyone who has the misfortune to suffer from migraines NEEDS to read this book! It explains so much. Sadly ... not really how to actually be CURED of them, but a fascinating read anyway, and it's always good to know you're not alone. Especially if you suffer from Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome, like I do, and it explains the links with sickness extremely well. Oliver Sacks is always a pleasure to read anyway, and has a lovely, readable style, despite dealing with complicated chemical explanations etc. "
10,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50915196-rebecca-rebecca,5,"Every migraineur should read this book. Sacks discusses migraine in terms of case histories, neurology, psychology, and the history of medicine. His account of migraine auras engage with religious figures and research on hallucinogens. The case histories are numerous and rich, and his digests of clinical experience are detailed, organized, and humane. You won't find some magic treatment for migraine in here -- there is none -- but you'll get a rich, historically informed, and sympathetic account of migraine from a sensitive and acute physician-writer.Note: the book was first published in 1970, and revised by Sacks in 1992. For all that, the pharmacology is only a bit out of date, and the neurology still appears to be current (to my admittedly non-expert and cursory attempt to learn of significant new developments). In every other respect, I doubt that anyone will do a better treatment of migraine experience for decades."
11,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1149791-christine,4,"I have to admit I started out strong with this book and then took the longest break ever. Then, I finally went back to it. The information in it is truly fascinating but it isn't the most fun read of all time. Musicophilia was interesting but had some fun. Oliver Sacks covers a lot of material. He goes over more case histories than I can count and discusses migraines as history essentially. He discusses the neurological makeup of a migraine and an aura in as much information as he knew at the time of the writing of the book. Sacks often ruminates when he writes and goes from topic to topic. He is a thinker and a listener, an interesting soul, almost a strange philosopher of sorts in my mind. This book is to be read for his thoughts, not for factual, ABC information on migraines. I would only recommend this to someone who has severe or chronic migraines and is well-versed on the subject and wants to hear the thoughts of a neurologist who cares about the subject. I disliked his Freudian mumbo jumbo...migraines are a neurological disease. I very much liked the information on migraine auras. That was interesting. It is a good book overall, but it reads kind of like a text book. Read it for the great content. "
12,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2731485-linda-branham-greenwell,4,"Migraine is a helpful book for people who suffer from migraines. It has full of rich detailed explanations and case studies. Dr. Sacks is wonderful neurologist who is a migraine sufferer himself. I was amazed at how many symptoms a migraine sufferer can have besides the actual headacheI also suffer from migraines and have found that many of the weird experiences I have had are part of the migraine syndrome. In another of his books, Hallucinations, Dr. Sacks details Alice in Wonderland syndrome -which are symptoms I had frequently as a child - but no one understood what I was talking about. I think they thought I was making it up. I have a few occurrences in later years. I also have experienced optical migraines - auras - recentlyThis book, Migraine, is a bot technical in places - for those of us who are not medical doctors or neurologists - but I found that I could still follow what was being said. I wish I had read it years ago when I was experiencing frequent headaches"
13,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1937311-mel,4,"I wish that I had read this book 7-8 years ago when I first started experiencing migraines. I wish that the numerous doctors and specialists I had seen had also read this book. Oliver Sacks doesn't provide a magic answer for the cause or cure of migraines, but his discussion of the different types of migraine, as well as contributing factors to migraine attacks, brought up some good points which cleared up some questions my doctors were never able to answer satisfactorily. Most interesting, of course was the section on migraine auras - particularly the idea that the cat artist Louis Wain may have painted some of his ""psychedelic cats"" during a migraine aura instead of a schizophrenic delusion. Check out Louis Wain on wikipedia to see examples..."
14,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30609603-andrew,3,"I'm probably not qualified to judge this book. I bought it, hoping that it would help me to understand my migraines. And it did help me out a lot. But it is, at times, fairly technical and maybe directed more at medical professionals rather than general readers. It's also probably out of date, having been last updated in the 90s, I think. A lot of the material holds up well, but I wonder how much has changed since then. Still a good read though. Well-written, as one would expect from Sacks. And it definitely gave me some insight into the nature of migraines. "
15,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/869088-janet,5,"I love all of Oliver Sacks books, but for this one, I'd say you would have to be a migraine sufferer to enjoy it. After reading this book, I really felt special and that I had a fascinating disease. Only Oliver Sacks can make you feel this way."
16,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10144333-michele,4,"I only made it through about the first 72 pages. But then I haven't had a migraine since then. I'm not saying I'll never get one again, but it's an impressive book. I would read it again if I started having them again."
17,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/371897-julian,4,I have these. They suck but knowing is half the battle right? 
18,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/881968-jason,4,"I don't suffer from migraines, so reading a book about them should have held no interest for me. And yet...the late great Dr. Sacks has managed to enlightening, inform, and entertain me again!"
19,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6551109-k,2,I didn't finish this before it had to go back because I just couldn't get into it.I get the feeling that maybe I've read it before?Just did not enjoy this as much as the other Oliver Sacks books.
20,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4743654-billie-hinton,4,"I love Oliver Sacks’ work in general, but picked this up after I experienced “forced reminiscence” as is described in his book about migraines. I have had migraines for many years, though mostly I have the pre-migraine aura symptoms, which are generally triggered by an intense beam of light or light through mini blinds in certain situations.Several years ago I had an experience I did not know how to describe. As it happened I wondered if I were going insane, and I called my husband and had him come home from work. It lasted about an hour, and the best way I can describe it is to say it was like having deja vu superimposed on dream memories superimposed on reality. I felt like I was living in multiple ‘consciousnesses’ and it was scary and confusing.Most interesting, I was in the barn with my herd during a portion of the experience and the horses all got very quiet and stood without moving as I did chores, almost as if they knew something was wrong and they just wanted to help keep me safe by not moving at all. This book is a fascinating read and explains the biology of migraines as well as other aspects of the condition. A technical and good read if you have interest in this subject OR if you just happen to be a big Oliver Sacks fan."
21,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63562469-nea,5,I‘m biased. 
22,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68919343-feliciaaslund,4,"The first chapter alone taught me more about my own migraine than all the doctors I've met (during 17 years of migraine) combined. Impressive to read Sacks openly admit he was wrong about some things in the first edition of the book. Always like people who are able to admit they were wrong. Also, I like that he actually covered menstrual migraine as it is an issue for plenty of women with migraine but usually overlooked, especially by male doctors. Could have skipped all the Freudian libido theories though."
23,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8302208-steve-voiles,4,"It is always a bit of a slog reading Sacks, because he does not dumb down the complexities of his own hard won understanding. Migraine is a prime example of that: his range of thought, his elaboration of detail and historical reference is immense, and often confusing to those of us who are less acquainted with all the disciplines he employs. This is not a page-turner but a labor of thinking. At times I was tempted to give it up, seeing it as too indulgent, to specific an area of study for a layman, but, as always, I ended up being glad I persisted.If, however, you are not passionate in your curiosity about perception itself, you probably won't want to invest the time and concentration this volume demands. If the evolution of comprehension and its mechanisms is exciting to you, this book with leave you intrigued and amazed."
24,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6854702-elizabeth-roberts-zibbel,4,"Of course much of the book is outdated, but it is a must read for anyone with migraine disease. Love Sacks’ writing."
25,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4807369-janday,4,"I suffer from chronic migraines and I just wanted to know more. I have never seen a migraine specialist or a neurologist, although I know my mother sees a neurologist regularly for her migraines. The only people I have ever spoken to about my migraines are general practitioners, and the only treatment ever prescribed has been medication-only -- medication which, after about three months becomes useless as I have built up a tolerance. So I wanted to know what an award-winning neurologist had to say about the pain I endure almost daily for the past 21 years.The book was originally published in 1970, but this edition is an overhaul from the 90s. Dr. Sacks often refers to what he originally published, and how research has changed since then, giving the reader a good historical look at migraine research. The text, although claiming to be written for non-physicians, gets very clinical at times. I actually had to skip two whole chapters on the Psychological and Physiological Origins of Migraine because they were too dense with clinical jargon. But most of this occurs towards the end of the book. The chapters on parts of a migraine, types of migraine, and structures of migraine were very informative. It was quite comforting to know that nearly half of the population has experienced the type of pain that I face on a nearly daily basis. While the text does not offer answers or treatment, it does offer a compassionate, comprehensive view of migraines. When I read the passage that urges physicians first and foremost, to form a collaborative relationship with the patient, to trust that their descriptions of pain and visual/auditory hallucinations are true and accurate to the best of the patient's ability to describe, and not to balk at lengthy and intrusive questions about the patient's emotional well-being; I nearly wept. This is what I have been missing from every encounter with a general practitioner. As if walking into a clinic and having a twenty-minute appointment with a doctor will provide an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan! The text has shown me how to talk about my migraines and what descriptions are important when I finally do get to talk to a specialist. General practitioners take note."

28,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16010931-douglass-gaking,3,"This is not Oliver Sacks' best work. I read this to get some medical insight on my migraine condition. Sacks puts the primary blame for migraines on psychological, rather than physiological factors, despite the fact that migraines are primarily a genetic disorder. He considers most cases of chronic migraines to be psychosomatic, which I have a hard time buying. The book can get very dry, and I found myself starting to skim, which I rarely do when I read. It does not help that the topic of migraines is not nearly as exciting as a topic such as Sacks' Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain, so I give him some credit for that. This book is also very dated. Much of the research was done up to the 1970's. It was republished with many additions in the 1990's, but it still feels dated, and many discoveries have been made since the 1990's that put it even further behind. This is a worthwhile read for someone who has migraines and wants to learn more about it, as long as you understand that much of it is dated. Other than that, it is not a great book, and you would be much happier reading Sacks' other works."
29,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17266774-dominic,3,"I have only read two of Sack's books but I love his style of writing and the personality he puts into medical books. The only reason I am not giving this book more stars was that I found some of the chapters repetitive and difficult to read or stay focused on. There were too many jargon words that he didn't clarify in the text. There was a glossary in the back but frustratingly I only found it at the end of reading, due to reading an ebook. The advantage of this was the in built dictionary on my device but even it didn't know some of the words. But basically even if I had known those words, it seemed certain chapters were not aimed at me, but rather those in the medical profession (which is clearly reasonable of a medical book to do!)Those chapters I could read easily (most of them) were fascinating and shed a lot of light onto the subject of migraines, of which I find I suffer from the occasional Classical Migraine variety. It also helped tie in many other experiences I have had in my life as possibly migraine related. I'm glad I read this book even though at times it was a real slog to get through!"

A friend or family of someone who suffers from migrainesWith that said, the book is dense and can be slow going for those of us not verse in medical literature and terminology. However, the (now well thumbed) glossary at the end of the book was of invaluable help. The terms not in there, I just guessed as you can figure out from the context of their use enough to keep reading and neither interrupt the flow nor miss important details. The book is extremely well organized and Oliver Sacks leads through the history of migraines and migraineurs, with ample use of case histories and citations of other studies to build the readers understanding so that by the end, you understand that a migraine may or may not be a 'convenient' escape for the sufferer, and that the migraineur is not a hypochondriac: they truly are suffering. If, as I do, you know someone who suffers from this ailment, I would highly recommend reading this book and then pass it along to your ailing family member or friend."
31,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/797975-kristen,0,"I bought this book on a whim a couple of Fridays ago because I was in a bookstore and it had been on my list of things to read for a long time. I brought it home and immediately started reading it. And then, when I went out with some friends, I got a migraine that lasted through Sunday. Argh.I'm not sure I'll finish the book -- evidently the power of suggestion is strong for me. But the illustrations are really great -- I've always wanted to be able to show people what my vision looks like when a migraine is coming on and there is a painting in the book that could have been drawn by me (if I were artistically inclined). The wide variety of symptoms that come together to create a migraine is very interesting. Headache is optional -- a migraine is really a whole constellation of other symptoms. Fortunately for me my migraines are still quite mild compared to many of those he describes in the book -- yet another reason for me not to pick the book up again! I don't need to make mine worse. :-)"
32,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11656238-anthony,3,"Oliver Sacks talks at length about migraines, a neurological problem he is fascinated by because of its varied manifestations and the auras that can precede them. There are classical migraines, common migraines, and then a handful of other classifications that he goes into. I enjoyed learning about migraines, and never knew that the symptoms went far beyond just the severe headache and sensitivity to lights. Migraine auras in particular are peculiar phenomenon that were fun to read to about.Throughout the book, Dr. Sacks has some great writing and discusses themes that make all of his books satisfying to read (the blend between science and philosophy, the relationship between doctor/patient, what can be clinically captured and what is left mystery), but I would suggest his other books before picking this one up. I found Migraine to be particularly dense and more ""doctor manual"" -y than some of his other books, but perhaps this is due to my own intellectual shortcomings. "
33,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10805992-ashley,4,"Oliver Sacks work is, for the most part, quite accessible to the non-technical. This book, however, was written in the early '60's before he got his lay person jive on. He did a decent edit in the '90's, but it's still very technical. I will admit to keeping the Dictionary.com app at the ready. Still, I found the content fascinating. Here is everything you wanted to know about migraine and more: the different types, the varying symptoms (both common and freakily rare), the methods of treatment, the pathology, etc. I found the beginning of the book very interesting. Though I'm fascinated by neuroscience, the last few chapters bogged me down too deeply in the mechanics of it and were a bit of a slog, which is why I knocked off one star. Still, I would highly recommend this for anyone interested in the subject."
34,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5636777-kevin,3,"Sacks covers all aspects of the migraine experience in this book. near-exhaustive.the science and scholarship are top-notch. he added an update to this edition covering recent advances in knowledge and treatment and modified his own prior statements, realizing he’d been wrong.including the art was important. it allowed non-sufferers to get a glimpse into the experiences of having a migraine and show that migraines really are not all about pain.he’s a good writer and does his best to talk with his audience but, in the end, it’s a clinical neuroscience book rather than a story even with all the case histories included. Hallucinations did a better job of marrying the scholarly delivery with storytelling. that’s a purely aesthetic assessment. making an encyclopedic book like this readable is an achievement."
35,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36877-mike,5,"A really fascinating, in-depth look at a common but mysterious illness. Sacks is one of my all-time favorite authors because of his thoughtfulness and thoroughness. He writes about medicine as both a science and an art, the study of patients just as much as, or more than, disease. (He explains that the primary method in treating a migraine should be to LISTEN to the patient.) The book starts with a historical account of the study of migraines and descriptions of its many forms. But the most interesting sections, for me, were the explanations of the biological and psychological ""roles"" that migraines are thought to sometimes fulfill, and the modern discoveries that have provided new insights into the illness (and its treatment) and the human brain/mind in general.

36,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2976142-thomas-edmund,3,"As a 'migraineur' I personally found this book enjoyable, reading about familiar symptoms and experiences (while also feeling glad I didn't experience the mosaic vision that some do)Although for those merely interested in increasing their knowledge, and even in fact for myself with a personal interest the book meanders considerably. I wasn't exactly sure what the difference between Part's II and III were, and it felt like there was much repetition across chapters (especially the concluding chapter)The section on psychological causes for migraines was hilarious (I must have emotional constipation...) although even updated in the 90s (not that long ago science-wise) feels pretty dated."
37,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8450145-adrian,3,"Definitely more medically-oriented than I was expecting coming from OS, but non the less a great synopsis of a terrible condition that seems elusive to modern medicine. I enjoyed the discussion on auras and circumstantial/situational migraines. Furthermore, the chapter on the her pairs was brief , but I could read OS pero snap philosophy of talking to the patient and listening to the patient come across his words. I did sometimes become lost in the innumerable details and that why I scored it at a 3 as I feel that clarity should go above information delivery. Lastly, the long road vs the short cut epilogue was great and I am glad that I can ask more of my physician. Someone who will listen to me as an individual. "
38,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27144503-nosemonkey,4,"If you get migraines, this is well worth a read - if only to discover that there are plenty of other people out there who have it far worse than you do. As a semi-regular migraine sufferer (auras rather than headaches, with a few bonus side-effects from forgetting the meaning of words to mild hysterics), this was fascinating. Made me realise that many other things I've experienced are symptoms (including digestive issues, utterly bizarrely), as well as that migraines shifting their intensity and patterns is entirely normal - and utterly unexplained.So no tips for dealing with them, but at least that means I can confidently tell people to bugger off when they advise me to avoid coffee / cheese / wine / whatever as there's no such thing as a consistent migraine trigger."
39,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1201174-kathryn,3,"I really liked this book,I learned a lot not just about migraines, but Sacks also has a very extensive vocabulary and make allusions to everything from greek myth to historical events. This also lead the text to being a bit chewy on occasion. Also due to the fact that the book has been revised a number of times it was annoying when you spent the time to understand a chapter only to find out in the next chapter that the information was out dated. It gave a nice background to the current information, but the way it was presented was a little annoying. However, I think that any one curious about what the mechanisms and history of migraine are should read this book."
40,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14952063-katie,3,"Oliver Sacks' first book, this reads somewhat like a Thesis. It is not often that I have to reach for a dictionary on a page-by-page basis (or make use of the book's glossary). Nonetheless, although it shows signs of Sacks not having quite made the jump to popular science writing at this stage, the book is fascinating and already shows his characteristic kindness, fascination with the world, and desire to both understand and help the reader to understand the internal world of his patients and subjects. Well worth a read for anyone with an interest in migraines, or in neurology more generally. Just keep a medical dictionary (or google) to hand."
41,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5482838-aimee,3,"This is an Oliver-Sacks-3, which means it is better than other books that I have rated a 3, but I have high standards for Dr. Sacks. There is some very fascinating material in here but it is much denser than I was expecting. His books are usually driven and organized by incredible case studies, but in Migraine, the case studies are used in a more traditional, academic sense: short paragraphs sprinkled in each chapter to illustrate various points. I learned from this book, but it took me a month to get through."
42,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12818720-kazen,3,"If you suffer from migraine as I do you'll find large sections of this book interesting and informative. I'm glad Dr. Sacks updated the information in 1990, though another edition for the new millennium wouldn't be out of place!Some chapters had no relation to my own experience (pages and pages about everything aura) but the parts that did were well-written and very interesting. A recommended read for migraine suffers as well as their loved ones, so they can have a glimpse of what an attack can be like."
43,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/649761-jana-bouc,3,"As a migraine sufferer I was interested to read what the illustrious Dr. Sacks (also a migraine sufferer) had to say on the subject. I did a speed-read of it in the library, skipping the stories. It was written in the 1970s -- too long ago to cover the modern prescriptions drugs that work pretty well with minimal side effects. But it was interesting to read about the history of migraine research and the various categories of migraines and their effects. It was a little too close for comfort. "
44,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18852672-molly-gauthier,3,"The book reads like a catalog of headache types and symptoms with some personal stories. Some points were really interesting, such as the similarity between migraine and epilepsy. But if you are looking for practical advice on healing your migraines, this isn't your book. I have finally succeeded in healing my own migraines. The culprit was mercury poisoning. The cure is in s book called Amalgam Illness by Andrew Cutler."
45,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/754524-lorrie,3,"Not the most current but helpful in that it explains the complexity and different forms migraine can take. If you suffer from migraines, especially the atypical symptoms, it will help you realize you are not alone. That said, it is not a how-to book. It is much more academic and brings in medical, psychological, and historical perspectives. It can be quite dense and is not an easy read. It is best for getting a context and wider view of the condition."
46,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237216-emily,3,There *luckily* has been a lot of progress in Migraine science since this was written (see The Migraine Brain for more) but there's still much to be gained from spending time with this book. Sacks is cheerful traveller on the painful Migraine road and he offers some really interesting historical context. There's more medical details than I'm used to in a Sacks book and they are highly skippable but it's worth checking out what Sacks had to say about this fascinating condition.
47,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12840458-kalena,2,"Even though there was a lot of research in this book, it was difficult to read and not what I expected.

85,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1279204-julene,3,"This book is very medical, with interesting case studies. What I really like is that his view of migraines is overreaching including both the physical and the symbolic level. I also liked learning about the many kinds of migraines.Here is a sentence from the book, ""The diminution of motor activity and external ties during a migraine is matched by a great increase in internal activation vegetative symptoms and their attendant, regressive affects—a paradoxical combination of inner violence and outer detachment—Analogous to the dreaming of paradoxical sleep, or the concealed agitations and hallucinations of psychic stupors.""And, ""One of the recurring themes of this book is that migraines are enacted at many simultaneous levels, and that their machinery, similarly, may be set in motion at any or every level. Although the precipitant of periodic, idiopathic migraines is, by definition, a neuronal one, we must allow that equally effective trigger-mechanisms may exist at many other levels, from local segmental reflexes which have assumed a tic-like sensitivity, to recurrent stimuli at the highest level, in the forms of obsessive expectations, recapitulative phantasies, etc. Whether the clockwork is originally at a cellular level (as in allergen reactions), at a molecular level, at the level of cerebral periodicities, or at the level of motive and emotion, may subsequently become irrelevant, for the periodicity of the attacks may finally become immanent and entrenched (in italics) at every functional level."" (These quotes from Page 137.)He explores the theories of medical research on headaches:Willis: ExplosionLiveing: Nerve-stormsGowers: ConvulsivenessAll of these looked at ""instability, criticality, singularity, intensely critical states or configurations in the nervous system—slightest stimulus can have catastrophic effect.""By the time I was around page 203, reading ""Migraine"" gave me an actual headache. The paperback book I was reading has small print. I could not finish the book, I made it through about three quarters and read the appendix about Hildegard and her visions. There is a very compelling chart of allied disorders on page 203 that shows affliated diseases on a scale with timing along the bottom axis, so at the seconds end is Epilepsy, Narcolepsy, Angst attacks and faints and the beginning of spasmodic asthma moving into angina in Moderate where the Migraine and the migraine aura reside along with Vagal attacks, at the far Slow end stretching from days into weeks are manic-depressive cycles, catatonic and cataleptic reactions, and protractive vegetative reactions. This is a complicated illness and results in a dense but excellent book published in 1992. It makes me curious about new research, although I don't think I'll be reading medical books that give me a headache. "
86,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34560232-paul-westwood,4,"This is a really well researched book and as a migraine sufferer since 13 I learnt some very interesting things about migraines but it wasn't written for the layperson so it's really heavy going at times. Sacks uses complex medical and scientific language which was often way beyond my level of knowledge and was even too dense with complexity for me to try Googling it. There were times when I was reading whole sections which I barely understood and would begin to wonder why I was bothering reading the book. But I don't think I can blame Sacks for this because I don't think I was his target audience. The book is very well evidenced with Sack's is own research and clinical observations as well as that of what I assume are the other major studies on the subject. The things I found interesting: reading about the history of migraine studies and that there's evidence of people suffering migraines going back two thousand years; the different types of migraines I've suffered over the years are fairly standard and some people experience some weird and varied symptoms; the similarities between epilepsy and migraine; the similarities between migraine aura and drug hallucinations and the studies looking at the wave forms in the brain that cause them; the illustrations that people had drawn over the years to represent the auras they have experienced; all the different types of migraine aura people can experience; that migraine is way more than just a headache; that migraine appears to be a bodily mechanism designed to fix something but we still don't know exactly where the process starts and why it happens in all occasions. I was disappointed that there wasn't more about diet because I've identified and removed a number of things from my diet which trigger migraines: cheese, caffeine, chocolate [dehydration and computer screens are also my triggers]. In the original version of the book Sacks says there's no connection between diet and migraine but this version has been updated and has an extra section at the end of the chapter to say there is now evidence that for some people diet is critical. I would like to know more about this but at the time of writing I'm guessing there wasn't much evidence for him to draw from. Interestingly, caffeine is mentioned on a number of occasions as a temporary cure which means that a cure for some people is a trigger for others, just to confuse matters further. So don't approach this book lightly. It's very hard going but if you're patient and interested in the topic and don't mind being baffled at times by technical language you're very unlikely to know unless you're a health professional in a very narrow field then there is lots of really interesting information in here. "
87,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4162791-claudia-putnam,5,"Okay, so this was updated in 1992 and I suppose more could be said at this point about migraines, especially regarding diet, but basically they still don't know shit. This is harder going than a lot of Sacks's books, because he's at least as interested in the science and the history of the science as in the phenomenology, and because he's a sufferer himself and wants this puppy put to bed. Luckily for me, I shared the range of his interests. I was especially excited about his grid, kind of what spectrum people might do today, in which he places epilepsy, migraine, bipolar and a few other nasties along a continuum. All of which he calls NERVESTORMS. You could look at is as epilepsy = lightning fast storm, migraine = good long nasty thunderstorm or even hurricane, bipolar = polar vortex or heat wave that doesn't move for ages. Interestingly (to me, again), all can be treated with anti-convulsants, though hardly anyone pays enough attention to the effectiveness of anti-epileptic treatments with bipolar anymore. And interestingly again, Sacks's doesn't even mention them as prophylactics for migraine, though now they are standard. Perhaps they hadn't got to them in 1992.There's this weird sexism. Surely by the 1992 update, there were female neurologists, but to Sacks, all doctors are hes and hims. And any women whose interviews he includes regarding their migraines have to be characterized as ""exceptionally bright,"" as if otherwise they would not be trustworthy witnesses. No male informants are labeled this way. You'd think that an extraordinary mind like Sacks's would have been able to think its way out of that particular box. Still, what a helpful book. And how wonderful that some of the earliest observations about ""megrim,"" hundreds of years ago, remain the best. And that some of the paintings patients have done representing their auras look a lot like cubism.... One description of the process, from 1982, coming later. I really don't think we've come that far, since. "
88,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115410317-dingo,5,"Best book I've read about migraines. I have had migraines since my childhood and I am now in my 50's. Most books are mostly about what the triggers are and what you can try to do about it. I have tried all of them and I have felt at times that anything and everything was a trigger. Diets and eliminating triggers can help to a certain extend and if it helps for you great ! It means your migraine was caused by a bad lifestyle. Bad lifestyles should be dealt with, migraines or not. I've had a doctor laughing at me when I told I had migraines. My experiences with doctors is generally not been good. It's getting better though. This book helped me understand myself better. Also I remember a passage that Oliver sacks told one of his clients that he could help getting rid of the migraines, however it was no guarantee that he would get something else in place of it. I have felt utterly hopeless with my migraines. This book helped me to embrace this hopelessness and this helped me most of all, at the time. I do believe in that there are therapies and medicines which can help. Until I was able to do something about my nausea recently I was not able to take painkillers. Now I am. The difference is that I don't loose 2 or 3 days. However painkillers are great but you still have to go to the bottom of it otherwise you will end up with some problems which might be even more detrimental. This book can help you find your way to get more in depth with your problem as Oliver Sacks describes different cases. There is always something you recognise and helps you understand and embrace yourself better."
89,037570406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1709487-jenny,3,"Oliver Sacks is a famous neurologist who has interesting things to say about all sorts of brain conditions. I recently read this book, which explored many modalities and different considerations about migraines. It also discusses historical opinions and examples of migraines. I am glad we are past bloodletting. Unfortunately I think it is still occasionally considered part of women’s “hysteria.” This book was written in 1970 and updated in 1990. There have been many changes in medications in that time which really makes this book out of date medically. It is very clinical and is full of case studies from the historical writings, and the author’s experience. I had difficulty reading this book as a layperson. I did find it interesting to see how migraines have been considered historically. I read the kindle edition and did not realize that there was a detailed glossary in the back of the book, which would have been helpful. There were also some art plates of artist’s renderings of migraines. I loved seeing these, as they were both artistic and accurate from my point of view as a migrainer. "
