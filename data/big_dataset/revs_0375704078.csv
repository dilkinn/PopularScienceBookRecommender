0,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"I have been working a fair amount the last year with software that produces signed language - so I had to read this book, where Oliver Sacks presents his take on the strange and wonderful world of Deaf culture. I don't think it's his most objective piece of work, but it's impossible to be objective in the face of the monstrous injustice that has been inflicted on Deaf society. Even today, many people I talk to are not aware that signed languages are just as much ""real"" languages as English or French, and that signers make up a well-defined linguistic community with its own cultural identity. For a long time, it was much worse. In the first part of the book, Sacks tells the story of how Deaf people acquired signed language during the late eighteenth century and then had it snatched from them again a hundred years later by the utterly misguided decisions of educational theorists who thought it would be better for them to learn to talk; it is hard to read this section without feeling both sad and angry. Now, as he relates in the third part, things have improved, and signers are slowly recovering their rights; but it is easy to understand why they are so suspicious and untrusting when they come into contact with hearing people. We have behaved very badly towards them, and they have reason to fear us.The middle section, which makes up about half the book, discusses sign language from the point of view of late 1980s neuroscience. Sacks quotes some fascinating neurological/psychological studies: the most striking one involved a series of experiments with a Deaf woman who had suffered damage to the right hemisphere of her brain. As a result, she was apparently unaware of half of her visual field; but, remarkably, she still signed using a ""signing space"" of a normal size, which included the left side she effectively couldn't see. Sacks interprets this as showing that signers ""lexicalize space"", processing it with their language-oriented left hemisphere when they are using it for purposes of signing. Another memorable passage is about a signed Yom Kippur service at a Deaf synagogue. Sacks, himself Jewish, describes how the Deaf worshippers together sign the words of the holy Talmud with great expansive gestures, often making the signs above their heads rather than, as would be normal, in front of them; completely logical, since the Person they are signing to is God. I wish I knew how reliable it all is: Sacks is by his own admission no expert in sign language, and doesn't sign at all. I'll ask my signing colleagues if they are better informed. But it's a beautiful and heartfelt book, and I think that it has materially helped the Deaf community in their struggle to win back their rightful place in modern Western society. It makes me want to do more in this area."

I didn't hesitate, I would much rather be deaf, I thought - a world of perpetual darkness was to be avoided at all costs.To be honest, I never really thought about this question again until reading this book. I had no idea what costs deafness can bring with it.Sacks go through many of these costs and explains, in remarkably simple language, some of the 'age dependent' structures that form our minds - how certain rules of language need to be learnt at certain ages - and if they have not been they mostly will not be, ever. The need for the deaf to learn sign earlier rather than later could not be explained in a better way.He also explains Vygotsky's Zones of Proximal Development in a remarkably clear way.This is a wonderful book and one that deals with quite difficult topics in a way that is clear and easy to read."
2,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2990642-rowena,5,"“We are remarkably ignorant about deafness…Ignorant and indifferent.” I would definitely agree that I was relatively ignorant about deafness, probably because I didn’t know any deaf people until some months ago. Making the acquaintance of a young deaf man made me really curious about deaf people in general. This book taught me so much, it was truly enlightening.I think it should be read by everyone. Some of the stories about the deaf population's struggle for acceptance were very powerful and poignant, and I was embarrassed that I had been so unaware of their struggles. A great quote:“And to be defective in language, for a human being, is one of the most desperate of calamities, for it is only through language that we enter fully into our human estate and culture, communicate freely with our fellows, acquire and share information. If we cannot do this, we will be bizarrely disabled and cut off- whatever our desires or endeavours, or native capacities.”"
3,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1215485-megan,4,"Seeing Voices was originally published in 1989. That was a big in-between year for the deaf. In 1988 Gallaudet students successfully pushed for a deaf president of the university. And in 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act would be signed into law.As for me, in 1989 I was three years old. I had not yet been diagnosed with my own hearing loss. I had no idea who Oliver Sacks was, what ""deafness"" means, where Gallaudet is, or what American Sign Language is. Two years later my worried parents and grandparents would hear that I have a progressive sensorineural hearing loss, which began as a mild loss and has since progressed to a severe loss in one ear and a profound loss in the other.Since I was ""mainstreamed"" as a child - educated without special education classes in a typical public school environment - I essentially knew nothing of other deaf people except Helen Keller. It was only when I began to take American Sign Language courses from the local community college (to avoid having to take two years of a spoken foreign language, which just confused me) that I learned of a Deaf culture, a Deaf identity, and the struggle that Deaf people have faced over hundreds of years. In that class I watched videos and read books and learned about the culture from my Deaf professor. And I learned American Sign Language.ASL is an interesting language. Although it is functionally very beautiful, with flowing hands and a rhythm all its own, it can be off-putting to people not used to it. The gestures can be forceful (depending on the meaning behind the sign). Facial expressions are exaggerated along with the signing. Deaf people can be pushy: putting themselves directly in your line of sight, smacking you on the arm to get your attention, waving their hands all up in the air. So it was kind of uncomfortable at first. But there is something about sign language that draws you in. It feels right when you sign, even if you are hearing. It feels like you are just learning another skill, not another language.I picked up this book because I've read Oliver Sacks' books before and never realized he'd published one about Deafness and Sign. And because I have a blog, Hearing Sparks, and wanted to write about this book for it, so that people know if they ought to pick it up. I think I will publish both this review and some more in-depth blog posts about the subjects touched upon by the author there.Sacks splits his book up into three parts, which were all written at different times.Part 1 is a cohesive and very readable history of deaf people as well as information about deafness (both medical and cultural) and Sacks' own introduction to the world of the deaf. We learn in school about history from the point of view of American colonists (if we are American) and slaves, basically. Reading about decades passing from the viewpoint of the deaf introduces not only a third viewpoint but the idea that there are many other viewpoints from which history could be told. In this chapter, Sacks draws a line between prelingually and postlingually deaf. The postlingually deaf are relatively often the most successful deaf people, because they have the memory of spoken language, grammar, sentence structure. Prelingually deaf people face challenges distinct to them, and forcing spoken language on them can lead to unforeseen consequences.Sacks' position on oral vs. signed education for the deaf is subtly introduced in this part. He isn't forceful or annoying with his position; he simply lays out the way Sign is beneficial for the deaf, particularly prelingually deafened individuals. He closes with a visit to Martha's Vineyard, where nearly one in every family on the island was affected by deafness and every single individual knew Sign, deaf or not. (The knowledge of Sign drifted away as Martha's Vineyard became focused on tourism.)Part 2 is a systematic view of American Sign Language itself and the way people naturally create grammar and syntax from essentially nothing. This is the longest chapter, and unfortunately suffers from an excess of footnotes and a rather dry tone. As usual, Sacks shines when writing about individuals, and the case studies he recounts in this chapter are very interesting. He quite easily demonstrates that American Sign Language is a full-fledged language in its own right, and demonstrates how languages are developed.Part 3 was the most interesting chapter for me. Sacks details the 1989 student revolt at Gallaudet for a deaf president. He was there, and his writing about the sense of community at the college and the fervor the students felt is very interesting. The protest culminated in the appointment of King Jordan, whose resignation in 2005 would lead to further controversy when the board tried to appoint someone who was not fluent in ASL - only this time the protests also occurred online.Overall, although parts of Sacks' books are now quite dated, it's still a very interesting read. Sacks does a good job of bringing together a lot of viewpoints, a lot of individuals, and a lot of ideas, and making them all fit together. "
4,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/891126-melissa,3,"Oliver Sacks is a fantastic writer; thus, this book is a fascinating read. The reason it got only 3 stars from me is because he did not write this book yesterday... he wrote it more than 20 years ago. I'm a speech therapist, and I work with many children who are deaf or hard of hearing in a school setting. So much of this book is now dated - the technology, the ideas, the arguments about deaf culture - even the words he uses to describe people who are deaf are outdated. Cochlear implants didn't exist 20 years ago. Mainstreaming special education didn't exist, people were still discovering that ASL was a self-contained language, ideas about agency and self-determination among populations of people who have disabilities have completely changed. The Americans with Disabilities Act didn't even exist when he wrote this book, for pete's sake!Oliver Sacks is a good author and he wrote a good book, but developments in the field have shown his book to be time-bound. It's time for an update. I'd love to read the book he would write now!"
5,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29384668-antonio,5,"I'm glad a friend of mine recommended me this book, because before reading it, I knew almost nothing about deafness. As a matter of fact, I hadn't really given much thought about it in my life, since speech is something so natural in our lives. In its first two parts, The Deaf World and Thinking in Sign, Oliver Sacks talks about Sign, explaining in an accessible way, its origins and some of its neurophysiological characteristics - neuroplasticity and language development are also recurrent themes in Seeing Voices. After that, the author tells us about The Revolution of Deaf, which took place at Gallaudet University in 1988, when Gallaudet's students fought for a deaf university president.What really got to me in this book was discovering all the complexity hidden in Sign, in which the deaf build their culture and their own ethnicity. Not just people with a common language and some similar characteristics, but a people, with its own social and cultural identity. "
6,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1072582-kaethe-douglas,3,"The first two sections are a bit of a slog. Sacks goes into the history of educating deaf people, and he veers off all over the place into footnotes that are neither amusing nor informative. Despite that, he does manage to put the history of Sign and boarding schools for the deaf into both a historical and international context. To summarize, having successfully educated many people with Sign, demonstrating that deaf does not equal dumb in any sense, that hundred years of success was completely dismantled in favor of speech and language-focused education which returned deaf people into a second-class of people who were, truly disabled by the people supposed to be teaching them. Then, in the third section, you get people actually studying Sign, recognizing that they are real languages with real grammar and everything, and a deaf rights activism that results in the student takeover at Gallaudet. That part is interesting, not least because the recognition of a language really seems to lead to recognition of culture in both the ethnic sense (Welch or Gaelic, say) and in the human-rights sense (reclamation of the words ""gay"" and ""black"" as part of an ongoing battle to receive the full human status to which all people are entitled.There is also some interesting stuff on accommodation and mainstreaming which parallels more recent educational efforts demanded by people with autism. I really wish there had been some sort of update, though, because the book was published in 1989. Fortunately, the Internets were able to bring me up-to-date.Library copy."
7,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22591633-zanna,5,"The contents of this short book should be common knowledge, but to me they were as new as they were astonishing, enraging, exciting. Oliver Sacks admits that he is an outsider to the topic, and I hope his reputation will encourage many to pick up this volume on trust as I did, and be inspired to do something, at least to read further.To be born deaf, Sacks points out, is potentially devastating, because the deaf child can't hear people talking and therefore can't learn speech, and is thus deprived of language, the crucial vehicle of thought. But, language need not be speech; it can be visual, and deaf people generate visual languages, sign languages, wherever they are and especially wherever they meet. In the early 19th century, a few hearing people in France finally bothered to learn some sign language and used it to teach deaf people to read. Abruptly, everything changed and deaf people finally began to enter public life. American Sign Language was developed and everything was awesome, until the Victorians decided to ban sign language and force deaf people to learn to speak, which can only be done with thousands of hours of intense tuition. Deaf people returned to isolation and delayed educational progress. This situation has, to the date of Sacks' writing, improved little; the deaf are still heavily oppressed by the strange tyranny of the hearing. Developed sign languages like ASL are complete and awesome and highly expressive, and, to say the least, their use benefits the user, especially when sign is learned ""as a primary language"", by improving their perceptual and memory skills considerably. Hearing people who learn to sign use both modes among themselves, because they find it comfortable and helpful. Yet many hearing parents of deaf children, instead of learning sign, force their children to learn speech. Instead of true sign languages, signed transliterations (like Signed English) are used for teaching.Wondering if there had been any improvement, I started digging around a little, and at least I can see there's a very long way to go.As well as being an important history, this book has lots of fascinating information and reflection on language learning, especially in early life. I would push it particularly into the hands of anyone intending to ever become a parent..."
8,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126262-brooke,4,"This book is 25 years old, and while I'm certain there are more recent books on the topic of deafness, this one is still worth reading. It's not just about deafness, but about language, and how language shapes our brains, and how important language is to developing as a person. In just 150 pages, Oliver Sacks managed to blow my mind with things which had never occurred to me before. "
9,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5072847-will-ansbacher,4,"Another of Sacks’s interesting forays, this time into the world of the profoundly deaf. Sacks is a great guide because he leaps into any previously unknown topic (it was to him, too) with such enthusiasm, insight and lack of bias. I had no idea that Sign languages - like ASL - were so complex, so “4-dimensional” (compared to the single time dimension of speech), so grammatically alien compared to spoken languages; no idea that Sign would arise spontaneously between deaf parents and infants; no idea that Sign had been taught to the deaf by deaf teachers until the 1880’s when it was replaced by what appeared to be a vastly inferior system that existed for nearly 100 more years; no idea even that the frantic signing in the corner of TV screens was simply a transliteration of English and a totally different thing from Sign altogether. And so on.Although the final chapter concerns a strike at Gallaudet, a university for the deaf in the US, this is not about the politics of deafness and the Deaf community: rather, its focus is from his perspective as a neurobiologist and physician, so it is full of insightful observations about the development of language and thought processes that arise in the absence of hearing.Seeing Voices does suffer from the usual Sacks issue of excessive and extended footnotes (which he acknowledges, but says one can read or not), and for once I was going to ignore them even though they must make up nearly half of this short work. But, they contain so much that is interesting and integral to the story that I think you do have to read most of them. At least this time there appear not to be any footnotes to the footnotes!"
10,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11508273-charlie,5,"I first read this book in 1992, and have re-read it several times as my prelingually Deaf daughter has grown up. In many ways it is an odd book--A warm, wonderfully personal first section; a cold, complex scientifically explanatory middle section; and a passionate ending section. I disagree with the criticism that the book is ""dated"". All books are ""dated"" the moment they are published; there have been developments in the world of the Deaf, but nothing that changes the nature of communication or the human condition.Cochlear implants have happened; and they work best, as one would expect, with hearing adults who, like Rush Limbaugh, have gone deaf and have neither the wit nor the empathy to join another culture.But cochlear implants were the third or fourth time that deafness has been ""cured"" in the last 200 years, and as incomplete as any of the earlier ""cures"". If a parent has a deaf child, there are many choices one faces, but the first is a simple choice: Either my child is horribly defective and must be ""fixed""; or my child and I have a language difference, and I need to learn a new language. My wife and I chose the latter."
11,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/409011-leanna,5,"A small book that packs a punch. The author is a neurologist and so much of his book (specifically the chapter Thinking in Sign)covers how language is developed from an infant on in someone hearing and then how language is acquired by someone deaf. This chapter is only 60 pages long, but it took me over a week before I could move on. I reread several pages and a mere sentence held so much meaning and could reveal so much to me that I actually found myself in a study mode craving to learn more. The book left me with a feeling of knowing so little and wanting to know more. Anyone can benefit from reading a book like this, but it is special to me because I have a deaf family member. Before reading this book, I had a deep desire to learn ASL because my experience has been that although other family members sign, and can interpret for me, when we predominantly talk we are causing an isolation that leaves me feeling horrible. My desire is to be bilingual and Signing be second nature to me. I also found nuggets of wisdom in this book pertaining to deaf schooling. A theory revealed is that there is a critical time in our lives (between 18 months and 13 years)that our minds are ripe for developing language and that it diminishes after that. There is also some evidence that supports residential schools being crucial to the deaf in their growth. Our educational system may focus more on mainstreaming, but that really doesn't seem logical to me (for pre-lingual deaf children) given that mainstream schools have no consistent focus on bilingual Signing. We have an innate ability to acquire language, but we don't do it on our own. It is only something that occurs with someone else. So what better argument for being with those that Sign. Prior to this book, I thought of Signing to be pantomime and now I understand the depth of it and understand it to be a true language. I have never used the word lexicon and I had to look it up in order to understand some of the concepts in this book. This book also took a linguistic approach to dissect ASL and it was fascinating.  "
12,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147229-ci,4,"In my own social and professional contacts, I have not yet met a deaf person nor known anyone using Sign language. Before reading this book, if asked directly about Sign, I would venture to guess that it is probably some literal translation of written/aural language, maybe a sort of visual Braille-like formation. Well, if I would think a bit, such “visual Braille” would immediately be rendered impractical if not impossible. The first one third of the book is quite brilliantly written. Mostly, Dr. Sacks exudes on the importance of language to shape our cognition and psychological wholeness. “We speak not only to tell other people what we think, but to tell ourselves what we think. Speech is a part of thought.”, and “We start with dialogue, with language that is external and social, but then to think, to become ourselves, we have to move to a monologue, to inner speech.” But can linguistic development happen among the deaf? In great length, Sacks talked about the “linguistic use of space”, the vastly different modes of meaning-making aurally vis-a-vis visually. A few useful diagrams such as the one on “look at” have been very useful to bring his points home. The second third of the book is laden with neurological research on how brains of deal people may function differently. Some parts are repetitive, although the impression is that our brain’s plasticity may have been the reason for visual language. I wonder if one can learn Sign language, would it enhance the way we think?The last segment is the student strikes at Gallaudet University in 1988, a key event in the Deaf Culture. But the writing seems to be a bit repetitive. Overall, I enjoyed this book and perhaps gained some appreciation in Sign language and the unique culture of the deaf. "
13,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/785750-emily,3,"Blow up your idea of what language is, by reading this book.I get that it would have been interesting to hear Dr. Sacks's thoughts on CI, and that the politics and science of Deafness he documented in 1989 have progressed now, but I think it sells short how he clearly explained what he learned about What Makes Us Human from exploring the language and culture of the Deaf community."
14,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28971758-sue-bridgwater,5,"If you want to understand Deafness and Deaf people you must read this book, along with When the Mind Hears: A History of the Deaf [Harlan Lane] and Understanding Deaf Culture: In Search of Deafhood by Paddy Ladd."

This book answers such a question:What was life before Deaf Community stood up for its rights?Even Better: What allowed Families, Schools, Science to cooperate with the Change?What was the Crisis that led to the ChangeHow immediate was the ChangeSacks wrote this small jaw-dropping informative book at the just the right time to tell what led up to the Student Protests at Gallaudet in March 1988. The news from Gallaudet held our collective attention in places beyond the US for four (4) days.I am shaking with the power of the people who were considered less than. Many even agreed that they were less than.I am shaking because I continue to support my friend Joanie with a mild mental limitation, reminding her that she is an adult. When I met up with Joanie at the YWCA a few years ago, she said she was a girl and wanted me to be a girl. She now knows she is not a kid.

But I still thought it was a wonderful book - Sacks's account of the ""Deaf President Now"" revolution at Gallaudet University is emotional and enthusiastic, and his general fascination for sign language and the minds of the Deaf is infectious. And the endnotes - wow they are substantial! "

To be themselves, a unique culture in our midst, yet... co-equals, to every sphere of activity?""With the advent of cochlear implants - that's a question we continue to grapple with."
19,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1842160-courtney-williams,3,"I picked this book up in the library of the college where I studied British Sign Language. They have a small section dedicated to BSL and Deaf studies, which I'm sure I'll work my way through while my library card still works. Anyway, I was interested to hear Oliver Sacks' perspective on Deafness as a neurologist, so I decided to give ""Seeing Voices"" a go.This book definitely shows its age, having been published 25 years ago (before the Americans with Disabilities Act – and, indeed, the UK's Disability Discrimination Act – came in, as well as before cochlear implants became widespread). Some of the language shows this age, as well as the descriptions of contemporary attitudes. However, it's still an interesting and valuable read for a number of reasons. My favourite part was learning about deaf people who didn't have access to signing until later in life or not at all and how that affected their development. The historical context was well developed, particularly the discussions of different trends in the education of d/Deaf people. I also enjoyed reading about the ""Deaf President Now"" protest at Gallaudet University from a contemporary perspective, having first learned about it through the 
Stuff You Missed In History Class
 podcast.Unfortunately, I had a number of significant issues with this book that prevented me from giving it a higher star rating. First of all, the book is only split into three long chapters. Though there are some breaks, this format makes the various threads more difficult to follow. (It also makes this a difficult book to dip in and out of.) There is also quite a bit of unnecessary repetition, which always bothers me. The biggest issue, however, is the footnotes. There are several that take up half-pages and at least one that took up more than a full page. This interrupted the flow of the narrative and made the book difficult to follow, particularly as some footnotes were more relevant than others. I feel like a lot of the information could have been incorporated into the main text in an effective manner and I'm not sure why it wasn't.As I said, this book is quite out-of-date, and has a few other points against it. However, it offers an interesting perspective and is worth reading for that reason, as well as the topics it covers and being a product of the time in which it was written. I wouldn't recommend it as the first or only book you read on Deaf culture, but it's probably worth a read for anyone interested in that topic."
20,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7089510-alisha,4,"I'm considering being a linguist because of this book. There are some things, some existences that just cannot be explained. Sacks does a great job showing you just how much language can make a person, and does a great job trying to depict the life of the language-less. It's a tough existence that's darn near impossible to even imagine, but this book gives as good of a overall peek as you'll ever get.2018: Not sure what I meant by ""language-less"" when I wrote this. I hope I was referring to the ""Wild Boy"" and the like, people who were literally deprived of languages/communication. Not the Deaf/signers. After delving deeper into Deaf culture /ASL, I need to reread this book to give a more robust (and accurate, if my first review is as misguided as I'm suspicious it is) review."

I understand that deaf are better in visual skills, but take it on for 6-7 pages (I got tired after these, maybe more) is exhausting. Also, redundancy in information is not helping here (although that is present in most of the books I read from him)."

23,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147289-jason-pettus,5,"As friends know, here at the age of 50 I've started learning American Sign Language (ASL) for the first time, and am doing a deep dive into the politics and culture of the Deaf community with a capital ""D,"" as a way of compensating for my ever-decreasing hearing and hopefully opening a new avenue for my shrinking social life. (See my review of A Deaf Adult Speaks Out for a long explanation of what exactly ""Deaf culture"" is, and why it's so important to learn about before getting involved with the community.) I stumbled across this particular book at my neighborhood library, while looking up others that had been recommended to me in the StartASL.com online course I'm currently taking; and I'm glad I did, because it takes an intellectually fascinating look at the subject, as you would expect from this famous pop-culture scientist who has gained international fame and a Hollywood career from being able to distill complex scientific concepts into language that you and I can understand.Thankfully as well, this is a relatively tiny book that you can make it through in just a single day -- only 160 pages altogether, with half of that scholarly footnotes you can easily skip -- arranged in three parts, two of which were first published as magazine articles: part 1, in which Sacks looks at the invention of formalized sign language during the Enlightenment of the late 1700s, and how it was eventually criminalized for a century by the repressive Victorian Christians of the late 1800s (who claimed that ASL was ""ungodly"" and ""blasphemous,"" because the Bible clearly states that the difference between humans and animals is our ability to speak), originally began as a review of a book on the same subject for the New York Review of Books; while part 3, in which Sacks travels to Washington DC in order to be a first-hand witness to the Gallaudet University student protests of 1988, and waxes philosophically on the civil rights movement and the history of the deaf being treated by the hearing as ""ignorant children,"" was first printed in the same publication. The original part 2, then, which comprises the majority of this book, is an in-depth look at the neurology behind all language, what happens in the brain when a person signs instead of speaks, and what we can learn about ASL as a legitimate language by looking at deaf people with various confirmed maladies of the brain, and what happens to their particular signing because of these maladies.Here 30 years later, perhaps the most interesting thing about this book is that it's arguably the first-ever memoir of a hearing person who ""got woke"" after the astounding developments within the Deaf community during the late '80s, a public intellectual who freely admits that he hadn't even really given Deafness a second thought before writing this book, but has come out the other side awed at the complexity and linguistic richness of ASL, the resilience and courage of the Deaf community, and the appalling discrimination that was inflicted on this community for decades without any of us even noticing. In the decades since, this dawning awareness has been happening among more and more of the hearing population, usually through spikes in the popular culture that gain unusual notice, whether that's the '80s movie Children of a Lesser God, Marlee Matlin's Emmy-winning guest role on Seinfeld in the '90s, or the massive popularity among Generation Z teens for the 2010s Disney Family Deaf-culture soap opera Switched at Birth (about which I've written an entirely separate essay in the past, for those who might be curious). Apart from Sacks' neurobiological look here at ASL as a language, which can sometimes become much too technical for a lay audience, it's his engaging wokeness that's the main takeaway here, a lesson in tolerance and the pleasures of intelligent curiosity that we can all learn important things from. This thin, fast volume comes strongly recommended in this spirit, especially if you're not planning on reading any other books on Deaf culture."

How, I ask myself, do I begin to convey the complexity of my emotions; or rather, the complexity, it seems, of my journey throughout this book, this manifesto. At once, scientific and personal, Oliver Sacks delivers a profound, moving and at many times emotional study and exploration of the world of Deaf People (capitalising intended) and Sign Language.Set in three parts, 'A Deaf World', 'Thinking in Sign' and 'The Revolution of the Deaf', Oliver Sacks begins his magnificent book by giving a thorough detail of the modern history of the Deaf, their struggle as a people, the rise, fall and rise again of Deaf and Sign education and the often-changing mood, awareness and perception of Deaf People and their language (by Deaf and hearing alike).This is followed by a brilliant, well studied and researched, exploration of the many factors contributing to the conditions of Deaf People and of Sign Language as a whole. Oliver Sacks delves into the world of the Deaf from all possible angles; the circumstances of their birth, their raising and upbringing, their struggle, their varying point of views, perceptions and behaviour, their stands and opinions of certain aspects of their life and language and finally their treatment by the hearing. This section of the book is quite scientific and might perhaps at certain points be difficult for the layman to follow, but it is nevertheless an exquisite study and provides the most informative accessible insight on the inner and outer worlds of the Deaf and of Sign Language.The final chapter, or section, was perhaps the most moving and emotional and almost brought me to tears on several occasions. The revolution of the Deaf is an event that you cannot help but to be empathetic towards; you cannot resist rooting for the Deaf. You are transported by Oliver Sacks to the scene; to the very location, you see what he sees, you hear what he hears. At the end, you cannot help but rejoice with the Deaf and wish in the bottom of your heart to stand up and clap for their long-awaited achievements and success.But here, most importantly, lies the beauty of Oliver Sacks' message to himself and to us all. It is the epitome of all conversions; the great finale, the conversion of Oliver Sacks' medical perception of the Deaf to a more compassionate or personal one. The conversion of Oliver Sacks the neurologist to Oliver Sacks the valiant defender and literary messenger of the Deaf.Oliver Sacks' literary prowess is very evident here; it demands the reader to accept Sacks as a man of two worlds; a man of both science and art, a phenomenon, bridging the inaccessible world of neurology and the world of literature. So finally, undoubtedly and admittedly, we must all arrive at the conclusion that Oliver Sacks' greatest achievement here is not his own conversion, but is the inevitable and unquestionable conversion of the reader following the completion of this beautifully artistic scientific study."

There were far too many footnotes which could have pretty much made up a second book, and were way too distracting. I ended up ignoring them as they were getting on my nerves! The subject matter, which I thought would have been of great interest to me as there is deafness in my family; came to me as flat and repetitive, over-quoted and outdated. I just lost interest very quickly. Not one of Sacks best. "
26,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9271767-kathryn,4,"I won’t bury the lead: I signed up for my first-ever sign language course after finishing this book and am now on week 3 of Colombian Sign Language, taught by a deaf professor. So, the book clearly worked for me. The short book was such a wonderful introduction to the world of the deaf that I’ve dared to enter it, hoping to gain some sort of access to their beautiful language(s) and culture(s).The book’s first section contains a fascinating history of deaf culture and the origins of American Sign Language. I devoured this essay. The second part deals with deafness from a neurological point of view, emphasizing the superior visual acuity and spatial organization of the deaf. With talk of neural substrates and lateralization of the brain’s hemispheres, this highly technical middle bored me, I have to admit. Finally, Sacks describes marching with the 1988 Deaf President Now student protest at Gallaudet University, the only liberal arts college for deaf students in the world. Reading about the students’ rejection of the illusion of their powerlessness was very moving.Here are what I found to be the most thought-provoking points.The situation of the prelingually deaf before 1750 was a calamity. Worldwide, they were treated by the law and society as little better than imbeciles. This was followed by a golden period in deaf history, with a great impetus of deaf education sweeping France and then the US, thanks to the contributions of key players in France’s deaf liberation movement.The congenitally deaf suffer from tremendous information deprivation, as they miss out on incidental learning in the background and often receive meager education content. Oralist education models, then, add insult to injury by wasting so much time on arduously teaching them to speak phonetic sounds they cannot hear, leaving little time for transmitting information.True sign languages are complete in themselves and have a radically different character from any spoken or written language. Transliteration is thus impossible, as sign languages have different structures from speech. Sign language is NOT English, or French, or any other spoken language.My favorite insight: sign language isn’t just proselike and narrative in structure in the manner of speech but essentially cinematic too. With the dimension of time, it is four-dimensional and the field of vision and angle of view are variable, with constant and fluid close-ups, distant shots, flashbacks, and fast-forward scenes. One is always aware of the signer’s visual orientation to what is being signed.The footnotes went on for pages and pages and were, as another reviewer put it, a big fat pain in the ass, but this is classic Sacks. Accompanying him on his journey from seeing the deaf in purely medical terms—as “diseased ears” or “otologically impaired”—to seeing them as members of a different linguistic community is still highly worth it.Title in Spanish: Veo una voz: I See a Voice"
27,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1008448-evalangui,3,"Published June 1989, the year after the Gallaudet University revolution.Interesting but pretty basic. Good for me since I haven’t read much on the topic at all and it references other material (David Wright’s autobiography, for example) and gives enough of a basic history to give a casual reader a basic understanding. I’m quite sorry to have listened to the audio version since it skips most of the footnotes, which are the most interesting part of the book for me! It’s a short-book in any case (64.000 words) and Sacks is a very readable writer.The pathos is a bit too obvious, although undoubtedly the situation was (and sometimes is) quite dire for deaf people and it made me all teary eyed anyway. Still, it might well be that old cochlear implants were pretty much useless to make a deaf person into a hearing one, unlike current ones. See my review of Sound and Fury for more on that.Another criticism to be made is that Sacks, like all Usian writers, is pretty USA-centric. Although there are appropriate comparisons to other countries and some history of the French tradition from which the Usian tradition originated with Clerc and Gallaudet and in the footnotes I did read interesting references to the very advanced organization of education for the deaf in countries like Venezuela and Uruguay (check the quotes) so it is possible that there is more about other countries in the ones I have not read but the bibliography is pretty much all Usian (I’m including it here, too).I find it a bit confusing how there’s proof that every sign language is a separate language and the level of intelligibility is so high that two random signers of any language will get by with each other and be able to have conversations in a couple weeks."
28,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48390128-alisa-zingerman,5,"Sacks' infinite ability to empathy deepens any subject he touches. This book has been a complete surprise for me for two reasons: first, I started out reading it as a book about the deaf community, by and by I realizing that, far from talking about a physical trait, this book is about the process of defining a group identity, an identity that is unique, powerful, and beyond national. Second, when Sack touches something he goes to the very root of the phenomenon, so, intending to read about the ways deaf people communicate I found out that Sacks went as far as analyzing the very nature of what a language is, better than many a book dedicate to this subject solely. Oliver Sacks is famous to the extent that it would be absurd to recommend his books, but still, I'd give it a try - this book is warmly recommended to anyone who has even a slight interest in languages - unexpected and brilliant. P.S. Yes, one third of the book are footnotes, and it didn't bother me at all.P.P.S. It's not a new book, I believe much has changed since the time it was written, but it is still a good introduction to the world of the sign-language, I think."
29,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,"Ok I don't think that the science side of things was as on point with this book as with some of his other works but gosh he got me caught up in the enthusiasm of the subject matter so well! I was swept away into this world, the world of the unhearing so quickly. I found myself wanting to learn sign and to be introduced to deaf culture too. His enthusiasm is palpable and it really will rub off on you in this one. Though there isn't as much science to this book as some of his others I found the voice of the author very strong and very compelling and it really made me rethink deaf culture and experience. "
30,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2442753-nicole,3,"Never met a Sacks I didn't like - this one is no exception, although I really wish the extensive notes had been footnoted and not crammed at the end like an unusually important epilogue. Quite a bit here that I knew about (had a few friends, Deaf and hearing both, who were part of the Deaf community growing up), but much that I didn't. One interesting/heartbreaking bit? How Sign was initially adopted and then abandoned until recently. Best stuff? The examination of the linguistics and neurology of Sign - very cool."
31,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4106729-anita,3,"A very interesting read that made me think more about the deaf community and how difficult it would be to be born without hearing. The first half of the book is fascinating and thought provoking with some interesting case studies, but it is let down by the second half of the book which is repetitive and very dated. It would be nice to have an updated version with mention of the effect of new technology and up to date case studies. The importance and history of signing was interesting and I am glad my primary school made us at least learn the alphabet!"
32,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/803323-nancy,4,"I just wrote a thoughtful review of this book, but it disappeared when I hit save.There are other good reviews, so I will just go with my complaint. It is a pain in the patootie to have 65 pages of footnotes at the end of a 130 page book. The foot notes have some interesting material so it was worth turning back and forth to read them. However footnotes that are anything more than a reference on showing where the author got a quote should be at the foot of the page so that the reader can comfortably read them. Or, even better, incorporate the information into the main text."
33,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17651154-calvin-campbell,2,Sometimes Oliver Sacks strikes me as a pompous ass.
34,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2065771-gadi,4,"Here I am listening to Beethoven on my bed, piano arpeggios mingling with the keyboard clicks, someone's footsteps on the stairway, and beyond that this newly consoling silence just floating in the night. I finished this book in a loud pizza shop and had to put earphones in (no music) to focus. At once it is commentary on the density of the prose and research and my chronic inability to focus, especially given how readily available sound and music and hubbub is in my life and in our society.I don't Sign, but now I want to be introduced to the wholly novel way of thinking and framing that Sign facilitates. I am reminded of the Master of None scene where the soundtrack evaporates and the deaf character begins to express herself, to seemingly vibrate with life off the screen, her facial expressions and gestural emotiveness leaping onto a whole new linguistic dimension. My favorite parts of this book were the times Sacks conveys this admiration for Sign, as well as his admiration for language in general. Sign in this book is a channel by which Sacks navigates the anatomical, developmental, cultural, and aesthetic structures and textures of language. It took me a while to get through this short book, though. Mostly because it is dense."
35,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28792997-eitakbackwards,4,"Always been a huge fan of Oliver Sacks and his amazing career. This book is a compelling exploration of what it means to be deaf and the historical and current challenges of such a life.Think about yourself, all that you are stems from your consciousness, your thoughts. For the hearing, we perhaps cannot imagine our sense of self disentangled from our language, our words are the very essence of us. Both in social interaction and personal identity and thought. But what if you are born in a silent world with no language to develop expression? You cannot understand abstraction or even grasp the concept of a question. How do you develop a sense of self if you cannot interact with others? This is the unique challenge for congenitally deaf children, historically perceived as 'intellectually deficient' compared to their hearing peers. Of course, there is no intellectual deficiency to speak of- simply a lack of language. Thus, deaf children are in a race against time to acquire sign language in their formative years which, if successful, offers them as many if not more opportunities than their hearing peers. I didn't know much about sign language (if anything at all) before reading this book, but now find American Sign Language (ASL) truly fascinating. ASL, far from pantomomic, is easily as nuanced as the most complex forms of speech. It has it's own internal grammar structures that sit parallel to those of spoken language. Meaning and expression are temporospacial.Another fact I loved in this book is that grammar is INTRINSIC in our brains. We are born primed to form a perfect understanding of grammar from imperfect and inconsistent observation (from caregivers), yet this is enough for an infant brain. Our capacity for language as infants is so advanced that it is akin to each child being a prodigy. So I'm now really keen to look up HOW grammar is intrinsic, how does that work in our brains.Basically if you don't read Oliver Sacks' books, read them, they're great. The world is a crazy place."
36,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78237829-helen-hnin,5,"Fascinating and eye-opening. I've always had an interest in Sign Language but I've never actually learned about Deaf culture. I didn't even know what this book was about when I picked it up; I only bought it because I wanted a non-fiction book that has something to do with psychology and this book just happened to be written by an author whose name I knew. The first 20 or so pages were a bit difficult for me to get through but then I couldn't put it down. And now I'm ready to learn more about Deaf culture and Sign Languages. Not related to the book but this also solidified my interest in learning a Sign Language. Unfortunately, my country still doesn't have a official sign language or any useable internet resources so I guess I'll be learning ASL."
37,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/602881-paul,4,"I was very excited by the prospect of reading about Sign Language and, in a broader context, the deaf community; in some aspects, this book delivered on (or exceeded) my expectations, but in other aspects, I was left wanting more. First, the positives...This book opened my eyes to many issues concerning the deaf community. The first section of the book cast a spotlight on the struggles they’ve had over the last few centuries, e.g., overcoming the stigma that they were inferior or damaged; establishing methods of communication and education for themselves; and making inroads in the scientific community that for a long time neglected them and misdiagnosed them.Also eye-opening to me was their newfound sense of community (described in the last section of the book), as was the realization of just how “newfound” many other aspects of their ordeal is—from the science to their education to their status—which kept jumping out at me throughout the book (granted, this book is two decades old, but relatively speaking that is not long ago at all). Further eye-opening was the notion that their newfound community served two functions, two “different perspectives on the same reality”, as Sacks puts it: one, that their community serves to unify them from the inside; and, two, that their community serves to isolate them from the outside. This provokes further thought as to whether they are in fact serving their best interests in doing so, or if that further sets them apart from the rest of the world in an unproductive way. Then, again, maybe a little of both.The middle section of the book, which described the psychology of language was also very intriguing. Some stimulating topics were those comparing and contrasting the brain development and functions of hearing people, prelingually deaf people, and postlingually deaf people. Another very fascinating topic was that which hypothesized the idea that complex thought itself—as found in humans—is only possible following the development of certain underlying language/communication skills.There were also many other thought-provoking ideas presented, such as the idea of teaching ASL to hearing children as part of a standard curriculum, thus developing those areas of the brain more. Or, even the notion of teaching infants to sign as a way of communicating with them much earlier and understanding their needs (which was mentioned only almost as an aside, but caught my eye). Also, there were a few points made that would cause the average reader to think, “oh, I never even thought of that!”, such as the various issues of etiquette that hearing people take for granted, but must be completely changed among deaf people.The many heartfelt observations of Sign (e.g., “One can have or imagine disembodied speech, but one cannot have disembodied Sign. The body and soul of the signer, his unique human identity, are continually expressed in the act of signing”) really resonated in me—so much so that I kept pausing in my reading to seek out YouTube videos which could illustrate this better for me (one such motivation was when Sacks described movingly how religious services are inherently perfect environments for Sign, leading me to browse quite a few “sign choir” videos). That, though, leads me to the negatives...I unfortunately found myself augmenting a lot of the book’s theories and statements with Google. While I understandably couldn’t expect videos to be included in the book, and I know that by definition Sign (being a spatial language) is difficult to illustrate, I was still surprised at how little there was in the way of examples and illustrations. For example, the grammar and various “dialects” of Sign are mentioned many times in the book, but are not (in my opinion) adequately presented. Very few examples of the dialects and grammar are given (if any), and the points on that subject are often simply left with a few meager adjectives and little more. For example, in discussing the various “indigenous signed languages”, Sacks writes, “all have, beneath their specific differences, some generic resemblance to ASL. There is no universal sign language, but there are, it seems, universals in all sign languages, universals not of meaning, but of grammatical form.” And, with that, the point is made, case closed. Why couldn’t he provide even one or two examples of these universal grammatical forms? Had he done so, it would have shed so much more light on his points on the subject (which are numerous throughout the book). Yet, he never does so. I also would have greatly appreciated quite a bit more insight into Sign itself.Finally, this book contains footnotes and then addenda to some of those footnotes—and this book has many footnotes! So, in the course of reading just a couple of pages, I routinely came across first the main text, then possibly some quoted text, then footnotes, and then addenda to the footnotes! It got distracting like that, with the flow sometimes getting lost. Sure, I could have ignored the footnotes (as Sacks offers in the introduction), but then I would have worried about missing something important (and, yes, I came across many interesting points in the footnotes that I am glad I didn’t skip!). So, while fascinating, I still couldn’t help but wish that Sacks had come out with a new and revised edition that would have incorporated much more of those footnotes and addenda into the main text.

As a hearing person who has only marginally been exposed to the deaf world, I found this book to be enlightening and amazing. Oliver Sacks dives deep enough into the brain processing to clearly communicate that ASL is not merely a way for the non-hearing among us to communicate, but it is itself a visual language as valid as spoken English, Russian, or Arabic. Additionally, he goes into the culture that accompanies it, showcasing how truly wonderful ASL is in its strengths and beauty."
39,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1004303-keith,5,"This is a book that will make you see the world differently once you have read it! It is worth the time and effort. Two thoughts to share: (1) Sign is a fundamental language of the brain. (2) ASL is really the most genuine representation of that fundamental language. I don't know ASL, but this book has made me want to learn it. All the other attempts at representing thought in different forms, according to Mr. Sacks, seem less pure. This is my interpretation of what I read."

42,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3959348-ru,4,"Famed neurologist and author Oliver Sacks once again provides great insight into a world most people people with the ability to hear probably take for granted. A lot of ground is covered once again by the great Dr. Sacks as he puts the existence of those who are deaf at the forefront of this book, a book that is sometimes a narrative, sometimes an analysis, and sometimes social commentary.Largely, there are quite a few thought-provoking stories and instances in this book that will likely stay with the reader long after finishing it. Consider the examples of deaf children, whose well-intentioned parents enroll them into a sign language program, but then the child has no resources to really use what they are learning, as they are learning it, once school is done for the day, because the parents and other family members are not necessarily also learning sign language themselves. Dr. Sacks makes strong points about the necessity of learning sign language - much as we must all learn _some_ language - by a certain age, otherwise, our brains simply do not absorb the same level of thinking and processing in later life. As such, you can imagine the struggles of someone afflicted by non-congenital hearing loss might endure and the obstacles that, too, presents.Dr. Sacks discusses medical traits and aspects of deafness to some degree, and one area that stood out to me was technological advancements in attempting to either provide or restore hearing through the use of cochlear implants. To my surrpise, cochlear implants have really only progressed on any level since the mid-20th century! This seems incredible on many levels. The reliance on early days of lip reading and basic, non-uniform sign language appears to have been profound before then.The final chapters of this book encapsulate some of the frustrations of the deaf in a hearing world, in the form of the Gallaudet University protests known better as the ""Deaf President Now"" movement. Gallaudet students demanded that a deaf person be appointed as president of the university after only being led by hearing presidents. The university is one of the only deaf higher educational institutions in the world and the students were strongly opinionated that their concerns could be better addressed by someone who fully understood their existence. In many ways, this battle seems representative of that allegory of what it must often be like to be hearing impaired in a world that is anything but. I wasn't aware of the DPN story before reading this and I felt moved by the plight of the students.Good work by Dr. Sacks, as usual, although I found his other books to be more to my preference. But, as usual, Dr. Sacks exposed me to new concepts through his work, and I am grateful for that experience with ""Seeing Voices""."
43,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11231211-iseult,4,"This was pretty good, my first time reading Oliver Sacks. I think if he simplified his language a bit more, it would've been a clearer read, especially in the second section, which is very heavy with linguistic and neurological terms the average person doesn't know but that aren't explained. That was the driest part to me, but obviously he was a neurologist, so I guess I can't fault him for that. As always, I did not like that there was very long notes in the back so you had to jump back and forth and take yourself out of the text and reorient yourself every time. I'd rather he incorporated them into the text naturally, but again that might be more of a personal complaint.I liked reading about the historical important figures throughout time, deaf people and hearing educators. I didn't like how several times he basically said that if someone doesn't have a language or cannot communicate, they're less of a human being (or maybe he was saying society viewed deaf people or others who cannot communicate in that way, but I felt like he implied he felt that way too.) However, he did speak of how crucial and life-determining it is for a deaf person to develop language within the first few years of their life, whether it's ASL, speech, or some in-between language like SEE, because of brain plasticity and hemisphere dominance. I hadn't thought about this as much, how even if a deaf person acquires ASL or any language later in life, they will never have the same fluidity and mastery of the language if someone doesn't develop their brain's ability for language as a baby. Many times he said ""sign language is a complex language, it's so complex, maybe more rich and complex than speech"" but I would've appreciated more examples of that rather than him just telling us that. It was convenient that he was able to be there the last few days of the Gallaudet protests and inspiring to hear about how the students realized their own power and how they effected change peacefully."
44,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5226097-bojan-tunguz,5,"Most of the information that we get about the world comes through the sense of sight. Therefore it would seem that it there is one sense that we would be loath to part with, it would be this one. And yet, it is the sense of hearing that has the greatest impact on the acquisition of language and subsequently on the formation of our minds. If we don't acquire language really early on in our lives, we are bound to lead a very limited existence as compared to most other people. It is these facts and some other very deep and important ones that I was able to gather from this Oliver Sacks book. It really opened my mind to the world of deaf people in a profoundly different way. Sacks documents various attempts over the last few centuries to give deaf people a chance to acquire a sign language, and different approaches to the education of the deaf. The book also opened my eyes to the fact that the sign language is a real language, qualitatively and profoundly different from simple gesticulations and gestures that we engage on a daily basis in our regular communications. In fact, the sign language is in one sense much more complex than the regular spoken language. One can argue that the spoken language is one-dimensional - it consists of sounds of different pitch and duration in time. On the other hand, the sign language is four-dimensional - it employs all three dimensions of space to create various hand configurations and adds an extra layer in the form of motion. One of the greatest features of Olives Sacks' writing is the highly sophisticated and literary style that he employs. I would love reading his books even if he were describing the content of a box of cereal. We are fortunate that his writing brilliance is matched with the vast knowledge and expertise that he has in neuroscience. It is this incredible combination of writing and scientific talent that makes each of his books a masterpiece."

If you can't hear, you somehow see"" - David Hockney The aforementioned quote encapsulates the theme and tenor of this magnificent book by the brilliant Dr.Oliver Sacks. Deafness in general and pre-lingual or congenital deafness is particular can have a devastating impact on the physical, mental and social psyche of the unfortunate individual. But the most jarring blow is the one dealt with by an unsympathetic and unaware society. The ostracism, isolation and neglect heaped upon a deaf person is more than adequate to inflict a trauma having the capability to scar and even wreck a pitiful life.However, due to the stellar and noble efforts of mercurial geniuses such as William Stockoe (the pioneer of the American Sign Language (""ASL""), Laurent Clerc, a French teacher famously titled ""The Apostle Of the Deaf"", giant strides have been and are being taken across the spectrum of the globe to bring more than just a glimmer of hope to the hearing impaired.A classic case being - The Gallaudet University in USA - the only University in the world to offer the deaf a liberal arts curriculum. In this touching work, Dr.Sacks traces the arduous path from despondency staring a deaf person in the face to delights awaiting in the form of an aspiring future and a beautiful and fulfilling lifespan. An interesting aspect revealed by Dr.Sachs (relying on the treasure trove of a plethora of research findings) is the plasticity of the nervous system to 'rearrange' the auditory synapses to facilitate visual perception to compensate for auditory loss in a person bereft of hearing.The real life examples in the book move, motivate and mellow down preconceptions and prejudicial notions. Slights such as ""tone-deaf""; ""mute""; ""dumber' etc would be relegated to the trash can once this book is done with. But the impact is sure to linger long after the covers have come down. So it should be!"

Now, let's just pray that I'm not some sort of plague on poor, unsuspecting authors. As usual, SEEING VOICES, is beautifully and crisply written in Sacks's elegant style. As someone who was born profoundly deaf durin ghte 1980s, this was a great look at what was happening when I grew up. So many of the things that he wrote about aligns with my observations within the Deaf community: the damage of late diagonises, how ASL is indeed a very real and vibrant language, and how ASL, if introduced early, can be a boon for a child's brain development. Sacks did a wonderful job of outlining everything that I've seen in a more eloquent manner than I could. His account of the ""Deaf President Now"" (DPN) events are worth a book of its own.But...This was published in 1991, the year that the FDA approved pediatric cochlear implants for mas usage. Ever since then, many children have been implanted, trained in the Audio-Verbal Therapy (AVT) in replacement of ASL. Moreover, mainstreaming has gone in full force, as IDEA and the ADA have ushered many more d/Deaf children into ""hearing"" schools, leaving deaf residential schools relatively underfunded and with fewer students. These are fairly pivotal issues in Deaf cultural history.In sum, this is an excellent book if you're looking for some insights into ASL grammar and syntax as well as a brief account of the cultural history leading up to the DPN. If you're looking for a more expansive view of Deaf culture and Deaf people, this will only whet your appetite, not satisfy it. "
47,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29383287-kate,3,"3.5/5starsThis was a VERY interesting look into the culture of the deaf, as well as the psychology behind language and linguistics. As a person who loves language and psych, it was definitely very interesting. Oliver Sacks also did a very good job of weaving narrative and research so it didn't get too boring.The critique I have is that it isn't very approachable. He explains at the beginning that each Part of this book was an essay or something he wrote for something else and then fleshed out a little bit more, and it felt like it was definitely written for an academic audience rather than just a casual reading audience. There were SO MANY people he would casually quote and mention who I had NO context on who they were or what they did, so the names totally flew over my head, and then made me wonder why Sacks was quoting them.I also, while I appreciate Sacks' acknowledging the fact that he is an outsider to the world of the deaf, he never tried to bridge the gap. He had several stories about deaf people, and a couple quotes from people, and he cited a couple books written by deaf people, but never during this did he sit down and interview a deaf person or try to actually learn some stuff form their perspective. So for me, as a person who worked with a child who was deaf, and knows several other members of the deaf community, I felt like he could have learned SO MUCH MORE if he had just reached out a bit more to people.Overall though, a SUPER quick little read that was very intriguing. Highly recommend for psych lovers or people interested in the deaf community or languages/linguistics!"
48,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8911750-katherine,4,"An engaging and thoughtful (though perhaps slightly wide-eyed) overview of deafness and Deafness. Having read two of his books so far, I think Sacks is an academic and writer who treats his subject with a lot of care and is great at communicating what he knows and has learnt in a very accessible and compelling way to the reader.Lost all the great quotes I'd saved in my notes, except for this eloquent revelation:And to be defective in language, for a human being, is one of the most desperate of calamities, for it is only through language that we enter fully into our human estate and culture, communicate freely with our fellows, acquire and share information. If we cannot do this, we will be bizarrely disabled and cut off—whatever our desires or endeavours, or native capacities.It is often not deafness that disables, but rather lack of language, lack of access, lack of understanding.So much awe and respect for the Deaf community and their culture.P.S.: The only copy of Seeing Voices I could get my hands on was the audiobook version; irony notwithstanding, it was fairly enjoyable and I do want to try more audiobooks in the future."
49,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33569468-cat,3,"This book was really interesting. I'm embarrassingly ignorant about deaf culture. This was very informative about the history of deafness. I also liked that the author was candid about his own ignorance about the subject. Seeing Voices is written with all of the enthusiasm that he has for learning about this subject. Also, just as important, it changed how I think about my relationship with language. How it is a gateway to learning and abstract thinking beyond social implications. But: there are a lot of asides and tangents in the form of footnotes at the bottom of the page. And they're long. They're interesting and worth reading, but the book feels disjointed because of them. I wish that they had just been incorporated into the narrative. It's the kind of book to read once through ignoring the footnotes, and then go back and just read the footnotes. "
50,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/132186-eoin,3,"Not done yet, so this is a temp. The subject is facinating (to me) and important (to everyone) and Sacks has that greatly excited tone of his that makes you think, probably rightly, that everything about the human mind is so *facinating*. The difficulty with this book is formating. In the edition I'm reading, there are footnotes (I love me the foot-notes, don't get it twisted) that take up as much as half the page, often running into the feet of subsequent pages. So lots of tangents and flipping back and forth that could have been prevented with a larger page and smaller foot-note font. Otherwise a great introduction to deaf topics with plenty of references to other works for follow up (though I'm sure the last 19 years have produced much in the way of deaf and sign books)."
51,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/566878-earnest,4,"Fascinating insights into the world of the deaf... you begin to appreciate the intricacies of sign language. I have learned it is truely a language; not just a pictorial pantomime of symbols, but a complex 3D movie of idiosyncratic edits, expressions, and points of view that is not bound or restricted emotionally in any way... it has equal access to as many expressions as spoken language... nay I have learned that sign can do more than spoken language. I have also learned that without language we are empty, restricted, uncreative, machine and animal like. It plays a vital role in the construction of identity, purpose, and facilitates growth. Language is so powerful it is essential to understanding ourselves as human. "
52,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2596843-carol-catinari,3,"This book is about the language of the deaf... I'd have to describe the book as very interesting content, but not so interesting to read. Til I got Chapter 3, and it became more readable. This was about the students at Gallaudet organizing to effect the selection of a deaf president. The book conveys the deaf community as a community of its own, with its own language and culture, and the trials it has gone through over time. Also the learning of language by those who don't hear, and the universal ability, and need, to learn (and even construct) language.My daughter had this book reserved for me at my local library. She periodically surprises me with an unexpected reserve. This was particularly of interest as my mother was deaf. How fitting...l'dor v'dor."
53,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1642391-cynthia-karl,2,"This was not my favorite Oliver Sacks book; my favorite is his memoir ""Uncle Tungsten"" which I really enjoyed. This book about the deaf and sign language seemed slow and repetitive especially with the copious footnotes but I did gain a much better understanding of sign language. It is a language in its own right with structure, grammar and nuances just like a verbal language. It gave me a much greater appreciation of the importance of sign language and why some deaf people do not envy those that hear and do not have any particular desire to have procedures such as cochlear implants. Sacks also includes a history of the treatment of the deaf prior to the development of sign language and how sad it must have been to be labeled an idiot when the only problem was an inability to hear."
54,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5167933-bea,5,"Excellent book! Gives you an insight in the unique world of the deaf community, and into the obstacles occurred by them in 'normal' society. It describes the history of the deaf, their position in society, the development of sign language, the (still ongoing) debate on whether deaf people ought to sign or to lipread. I'd never been aware of the world behind all this.The book reads well, the matter has been thoroughly researched. Not a book for light reading, but a pleasure to read non the less.Greatly recommended, because it gives you at least some understanding of the different world deaf people live in. Makes you remember you should not judge or form an opinion unless you know what you're talking about."
55,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11040524-hannah,3,"An interesting insight into a fascinating topic.However, only three stars because the use of footnotes was distracting. I prefer reading continuous prose and it was awkward constantly switching between the main text and the footnotes which also contained pertinant information.It was interesting to learn how different gesture is from sign language, that they actually use different parts of the brain. I was also fascinated by the way Deaf children see the world differently and are more accurate in remembering exact locations. Perhaps sign language and the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis would be an intriging topic for study?The book was first published in 1989 so I wonder how different things are today with the cochlear implant changing the number of deaf people."
56,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2854620-emily,4,"This taught me more about the deaf culture and history than I've ever thought to ask about. It's an honest account that includes just enough first person to personalize the search for a deeper understanding of being deaf and what that means. Oliver Sacks always uses his own encounters with people to guide his research and shape his descriptions, but never lets that cloud an actual scientific account of the issue. This book won't teach you sign language, but (in my mind) it's incredibly helpful for learning about deaf culture. I used it for a linguistic education class, and did a presentation about how people deprived of communication develop differently and are often deprived of proper linguistic capabilities. This was a good view into different fields. "
57,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5915664-no-l,2,"I'm normally a fan of Sacks. This one annoyed me though. It's kind of bizarre that a neurologist would be shocked that Sign is a complete language. He acts surprised that Deaf people's brains may be wired differently because of different input. Duh. It reads like he's shocked that the Deaf can do things like, you know, go to college. It was published in 1989 and even that late there were kids who never were identified as Deaf and thus people thought they were mentally disabled, so maybe that's where his incredulity comes from? Not sure, but I was annoyed. Sacks loved the footnotes, and it's obvious here. It got an extra star because Sacks is still fun to read since he's so engrossed in his subject, and I loved the part about the protests at Gallaudet, which I remember."
58,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5564491-garrett-mccutcheon,5,"As a hearing person, I must admit that I never gave much thought at all to the Deaf, let alone Deaf culture. Sacks' Seeing Voices is a real eye opener in this regard. Sacks admits that he came at the problem of deafness from a medical/neurological perspective, and was quickly and radically changed by what he learned about the Deaf. Sacks passion is evident as he takes the reader through the history of Deaf culture, the struggles and successes of the Deaf. I now have a new appreciation of the Deaf, and their place in society, and their unique difficulties. This has opened a new channel in my mind, one which I intend to explore more fully in the future."
59,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9482173-matthew,3,"Very interesting book.Pros: This book will give you a glimpse of Sign Language that you have never seen before. Not only does it go into the mechanics of Sign, it also explores history and culture of Sign. This book is more about history/sociology than it is linguistics but I would still recommend it to anyone who is interested in linguistics. Also, be aware that the book is a little dated.Cons: This book is a bit dry. The footnotes feel like sludge to fight through. The author uses technical vocabulary and the sentence structure feels clinical/academic. This is one of those rare books where I disliked the reading experience but really enjoyed the content itself."
60,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30614479-kururu-sama,4,"Fun fact: when I first saw the title of this book, I thought it might be about synesthesia. Oliver Sacks has a great reverence for Sign and Signers, which is quite evident throughout the book. What is most fascinating about Sign, however, is how so much can be applied to all languages in general -- all languages, at their core, are about communication, and all languages, no matter if they are visual or aural, ultimately develop in the same way. This book was a fascinating look at the history of Sign and Sign itself. It may, however, be a bit dated, considering that it was first written in 1989. "
61,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11169412-jaclyn,4,"Started off a bit dry, and at times felt a bit paternalistic when he talks about children who couldn't express concepts because they struggled to learn English and how amazing it was when hearing people figured out how to break down these linguistic barriers. I wish it had been contextualized a bit better or focused on Deaf innovators.Still, the second (thinking in sign) and third (Gallaudet University protest) parts we're fascinating and a lot of fun to read. I love how he talks about sign language and how Deaf students and teachers in the 80s advocated for the recognition of Deaf identity."
62,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3890607-kelly,5,"Oliver Sacks is a brilliant man who manages to explain high-density concepts to a layman without talking down. Now that's impressive. Also impressive: the truly mind-bending (literally minds are reshaped) science of how our brains form language centers with and without the ability to hear. And while that may sound dry I actually cried while reading this book on the subway. Totally intensely interestingly fun. While learning. Thank god, because I have read the first fifty pages of ten terrible books in the last few weeks and I needed a win: this was it."
63,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13798007-kathryn,3,"This is a fascinating and richly detailed book, as with all of Oliver Sacks's work. I like the way he combines psychology, neuroscience, and anthropology to create a truly nuanced and empathetic portrayal of his subjects. However, this book (published in 1989) is very outdated and a lot has changed since then in the fields of linguistics and disability rights, so I would not recommend this book to someone who is new to d/Deaf culture and the issues faced by the community. It was originally intended as an introductory text, but it no longer functions as such today."
64,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8159632-kevin,3,"Sacks is best, I think, when he writes short case studies, as he does in The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat. In books like this, where he writes continuously on a single subject, he tends to aimlessly romanticise in a way that makes him very tiring to read. Overall, though, this is still a good book, and I'd recommend it. Some of what he writes on language is dubious and outdated, but perhaps it's not fair to fault him for this. The final third of the book, on the Gallaudet University Strike, is also quite a thrill to read, and mostly makes up for what precedes it."
65,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21104021-roxanne,4,"Fascinating. Offers insights regarding deaf culture, linguistics, neuroscience, and history. Provides excellent example of how science is confounded by social norms and politics. Broadened my understanding considerably. Rather than regarding deafness as a deficit, Sacks argues that it is extraordinary--deaf people invent language rather than merely learn it, prelingually deaf people have profounded appreciation of Shakespearean plays, for instance, in that they ""see"" rather than ""hear"" the words as they are read. Definitely changed my perspective."
66,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7291786-alexi-parizeau,5,"I normally love the Notes section of most books, and so I especially loved what Sacks did in Seeing Voices: almost every page is filled with notes! I loved it!! Reading the book was like carrying two conversations at once; perhaps a bit more challenging to maintaining flow, but certainly enriching and highly stimulating. The content of the book was also quite interesting (and the historical perspective on Deaf empowerment was inspirational), though it doesn't provide many answers so much as urgent questions."
67,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7716365-kate,3,"This book is pretty old at this point, there are newer books with newer science in them re: the neuroscience of language and sign language in particular. And there was a lot of blah blah about how what the mother does or doesn't do for their infant can make or break them, as if fathers do not a thing to influence child development. But, I like Sacks' style, and I really liked the third part of the book where he describes being on the Gallaudet campus for the Deaf president protests. A great moment in history."
68,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48908335-katie,2,I read this book due to an interest in deaf culture and I have just started learning British Sign Language. However this book was disappointing. The reading was disjointed and I couldn't find the motivation to read all the notes at the back which were extensive and I think unnecessary. However the material concerning deaf advocacy and standing up for their beliefs in having a deaf president of a university is important. I feel sign language has given the deaf a voice but this book is not a simple introduction to deaf history. I will look for something else to teach myself about this. 
69,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29920754-megan,4,"Sacks's novel is surprisingly pro-Deaf given that it is written years ago by a hearing neurologist. Many hearing individuals in the medical community still view deafness as a disease and push cochlear implants as the ONLY ""cure,"" failing to educate hearing parents of deaf children about the Deaf community, Deaf schools, and importance of Sign language; such as pairing sing language with cochlear implants and speech therapy. Sacks- on the other hand- supported ASL and saw it as a necessary aspect of a Deaf person's life as well as the importance of Deaf Culture and Deaf autonomy."
70,0375704078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35566354-elliot-riley,4,"Excellent except for some ableist language (using the word ""normal"" to describe hearing people). I wonder if that's been edited out in more recent printings. Also the history of Gallaudet University was interesting but felt almost a little tacked on at the end. Since the book was published in the 80s it makes me want to read up on what's happened since as far the percentage of deaf teachers and administrators.Overall I was thrilled to discover one of my favorite topics tackled by one of my favorite writers."

His famous books are among others: 'The Man Who Mistook His Wive for a Hat and The Awakenings."

It was by no means bad but his style seems a lot dryer than in his other books. Like in his other books, the topic is interesting but it seems like he does not explain it as well as he has other topics in his other books. Also, a good portion of the book is his notes and sources which makes the book seem much longer than it actually is. "

His enthusiasm for learning always shines throughout his books. This book was less effective than some of his other books because it's three essays about deafness joined in one book. There was repetition within some of the essays. Still, I learned a lot about sign language and how it came about. I found the book really interesting."

But the endless, lengthy footnotes made it impossible to find any flow - I felt as new to the book at the end as at the beginning. It also felt like he repeated himself a lot, but that might be because of the disjointed aspect. If all those footnotes were so necessary and useful (and they were), then he should have incorporated them into the text. Still worth reading though."

I remember going with her as a child to the deaf and blind center in Dallas and telling the lady she needed her hands to talk. I must have been about four. Something so obvious to a four year old was thought to be not the best way by the educators. This book should be read by all educators.

Most of the book is dry and academic and presumably pretty outdated at this point, covering studies on how deaf individuals learn and the now 25-year-old debate on the merits of Signed English v.

I prefer the individual stories that Oliver Sacks typically provides, and those were minimal in this book except for the tenacious and fascinating Gallaudet student demonstration urging the administration to hire a deaf president."

A lot of what Sacks wrote seems very common sense (of course ASL, ISL, etc. are languages! what else could they be?) but the background research into neurology is fantastic (if a bit over my head).
