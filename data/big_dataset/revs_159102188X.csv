And an older white woman who writes books and book reviews.Answer: both of us wanted to be astronomers since we were kneee-high to a toy telescope. And that's where my astral career ended. Tyson, however, took his lifelong love of the stars from the Starlight Apartments in the Bronx (poetic irony, yes?) first to a Ph.D. in physics and then to a career as college professor, Director of the Hayden Planetarlum, commenter extraordinaire on the PBS Nova series, and even to the extent of dissing Pluto. The last charge, levelled by Sheldon on tv's ""The Big Bang Theory,"" is denied by Tyson, who really is a peaceable, good natured guy. I thoroughlty enjoyed this book, a brief autobiography of a man I've admired for years. I learned that his sense of humor revealed on Nova is very real, and very funny, as when he says,  “Unlike what you may be told in other sectors of life, when observing the universe, size does matter, which often leads to polite ‘telescope envy’ at gatherings of amateur astronomers.”THE SKY IS NOT THE LIMIT is written to appeal to adults and juveniles, too. He never tires of exhorting young people to lift their head, gaze at the sky and set no limits. This is advice we should all take to heart."
1,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27195238-menglong-youk,5,"""The Sky Is Not the Limit"" is an autobiography of Neil deGrasse Tyson, one of my few favorite astrophysicists alive. It reveals what happened during his childhood that lead him to get absorbed into astrophysics when he was just nine, the age of which many people have no clues to their future. It also vividly describes his passion when he got involved in astronomical events and a trip to West Africa to see solar eclipse with many famous people, including Neil Armstrong, the first human to set footprint on the surface of the Moon. Interesting activities like answering scientific questions and sharing his knowledge of the greatness of universe in various events and even on the planes awards him pleasure emotionally. The stories of his later work as a member of the Bush's Aerospace Commission, the racism he encountered during his everyday and academic life, his relationship with the cosmos, the possibility of how the world will end, and the controversial relationship between science and religions are also crammed into this informative autobiography. After finishing reading it, we not only indirectly experience Neil's life, but also are able to expend our knowledge of science.I love every moment while reading this book. It's highly recommended.In the end, I will leave you with the last paragraph, which Neil spectacularly expressed his feeling through this book.""I owe Earth (and the universe) much more than this. For my entire omnivorous life I have eaten of its flora and feasted on its fauna. Countless plants and animals have sacrificed their lives and unwillingly donated their energy content to my sustenance. The least I can do is donate my body back to this third rock from the Sun. I want to be buried, just like in the old days, where I decompose by the action of microorganisms, and I am dined upon by any form of creeping animal or root system that sees fit to do so. I would become their food, just as they had been food for me. I will have recycled back to the universe at least some of the energy that I have taken from it. And in so doing, at the conclusion of my scientific adventures, I will have come closer to the heavens than to Earth."""
2,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1660832-kevin,4,"I loved this biography of Tyson. I'm a long term fan of Cosmos the Sagan then Tyson updated version, and it was very interesting reading about Neil's path to the stars and about his meeting with Carl Sagan. Lot's of good stories about science and about being black in America."
3,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"The Sky Is Not the Limit: Adventures of an Urban Astrophysicist by Neil deGrasse Tyson“The Sky Is Not the Limit” is the entertaining biography of astrophysicist Neil De Grasse Tyson. Best-selling author and science icon Neil deGrasse Tyson takes the reader on a journey through his eyes, which is to say the cosmos and many interesting insights of his life. This uplifting 203-page book includes the following seven chapters: 1. Night Vision, 2. Space, the Final Frontier, 3. Scientific Adventures, 4. Dark Matters, 5. Romancing the Cosmos, 6. The End of the World, and 7. God and the Astronomers.Positives:1.	Great science writing. Informative, interesting, accessible and fun to read. 2.	The fascinating life of Neil deGrasse Tyson (NDT), makes for a great biography. “In these pages, I share what I believe to be amusing and playful moments of my life in the cosmos.”3.	The book has excellent flow. The pages read themselves.4.	NDT’s charm is found throughout the book. He shares his interest in the universe and his life as a black man in America.5.	The impact of good teachers on students. “A student's academic life experience can be constructed from much more than what happens in a classroom. Good teachers know this. The best teachers make sure it happens, and measure their own success as educators not by how many students earned As in their class but by the testimony of whose lives they enriched.”6.	Not afraid to provide constructive criticism. “So we have created, and willingly support, an educational system that honors the highest grades in class and on exams, but these same perfect grades bear little or no predictive value for those who will actually express the talent that shapes our contemporary culture.”7.	NDT shares his favorite courses. “My favorite between them, and my favorite of them all was simply titled Astronomy Roundtable, which covered the physics and the mathematics of relativity, black holes, quasars, and the big bang.”8.	NDT’s philosophy is top notch. “Actually, there is no shame in not knowing. The problem arises when irrational thought and attendant behavior fill the vacuum left by ignorance.”9.	Shares perspectives on interesting topics like the defense of humanity. “we must colonize space in as many places as possible, which will proportionally reduce the chance of our annihilation from a collision between Earth and a comet or asteroid—we would then no longer have all our eggs in one basket, as it were.”10.	The impact of 911 on NDT. “The fires created a furnace hot enough to render molten the steel cores of the World Trade Center towers. Before my apartment received professional cleaning, I collected a vial's worth to keep as a kind of reliquary—in remembrance of a tragic portal through which we had all passed.”11.	Social criticism. “At the risk of sounding like a curmudgeon, allow me to say that one of society's greatest ills is the astonishing breadth and depth of its scientific (and mathematical) illiteracy.”12.	In defense of the scientific method. “Initial uncertainty is a natural element of the scientific method, yet the scientific method is, without question, the most powerful and successful path ever devised to understand the physical world.”13.	So why did Pluto get demoted? Find out.14.	Fun tidbits. So what about the metric system? “Last I checked, only four countries are left in the world that do not officially sanction the metric system in their general population: Liberia, Myanmar, South Yemen, and the United States of America.”15.	Fascinating look at being black in America. “At no place along that timeline could I recall a black person (who is neither an entertainer nor an athlete) being interviewed as an expert on something that had nothing whatever to do with being black.” “I can summarize my life's path by noting the following: in the perception of society, my athletic talents are genetic; I am a likely mugger-rapist; my academic failures are expected; and my academic successes are attributed to others.”16.	Math and physics. “Equations are not ideas unto themselves. They are just the symbols that represent ideas.”17.	The end of the world. “The complete list of corpses may sound familiar: black holes, neutron stars (pulsars), white dwarfs, and even brown dwarfs are each a dead end on the evolutionary tree of stars.”18.	Religion versus science, always a fascinating topic. “The claims of science rely on experimental verification, while the claims of religions rely on faith.” “I have yet to see a successful prediction about the physical world that was inferred or extrapolated from the information content of any religious document. Indeed, I can make an even stronger statement. Whenever people have used religious documents to make accurate predictions about our base knowledge of the physical world, they have been famously wrong.”19.	A photo insert. Negatives:1.	Very little supplementary visual material on the substance of the narrative.2.	No links to notes.3.	No formal bibliography.In summary, icons that are genuinely passionate about their work always impress me. NDT loves being an astrophysicist and his engaging words flow beautifully throughout. A fascinating life in a fascinating career, a biography worth reading. I recommend it!

4,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/547720-brandon-easton,5,"This guy is one of my personal heroes. A black dude from the Bronx who went to earn a Ph.D in Astrophysics. This guy rocks. Neil DeGrasse Tyson is the director of the Hayden Planetarium at the Museum of Natural History in NYC, and he has become a minor celebrity in the world of science. Not so much because of the color of his skin, but for the story of how a kid in a NYC apartment fell in love with the study of deep space physics and phenomena. This book is very breezy and fun. The few times he gets into complex analyses of astronomy his prose style allows just about anyone to understand his point of view.I also like this book because he feels (as I do) that American society is far too scientifically illiterate, and there needs to be more mainstream scientists of color who inspire and reach back into disadvantaged communities. Trust me, this is an excellent read. "
5,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/644451-christine,2,"I wanted to like this because I like Neil Degrasse Tyson. But it turns out that I like the cool, smart, yet approachable Neil of 2015 way more than I like the vaguely condescending People Magazine's Sexiest Astrophysicist Neil of 2004. I don't know who the intended audience was for this memoir and I'm not quite sure he did either. There was a push for NASA funding alongside bemoaning funding going to the arts in school. There were sections that just meandered and I actually flipped past them, which I hardly ever do. I ended up giving up on the book. "
6,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7240015-stephen,4,"How does a young black kid from the Bronx become a world-famous astrophysicist, Director of the Hayden Planetarium and the second coming of Carl Sagan? The Sky is Not the Limit is Neil deGrasse Tyson’s semi-autobiographical account of how he came to be seduced by the study of the night sky, one that doubles as a light work of popular science, promoting informed, critical thinking and asserting that yeah, science is cool. Subtitled Adventures of an Urban Astrophysicist, Tyson’s memoir reveals that anyone can take joy from studying the stars, even if their view of the sky is washed out from city lights and their ambitions discounted by everyone they meet. The biography-turned-essay collection is Tyson’s most effective attempt so far to convert his gift for communicating science in public lectures into written form. Though his being seduced by heavenly bodies takes center stage, one essay (""Dark Matters"") sees Tyson make a rare comment on race. Although he received support from his parents and guidance from remarkable individuals like Carl Sagan and Isaac Asimov, Tyson had to overcome the obstacle for race: at every step along the way of his education people questioned his choice of occupations, from patronizing whites doubting his intelligence (""Why don't you just play basketball?"") to patronizing blacks who thought astrophysics was too white and that an intelligent black man should be helping the race by being a social activist instead. He persevered, however, and eventually became a celebrity scientist, the first black man (to his knowledge) to be interviewed on television and asked for his professional opinion on something outside of race or civil rights. The Sky is not the Limit covers astrophysics, math, skepticism, telescope stargazing as a first date (not successful), and September 11th, 2001. Those looking for an entertaining science read should find this attractive. Related:Dr. Tyson hosts a weekly podcast called ""StarTalk Radio"", which is ridiculously awesome. He always hosts with a comedian, includes interviews, and fields questions from listeners about science and popular culture. The last show featured an interview...Buzz Aldrin, one of the first two men on the moon. Tyson has also spoke with Dr. Ruth (that ""Dr. Ruth"") and frequently features authors like Mary Roach and Neil Chaikin"
7,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1995871-jake,4,"Hopefully, likely, someday there will be a comprehensive biography of astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson. No rush though. With several published works, and many videos and audio recordings available for free online, the in-process life of Dr. Tyson is quite accessible. And for those of us who want the equivalent of an extended personal conversation, there is The Sky Is Not the Limit. Published in 2004, this book is far from comprehensive. Still, it is a wonderful survey of the life of the man People Magazine hypothesized to be the Sexiest Astrophysicist Alive.I was hoping for a memoir that focused mainly on relating life events. However, The Sky Is Not the Limit spends a great deal of ink engaging in scientific discussion. In such cases, a briefly recounted memory serves as a springboard to academic discourse. All the material is valuable, but the selling point of memoir is undercut somewhat as a result. A minor criticism, but this book wants for a greater abundance of revealing anecdotes.At any rate, Dr. Tyson's exciting and candid voice comes through loud and clear. The anecdotes he does share run the gamut from triumph, to tragedy, with humor and surprise included. In terms of offering both vivid personal history and profound reflection, the sections on 9/11 and racism are absorbing. Tyson provides some of his most insightful and bittersweet assessments when recounting his memory of the Apollo 11 moonlanding. For fans of Neil deGrasse Tyson, this book is of course a must read. For those shopping for a proper introduction to Tyson's scientific knowledge, and his entertaining and accessible style of sharing it, consider trying 
Death by Black Hole
or the more recent

Easy read that is very knowledgeable and enjoyable! "
9,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16041437-steven,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this. There's not a wasted moment in this book, it's full of interesting recollections, and opinions that each end on solid points while flowing nicely to the next sections. The last few books I read meandered throughout, and I often found myself wondering where they were going, so it was a relief to read this and never feel lost. These were at times funny, harrowing, and at times beautiful and profound. His 9/11 recollection was probably the most vivid I've come across, possibly because it was seen through the point of view, all-together a physicist, father, and one who was so close to the incident. My only nitpick is the final chapter on religion because it was somewhat wishy-washy, which is fine, if he just said, ""I feel wishy-washy about theological matters."" It was the only section where I couldn't tell what his point of view was. Otherwise excellent book."
10,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10600289-donna,4,Well written engaging autobiographical story of his early years and enduring love and pursuit of astrophysics
11,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5138376-margaret,4,"Neil DeGrasse Tyson is possibly the coolest astrophysicist to have ever lived. Unfortunately this means that I have no idea what his research is about (since even this autobiography of sorts breezes through his grad school years) but that I do know he's one of the great modern popularizers of science. The Sky is Not the Limit shed light both on his astrophysical and personal life and gives more detail beyond his Daily Show persona. From beginnings, including going up to the roof with a telescope and occasionally having the police called to investigate the person with the long, thin object on the top of a NYC building roof, to his continuing themes of Pluto and inaccuracy in movies (sorry ""Gravity"" folks, this was a thing years before he pointed out every inaccuracy), Tyson tells stories with his usual charm and humor. Really, if it's any hint to other scientists out there, adopting more of Tyson's wonder at the universe and making it obvious to others is a great way to start doing some outreach. Other, less run of the mill topics included Tyson's experience during the 9/11 attack on New York, including evacuating with his daughter. Also, a chapter about his experiences as black man in modern America were particularly interesting, especially since the discussion occurred at a conference for African American physicists (who had all very similar experiences with the police and shopping mall cops--interesting too in light of the Henry Lewis Gates, Jr.'s run in with local cops not too many years ago). The experiences of both being an astrophysicist (which of course I am interested in as I am working on a PhD in a subfield of astrophysics) and being an underrepresented minority (also applicable) were interesting as both an insight into how scientists think but also how they develop. One thing missing that I very much wanted to hear about was Tyson's graduate school experiences. He alludes to issues at his first institution as a reason for finishing his master's there and taking some time off, and I was very curious to learn more about it. I'm not trying to pry, but my very new position as a graduate student has made me curious about others' experiences. NDT has been a scientific role model for me for years, so I was hoping to glean some advice about how to get that PhD without going nuts. Still, the range and interesting nature of Neil deGrasse Tyson's observations throughout his life and career were fascinating, and it's well worth the read especially for non-scientists, because more than a few times Tyson is spot on about how the minds of us scientists work. "
12,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3382610-melinda,4,"Very entertaining memoir, but a bit dated since it was written in 2004. Would love to know more about the past 10 years, and sad illness caused us to miss deGrasse Tyson speak here in Madison. Main point that will stay with me in this book it nurturing the natural passions of our children. He was 9 when he set his sights on the stars, and his parents supported and encouraged him every step of the way. Second point, the important of science projects and critical thinking as part of childhood. As a lawyer mom I am always challenging the kids on arguments and assumptions, but not the natural scientist I vow to pull out some of those kid science project books I've bought. Well worth the read. deGrasse Tyson is funny, infinitely smart, and makes the bold comments we need to make about valuing, not belittling, scientific and math literacy. Thank you! "
13,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3770740-candice,4,"Neil De Grasse Tyson is an astrophysicist, he's the director of the Hayden Planetarium, and he's black – a combination making for a unique viewpoint. The book is mostly autobiography with a good helping of space science. Tyson's kind of a larger-than-life figure, and the same energy he brings to his interviews permeates this fun – and often funny – book. He never hesitates to detail his accomplishments,which is great, as he's done some amazing things. He doesn't downplay how much the media seems to love him (which is also great - I wish reporters would call working scientists more often), but he also mentions things like his drawer full of hate mail from third graders about his stance on Pluto's planetary status. We need more people like him in the public eye."
14,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9147502-andreas,4,"It tells the somewhat inspiring story of Neil deGrasse Tyson. He focuses especially on his way through High-School and College, as well as the troubles he faced due to his skincolor. He also offers his thoughts on several subjects, such as religion, 9/11 and the mediaIt is written with a certain kind of dry wit which I enjoyed quite alot.However, he judges certain groups of people pretty harshly within the book, so if that kind of stuff isn't your cup of tea, you best avoid this book."
15,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1178167-tracey-baptiste,4,"Makes me wish I'd taken some college-level math so I'd have a better understanding of the universe and how it works. But it's not necessary to know any math to read the book. It's quite a good portrayal of a regular guy who became one of the most prominent astrophysicists of our time, and who just happens to be black, breaking the mold on stereotypes. Plus, it's witty and elegant."
16,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30614192-savannah,5,This man is very brilliant. Neil Degrasse Tyson for president please.
17,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2996033-sistermagpie,4,"Fun book by Neil deGrasse Tyson, the astrophysicist of the title. It's not quite an autobiography, more of him just musing about his life and how he sees the world with fun digressions into things like peoples' reactions to math equations and the end of the world. It's not too big on hard dates which for my purposes is a little difficult--it feels like his 14th year lasted forever! But I really liked the personal stories he told about that time. It's comforting to read about a kid who was not perfect but really excited about learning and intelligent when he's surrounded by people inspired to support him in that. "
18,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2860910-linda,5,"An interesting and informative read. For most of the book I wondered why the author made very little of the fact that he's a man of color. I thought that certainly must have been a factor in his life. And, sure enough, later in the book he devotes a chapter about how his color did play a roll for him. He is certainly an amazing and accomplished man, irrelevant of his skin color. And a good writer, too."
19,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37650802-kara,3,"3.5 stars. An episodic look back on Tyson's career up to 2004, interspersed with a lot of scientific information. I was expecting a more cohesive, singular narrative of his past based on the description, but this book was more anecdotal than not. Some parts of Tyson's experience are really powerful and unique, and I was especially moved when he recalled being in NYC during 9/11 and reflected on his experiences as a black man and astrophysicist in America. However, in other places he can be rather condescending towards others, especially if they don't have as deep an understanding of astrophysics as he does, which could be a little off-putting to me as a reader. All in all an interesting read, though a bit of a mixed bag due to the considerations noted above."
20,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19094894-beverly-hollandbeck,3,"I thought I was getting an autobiography of Neil deGrasse Tyson. He did include a few personal stories, but he spent a lot of time explaining cosmic stuff. I think he can't help himself. Also, I got the feeling that some of the chapters were recycling of speeches he had made. You'd think his life would be so full that he could write a whole book about himself. Or more likely, when he is talking about th cosmos, he IS talking about himself, as I have heard him say that all of us are made with the stuff of the universe. I mostly skipped the chapter that detailed ways the universe could kill us all at once."
21,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71834000-castles,3,"I love Mr. Tyson and it’s tempting to rate any of his books high because of the the the magic of the subject and his friendly approach. This book is not different, though more of an autobiography than the rest of his books, it’s still fascinating, at points even more than usual because it’s nice to read about his passion sometimes more than reading complicated physics. At times I’ve found some of his approaches a bit arrogant and surprisingly ditching others, usually for their poor understanding of astrophysics. What’s up with that? "
22,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2221534-brie,3,"It was interesting to see how Tyson got to be where he is and the challenges he faced. Not as good as his other books, but still interesting. He really is a great writer and speaker, and knows how to bring the very complicated subject of astrophysics down to everyone's level. If you enjoyed this, I highly recommend his Death by Black Hole."
23,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2272277-julie,4,"Neil deGrasse Tyson tells us what it was like growing up as a kid in the city with an early passion for astronomy. He got to do some really cool stuff at an early age.

24,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5346734-linda,3,"Tyson is a classy guy with a great story. It is well worth reading. With that said, it took me months and months to finish the book. I'd read a chapter and not read another one for weeks. There is nothing wrong with the book or the story. Tyson came from humble beginnings. He's brilliant, and he worked hard. He's a family man, happily married with kids. This just doesn't make for page-turning excitement. I highly recommend the book, but you will be able to put it down. "
25,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2450961-james-martin,4,"I've seen quite a few of Dr. Tyson's lectures and interviews on the web, so I thought I might like reading some of his work, and a memoir seemed like an easy first step. I enjoyed this book. It's mostly autobiography, of course, but there's also a bit of cosmology, media criticism, social criticism, and some thoughts on education and religion. It is, for the most part, a light and entertaining read. And, having read it, I'm certainly likely to give some of his other books a try. "
26,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/737449-michael,3,"I've enjoyed everything I've read by Tyson. This book seemed 70% biography, and 30% opinion. This is not a negative critique of the book. I'm interested in just about anything he wants to talk about. Having now gotten some background information on him, my opinion has not changed. This will definitely make you look a little inward, and assess whether or not you have had a productive and fulfilling life."
27,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42346401-sharon-healy-yang,5,"Tyson is bright, funny, and inspiring. He deftly blends reason and impish humor to reveal the need for applying the clarity and logic that science demands to our everyday life. His chapter on ""Dark Matters"" is a sensitive, wise use of inductive argument to circumvent the usual knee-jerk emotional responses to the topic of racism, freeing his readers to recognize its pervasiveness. I use the book in my Critical and Creative Thinking class, and the students love it."

And it really is interesting to learn about how all the elementary school hate mail to Neil following the his stance on Pluto or his day spent with Carl Sagan as he considered universities. Like, leave some awesome for the rest of us, NGT. And, as far as readability, this book reads in the same charming dialect that he speaks. So hurry up and read it. "

He's good on the Daily Show, but...meh."

He meanders a bit in the events of his life and career. The book is way too short, but still very enjoyable. His experiences as a rare black man in the field in a lot of ways mirror the struggles of women of any color in the field, so it felt especially relevant to me."
31,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2342151-sean-mcbride,3,"Mr. Tyson is my absolute favorite scientist and frankly a man I look up to. I thought this might have been a little more robust than just a biography, but even so he has led a fascinating life and is the most brilliant and common-sensical man alive.

32,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7623414-chris,4,"This is the fascinating story of Neil deGrasse Tyson's life, with bits about the life of Earth and the universe thrown in free of charge. The story of why Neil didn't become a stripper after all is worth the price of admission. The stories of his experiences of 9/11 and living as a black scientist in America are, of course, less amusing but far more revealing. Highly recommended."
33,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5937919-daniel-farabaugh,5,"Having read numerous scientific works by Tyson, I was fully expecting and rewarded by his insight to the scientific world. What this book added was a perspective on the scientist himself. His recounting of his childhood is fascinating and especially poignant are his reflections on race. Truly excellent. "
34,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14734538-roberto-rigolin-f-lopes,4,"Amusing how Tyson's position about space exploration matches with Asimov's, especially in the book “The end of eternity”. Most impressive, Neil is actually pushing it into the U.S. space program. His life is full of accomplishments despite the odds against him. As he put it, it was not a gift but hard work! Quite inspiring reading."
35,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5955667-dana,5,"Enthralling read. I have this on my Fire, and didn't realize I'd reached the end - I literally said out loud, ""There's no more?"" Even if you don't consider yourself science-focused, this is a very inspiring read that demonstrates exactly how hard work pays off. I think it would be an excellent read for young people, and also those of us who are older and may have found ourselves a bit lost. "
36,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51170323-nate-carlson,5,"What can I say? I love this man, I love his voice, I love his insight, his humour. Neil deGrasse Tyson got me into science in a period of my life when my teachers were subpar, and for that I will always be in his debt. His story is far more interesting than mine though. If you loved his other books on the universe, or if you just saw Cosmos, you'll enjoy this book."

But reading this book brought to me a thirst to learn more.Not only will you learn about outer space but you will learn about the man and his up hill struggles to become one of the leading authorities on the cosmos.
39,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/557983-lauren,4,"A memoir by my favorite, funniest scientist. I thought it would be a good place to start before I read the rest of his more scientific work. It's read-aloud-to-your-spouse-while-he-rolls-his-eyes funny."
40,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3974273-charles,4,"A solid read. Tyson is my favorite scientist in the public eye. He makes science fun. This was an enjoyable autobiography, although Tyson does at times get a bit full of himself, especially when he talks about how physically gifted he is compared to other scientists. "
41,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5919644-claire,0,"Excellent memoir. Funny, enlightening, inspiring and interesting, especially the last two chapters ""The End of the World"" and and ""God and the Astronomers"". But the whole book was really neat. A great insight into a great mind!"
42,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3936195-jason,4,"I read this and thought ""how great is it that this guy, at the age of 9, decided his destiny and made it happen."" Worth reading if only for that. Sure, Mr Tyson turns a good phrase, and there is more than a few laughs. Worth reading. Makes me simultaneously glad and sad."
43,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/603174-jason,5,"This memoir gives fuel to anyone to shoot for the stars, or whatever their dreams are. Really enjoyed the last chapter that connects math and science. Plus the great argument as to why we should switch to the metric system. "

45,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5207645-milka,4,"A very interesting autobiography, in which Tyson shares how and why he knew from early on that studying the universe would be his life path, and how he became the most famous American astrophysicist of our times."
46,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17061542-zoe-s-human,3,"It's an interesting autobiography, which covered more than just science - his experience as a black man in a white dominated culture, his experience of 9/11 as a New Yorker, etc. However, it meandered at times. Sudden leaps were made and rambling occurred. Still well worth my time though."
47,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1498595-ra,4,"2004 semi-biography of the great astrophysicist, thoughtful, with personal details, including appropriate racial issues, and plenty of theory.

49,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51024943-bobbi,4,"Dr. DeGrasse Tyson has written a most readable book. He has gotten me much more interested in the cosmos, as he put forth an honest rendering of his life as a significantly smart urban astrophysicist."
50,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75857-emma,1,Eh. Stronger first half than second. He lost my appreciation when he started bashing Mary Poppins. Not cool.
51,159102188X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/369112-melody,4,"Fun, informative, and cheeky, this is not your average astrophysicist's memoir. Tyson is a singular kind of guy, funny and passionate and intense."
