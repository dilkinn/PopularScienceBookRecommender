0,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5789830-tim,2,"I had serious problems with the way this book is written. Though Grandin's plainspoken writing style is refreshing, I often felt like she was oversimplifying very complex ideas in order to appeal to a scientifically illiterate audience (or worse, to make her arguments more convincing). Statements such as ""Autism is a kind of way station on the road from animals to humans"" aren't just over-dramatic (and ultimately nonsensical), they're also potentially offensive. Much of the book is purely speculative, and I'm left wondering whether it's really appropriate to write a popular science book that's mostly about completely untested hypotheses (this seems to be a growing trend in popular science literature, but that's another discussion entirely).At the very least, Grandin could have been clearer in differentiating between 1) widely accepted scientific consensus, 2) well regarded schools of thought, 3) contested minority theories, 4) solitary experiments that have not been reproduced, 5) purely anecdotal evidence from her own life or that of friends, and 6) her own untested hypotheses. As is, they all sort of blur together, and a reader not entirely familiar with how science works might be led to buy into Grandin's arguments with less skepticism than is warranted. It certainly didn't help that many of the studies and ""facts"" she mentioned weren't even cited. Those that were were often cited as news publications ABOUT scientific studies rather than directly citing the studies themselves. It's important to remember that much of what is written about in the book is outside of Grandin's own area of professional expertise, and though I think it's perfectly fine to write about a topic you don't have a degree in, it was things like that that made me wonder whether Grandin herself could stand to be a little more skeptical, methodical, and cautious. To put it simply, I trusted her when she was talking about farm animals and dogs, less so when she was talking about neuroscience and other kinds of animals, and not at all when she tried giving insight into stuff like politics or child rearing.One constant point of annoyance: For someone with a PhD in Animal Science, I was astounded that Grandin seemed to have no idea whatsoever of what the word ""animal"" even means. The book was littered with phrases like, ""Animals feel pain. So do birds, and we now have pretty good evidence that fish feel pain too"" or ""I know dung beetles are insects, not animals, but..."" Since distinguishing between the six taxonomical kingdoms is one of those things you learn in 9th grade bio class, I can only assume that Grandin is dumbing down for her audience. This has the duel effect of insulting the intelligence of those readers who have a basic grasp of Bio 101, and spreading misinformation and confusion among those who don't.The confusion over the category of ""animal"" extends to talking about humans as well: ""People were animals too, once,"" she writes. And what - we're not any more? Throughout the book, Grandin condemns overgeneralizing (a vice she associates with ""normal people"") and champions a pragmatic focus on specific details (a skill she associates with autistic people and animals) as the best way to handle any situation. Yet Grandin is guilty of many massive over-generalizations (the aforementioned ""waystation"" idea being one example, her failure to treat autism as a spectrum being another). And among the most frustrating of these for me was Grandin's view of humanity's relationship to the rest of the animal world, which is vague, romantic, and naive. Statements like ""dogs and people belong together"" or ""people and animals are supposed to be together"" amount to nothing more than mushy utopianism. What exactly would such a thing even mean? Together how? Grandin never elaborates.Her idea of ""nature"" is pretty unscientific as well. At one point she asks, ""Is animal infanticide really what nature intended? Or is it, at least some of the time, an aberration of what nature intended?"" That question doesn't even begin to make logical sense. What kind of mystical nature is Grandin talking about that has things like intention? Nature doesn't intend. There are no aberrations in nature. These are human concepts. Nature just is. Even if she takes the classic anthropocentric view of defining nature as ""everything in the world except humans and things made by humans,"" the question still doesn't make any sense. Animals have been killing their young long before humans even existed. What Grandin really means to say is that animal infanticide seems to serve no evolutionary purpose. This may be debatable. But either way, plenty of animal (and especially human) behaviors serve no apparent evolutionary purpose. ""Evolutionarily advantageous"" is not the same as ""natural"" and neither of those is the same as ""right,"" ""good,"" ""moral"" or what have you.All that having been said, Grandin's many anecdotes are entertaining and there's a lot of cool ideas to chew on throughout. If you're an avid reader of pop neuroscience or animal studies books, you might already have encountered a good deal of this stuff, but the parallels Grandin draws are interesting (even if I'm skeptical of some of them) and her emphasis on ""getting inside the black box"" of the animal mind is an important one. Overall, I enjoyed reading this book, even if I was often frustrated with it."
1,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1836077-lightreads,4,"Came for the autism, stayed for the Labradors. Background: Temple Grandin is an animal behavior specialist. She's single-handedly revolutionized the humane treatment of slaughter animals in the United States. She's also a vital force in the neurodiversity movement. This book argues broadly that animal cognition shares some key features with autistic cognition – picture-thinking, working memory shortages, detail-fixation, etc. It also takes a fascinating tour through what we know about animal emotion, consciousness, and cognition.Awesome, on multiple levels. The animal psychology wasn't just interesting (though it really is!) but also useful for those of us who handle a working dog. And also, Temple Grandin is one of those people who manages to make her life a sustained act of advocacy, which is something I aspire to on my very best days. This book spends some time explicitly explaining autistic cognition, but it more subtly is autistic in a way that just says, here's my brain. It's not like yours. Just so you know. "
2,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22110057-debbie-zapata,4,"My mother gave me this book and I wanted to get it read before my next trip north. I am very glad I did; it was fascinating on many levels.Temple Grandin uses her own life experience as a person with autism to explore animal behavior. She compares the way brains work: 'normal' human, autistic human, animal. She talks about her own work and research with animals, but also mentions many research projects and publications that also deal with the ideas of why we (animals and people) are the way we are. How similar are we? How different? Chapters range from 'How Animals Perceive The World' to 'Animal Aggression' to 'How Animals Think'. She talks about selective breeding and how it is changing not only dog breeds but pigs and cattle as well, because when one specific trait is encouraged, a lot of others are lost, thus affecting the overall disposition of the animal and creating health or behavior issues that were not around before. I was tickled by the idea of prairie dog language, and the reason offered for why these little rodents seem to have developed the ability to use calls that correspond to nouns, verbs, entire sentences. While Man usually congratulates himself for being the only creature intelligent enough to develop language, what if that ability actually came from being a prey animal? If you are a prey animal and have no way at all to communicate to your fellows, you will all be eaten eventually. Prairie dogs are every predators favorite snack. Not hard to imagine how tantalizing early man would have been to all the hungry predators around those days. Language in man would have made it easier to survive. Apparently language in prairie dogs is doing the same thing. I thought that was cool, and would love to read more of the original papers written by Con Slobodchikoff about his research and findings.I don't usually take as many notes for a print book as I do when I am reading online, so I don't have specific examples handy to share. But I have worked with animals: dogs and cats at two veterinary clinics, and even more closely later with horses. I found myself constantly thinking 'yes, of course', or 'Oh, that makes so much sense'. I think anyone who observes, loves, and understands animals will appreciate this book. And if a reader wants to develop better relationships with animals but would like some guidance, this an excellent place to begin, in my opinion. During my four years living and working on a horse breeding farm, I often felt like one of the herd, as odd as that may sound. But I had developed a connection to the horses that allowed me to wander around with them as if, in their eyes, I was just another horse. This was a huge benefit when I was working with the babies. Once I was able to figure out why one youngster freaked out whenever we walked past a certain pick-up truck: he was seeing his reflection in the shiny bumper and thought it was a horse-eating monster. I coaxed him up to the truck and had him touch noses with himself. Whether he understood exactly what he was seeing at that point, I don't know, but he immediately relaxed, his entire body language revealing that he seemed very proud of himself right then, and he never was scared of that shiny truck bumper again.My experiences over the years on the farm is why I agree so strongly with Ms. Grandin's final thoughts:""I don't know if people will ever be able to talk to animals the way Doctor Doolittle could, or whether animals will be able to talk back. Maybe science will have something to say about that.But I do know people can learn to ""talk"" to animals, and to hear what animals have to say, better than they do now. I also know that a lot of times people who can talk to animals are happier than people who can't. People were animals, too, once, and when we turned into human beings we gave something up. Being close to animals brings some of it back."" "
3,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103544-sammy,4,"This book truly is a must-read for any pet owner, and I highly recommend it to anyone who just loves animals. Temple Grandin offers fascinating insights to the animal world, which will confirm things long time pet owners always knew, and bring to light startling new information.One main thing this book brings to light is to not underestimate animals or those with autism because often times they're smarter than us. Yet, that's one thing Grandin tries to avoid, saying things like animals are smarter or humans are smarter. Rather she just tries to point out that animals may do things differently but that doesn't mean they're stupid. It's all about skill level that certain creatures are better at than others.This book never got boring, whereas many other ""animal"" books tend to get dry and scientific. Grandin, while delving into scientific facts, puts them into words the average person can understand, and most always will support every fact or theory with an example. Always there was some story to go along with everything she was telling the reader about, and every story was amusing and fascinating to read about.Another thing this book was wonderful at was pointing out autistic characteristics in a way that's not so harsh or right in your face of ""look at how similar they are!"" It was gentle, casual, not making a big deal out of it. It's also divided into easy sections so if you want to skip something or find something specific you can.I really enjoyed this book. I want to try to get my roommate with the puppy to read it because it will teach her things about her dog that I'm sure she never knew. This is a very good book to have at your side when training animals, or even planning on getting one. Even if you've had your current pet for a decade, still get this book, it may help you when Fluffy starts doing something completely off the wall."
4,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80316998-howard,5,4.5 Stars for Animals in Translation (audiobook) by Temple Grandin and Catherine Johnson read by Shelly Frazier. I find it fascinating getting to see the world through Temple’s eyes. Her understand of how animals think is amazing. This book is a great resource for everyone who has animals in there lives. From dogs and cats to horses and cows. This book explains how to provide a proper environment for the animals and how to correct their behavior in a humane way. 
5,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/139334-jessica,4,"I liked this book more than I expected. For a long time, I'd been reluctant to pick it up because I thought the premise was more or less, ""I'm autistic so I'm halfway between 'normal' people and animals (every other species)."" I'm sure I don't need to explain why that's offensive.Instead, Dr. Grandin uses brain research, coupled with her experience as an autistic person, to try to explain how members of other species may experience the world.If you can disregard the sweeping generalizations about ""animals"" (which range from clams to humans), Dr. Grandin has a lot to say. For starters, she points out that we don't treat other animals very well -- and she goes on to explain how treating members of other species as if they were human won't really rectify the situation. And some of the research she discusses is fascinating. I, for one, never knew that prairie dogs' language is so rich that it can be characterized in terms of nouns, verbs, and even adverbs.Where I do take offense is that this book starts from the major premise that animal liberation is a pipe dream and that humans will continue to keep other species in captivity to serve our most trivial whims for time immemorial. The world Dr. Grandin envisions is one that's infinitely more humane than the one that exists now -- but I have hope that we can achieve even more."
6,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5715723-krista,3,"I have mixed feelings about this book, and I haven't finished it, so I'm not sure if it's fair to write a review yet. But one thing keeps annoying me throughout the text: her constant use of the term ""animals"" when she really means ""mammals"" or specifically livestock. She makes generalizations such as ""animals are visual creatures"" which is certainly not true for the majority of animal species. She's specifically talking about livestock and hoofstock, but she's not using the specific term. On page 59, she uses dung beetles in an example of differing forms of sensory perception but then actually writes ""I know dung beetles are insects, not animals, but...""Um, what? You have a PhD in animal science, but you don't think insects are animals?In order to get through the book I find myself mentally replacing the word ""animal"" with ""mammal"" in order for the text to make sense -- but even then, there's too many gross generalizations that annoy me. Also, Grandin comes across as somewhat smug and snobby about her ""talent"", but I'll attribute that to her autism and difficulty with human social interactions.I agree with some of her perspectives; disagree with others. It's not a bad book, but it's certainly not the be-all and end-all of animal behavior. "
7,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5946412-elizabeth,2,"I was actually really disappointed in this book. It seemed like just a collection of anecdotes. There was some science to back up her hypotheses but there wasn't that much. I was hoping for some better insights.She also makes some crazy generalizations. For example the paint horse that was crazy and had whole body twitches every 30 seconds or so. She said it was Tourrett's like and was probably because he had a lot of white coloration. She never explored that maybe he received a physical head injury at some point or other nerve trauma. She just assumed it was white. I have never heard of this being common in any other paints or breeds that have a lot of white (Appaloosas, Lippazzaners etc).I was expecting more out of this book because of all of the hype.Read it for the few good ideas and some interesting parallels and correlations but there is actually very little concrete science or conclusions that could be drawn from any of this."
8,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1480887-kspeare,3,"I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, it's almost worth the purchase price for the explanation of the difference between negative reinforcement and punishment, a distinction that escapes far too many pet owners, not to mention parents. And there is a ton of useful information in it for people who are learning about how animals think.However, there are a few spots in it that give me cause for pause. Grandin has some unique ways of looking at things, and once she has a hypothesis, she is going to prove it come hell or high water. One fairly benign example is that she seems to be under the impression that only autistic humans think in pictures. Of course, many humans who aren't autistic but are visually oriented think in pictures at least as much as in words, and in many cases more so.More worrisome is her hypothesis that animals are mentally ill in direct proportion to the amount of white skin they have. She contends that paint horses are crazier than solid-colored ones, and the more white they have, the crazier they are. As anyone who has worked with very many examples of both knows, paints on average tend to be mellower than many other breeds which are solid-colored, and the amount of white skin has nothing to do with it. The most reactive paint I ever worked with had only a small splash of white on his belly and white stockings, while one of the most levelheaded ones was an overo with only a minimal amount of color other than white. This kind of pants-seat hypothesizing worries me, because readers who don't know better may take it as gospel.So this book it worth reading, IMO, but if something in it sounds off to you, check it out with a knowledgeable friend."
9,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1122133-suzanna,5,"This was a GREAT book for anyone who wants to learn about the way animals process information - and as a bonus, you learn about how humans do as well. I love that the author puts things in terms a lay person can understand, and I love that she is honest and humble. Grandin writes matter-of-factly about her own disability, and how it has enabled her to identify with the minds of animals in certain ways. I came away with a deeper understanding of how to interact with my horses and dogs, and found that many of the ideas I had suspected about their mentality, she confirms. There were a few small (very small) theoretical points on which I disagreed with the author. But these minor issues are entirely theoretical, and don't take anything away from the book.A very worthwhile read for any animal lover/owner/handler, or just anyone with an interest in the mind and how it functions. "
10,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,4,"The word ""animals"" is in the title, but the reader learns a lot about human behavior from this book. The author writes from her own personal perspective of being autistic. I learned from the book that the frontal lobe's ability to screen through all the incoming sensory data to the human brain to quickly form broad generalizations is what we understand to be normal human consciousness. The more limited functioning of animal frontal lobes allows them more direct access to the raw data from lower parts of the brain. This allows animals to super specialize in certain skills that help them to survive. (i.e. dog's ability to smell, or migratory bird's ability to remember 1,000 mile routes). Impared functioning of the frontal lobe may explain how some autistic persons appear to have super human skills in specialized areas. They have privileged access to the raw data from the lower parts of the brain unfettered by screening by the frontal lobes. Unfortunately, it also explains how other autistic persons can be overwhelmed by the flood of incoming sensory data and are unable respond appropriately to their surroundings.The book is full of interesting anecdotal stories about human and animal behavior. One part I found particularly fascinating is the theory that the evolution of the human brain may have been influenced by the presence of domesticated wolves (i.e. dogs). I know it sounds hard to believe, but there is a rational basis for such speculation. The comparison of dog and wolf genetics indicates that dogs started being domesticated about 135,000 years ago which is the approximate time that modern humans began spreading throughout the world. The partnership between dogs and humans may have given an edge to modern humans in their competition with Neanderthals in Europe during the last ice age. So the expression, ""Man's best friend,"" may have more truth to it than we realize!"
11,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57158143-bibliovoracious,5,"How wonderful! I can't believe it took me so long to get to this. I love her unique style, and the stories from her exceedingly unique life experience, but most of all her insights. I feel a lot of commonality to what she describes, making me wonder (am I on the spectrum?). The answer is that I think we all are (the spectrum is long), and if we  allow a type of awareness that's perhaps less socially cultivated and rewarded, we can easily recognize and respond to the truth and insight that she LIVES, every day, by default, in her state of being and thinking. Far beyond telling us how animals are special, Temple Grandin's whole amazing life's work is telling us how special the viewpoint from autism is, and how human diversity is a gift to humanity."
12,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/120541-lauren,5,"This book is so awesome, everyone should read it. Grandin talks about the ways that her autism gives her insight into animal behavior, while weaving in discussions of genetics, breeding practices, and stories about animals. She talks about horses, cows, cats, dogs, and chickens, really there's something for everyone. Grandin is responsible for the redesign of slaughterhouses to be a lot more humane (she talks about some of the contradictions in ethics this entails, but overall, it seems like a very good thing that most major meat packers are using her systems), a nice counterpart to some of the hype created by FAST FOOD NATION and the like. It's just start to finish fascinating."
13,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17817291-tim,5,"This book was an absolute delight to read. I wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone everywhere but especially to people who have an affinity for animals. You learn a great deal about animals in these pages but by way of contrast and compare you also learn a whole lot about human beings. Using scientific studies of animals, her own experiences as an autistic person, and her experiences working with commercial enterprises to improve the welfare of animals, the author hypothesizes that the way autistic people perceive the world may be similar to the way animals perceive the world.  Quite a few of the statements in this book begin with the phrase 'I think' or something similar so the author does acknowledge she is speculating. However, it is not unfounded speculation. Her method for discovering some unidentified factor in the farm environment that is scaring or harming the animals and then suggesting changes involves seeing things not from the perspective of a human but that of an animal. The reason she is so successful at this is because autistic people (based on her own experience and many other studies) perceive the world differently than most humans do. People see one unified thing: a landscape, a building, a statue. Autistic people see a collection of details. A fence made of weathered cedar posts, a length of rusty chain, a bright yellow rain coat, etc. When it comes to identifying what is spooking an animal, the devil, as they say, is in the details. So who better to note that than someone who sees discrete objects as collections of details? People focus in on the things they want or expect to see and all of the other details fade into the background (the 'Gorillas In Our Midst' psychology experiment is a well known example of this). Autistic people are less prone to doing that. The reason for this, according to the author, is because autistic people think with pictures instead of words (ie. they think in concrete terms and see details whereas people who think with words think in abstract terms and see objects). Mammals and to a lesser degree, autistic people, have a less developed frontal cortex. One of the roles of the frontal cortex is to serve as an associative system. It takes a whole bunch of seemingly unrelated details and associates them into one integrated whole. There is an expression: big picture thinking. The neocortex is responsible for big picture thinking. We invent or discover a sort of overarching structure that binds all of the disparate details of existence into one coherent whole (which of the two we believe we are doing is obviously going to be based to some degree on the subjective epistemology of the individual him/herself and is a debate outside the considerations of the book). In terms of personal history, these overarching structures are known as schemas/schemata, in terms of human history they are called meta-narratives. Basically, your neocortex looks at the details and tells you a story about what life is about. It takes all of those details and turns them into one cohesive thing. This may be a good thing but like all good things, there is a trade-off. The author explains: 'The price human beings pay for having such big, fat frontal lobes is that normal people become oblivious in a way animals and autistic people aren't. Normal people stop seeing the details that make up the big picture and see only the big picture instead. That's what your frontal lobes do for you: they give you the big picture. Animals see all the tiny little details that go into the picture.'I am going into all of this detail because it sets the stage for the topics covered in this book and compares how a neurotypical human experiences it, how an autistic person experiences it, and how it is believed (based on things like observation and fMRI scans) an animal may be experiencing it. The TLDR: the author is using the autistic perspective to translate the intellect, emotions, and perceptions of animals into terms a non-autistic human can understand. Thus the title 'Animals In Translation.' There is a lot of fascinating information about animals in this book, divided up into the following chapters:How Animals Perceive The WorldAnimal FeelingsAnimal AggressionPain and SufferingHow Animals ThinkAnimal Genius: Extreme TalentsThis is bookended by a short autobiographical account and a behaviour and training troubleshooting guide. I am always amazed when I read accounts of animal intelligence. Alex the african gray parrot is one of the more famous examples. He became so adept at spelling he was able to spell out new sounds associated with objects without being trained to spell that particular word; demonstrating he wasn't merely parroting phrases, he had some grasp of the concept of phonics. Alex would also ask questions unprompted (for example, asking what colour he was when catching sight of himself in a mirror.) Another interesting area is research into the relationship between music and language. As humans, we tend to think of language merely as the content of a word or string of words. If I direct a statement at you, you understand what it is I am saying. While that is true, it is equally true that if I say something to you in a gruff manner, I have communicated something different than I would have if I had made the same statement in a well modulated tone. Likewise if my voice rises at the end of a statement, it turns that statement into a question. How something is said is as much a part of communication as what is being said. Tone matters. There is some research into whether some animals employ a sort of tonal proto-language. There is once again an autism connection here that the author unfolds. The author also considers the experiences of people who never learned any sort of verbal or sign language until they were fully grown adults. That was a fascinating read also. The story of Ildefonso, A Man Without Words, makes it clear that people can understand abstract concepts without the benefit of words.Tool manufacturing was another topic the author covered; crows bending wires into makeshift hooks was one example among a number the author gives. The current scientific controversy is whether animals are capable of true cognition, defined not as instinctual hard wired behaviour or learning a simple rule of thumb but instead solving a problem under novel conditions. Crows noting that cars stop at red traffic lights and go at green traffic lights, placing nuts in front of the front wheels when the light is red and then swooping down to eat the innards of the now broken nut after the light has turned green, the traffic has moved on, and the coast is clear might be an example of this.I have read before that it is the animals with the most complex brains that exhibit a greater potential for empathy. This book speculates about another, far less benign similarity between humans and animals with more complex brains:'.....when I read through the research literature I'm struck by the fact that the animals with the most complex brains are also the ones that engage in some of the nastiest behaviour. I suspect people and animals probably pay a price for having a complex brain. For one thing, in a complex brain there may be more opportunities for wiring mistakes that lead to vicious behavior. Another possibility is that since a more complex brain provides greater flexibility of behavior, animals with complex brains become free to develop new behaviors that will be good, bad, or in between. Human beings are capable of great love and sacrifice, but they are also capable of profound cruelty. Maybe animals are, too.'It was at this point that my own neocortex did that thing it does and made an association. Something I had read in the book Mere Christianity: that the more intelligent an entity is, the more potential it has for great good when it goes right but the more potential it has for great evil when it goes wrong. Of course, C. S. Lewis was looking upwards to celestial beings, this book is looking downwards to animals.There was so much intriguing material covered in this book I could go on at length. Suffice it to say, we've come a long way since Rene Descartes arbitrarily assigned animals to the category of automatons with no inner life. The author writes near the end of the book: 'It's time to start thinking of animals as capable and communicative beings. It's also time to stop making assumptions. Animal researchers take a lot for granted: “animals don't have language,” “animals don't have psychological self-awareness” - you find blanket statements like this sprinkled throughout the research literature. But the truth is, we don't know what animals can't do better than we know what they can do. It's hard to prove a negative, and proving negatives shouldn't be the focus.	If we're interested in animals, then we need to study animals for their own sake, and on their own terms, to the extent that it's possible. What are they doing? What are they feeling? What are they thinking? What are they saying?	Who are they?	And: what do we need to do to treat animals fairly, responsibly, and with kindness?	Those are the real questions.'Sigh. Now I want an african gray parrot so we can, you know, discuss the reality of platonic objects and stuff. But perhaps that is a job for The Philosopher's Dog?"
14,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4834052-jennifer,2,"I have mixed feelings about Temple Grandin's ""Animals in Translation"". On the one hand, she writes about interesting and useful concepts. On the other hand, parts of her book are outdated (I checked the publication date 3 times while reading to confirm the book was written this century) and oversimplified.I'm a professional dog trainer, so I'm constantly trying to figure out better and different ways to explain reinforcement (positive and negative), punishment (positive and negative), the hyper-specificity of fear, generalization of behaviors, the need for socialization, etc., to my students. These are all hard concepts for many to understand, and Grandin does a magnificent job of explaining them plainly. Her simple way of explaining these training concepts was wonderful, but doesn't work nearly so well when applied to more complex scientific concepts.If Grandin's book had been filled to the brim with journal citations and science vocabulary, it wouldn't have reached nearly as wide of an audience. However, she has dumbed things down to the point that she makes dramatic and overgeneralized statements. (For instance, her inaccurate statements about ""normal people"". It makes me wonder how many of her statements about people with autism, or animals, are also inaccurate.) Her writing style also makes it hard to differentiate fact, from theory, from hypothesis, from her own speculation. Her use of outdated hypotheses was especially grating.One example of this, was her use of the triune brain model (the reptile, animal and human brain) as fact. I learned about this model in college, but only in the sense that it hasn't been embraced by the scientific community as a valid hypothesis since the 1990's. Based on her writings, she is also appears to be a believer in dominance theory. Dominance theory originated with a study of captive wolves back in the 1940s. This study spawned more studies of captive wolves. Captive wolves act nothing like wolves in the wild. Wolves in zoos are (usually) unrelated and forced to live together in an unnatural environment--as a result they do engage in violent social struggles. These findings on captive wolves were then wrongly applied to wild wolves, and then our pet dogs. In the wild, struggles for ""dominance"" would simply take too much energy. Wolf packs work like a family depending on each other to survive, and fighting would inhibit the pack's ability to do so.The definition of ""dominance"" is not what most people believe it to be (which is also the way that Grandin uses this word). Dominance only describes the relationship between two individuals in terms of one individual having pick of a specific resource (such as food, water, toys, etc.) over the other individual. Dominance of a resource is not achieved through force, but through through one individual peacefully allowing the other first pick. It's like letting your little brother have the chicken leg out of the bucket of fried chicken. Technically, you could physically assault your brother to claim the chicken leg for yourself, but it's easier just to let you brother have it. When you see a dog use force to get what they want, it isn't dominance, but instead an anxiety-based behavior. This tends to be exacerbated when followed up by verbal/physical threats from a human owner attempting to show their ""dominance"" over the anxious dog. Dominance theory is not only flawed and dangerous, but also ignores that fact that wolves are NOT dogs. Dogs are about 14,000 years (or possibly 100,000 according to Grandin) of evolution away from wolves. Dominance theory has widely penetrated our society, but has been on it's way out of dog training for about 20 years now.Due to this, Grandin's book was incredibly hard to get through. Most any time she talked about dogs, I ended up putting the book down and walking away out of frustration. The plain language of this book leads me to believe its intended audience is readers with little science background. This combined with the blurred lines between outdated concepts, current theories, and personal speculation, I worry that many readers won't think critically about the concepts she's introducing.There are ideas in this book that are accurate and would be helpful in interacting with animals, but others that are outdated or (like dominance theory) even harmful. The title ""Animals in Translation"" implies this book will gives readers a greater understanding about the inner workings of an animal's mind. However, I mostly feel like I need to fact check everything I learned from reading this book."
15,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1442386-hillarymagee,5,"Where do I start? This book was delightful. I so enjoyed this look into Temple Grandin's life and her life's work. Though I don't think Grandin would ever describe life with Autism as easy, she's certainly not going to sit around and pity herself either. Grandin was key to her own autism therapy at a very young age, designing a ""squeeze"" apparatus modeled after a machine she saw on her aunt's cow farm that was designed to gently squeeze the cattle as a means of calming them. Grandin had rather interesting childhood and achieved a PhD. Her life's work is to ensure humane treatment of cattle that are designated for slaughter, and with only 10 simple rules, she has done wonders for the industry and the cows that feed us. One of the comments on the back of the book stated that the reviewer was often unsure if this was a book about animals that used autism to help explain them or if it was a book about autism that used animals to help explain it. I feel as though I came away with a wealth of information about animals and about the hidden blessings that can be associated with autism. I loved this book and cannot recommend it highly enough"
16,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2083208-janice,4,"I liked this book and found many of the author's insights fascinating. It is interesting in reading reviews that many people gave it five stars but an almost equal number gave it a one star. I think there was one reviewer that said she'd have given it less than the one if that option was available. My main complaint with the book was that there were too many (though captivating) details and not enough generalizations. But, that is what makes this book interesting. Temple Grandin admits that this is what autism is about and I think makes clear with her writing. I'll definitely be thinking about this book and reviewing some of the notes I took. By the way I don't normally mark passages but I was afraid I couldn't find them again because they were scattered about so much (like the nuts that squirrels hide for themselves) I was afraid I couldn't find them again.I found a wonderful interview with Temple at: http://conversations.psu.edu/episodes...It was so interesting to hear her speak after reading the book."
17,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26259-jenne,4,"I'm not really much of an animal person, but I liked this book a lot, mostly for the view it gives you of what it might be like to be autistic. I'd be interested to meet Temple Grandin. I'm amazed that she has managed to build such an impressive career, since she says in this book that until she was about thirty, every day she had the same feeling of anxiety that you get when you are about to defend your doctoral dissertation. Every day! She eventually started taking medication that improved things for her, but it's hard to imagine surviving that level of stress for so long.If you do have a pet, definitely read this book--it gives a lot of interesting insights into why animals behave the way they do."
18,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/811765-mandy-leins,4,"Temple Grandin is autistic, and has applied her experiences as an autistic woman to her work with animals. This book is sprinkled with information from all aspects of her work, including anecdotes of working within the food industry and why animals that are photographed in the wild are almost all marked with a white patch (no joke). It's a bit of a hard slog at times, and if you are at all at odds with the slaughter industry, you may feel that she is acting as an apologist and might become angry. While I don't believe she is doing so, I do believe that she is presenting events in a positive light, especially given her efforts to make slaughter more humane. Definitely worth a read."
19,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7813734-mom,4,"This is another exceptional read by Temple Grandin. Each book improves upon the last. I had a little trouble getting through it because it's very text heavy. This is not a complaint about the book, I just have trouble reading highly intelligent theories and thick content. Still I enjoyed it and I am ready to tackle her next book."

21,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1072582-kaethe-douglas,5,"Grandin is a fine writer, with real insight into the lives of animals of all sorts. i enjoy all her books."
22,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/821868-kirsten,4,"I totally loved this book, and found it almost impossible to prevent myself from reading sections out loud to my husband or anyone else who would listen. There are many fascinating anecdotes about both animals and autism, and for the most part the notes and bibliography allow one to follow up on some of the more striking stories.Temple Grandin believes (and I admit, I also hold this believe pretty strongly) that animals must be met on their own terms -- it's not fair to treat animals like humans, and it causes us to miss things or do the animals disservice. At the same time, it's also a mistake to underestimate animal intelligence and the depths of animal experience.I also deeply respect Grandin's work in making meat packing plants and feedlots more humane and less unnecessarily frightening. In particular, her discussion of commonsense ways that these plants can be inspected more efficiently and with better results presents an astonishingly simple and effective way to decrease accidents and animal suffering. I would have liked to have her address the meat and dairy industries in a little more depth, however. I'm not a vegetarian, but I do care about animals, and I would have liked to hear more about her feelings on whether certain methods of raising beef and dairy cattle lead to a less traumatic life for these animals. It's sort of a mistake in a lot of ways to ask whether raising a dairy cow one way or another is ""more natural,"" since these animals have been domesticated for food production for thousands of years, but I would like to know whether she thinks grass fed animals lead better lives, etc.One weird thing that other reviewers have mentioned is her conviction that albinism or even patches of unpigmented skin/white fur lead to ill health or behavioral problems. I've found some support for this in my own research; for example, Lethal White Syndrome is a genetic disorder that plagues white-coated offspring of ""frame"" patterned American Paint horses, and there are a lot of other cases of white-coated, blue-eyed animals having birth defects or genetic disorders. However, these seem to by and large be physical problems, rather than behavioral. Elsewhere in the book, Grandin discusses the problems that can occur when humans breed animals specifically for one characteristic (such as breeding collies for a narrower head, or selectively breeding for coloration), and it may be that what she is getting at is that breeding animals selectively to have white coats can cause other, unanticipated problems. Still, if that's the case, she's overstating it quite a bit here.At any rate, this is a really fascinating book, and while I've spent a lot of time on a perceived flaw, it's really a pretty small part of the book. I highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in animals and how they think, and also to anyone who is interested in gaining insight into autism."
23,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7229186-somewhatbent,3,"I have a number of conflicts with this book – which should in no way diminish the remarkable body of observations made by Dr Grandlin. It is generally accepted as cold hard fact that animals don’t think like humans. Until such time as there is scientifically verifiable information and understanding, we, as scientists, don’t know how humans *or* animals think. With ongoing study using functional MRI (fMRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning we are learning more about the workings of the brain in many species.[return][return]It is somewhat clearer and better understood that perceptual and cognitive processing in persons with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) and the general population can be quite different. There has been advancement in this field in the few years since the first edition of Animals in Translation was published and is not unreasonable to expect far greater understanding of the variety and depth of ASDs in the next few years.[return][return]As a behaviorist Dr Grandlin effectively uses her perceptual abilities which are rather outside the conventional ‘boxes’. That she has developed some methods of livestock management that might not have otherwise been implemented. There is no question that she observes things that can be applied to some animals very effectively, as the numerous anecdotal examples in the book illustrate. What is not clearly addressed is that techniques that are effective on large livestock do not apply to domestic pets, foul or other species. There are some presumptive statements regarding canine behavior a species which she admits having minimal experience with and the behavior she asserts is inconsistent with the experiences of dog handlers and trainers in a wide variety of disciplines; (Search & Rescue, Police and Security, Service Dogs of varying specialty).[return][return]What I hope many people bring away from this book is not the controversy of animal behavior, slaughterhouse and feedlot practices and whether or not a person eats meat, but that there are as many variations of perception and cognition as there are species. ASDs come in an enormously wide variety from people you would never recognize as having one to the stereotypical internally focused, non-verbal, rocking child. There can be huge value in thinking outside the norms, as Dr Grandlin and Bill Gates (with his publically acknowledged Asperger’s Syndrome).[return][return]Recognizing this and allowing for adaptations when some students are simply incapable of learning in ‘conventional’ ways will allow all of society to benefit from the advances these people can make, because it’s simply not comprehensible to them that something *can’t* be done just because it never was before. The potentials for humanity and the species we share the Earth with are indeed boundless, if only given the opportunity to function in a way that optimizes and celebrates them, rather than marginalizing and stereotyping."
24,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7709596-g-na,3,"Considering one of my favourite subjects is animal behaviour, I was looking forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations.Grandin is an autistic woman with a Ph.D. in Animal Science, so I thought this book might have a somewhat scientific bent to it. Instead, it is written in a conversational tone, poor grammar and all. That aside, it has some other major problems: Namely, despite the book being about the similarities in behaviour between animals and autistic people, the author never defines or explains autism. She occasionally refers to autistic people perceiving the world in a particular way, but the reader is left wondering what exactly autism is.In addition, all of Grandin's information about autistic people comes from her own experiences. Not that her experiences aren't valid, but we have no idea if they are typical. And she also paints a big line and places autistic people on one side, and non-autistics on the other, and infers that non-autistics just can't see what autistics do, and that's just not always the case; I notice some of the things she says ""only autistics"" do, and as far as I know, I'm not autistic.In general, there is some interesting information in here, and there are bits worth paying attention to. However, had it been written ""right,"" it could have been a great book."
25,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1484853-simone,3,"Ummm. So I liked this, then about halfway through it became one of those books I just wanted to be over. So, there's that. Also I generally have objections to the dominant ""pack leader"" theory of dog training / rearing. Dog Sense: How the New Science of Dog Behavior Can Make You a Better Friend to Your Pet, to me, provides a much more compelling model for thinking about dog behavior. If dogs are able to differentiate between other dogs and humans, as Grandin says that they are, why would they take rules that might apply to dogs living together and impose them on humans? To me it's not a compelling theory. However, most of the rest of the research she talked about (aside from the dog stuff), was really interesting and more about animals than autism which I enjoyed. She also reads as anti-Rottweiler/Pit-Bull, because she says they are innately agressive, and people who live with them and don't get bittern are apparently just lucky the dogs never attack. She doesn't so much say that outright, but something really close to that. /Shrug. "

However, I feel like Temple Grandin may be a victim of her generation. She (or her coauthor, it's hard to tell) consistently refers to neurotypical people as ""normal"" which is generally something I don't feel should be in a professional book. The other thing about her that made me hesitate was her implication that rottweilers and pit bulls are inherently Dangerous Dogs."

28,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2422276-mag,5,"A unique and fascinating book. Grandin makes a thesis that autistic people have a lot in common with animals in their way of processing information, thinking and experiencing pain and emotions. Well developed frontal lobes are characteristic of a normal human brain. They are also responsible for a global and coherent image of the world, and a generalized way of thinking. The outcome of healthy frontal lobes is more verbal expression and controlled behaviour (e.g. people have much more control over their emotions and fears than animals; they can filter them out, and animals can’t) Grandin claims that since both autistic people and animals have smaller or underdeveloped frontal lobes, they share characteristics connected to this fact. They perceive the world in a series of sensory strings : sounds and images which record an amazing number of details, but do not get immediately interconnected into a meaningful whole. They have a lot of problems generalizing information (e.g. when an autistic child learns to butter a toast, we cannot take it for granted that he or she has learned how to spread peanut butter on it as well) and filtering unnecessary details or distractions. They also have a big problem coping with fears and negative emotions.Grandin also makes some revolutionary statements. She argues that animals have consciousness, and the fact that they don’t have the language to express it does not preclude that. She herself does not think in words. She also says that animals show certain behaviours that have been so far attributed to humans only. Animals, she says, can kill for a pleasure of killing and gives examples of violent male gangs of adolescent dolphins, killer whales and chimpanzees.Animals can communicate and manipulate verbal language too, and the prairie dogs’ language is thought to be most advanced and is most comprehensively described.On the whole, Grandin tries to argue, convincingly in my opinion, that animals are very close to humans in many ways. She herself is an avid advocate of animal rights, and is a consultant on safe and humanitarian slaughter houses for cattle.Very impressive and recommended."

Standing at the intersection of autism and animals, she offers unparallelled observations and groundbreaking ideas about both.Autistic people can often think the way animals think - in fact, Grandin and co-author Catherine Johnson see autism as a kind of was station on the road from animals to humans - putting autistic people in the perfect position to translate ""animal talk"".

I didn’t know that autistic people see the world in fragments, but after Grandin explained it, lots of things make sense, like an autistic person not being able to look directly at you and the savant kitchen worker my husband knew many years ago when he was bartending, who could count silverware in a tray at a glance and tell you what day of the week you were born on by the date. Her information about animals gives me a new appreciation for the dozen or so cats we’ve had over the years—Magnolia who played fetch with marshmallows, Eliza who was sweet and nurturing, Pi who was sensitive and got her feelings hurt easily, Abo who liked to bob his head and dance, Jazz who sits by the window and speaks ‘bird talk,’ and our newest, shy little Pippin who is threatened if we stand up, but when we sit down will climb into our laps for a pet. They’re all different with their own personalities and ‘talents.’ I love this book! Grandin is correct when she says animals make us human."

I like Grandin's blunt straightforward style and greatly appreciate her basic respect for science mixed with a healthy questioning of science methods and conclusions. I particularly liked her use of lots and lots of examples - she does get carried away sometimes and gets off the point but the examples are always interesting and she always comes back to the point. Grandin tries to explain how animals and humans are alike and how they are different and how we can better recognize animal perception and make life better for both of us. She traces her interest and love of animals to her own autism which she feels makes her think and perceive the world more like an animal does and gives her a bridge to understanding animal behavior. I loved her examples of working with meat and poultry industry to help make animal treatment more humane. Although I am not particularly fond of dogs, I have many friends with dogs and was fascinated by her examples of dog behavior and can see things she talked about in the behavior of dogs that I interact with. This book could be used in high school or junior high as a great introduction to various sciences."

I've spent thirty years as an animal scientist, and I've spent my whole life as an autistic person. I hope what I've learned will help people start over again with animals (and maybe with autistic people, too), and begin to think about them in a different way.I hope what I've learned will help people see. (26)A book that was highly recommended to me in my undergrad days of studying Education and which I only now got around to reading. I wish I hadn't waited! By now I'm sure everybody knows the ""hook"" to this title: author Temple Grandin is autistic (her own words, no offense meant to anybody who prefers the Identity-First Language of ""a person with autism"" or ""on the spectrum"" or something similar -- I'm not very up-to-date on things like this and genuinely hope I don't offend) and so this book is both a sharp reminder that everyone has a valuable contribution to make of some sort or another as well as an illuminating look into animal behavior which is a fascinating topic in and of itself.Grandin's writing is quaint, and patient, and precise. It's guileless. It's as if Kurt Vonnegut were writing a ""how to"" manual. And in learning about animal behavior, she asks us to consider our own in the process, making for a wonderful primer on foundational topics in psychology.All in all this is a good book, but not perfect - it grows quite repetitive, and Grandin fires off a lot of trivia that is interesting but does not delve very deeply into the topics she shares. It's a really great introductory text to some basic principles of brain chemistry, developmental psychology, and of course behaviorism and animal husbandry. But while each page itself is full of fascinating tidbits, the book as a whole does not cohere.3 stars out of 5. Both interesting and informative, which is what we all hope for in our nonfiction, but the length leads to repetition, the content doesn't delve all that deeply into these topics, and as other reviewers have noted there are some concerns about the scientific validity of some of her conclusions drawn on small sample sizes and anecdotal evidence. The best chapters, in my opinion, are ""Pain and Suffering"" and ""How Animals Think"" as they explore content I haven't seen as often in other works."
39,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54399136-jessica,3,"This book is mostly about the behaviour of domesticated animals such as cattle, horses, dogs and cats. Grandin discusses why animals behave specific ways, what the behaviour means, and what triggers the behaviour. Grandin also provides helpful tips on choosing and training pets. Interestingly, Grandin draws parallel between animals, autistic people and children. She discusses the similarities among all three from the behavioural neuroscience perspective (not cognitive neuroscience stand point).This book is packed with research-based facts and observational notes from Grandin's experiences with animals. I especially like the checklist she designed for animal welfare audit at ranches and/or slaughterhouses. The philosophy behind this 10-item checklist was simple, concise, and remarkable. A 100-item checklist, developed by language-based thinkers, lacks the precision and sophistication of her 10-item checklist, developed by a visual thinkers (Grandin herself, who is autistic). I think animal lovers, (perspective) pet owners, ranchers, nature lovers, hunters (sustenance and recreational), and parents could benefit from reading this book. It's a 3.5-star book for me."
40,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44177906-g,4,"I enjoyed this, and learned a lot about animals. However, I question the validity of her premise that autism is halfway between animals and normal people. The premise itself may be correct--but her argument in support is circular. I can see how her autism helps her FEEL more connected to animals, and how that connection may allow her insights into animal behaviors and mental processes that ""normal"" people may not have. But such a supposition is a poor foundation for science--and in this book she often blurs the like between ""I think I have insight because my mental process might be similar to animals"" and ""I know this about animals because it's similar to how I am as an autistic person."" "
41,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6826004-tara-hall,4,"I usually don’t read non-fiction books, books about autism…or books about animals, though I love animals. Usually animal books have passages with very upsetting parts, and the happy ending, if there is one, is ruined for me by these “bad spots.” But as my husband gave this book to me, I was guilted into reading it, thought I was able to put it off for 8 years. To my surprise, I enjoyed this book very much.Among its provocative ideas, the book:•	argues that language is not a requirement for consciousness--and that animals do have consciousnessThis I can agree with from my own experience with animals of 30+ years.•	applies the autism theory of ""hyper-specificity"" to animals, showing that animals and autistic people are so sensitive to detail that they ""can't see the forest for the trees""--a talent as well as a ""deficit""•	explores the ""interpreter"" in the normal human brain that filters out detail, leaving people blind to much of the reality that surrounds them--a reality animals and autistic people see, sometimes all too clearlyThese two ideas were demonstrated very well in the book.•	explains how animals have ""superhuman"" skills: animals have animal genius•	compares animals to autistic savants, declaring that animals may in fact be autistic savants, with special forms of genius that normal people do not possess and sometimes cannot even seeThis was also explained, though not as well as the previous points.•	examines how humans and animals use their emotions to think, to decide, and even to predict the future •	reveals the remarkable abilities of handicapped people and animals •	maintains that the single worst thing you can do to an animal is to make it feel afraidThese concepts were also fairly well explained, with the last being a truth I agree with completely. The pain of a shot is much easier to deal with than pain which hurts less but you have no warning about, like a bee sting.Specific parts of the book I found riveting, such as the following:1.	Pure while or light colored animals with blue eyes and pink noses tend to have neurological problems, because they have less melanin. I see this in my own experience with cats, having owned several with light colored skin/eyes that were very neurotic.2.	Breeding animals for specific traits almost always results in neurosis and aggression sooner or later. Purebreed dogs are responsible for most of the dog attacks, because breeders have inbred lines to make the animals adhere to AKC specs (pp82-83). Pigs bred for leaner meat are much more nervous and less prolific in breeding than pigs bred for soundness (p101). Roosters bred to be fast growing and more muscular became rapists, because the breeding screwed up their ability to do courtship displays, leading to the hens not submitting to advances (pp69-72). There were many other examples given, too.3.	Mammals aren’t the only ones with feelings or social lives. Reptiles have them too, like snakes (p88). 4.	Animals also have sexual deviations and preferences. At least Bhraman bulls do (p103)5.	Higher intelligence usually results in “evil” social behaviors such as infanticide, rape, and murder. I’ll never look at Shamu the same way, after reading about killer whales who really like to kill(pp 150-152).6.	A shock collar is good for training. I personally agree with this, from my own use with them for my dogs to curb behaviors on walks in the countryside, but I didn’t expect Temple to agree. Mind you that the idea of this kind of collar is not to shock dogs repeatedly, but to correct bad behavior, so electronic beeps as “warnings” can be used to let a dog know when its wandered too far, should keep up or not range far ahead, should not bolt, etc. A shock is used as last resort. A collar is not a substitute for obedience training, it’s an aid in training.7.	A checklist that is 10 items long is much better for a slaughter plant to protect animal safety than a 100 item one. This seems wrong, but Temple makes a terrific argument for this idea. Moreover, she is right that simple is better, because you can see better what needs to be improved. I have seen this myself in the overly complicated OSHA code for NYS and USA. Focusing on details instead of the whole picture is an easy trap to fall into.My only gripes about this book were:1.	Temple advocates against leash laws, citing they lead to dogs that are unsocialized, a theory I am in opposition to. It’s an owner’s responsibility to socialize their dog, something I see all too seldom.2.	She is clearly against specific breeds, saying they are prone to aggression and that mutts usually are non-agressive. Having owned German Shepherds my whole life, I am opposed to this, and it also smacks of the same kind of thinking that led to breed bans in several cities, with a lot of good dogs left homeless at best and destroyed at worst.3.	Much of the writing is very easy to read, but it’s not well-written and a lot of specific conclusions do not have facts to back them up, just anecdotes from the author’s life. This is not bad, but it does affect how much weight to give insight and advice found in the book, especially on the training/troubleshooting sections.Overall opinion: Worth reading, just so you can discuss with someone. Parents: Okay for a teen, but likely would not be of interest to someone younger.Language: no swearingAdult Content: none, save maybe the passage on collecting semen from bulls and their deviances.Violence: some passages on animal murder."
42,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48073805-katarina,4,"well this is just a fantastic book. there sure are some weird passages (either concerning autistic people or facts) as others previously mentioned, but i let it be like it is, from the author's point of view as an autistic person. nevertheless, an eye-opener and teacher in humbleness and awe towards nature. For all you animal lovers and people behaviour detectives. thoroughly recommend.bonus: you'll get to understand primary emotions and relationships between them (such as fear being a check on aggression)."
43,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13510558-teresa-osgood,5,"This is just fascinating. Primarily an animal psychology book, the author offers useful comparisons and contrasts between animals, normal humans, and autistic humans while considering vision, brain structure, emotions, and other internal parts of life. She backs her assertions with current research, succinctly described. When no studies are available, she gives her opinions clearly. Temple Grandin is no Dr. Doolittle, but her experiences and studies make this a very enlightening book."
44,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91569958-sabrina-ahmed,4,"Found this book really interesting and easy to follow. The explanations of concepts that everyone can grasp and imagine as possibilities meant that the author’s reasoning for her opinions made sense. It gave insight to how autistic people think but also some of the difficulties that they may struggle with because of the comparisons between them and animal minds. Originally picked this book up for the references to Panksepp’s work and I’m glad I did, because it was enjoyable to read. "
45,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1209770-carol,5,"What a fascinating subject and a wonderful lesson from this renowned animal behaviorist, who just happens to be autistic. She makes numerous comparisons between the brain of an animal and an autistic person as they are both different in some ways from a person with a ""normal"" brain. I learned a lot and appreciate even more how intelligent Temple is. "
46,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1703532-catherine,5,"Just a hugely phenomenal book on the correlation between animals and autistics. It’s actually about more than just that - it’s about human nature and animal nature and how there are more perspectives than meet the eye. I feel like I learned more in this book than I have about anything in a really long time. Funny. Wise. And told from a place of quiet confidence. Every bit of information, every word, sentence, chapter, felt essential; nothing felt gratuitous. Read it. You won’t regret it"
47,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5632362-womana,4,Excellent read. Temple is one of my heroes. And the book does not disappoint. Fascinating information.
48,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31132409-joyfulkotheimer,5,Dr. Temple Grandin has written an intriguing explanation of how her way of thinking in pictures offers insight as an autistic scholar towards understanding the way animals might think as well. It was a fast and fascinating read- I highly recommend this for anyone to read and get a window into another perspective to people and animals.
49,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4834343-martha,4,"Temple Grandin sheds light on the similarities between the autistic person's brain function and that of animals. From her autistic perspective, she explains how she processes incoming information, how she adapts to unfamiliar situations and how she learns. She compares these brain functions to the science of animal intelligence and makes multiple connections between the two. She is not afraid to disagree with other scientists or previously-held beliefs and backs up her theories with strong scientific evidence. She truly has a different way of looking at animals and the reasons behind their actions and reactions.Although I found the very technical science of brain function a little heavy at times, it was a gripping text, filled with real-life examples of animal communication, aggression, anxiety and fear. I found the chapter on animal language/communication especially fascinating. She gives an in-depth look at the ways that prairie dogs communicate different threats which I will not soon forget. I can see this kind of complex communication within my own small flock of chickens and believe whole-heartedly that they are sharing much more information than simply 'food' and 'danger'.I listened to this as an audiobook and, although the narrator was mono-toned, I found it was a great way to float through the detailed research which may have bogged me down in a book."
50,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,4,"“Animals in Translation” is premised on two concepts: autistic people are like animals insofar as both have less dominant frontal lobes than normal humans; and that while most of the book consists of Grandin's educated guesses, her autism makes her guesses different because she often “happens to be right.” That is, her insights are corroborated if not proven by observable results. Her emphasis on the adaptive abilities of animals, their capacity to learn and teach cultures, their different-but-not-better/worse ways of perceiving and understanding the world makes a strong argument against the rapidly eroding chauvinism that puts humans above, rather than among, our closest relatives. The book is structured in short vignettes told in a uniquely straightforward style. Each contains an insight informed either by an anecdote from Grandin's experience or a summary of an ethology or psychology or neuroscience experiment. The research is compelling and interesting, and while the book meanders gently without an arc or an agenda, it never seemed boring, repetitive, or pointless. The format simply reinforces the values in Grandin's mind, along with a few key take-away concepts about neuroscience and psychology. The way the book is sold is a bit unfortunate – using the “mysteries of autism” to “decode” animal behavior, etc. The book often seemed self-conscious of the fact that people would read it looking for specific advice about animal decisions and behaviors in their lives. However, that never felt like the authors were distracting from what they wanted to say in order to give readers the dumbed-down take-home advice. Rather, it felt like Grandin was simply expressing something deeply pragmatic in her personality, which is exemplified in her work, which one would think she'd find emotionally traumatic: she abets the efficient slaughter of her favorite animal, cows, simply to ease their suffering. There are quite a few memorable tidbits in the book. For instance, the fact that elephants communicate in sub-audible frequencies at distances up to 25 miles. Or that tigers have to be taught to restrain themselves from killing as many prey animals as they feel like (I'd always assumed predation was limited by availability of prey/energy budget of predator). Or that dogs are believed to have diverged genetically from wolves over 130,000 years ago, indicating that most of the lifespan of our species has been spent alongside domesticated dogs. Apparently some people think that many of the traits that make us relatively unique among primates – same-sex, non-kin friendships; complex social structures; hunting in groups; etc. Dogs may have enabled many of the differences that enabled our rapid evolution away from the lifestyles and biologies of other hominids. That's a pretty neat idea."
51,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1702050-fox,4,"You know, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.I read great swaths of it five years ago or more, enjoyed them immensely but never finished the book. It's been sitting on my to-read shelf forever and I finally picked it up to finish it. Oddly enough, I read Temple Grandin's Thinking in Pictures before finishing this book. Autism isn't an especially deep interest of mine, cognitive ehtology is. It's funny how life works.Animals in Translation will likely forever be controversial. The idea that animals and autistic people have similar cognition is going to be controversial and politically charged regardless of who you are. Nevertheless, the observations that Temple Grandin makes are compelling and ultimately, not all that insulting. She's not comparing autistic people to animals in a negative way, instead she's stating that due to changes in brain chemistry and make up both perceive the world in a way that's different from normal functioning people. She then backs her statement up with personal experiences, observations, and what at that time were recent studies. I'd be interested to hear what she thinks of her hypothesis now, though I doubt much has changed in the intervening years.She credits animals with being far more intelligent than we believe, simply intelligent in different ways. Is a dog's ability to predict a person's seizure before it happens a sign of intelligence? They are responding to signs too subtle for us to predict. What about a magpie pretending to have a broken wing to distract a predator? What about the way ravens and wolves interact? Or the migration patterns of birds? The social structure of horses? Did we domesticate wolves, or did they domesticate us? Did we learn music from birds or vice versa? Is music, ultimately, how animals communicate?I found the book fascinating and a good starting point for anyone interested in animal thought and behavior. While it will likely forever remain controversial, as Temple Grandin rightly points out, this field is controversial to begin with. Very few people are willing to admit just how intelligent and emotional animals can be and give further ground to them in such a way. Humans want to remain special, and bit by bit these studies are making it more evident that humans, truthfully, aren't. I don't think many people want to deal with the ramifications of that."
52,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2339196-tbml,5,"This was one of the Branigan BookClub selections for April 2008. The other was Sara Gruen's mesmerizing WATER FOR ELEPHANTS.For the purists out there, yes I know that it is gramatically incor-rect, but I'll write it anyways. ANIMALS IN TRANSLATION is one of the most enjoyable and fascinating books that I have read in many years. A felicitous constellation of characteristics combine to make this so. First, the subject matter; here the subtitle says it all--'using the mysteries of autism to decode animal behavior.' Already she has me hooked. Just look at the words. ""Mysteries,"" that is nearly irresis-tible for anyone with an active curiosity! ""Autism,"" I am fascinated by the wide variety of human conditions and behavior. ""Decode,"" appeals to my voracious curiosity and suggests hidden knowledge revealed. ""Animal behavior,"" I am an unabashed animal lover and the idea of understanding their behavioris immensely appealing.So, before I even opened the book, I was primed, pumped, pulled in and prepared for a treat!Well, I got one! And on a number of levels. First there is the autobiographical element. Grandin doesn't sensationalizes or sugar coats the moments when her autism appears; it is simply there as part of the story. No ""...look what I overcame;aren't I great because of it?"" dramatics or ""...Oh, woe is poor little me!"" self pity; just a matter of fact narrative of her experience. Then there is what I call the 'review of the literature' component. Throughout the book, she is constantly citing studies from a wide range of scientific disciplines that bear upon a specific point or ilustration she has just made. For me that is fascinating. And, she does it so clearly. Then, she talks so knowledgably and convincingly of animals and their behavior that it is a joy to read. Grandin obviously knows her subject and is passionate about it. To top it all off,there is her writing style. The adjectives ""lim-pid,"" ""crisp,"" ""uncluttered,"" ""reasonable,"" and others of the same ilk come to mind in this context. Grandin's prose, the solid rational basis for her arguments and her disarming candor remind me of other authors I enjoy: John McPhee, Mary Roach, Simon Winchester, Jake Page, and Marion Roach. If you are at all curious about animals, their relationship to people and vice versa, autism and the world around you , my guess is you would enjoy this book.--Markhttp://chile.las-cruces.org/search?/t...- "
53,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/575523-kristin,5,"A fascinating look at how the author parallels her own life experiences as a person with autism to animal behavior. I had heard of Grandin, primarily in relation to her being one of the most famous autistic individuals who shares her unique perspective on life with her condition, but I was not aware until I read this book that she is a revolutionary figure in the meat industry. She opens by discussing the concept of a 'squeeze box', a device she created for herself to aid in reaching a state of calmness by exerting an even pressure all over her body (the same idea as the weighted blankets that are popular this holiday season), and how she applied the same concept in the cattle industry to get cows who needed vaccinations to willingly enter the chute and stay still while restrained. From there, Grandin discusses her other work in the cattle industry, how she was able to improve efficiency and make the slaughter process more humane because she finds that the autistic brain and the animal brain have more in common than a 'normal' human brain and an animal brain do. When cows were balking at entering buildings, forcing the handlers to resort to violence in order to make them obey, Grandin noticed bothersome details in terms of lighting and obstacles that the other humans were oblivious to, that, once corrected, allowed for a much smoother process and happier cows.Grandin also provides advice to readers who may be facing challenges with their own animals, primarily horses and dogs, by delving into the science of animal behaviors and her reasoning, which combines the scientific research of others with her own experiences. While there are many authors out there who give training tips based on years of working with animals, Grandin's points that compare the animal brain with her own autistic brain, and how to get the best out of an animal without intentionally or unintentionally ending up doing more harm than good, offer a unique perspective I'd not encountered. At times, she is quite blunt with some of her phrasings, perhaps because she sees things as very literal and thinks in terms of pictures, not words, but I'm glad her co-author didn't smooth things out because if that's how she is, then her writing should reflect her personality. I would definitely be interested in reading more autobiographical pieces of hers."
54,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1757121-sharon,5,"I first became aware of Temple Grandin and her work through Monty Roberts; when I took his Join-up workshop, Thinking in Pictures: My Life with Autism was required reading. Grandin uses her unique ability as an autistic woman to see things from the perspective of animals. Her humor and knowledge shine through on the page as she talks about how animals learn and what motivates them. Not only does Grandin employ documentable science (the book contains numerous pages of endnotes), but she also shares entertaining anecdotes from her work in agriculture.I particularly enjoyed the stories of animals who learned things not expected of them, such as Alex the parrot. Alex had an extensive vocabulary, and was being taught the sounds various letters made by his owner. She used magnetic fridge letters in the process and he learned them phonetically. (view spoiler)[One day, when she was showing off his progress, he kept asking for his favored reward but was not receiving it. In frustration, he said ""Want nut. Nuh. Uhh. Tuhh."" No one expected that he would learn to spell. (hide spoiler)]Grandin also talks about how animal's different thought processes can apply to people living with autism, such as herself. This book was very insightful on numerous levels and I highly recommend it."
55,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33093229-fred-svoboda,5,"This book was a great pleasure, pulling together material from a wide range of research and anecdotal experience. I see that some people are objecting to its very strong point of view that does not always accord with accepted theories; however, if you're going to read a book by an autistic person who hugely changed the treatment of food animals for the better by having a unique point of view, that point of view is what you signed up for. This is a popular book intended to expose a general audience to interesting ideas on animal behavior, and it does that well.Like a lot of other books these days, this one could have been better edited. It fairly often says ""animals"" when it means ""mammals,"" which is annoying but that any good editor would have caught and corrected. There are other similar errors. There is no way of telling if these come from Grandin or her co-author--or are related to Grandin's autism, which might be possible.If you want the original research studies and an academically rigorous discussion you want a different book or to become a professional animal behaviorist. This book, however, is full of Aha! moments and that appealing point of view that I mentioned earlier.Oh, for those who know me personally, my wife wishes me to mention that SHE checked this out of the library but that I stole it and zoomed through it while she was reading something less engaging. Look for her review soon."
56,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13993049-frederic-pierce,5,"Mind blowing. Temple Grandin comes at everything from such a different place that you can't help but look at the world from a different perspective once you start reading it. There was something on nearly every single page (Except for the weird final part, where she summarized things in outline form. I could've done without that) she shared a story or an insight or a study that left my jaw hanging open. A parrot who actually taught himself to spell. Dogs who somehow detect seizures in people before they happen. Meat packing plants that leave live animals wiggling on hooks. A farmer that has to cater to a boar's perversions in order to retrieve breeding semen. Crows that memorize where thousands of different food hiding places. It goes on. And on. And at the same time, not only are you realizing that there's a lot more going on in animals' skulls than we generally think, but you're gaining insight into how people with autism and other perception disorders view the world. I'm treating my animals and the people in my life differently because of this book. Any work responsible for that kind of transformation is worth recommending to everyone. "
57,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10496704-robert-kenny,3,"This book is worth reading if you go into it with the right mindset: Do not expect a scientific book or a writer who has a good grasp of science. The limits of Grandin's understanding of scientific concepts, such as evolution and scientific reasoning, are very apparent, as she makes numerous factually incorrect statements about them. She doesn't even seem to be aware that humans are animals, saying they ""once were."" There are many times where she makes very bold assumptions about the nature of animals or humans and admits that she has no evidence whatsoever to support it. She's often saying things such as, ""I feel like"" and ""I don't know this for a fact, but I think..."" Much of her ""evidence"" consists of ""I had this one friend who had X experience, so I believe X (insert a broad generalization). That being said, Grandin's perspective is in itself fascinating, as we don't always have the opportunity to hear so many specifics about the experience of being autistic from people with autism themselves. Some of the comparisons to animal experiences seemed at least plausible, if not supported by much evidence, and the studies she does discuss made for interesting reads. "
58,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39779-holly,5,"Although the writing is sometimes dry and I really didn't required the itemized list of things that can distract cattle while in a chute I loved this book. Love it so much that I quote it, talk about it with everyone, brought it up in therapy and developed relationship code to use with my girlfriend (as in ""I need some squeezebox time."") As a pet owner it made me think about the signals I send my animals - am I alpha enough? I like to think so, but there's always something to work on. As a reader I felt like I had been taken to places I never would have visited on my own. Even if you can;t make time to read one of Temple Grandin's book try and listen to an interview with her on public radio. She's fascinating and her ability to articulate her own autism and teach non-autistic people to see the world through her eyes and the eyes of the animals she works with is is devastatingly effective. You wont see the world the same way again.Here's a Fresh Air interview: http://www.npr.org/templates/story/st... "
59,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11440128-dianne,5,"I was fortunate to see Ms. Grandin in 1984 when I was in College and studying Special Education. She was showcased on a Segment of ""Oprah"" on a show about ""Idiot Savants"" I remember as vividly now, how angry I was then, that they referred to any of the People, whom I felt they were exploiting for the financial gain of the Psychologist who had been studying them since their childhood. Still, I was doing my Undergraduate Thesis on Autism and while biting my lip a few times, watched in fascination as Ms. Grandin would ""snap out of her inner world"" for a moment and say or do something remarkable. Unfortunately, the ""What"" at this point has failed my memory.I read this book when it was first published in 2005. It didn't surprise me that she had the ability to communicate with animals. My own research had led me to the argument that Autism and Animal Communication were so tightly entwined that one day someone would crack that code. This book is well written. It will leave you teary eyed at times, while just fascinate you at others. This is a must read! "
60,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108010-tina,5,"Lauren recommended this book to me, and she was spot on in assuming I'd love it. So much interesting stuff here! It basically just describes a whole bunch of cool ways that animal brains work, with a healthy bit of info on how normal and autistic human brains work, too. Full of illustrative stories and experiments. As I was reading this book, I couldn't stop rambling on about everything in it to M. If you are interested in How Brains Work (and you have to know by now that I'm OBSESSED with the topic), I seriously recommend that you read this book. Now. Quick warning: It does contain quite a lot of stories about slaughterhouses, which was difficult for me to read at times. I much preferred when she talked about animal behavior that wasn't related to feed lots, etc. But despite that, I still loved this book and want to share all the facts from it with everyone I know. I wish I'd taken notes. Yes, I'm a nerd."
61,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/861650-laura,3,"I expected a little more from this book, after hearing about it constantly for several years in animal circles. When comparing thought processes and perception in animals and autistic people, Grandin provides some interesting insights in our dealings with animals. A good deal of this, however, is not as new or groundbreaking as she seems to feel it is, given anyone who has worked closely with animals for a time will come to the same realizations of what they see. When covering behavioral conepts in general, she tends not to distinguish between what are generally regarded as facts or hard theories, and what are individuals' hypotheses and pet theories. She simply chooses what she likes and presents it all as straight fact, which I find rather irritating and somewhat irresponsible coming from a PhD. Her anecdotes and examples are fascinating, but I'd suggest taking her renditions of them somewhat lightly and going to the original literature for more accurate accounts. "
62,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/766968-tami,5,"Animals in Translation is an amazing book. This book states that by looking at human autism, we can better under animals, the way they think, the way they behave, and how they see the world. The author is an animal scientist who works primarily with slaughter houses. She is also autistic. Before reading this book, I had very little comprehension about the way that autistic people see the world. I simply had no idea that seeing the world in a visual way was that much different than the way that I think. I now see that this different way of thinking has a lot of really interesting benefits, particularly when it comes to understanding other visual thinkers like the animals around us. As I read this book, I started to comprehend how much detail in life we normally ignore. So much of what we need to understand animals is simply looking at life from their perspective, both literally and figuratively speaking."
63,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1246511-alex,5,"A truly fascinating read. Grandin's synthesis of how human and animal brains works is by far the most compelling one I've read so far (and I've read a few!). Her anecdotes are truly fascinating (elephants that communicate over miles by beating on the ground! dogs that can detect human seizures long before they occur! dolphins that kill porpoises just for kicks!) and fodder for a lifetime of cocktail party conversations. But more vital is the synthetic whole she makes out of her work on animal behavior and her own autism, which is at once disarming and compelling. In the end, Gradin's frankness, honesty, and willingness to acknowledge the limitations of her knowledge makes her generalizations about minds, behavior, and evolution far more compelling than many of the more popular writers on the brain. This little book should be read by anyone who cares about animals, and/or anyone cares about how the mind works."

While reading this book, the reader realizes that often many people with autism have unique abilities that the rest of us can only dream of.i highly recommend this book; it is incredibly insightful. i found myself repeatedly finding such logic in Grandin's wisdom that just made such sense."
65,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/912850-jon,5,"Really a 4.5 star book, but I'll give it five do to the limited nature of the grading system.This book really changed my perspective on how I view animals (and autistic people!). Unfortunately, kids will be forced to read some waste of time book in high school like Billy Bud or Romeo and Juliet when there are awesome thought provoking books like this. It was fascinating to feel the basic accessibility of this book instead of the normal, overly-verbose, academic prose that would fill this type of book. I wonder how much of the writing was done by Temple and how much by the co-author. Being autistic, is it even possible for Temple to write an entire book by herself? I have way too many questions now, but that's the whole point to a good science book."

She believes her autism gives her an edge in her profession as she believes she thinks a lot more like animals do. She speaks of herself as thinking in pictures, not words. She also writes of noticing a lot of details that normal people don't--but that animals do. I found the book interesting not only for what it had to say about animal behavior but also for what Grandin had to say about her own autism. However, I found the book repetitive and grew tired of it 3/4 of the way through, so I just skimmed the rest. This is a book that has been in my TBR stack for some time and which I've attempted to read in the past, and just never finished, though I sort of wanted to. This time I'm giving up. "

From her own unique perspecitive as a person who has overcome autism, Grandin is able to understand animals so well that she is called on to manage animal behavior problems all around the country. Her book is thought provoking and loaded with personal stories from her vast experience with dogs, horses cows, pigs and chickens. She includes an excellent overveiw of contemporary neurological science views that help show how the brains of animals work, in comparison with humans. A perfect mix of storytelling and science, the book is entertaining and enlightening."

I will no longer have the disdain for crows I have previously felt--they are really quite intelligent(though I may still find them a little creepy in large groups). The author, who is autistic has long had a special connection to animals and is now an expert on animal behavior. She describes animals in many different ways from their feelings to their thoughts(and gives amazing evidence about language abilities).

80,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19143066-stewart-mcfarlane,5,"This is fascinating book on animal behaviour written by Temple Grandin, a remarkable woman, who lectures all over the world on animal welfare, especially livestock, and on the nature of autism. The book is co-authored by Catherine Johnson, a mother of two children with autism.Temple Grandin is an associate professor of animal science at Colorado State University. She courageously went public about her diagnosis of autism. She also has an international reputation in the meat-packing industry, for her ground-breaking designs of humane cattle-handling equipment, techniques, and setting standards of good practice in handling animals.Grandin has two main aims in this book. She aims to show how problems in animal behaviour can be resolved by understanding the causes of the behaviour. To this end, she has analysed livestock behaviour down to its smallest details, so that she can predict what an animal will do. She has extensive experience in being called in to trouble-shoot difficult behaviour in domestic and agricultural animals, including cattle,pigs, dogs and horses. She has synthesized the knowledge of animal breeders, trainers and ethologists, into rules and practical advice on how to manage difficult animals.Her second aim is to develop a new theory of autism. She argues that the autistic mind is closer to the animal mind than it is to the typical human mind, when it comes to perception of detail. This opens the possibility of new ways of understanding autism. There are autistic ""savants"" who can identify a prime number with uncanny speed, or can perform complex calculations faster than a computer.. In all of these instances, the individual has systematized a mathematical system. Grandin extends her understanding to living creatures.Grandin has tried to systematize animal behavior. She starts from the animal's perspective and asks; what kinds of stimuli might make an animal frightened? What kinds of stimuli might make an animal aggressive? What do we know about the neuroscience of animal drives that might help us predict its behaviour? Grandin's analysis of animal behaviour results in her understanding it to the point of being able to predict it, and to remedy faults and problems.Here are some examples of how slight changes in an animal's environment can produce strong, often alarming reactions. Changes in lighting from outside to inside building can frighten cattle and pigs. Pools of water can frighten them when caught in the light. Flapping objects such as coats or rags near where they have to walk can really scare them.Unfamiliar noises from generators etc can unnerve them and cause panic.As a dog trainer and elephant handler, I realise the importance of knowing your animal and trying to see things they way that the animal does. I have learned to read the body language of my dogs, so as to predict their behavior. Their running action when hunting squirrels is totally different from that when they have the scent of a bitch in season. My German Shepherd has a fast purposeful trot with his head up when he is planning the pursuit of an interesting female dog. He also stops looking around for me, because at that time I have temporarily ceased to exist for him, so if I want to stop him, I know I have to act fast with a stop command. If I know the bitch is friendly to him, I usually just let him get on with it and re-call him when his curiousity and/or lust is satisfied. I know one elephant in Chiang Mai Province who is terrified of small white birds, if they are feeding on the ground in a flock. She gets nervous and simply will not proceed past the birds. I just let her back up and find another route, or I dismount, leave her at a safe distance, and scare the birds off for her. She doesn't mind them at all if they are perched in the trees. She was probably startled by a flock of these birds when she was young.Many animal trainers and animal problem solvers such as Cesar Millan, who often deals with dog phobias, are aware of the importance of close observation and trying to see things the way the animal sees them. Grandin goes further in trying to systematize this knowledge. She has also examined the causes of aggression in domestic animals such as horses or dogs, and developed a set of rules. If a stallion is kept locked up and deprived of the opportunity to learn to socialise, it will be very aggressive to other stallions, and will try to rape mares. If a dog is not properly socialised with other dogs and people outside its family, it may well be aggressive, through fear. Or if it is allowed to be too dominant and intimidate its human family, then it may be aggressive to them. If it knows its place in the family, and is given clear boundaries, it will be contented and not cause such problems.Finally, she has examined animal breeding. If you cross a fast-growing rooster with a fast-growing hen, you get fast-growing chickens. But she identifies that such single-characteristic genetic breeding programmes always come with a down-side. The fast-growing offspring also have weak hearts, for example. If you cross fast-growing chickens with those selected for their strength, you get long-lived, fast-growing chickens, but they are monstrously aggressive. I think some of the accounts of the mistakes and cruelties inflicted on livestock here will cause more people to question the ethics of the whole process of commercial meat production, however well managed. In my view that is a good thing.Some readers may be shocked that Temple Grandin is saying that autistic people are more similar to animal than normal people. Isn't this suggesting that autistic people are subhuman? In fact, Grandin's claim is that animals have superior perception of detail, and so do people with autism. So, far from offending people with autism, she is if anything suggesting that non-autistic people have less sharp perception. In a way she is saying that it is the ""normal"" people who are handicapped, because they miss all this detail, and make many mistakes when trying to remember events. We know that this is the case from ""eye-witness"" testimony, which often turns out to be unreliable , because our brains construct memories, make assumptions, and change details and sequences, often in the very process of recalling them. She links the two themes of her book by arguing that a person with autism will have a greater affinity for animals than will a person without autism, because the same sorts of unexpected changes like flickering lights, or sudden small movements or sounds that might startle an animal, might also startle a person with autism. She goes further to argue that understanding animal perception might help us understand autistic perception.Getting back to the elephant example, Grandin mentions the fact that they use infrasonic (low rumbles) to communicate and possibly even seismic communication (ground vibrations) to send messages to their family members across distances as great as 25 miles. Elephants when distress, slam their trunks on the ground. The elephant I know with the white bird phobia does this if the birds get too near her. I agree with Temple here, that the elephant is communicating her distress to other elephants. In fact elephants do a whole range of things with their prehensile trunks. They explore their environment, comfort each other, pick up food and objects such as sticks to scratch with. Elephants normally sleep standing up, and often with their eyes open. You know when an elephant is asleep because its trunk is totally relaxed and resting on the ground at the tip. This is important because you should never startle a sleeping elephant. You should make a gentle sound, and let it wake up first, and you should never approach an elephant from behind or straight ahead of it. Their vision is poor and they are happier if you approach from the front but to one side, so they clearly see you coming.I am delighted to see that towards the end of the book, she discusses the evidence that humans co-evolved with wolves, in other words that we changed them and they changed us. This is something that I have long believed. Dog and human bones have been found in burials dating back 14,000 years, so some archaeologists concluded that domestication of dogs too place then. But Robert Wayne and his team at UCLA examined through DNA testing found that dogs started to diverge from wolves about 135,000 years ago. He suggest, and Temple and I agree with him, that proto humans, wolves that were slowly becoming dogs, were developing together, and were already closely associated. Many finds of wolf bones and humans bones together,date from more than 100,000 years ago.This suggests that they were associating at a time when homo sapiens were just evolving from homo erectus. This means they had few tools, were perhaps pre linguistic. The wolves with their superior sense of smell and superior pack based hunting skills, probably taught the proto humans the value of cooperation with them and with each other. Grandin argues that human social structures resembles that of wolves, more closely that that of primates. Even stronger evidence is that fact that the mid-brain of humans, which handles sensory data, including scenting smell, shrank over 10,000 years ago, while the fore-brain which handles language, reasoning and planning skills remained the same. The suggestion is that many of the mid brain functions of humans were not needed so much because the dogs were handling that side of things. The camp dogs were scenting, hearing and identifying prey and dangerous threats, for the humans, so the human brain was free to specialise and organise, develop language and cultural skills. Grandin suggest that this is probably why homo sapiens were able to flourish, while Neanderthals with similar brains to humans, did not, because they were not cooperating with wolves or proto dogs.I think this evidence may well explain why so many humans, including me, have such a strong affinity with dogs, and wolves. We are ancient companions.Interested readers can find out more about my experiences with dogs, elephants and other animals, in my book: OF MICE & ZEN.ANIMAL ENCOUNTERS IN THE LIFE OF A WANDERING BUDDHIST (free samples of Goodreads and Amazon).As I have made clear, I greatly appreciated this book. One important detail on which I disagree with her, is on the use of shock collars and invisible electric fences on dogs who chase joggers and cyclists, or dogs who roam. She advocates these as necessary to prevent these problems. I disagree. Such devices often traumatize dogs and can cause the dog to get injured. One unfortunate collie was so traumatized by the shock fence, that she would never leave the house and started pooping on the floor. These devices are barbaric if used by careless, inexperienced people, and they are not necessary. I have trained many dogs not to chase people, vehicles, or livestock and not to run off, without recourse to such devices. It just takes more time and effort on the part of the trainer. You have to be able to bond with, and communicate with the dog, to predict its behaviour, and intervene then. Anyone resorting to these electric shock devices is simply evading that responsibility. I think this issue is one where Temple Grandin's background in livestock management works against her. There, the use of electric devices is seen as normal, but in dog care ? Surely not acceptable."
81,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15704502-colleen,5,"I wasn't able to read this book in one setting or even 2 settings and, maybe, that's a good thing because then I took the time to reflect on the way humans do things and why. It's intriguing to compare how Temple and I relate to animals and to reflect upon our differing realities. I shall reflect upon the following statement for a long time: ""Normal people can't see all those little changes without a lot of training and effort, because their brains process them unconsciously. So normal people are drawing what they ""see,"" which is the finished object, after their brains have put it all together. It's ironic that we always say autistic children are in their own little world because if Dr. Snyder is right it's normal people who are living inside their heads. Autistic people are experiencing the actual world much more directly and accurately than non-autistic people, with all their inattentional blindness, change blindness, and their every-other-kind-of blindness."" I was drawn to this book because I'm a born animal lover and because I have much curiosity about the natural world. I gained much perspective from Temple's book in regards to the how and way animals relate to world, but also gained a deeper understanding of the inner workings of human brain. Book initiated much reflection upon some of my preconceived assumptions of intelligence and those reflections definitely re-configured my understanding to include the many different types of animal geniuses.Because of how Temple described her reality, I have rearranged my assumed perceptions of what is the correct way to view the world; and I have adopted a better understanding of, and respect for, the autistic point of view. Temple's story reminds me to not be so quick to assume that my way is the right way. In regards to my life as an educator, I've gleaned more understanding of autistic children. I interacted with autistic children during my career, and those experiences caused me to assume that autistic children needed to interact with environment in a way that was quite rigid. After reading this book, I wouldn't describe my experiences with autistic children in quite that way. Now, I know that it wasn't so much that they were always trying to say their way was the right way, but, rather, that they just couldn't ""see"" things my way---and I couldn't see things their way. So, I don't think this book is about what's the right way or the wrong way to see the world; but, rather, the takeaway message is that human reality is affected by brain function, human experience, emotion, and context. It is highly valuable for all of us to share our realities of the world---and highly valuable for us to listen to the realities of others. I recommend this book for everyone. Another important take away is that most of us don't take the time to think about why we do things the way we do because that would just take too much time and be inefficient; but, oftentimes, it would be helpful and useful to reflect upon how and why we do things differently so we can compare our actions and results for the purpose of getting deeper understanding of alternate views. Since non-autistic people don't feel compelled to evaluate or alter their ""normal"" way of doing things (because those ways are an accepted way), it is likely non-autistic people also don't see the full ramification of doing some things in the ""normal"" way. On the other hand, the autistic person trying to cope with the majority viewpoint is compelled to do some analysis and evaluation in order to cope with the most-accepted standards of thinking and behavior imposed upon them. Temple describes many situations in which her non-standard thinking actually resulted in actions that were more acceptable to animals. She offers numerous stories on how the non-autistic person can learn from the autistic person about better ways of doing things by exploring alternative viewpoints and evaluating their assumptions about reality. Temple explains---in a nonjudgmental way---that the autistic view of the world is another reality, and that the autistic and non-autistic brain function differently resulting in some specific and differing autistic and non-autistic viewpoints and actions. Most enlightening to me is that the autistic reality offers the non-autistic person a window through which they can view their ""normal"" perceptions, actions, and viewpoints. Temple offers an alternative view of the non-autistic person's reality, which in the case of livestock management, encouraged humans to handle animals more humanely and more efficiently.This story has stirred in me the desire to reflect upon the assumptions I make about the BEST way to be with animals, and also has changed my view of autism. It's awesome when anyone, who resides a bit out of the norm, shares their story because we are reminded that change is good, that evaluation of our actions is important, and that the norm is only a norm for a short moment in time. I don't view autism negatively; but, rather, appreciate the autistic genius for seeing in pictures and noticing details that my brain ignores. Temple's story has encouraged me tap into the ignored realities of my daily existence."
82,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7729729-alison,2,"Temple Grandin is a huge name in animal welfare. Or, she was. She contributed amazingly to the field, but this book is definitely a product of its time.I couldn't finish it. Some of the anecdotes were interesting, but a lot of the information itself was outdated. Dominance theory hasn't been taken seriously in the animal world for some years now and this was the main theory of her book. The parts about how animal brains work and how she related it to her experience as an autistic woman were really interesting, but after the chapters on how you have to show pigs and horses and dogs who's boss I'm left wondering how much of the rest of it is out of date and considered ridiculous in 2019 by brain...scientists? I wonder how much of it even Ms. Grandin would still stand by.Even back when it was considered cutting edge, there were certain things that would have bothered me. She mashed personal opinion with scientific evidence with abandon. There was a lot of speculation, a lot of ""No one has done any studies on this specifically, but I bet that..."" which is not what I'm looking for in an educational read. I think that when you're writing from such a position of authority it's irresponsible to throw your opinion around like it's fact. It also didn't have the circumspection I've come to expect in pop science books. The first few chapters focusing on the basics of the field and disclaiming on how their results aren't necessarily definitive, how narrow the case study was, how new research is coming out, etc. I'm gonna be honest, I love that part. It was a little disappointing for it to be missing in one of the first books I've been able to read about my own field.From a writing standpoint, it was pretty awful. She's very ""write how you talk"" which makes it easy to follow, but it must take decades to have a conversation with her with the way she's constantly inserting irrelevant facts and stories. If she wants to write a memoir that's fine, but this book was supposed to be about a specific topic and she apparently had no editor to ask if paragraphs or entire pages were actually contributing to her point. This book could have been like 150 pages and been complete. I'm sorry Ms. Grandin but I'm not reading a book about animal behavior to find out how the government would be so much better if everyone just thought like you did.I did make it an admirable halfway through before giving up. I just have more valuable things to read with my time. If you're looking for a meaningful read about animal behavior, pick up something shorter that was written in the past couple of years."
83,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91724581-carol-aguilar,3,"	I read the book Animals In Translation. I discovered this book because it was in the no AR section and it caught my attention because it had the word Animals in it. I enjoyed the book in some parts and in some parts I didn't. In some parts it even made me angry.	The book was really good because Temple Grandin did a great way of explaining. I learned things about autism that I didn't know. I also really learned things about the brain.She really made sure you knew what autism is and how people with and without autism act and react, before saying how animals and people with autism have a connection and can help each other. She also explained a lot of things that were not related to autism. For example when she was talking about the behavior of humans and animals and that anthropomorphizing a animal is the worst thing you can do it really got me thinking. Do I anthropomorphize my pets and other animals. Is it dangerous if I do it? She also really explained that animals do and will feel emotion. She gave many examples of this for example the cats helping each other out during a delivery of a baby or saying the cows feel emotion when they are separated from their young. Even though they already “reached” a age in which they won't miss their young. This is where I start to not like the book. 	 What I didn't like was that Temple Grandin was saying all these great things about animals for example saying that humans and animals have different brain but also awfully a lot in common, saying how cows can be just like a dog and play just like one,and even saying how they can be a great companion for people with autism. But yet she talks about animals being used in labs and being tested on and even being used in her” humane” squeezing chute and humane ways to hand a animal going or getting ready for slaughter. It was very conflicting. It's like saying you love animals yet you still eat them. Or saying your against rape yet you eat dairy products.	 I think someone who would enjoy this book is anyone that is interested between the connection of animals with people with autism and even with people without it. Anyone also ready to read a book with a lot of information about the connection of humans and animals should read it."
84,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91381557-trey-hall,4,"Reading this fascinating collection of scientific experiments and phenomenological wonderings about animals' feelings, consciousness, and language was like trying to watch all at once the movements of a vast mobile on a windy balcony: you can sense that the different beauties, velocities, and fluctuations of all the pieces are connected, but your mind simply can't map the connections: in a way that leads to grandeur and awe, and occasionally to frustration at your perceptual limits.As a starting point, the author reflects on her own autism - and part of autistic perception, in general - as potentially similar to non-human animal patterns of perception and understanding. [I acknowledge this idea could be understandably offensive to some. Grandin writes in a full-on style and makes no apologies. Whether the science is far-out there or not, I'm not educated enough to say, but I found it compelling]. For example, she suggests that animals (whom she studies and loves) might share the same ""hyper-specific intelligence"" (not conceptual; not organizing the raw data perceived into any representative, and often smoothed-out, whole or schema; but seeing the minutiae of component parts without organizing them) and ""mental image language"" (thinking not in words or concepts but in pictures) that autistic people frequently describe having. From there she spends most of the book imagining what the multiple intelligences and emotional lives of animals might be like. I learned so much reading this book, but beyond learning, I experienced an increased sense of compassion for, friendship with, and sincere regard and love for animals, whose fear- and thought- and pain- and love- and joy-worlds, I'm convinced, are much more more dynamic, complex, and psychologically variegated than many scientists in particular and people in general think or allow themselves to think.For me, this expanding awareness raises serious ethical questions, to be sure - and I'm already a pescatarian - but more than that, it invites me into a deeper participation in my/our essential communion with all creatures, in the way I try to see, the way I pray, etc."
85,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44661992-michael,3,"My first thoughts about this book were: I wonder if I can get a refund from Colorado State University for the hundreds of dollars worth of tuition money I spent in Vet school for the privilege of listening to Temple Grandin present the exact same material as contained in this book. Given that in book form I was better able to concentrate on the material without being distracted by the author’s autistic mannerisms, I preferred the book form. Given that I checked the book out for free at the library I feel that I way overpaid in school.Temple Grandin is an interesting character, she is perhaps the most famous autistic person alive today. She believes that her autism causes her to think like a cow, and many view her as some sort of animal behavior autistic savant. I find these claims dubious at best. She does have a decent understanding of animal behavior, but has spent years studying it. It doesn’t sound as if it came naturally to her. As she tells a story of when she was young she couldn’t tell small dogs apart from cats because they were the same size. I think this shows that she wasn’t born with some innate understanding of animals, but actually started further behind most people. I believe she has worked hard to gain her understanding.One of my biggest problems with the book is that she spouts off old wives tales, stereotypes, anecdotal evidence, and her own untested theories as if they were all fact.She is fond of telling how she likes to lay down in the middle of a pen of cattle, and allow them come up and lick her. Yet I have been unable to grasp what insights she has gleaned by doing this. Being an individual who spends most of my time in cattle pens, I just keep thinking that is a disgusting place to lay down.With that said I must admit that despite her autism or perhaps because of it she has managed to turn her interest in animal behavior into a successful career. Additionally if my clients all had cattle handling facilities designed by her, and followed her principals it would make my life much easier."
86,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1300439-paula,2,"Like Temple Grandin, I believe that animals are more intelligent than we have given them credit for. I've read studies of crows, gray parrots, octopus, and ground squirrels in particular that reveal some amazing capabilities including strategizing, language, and tool making. So, I came into this text prepared. Grandin's comparisons between the capabilities, and limitations of autistic people with that of animals was interesting. Her understanding of ""normals"" was less impressive. Many of her claims about autistic people has more to do with intelligence than autism. For example, she claims autistic people are more observant than normal people. Whether this is true overall is speculative. I believe that intelligent people are more observant, and her claims to being hyper observant have as much to do with her intelligence as with her condition. She doesn't seem to separate the two at all. Autistic people have as broad a range of intelligence as normal people do. Yet, she doesn't parse out those traits that depend upon intelligence from those that depend upon an aberrant condition. She also claims that she has a particular insight into animal behavior and feelings that normal people cannot understand. This is also pure speculation. She deals mainly with ranchers, stockyard and slaughterhouse workers. These people have strong reason to believe that animals are less intelligent and less feeling than is likely the case. They do not represent all ""normals"". There are a great many normal animal trainers, and even pet owners who have great insight into the minds and feelings of animals. You don't have to be autistic to see that animals have feelings, and thoughts. You just have to care about animals, and not care about how much money you'll lose if the cattle keep getting injured. Her attitude toward veganism also shows a lack of understanding. She obviously did not study even the most rudimentary nutrition studies when she did her brief experiment in giving up meat. Watch The Game Changers if you think that eating vegan can leave anyone feeling weak! "
87,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2410849-juliet-wilson,4,"Subtitled 'the woman who thinks like a cow' this is a fascinating book about animal behaviour. Temple Grandin has autism and has used her different way of seeing the world as a way into understanding animals.Temple Grandin is an associate professor of animal science at Colorado State University. She has worked in the meat processing industry, helping to make slaughter houses more humane. As a vegetarian I didn't find this part of the book the easiest to read, but I have to admit that so many people are meat eaters who will never give up eating meat that it is vital that slaughter houses are made more humane. Also it is fascinating to read how the author thinks her way into the cow's mind, how it perceives the world and how it can be made to feel calmer and less threatened.The rest of the book looks at all kinds of animals, how they learn and how they relate to humans and whether the ways in which animals communicate can be considered to be true language, including the story of Alex the parrot, who seemed to be able to genuinely communicate and learn quicker than his owners and trainers expected . She outlines what makes dogs so good at being helper animals (particularly their sense of smell!) and how best to train dogs to increase their chances of growing up into well behaved, calm pets or working dogs (and she's a great believer in dogs working to give them a purpose in life!). The author constantly compares her own way of thinking as a person with autism to the way that animals think.All in all this is a fascinating book, whether your main interest is in autism in humans or in animal behaviour."

Temple Grandin writes forcefully and entertainingly about brains and perception and behaviors, both animal and human. Very useful ""Behavior and Training Troubleshooting Guide"" at the end.p.72: As the roosters got more and more aggressive, the humans unconsciously adjusted their perceptions of how a normal rooster should act. It was a case of the bad becoming normal, and it's a big danger in selective breeding programs.

I was in a constant, daily state of emergency. It was horrible.p.276: If language naturally evolves to serve the needs of tiny rodents with tiny rodent brains, then what's unique about language isn't the brilliant humans who invented it to communicate high-level abstract thoughts. What's unique about language is that the creatures who develop it are highly vulnerable to being eaten.p.288: But when you look at the jobs some dogs have invented for themselves using their advanced perceptual abilities, you're moving into the realm of true cognition, which is solving a problem under novel conditions."

Being close to animals brings some of it back.”Temple Grandin address two topics in this book: animals and autism. The connection between the two is far closer then I would have imagined. But by using her autistic mind, Grandin is able to understand animals in a way many people do not (or have to be trained to). As someone finding out late in life that they have Aspergers, her revelations on autism and autistic brains was eye-opening and affirming. Her ideas and research into animal behaviour and language are equally illuminating. I’m curious to know what we’ve learned about animal intelligence 15 years later. I suspect I’ll be reading more on this topic in future. There are a few moments in the book that show its age. Grandin uses ‘retarded’ several times, which I imagine was not seen as a slur 15 years back. And while she does so with no malice or condensation, for a modern reader it can be rather jarring. Additionally, there are a few stories of very severe animal abuse. Grandin uses these stories to argue in favour of animal welfare, but they are still quiet disturbing to read. These are things I feel is important for people to know going into a book that I can otherwise heartily recommend. Grandson’s love and fascination of animals is present in every page, and her work in increasing animal welfare in the meat industry was huge. If either topic is of interest to you, this book is worth your time.  "

It basically just describes a whole bunch of cool ways that animal brains work, with a healthy bit of info on how normal and autistic human brains work, too. Full of illustrative stories and experiments. As I was reading this book, I couldn't stop rambling on about everything in it to M. If you are interested in How Brains Work (and you have to know by now that I'm OBSESSED with the topic), I seriously recommend that you read this book. Now. Quick warning: It does contain quite a lot of stories about slaughterhouses, which was difficult for me to read at times. I much preferred when she talked about animal behavior that wasn't related to feed lots, etc. But despite that, I still loved this book and want to share all the facts from it with everyone I know. I wish I'd taken notes. Yes, I'm a nerd."
91,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/861650-laura,3,"I expected a little more from this book, after hearing about it constantly for several years in animal circles. When comparing thought processes and perception in animals and autistic people, Grandin provides some interesting insights in our dealings with animals. A good deal of this, however, is not as new or groundbreaking as she seems to feel it is, given anyone who has worked closely with animals for a time will come to the same realizations of what they see. When covering behavioral conepts in general, she tends not to distinguish between what are generally regarded as facts or hard theories, and what are individuals' hypotheses and pet theories. She simply chooses what she likes and presents it all as straight fact, which I find rather irritating and somewhat irresponsible coming from a PhD. Her anecdotes and examples are fascinating, but I'd suggest taking her renditions of them somewhat lightly and going to the original literature for more accurate accounts. "
92,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/766968-tami,5,"Animals in Translation is an amazing book. This book states that by looking at human autism, we can better under animals, the way they think, the way they behave, and how they see the world. The author is an animal scientist who works primarily with slaughter houses. She is also autistic. Before reading this book, I had very little comprehension about the way that autistic people see the world. I simply had no idea that seeing the world in a visual way was that much different than the way that I think. I now see that this different way of thinking has a lot of really interesting benefits, particularly when it comes to understanding other visual thinkers like the animals around us. As I read this book, I started to comprehend how much detail in life we normally ignore. So much of what we need to understand animals is simply looking at life from their perspective, both literally and figuratively speaking."
93,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1246511-alex,5,"A truly fascinating read. Grandin's synthesis of how human and animal brains works is by far the most compelling one I've read so far (and I've read a few!). Her anecdotes are truly fascinating (elephants that communicate over miles by beating on the ground! dogs that can detect human seizures long before they occur! dolphins that kill porpoises just for kicks!) and fodder for a lifetime of cocktail party conversations. But more vital is the synthetic whole she makes out of her work on animal behavior and her own autism, which is at once disarming and compelling. In the end, Gradin's frankness, honesty, and willingness to acknowledge the limitations of her knowledge makes her generalizations about minds, behavior, and evolution far more compelling than many of the more popular writers on the brain. This little book should be read by anyone who cares about animals, and/or anyone cares about how the mind works."
94,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4084325-carole,4,"i loved this book. the author is living a full, productive life as an animal scientist. the author has autism, and she has the incredible ability to see the world through some animals' eyes, or rather understand animals and their abilities in a way that is refreshing and very real. this book is not about the shortcomings of people with autism, or all of the things that animals can't do or understand; rather, it's about all of the extraordinary, invaluable talents that animals have, that perhaps we don't fully understand. While reading this book, the reader realizes that often many people with autism have unique abilities that the rest of us can only dream of.i highly recommend this book; it is incredibly insightful. i found myself repeatedly finding such logic in Grandin's wisdom that just made such sense."

Unfortunately, kids will be forced to read some waste of time book in high school like Billy Bud or Romeo and Juliet when there are awesome thought provoking books like this. It was fascinating to feel the basic accessibility of this book instead of the normal, overly-verbose, academic prose that would fill this type of book. I wonder how much of the writing was done by Temple and how much by the co-author. Being autistic, is it even possible for Temple to write an entire book by herself? I have way too many questions now, but that's the whole point to a good science book."
96,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1436259-ruth,3,"The author of the book is autistic and an expert in animal behavior. She believes her autism gives her an edge in her profession as she believes she thinks a lot more like animals do. She speaks of herself as thinking in pictures, not words. She also writes of noticing a lot of details that normal people don't--but that animals do. I found the book interesting not only for what it had to say about animal behavior but also for what Grandin had to say about her own autism. However, I found the book repetitive and grew tired of it 3/4 of the way through, so I just skimmed the rest. This is a book that has been in my TBR stack for some time and which I've attempted to read in the past, and just never finished, though I sort of wanted to. This time I'm giving up. "

From her own unique perspecitive as a person who has overcome autism, Grandin is able to understand animals so well that she is called on to manage animal behavior problems all around the country. Her book is thought provoking and loaded with personal stories from her vast experience with dogs, horses cows, pigs and chickens. She includes an excellent overveiw of contemporary neurological science views that help show how the brains of animals work, in comparison with humans. A perfect mix of storytelling and science, the book is entertaining and enlightening."

I will no longer have the disdain for crows I have previously felt--they are really quite intelligent(though I may still find them a little creepy in large groups). The author, who is autistic has long had a special connection to animals and is now an expert on animal behavior. She describes animals in many different ways from their feelings to their thoughts(and gives amazing evidence about language abilities). Dogs and cows are probably discussed the most, but other animals are also included. Really fascinating details that help me understand our neurotic dog in a whole new way."

Not sure if the lack of citations are on purpose but she should know better.What bothered me the most was how she tried to pass beliefs as fact even at times when it's clear she knows nothing about the subject in question.This was my first Temple Grandin book, now I doubt I'll read anything else by her."

110,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19143066-stewart-mcfarlane,5,"This is fascinating book on animal behaviour written by Temple Grandin, a remarkable woman, who lectures all over the world on animal welfare, especially livestock, and on the nature of autism. The book is co-authored by Catherine Johnson, a mother of two children with autism.Temple Grandin is an associate professor of animal science at Colorado State University. She courageously went public about her diagnosis of autism. She also has an international reputation in the meat-packing industry, for her ground-breaking designs of humane cattle-handling equipment, techniques, and setting standards of good practice in handling animals.Grandin has two main aims in this book. She aims to show how problems in animal behaviour can be resolved by understanding the causes of the behaviour. To this end, she has analysed livestock behaviour down to its smallest details, so that she can predict what an animal will do. She has extensive experience in being called in to trouble-shoot difficult behaviour in domestic and agricultural animals, including cattle,pigs, dogs and horses. She has synthesized the knowledge of animal breeders, trainers and ethologists, into rules and practical advice on how to manage difficult animals.Her second aim is to develop a new theory of autism. She argues that the autistic mind is closer to the animal mind than it is to the typical human mind, when it comes to perception of detail. This opens the possibility of new ways of understanding autism. There are autistic ""savants"" who can identify a prime number with uncanny speed, or can perform complex calculations faster than a computer.. In all of these instances, the individual has systematized a mathematical system. Grandin extends her understanding to living creatures.Grandin has tried to systematize animal behavior. She starts from the animal's perspective and asks; what kinds of stimuli might make an animal frightened? What kinds of stimuli might make an animal aggressive? What do we know about the neuroscience of animal drives that might help us predict its behaviour? Grandin's analysis of animal behaviour results in her understanding it to the point of being able to predict it, and to remedy faults and problems.Here are some examples of how slight changes in an animal's environment can produce strong, often alarming reactions. Changes in lighting from outside to inside building can frighten cattle and pigs. Pools of water can frighten them when caught in the light. Flapping objects such as coats or rags near where they have to walk can really scare them.Unfamiliar noises from generators etc can unnerve them and cause panic.As a dog trainer and elephant handler, I realise the importance of knowing your animal and trying to see things they way that the animal does. I have learned to read the body language of my dogs, so as to predict their behavior. Their running action when hunting squirrels is totally different from that when they have the scent of a bitch in season. My German Shepherd has a fast purposeful trot with his head up when he is planning the pursuit of an interesting female dog. He also stops looking around for me, because at that time I have temporarily ceased to exist for him, so if I want to stop him, I know I have to act fast with a stop command. If I know the bitch is friendly to him, I usually just let him get on with it and re-call him when his curiousity and/or lust is satisfied. I know one elephant in Chiang Mai Province who is terrified of small white birds, if they are feeding on the ground in a flock. She gets nervous and simply will not proceed past the birds. I just let her back up and find another route, or I dismount, leave her at a safe distance, and scare the birds off for her. She doesn't mind them at all if they are perched in the trees. She was probably startled by a flock of these birds when she was young.Many animal trainers and animal problem solvers such as Cesar Millan, who often deals with dog phobias, are aware of the importance of close observation and trying to see things the way the animal sees them. Grandin goes further in trying to systematize this knowledge. She has also examined the causes of aggression in domestic animals such as horses or dogs, and developed a set of rules. If a stallion is kept locked up and deprived of the opportunity to learn to socialise, it will be very aggressive to other stallions, and will try to rape mares. If a dog is not properly socialised with other dogs and people outside its family, it may well be aggressive, through fear. Or if it is allowed to be too dominant and intimidate its human family, then it may be aggressive to them. If it knows its place in the family, and is given clear boundaries, it will be contented and not cause such problems.Finally, she has examined animal breeding. If you cross a fast-growing rooster with a fast-growing hen, you get fast-growing chickens. But she identifies that such single-characteristic genetic breeding programmes always come with a down-side. The fast-growing offspring also have weak hearts, for example. If you cross fast-growing chickens with those selected for their strength, you get long-lived, fast-growing chickens, but they are monstrously aggressive. I think some of the accounts of the mistakes and cruelties inflicted on livestock here will cause more people to question the ethics of the whole process of commercial meat production, however well managed. In my view that is a good thing.Some readers may be shocked that Temple Grandin is saying that autistic people are more similar to animal than normal people. Isn't this suggesting that autistic people are subhuman? In fact, Grandin's claim is that animals have superior perception of detail, and so do people with autism. So, far from offending people with autism, she is if anything suggesting that non-autistic people have less sharp perception. In a way she is saying that it is the ""normal"" people who are handicapped, because they miss all this detail, and make many mistakes when trying to remember events. We know that this is the case from ""eye-witness"" testimony, which often turns out to be unreliable , because our brains construct memories, make assumptions, and change details and sequences, often in the very process of recalling them. She links the two themes of her book by arguing that a person with autism will have a greater affinity for animals than will a person without autism, because the same sorts of unexpected changes like flickering lights, or sudden small movements or sounds that might startle an animal, might also startle a person with autism. She goes further to argue that understanding animal perception might help us understand autistic perception.Getting back to the elephant example, Grandin mentions the fact that they use infrasonic (low rumbles) to communicate and possibly even seismic communication (ground vibrations) to send messages to their family members across distances as great as 25 miles. Elephants when distress, slam their trunks on the ground. The elephant I know with the white bird phobia does this if the birds get too near her. I agree with Temple here, that the elephant is communicating her distress to other elephants. In fact elephants do a whole range of things with their prehensile trunks. They explore their environment, comfort each other, pick up food and objects such as sticks to scratch with. Elephants normally sleep standing up, and often with their eyes open. You know when an elephant is asleep because its trunk is totally relaxed and resting on the ground at the tip. This is important because you should never startle a sleeping elephant. You should make a gentle sound, and let it wake up first, and you should never approach an elephant from behind or straight ahead of it. Their vision is poor and they are happier if you approach from the front but to one side, so they clearly see you coming.I am delighted to see that towards the end of the book, she discusses the evidence that humans co-evolved with wolves, in other words that we changed them and they changed us. This is something that I have long believed. Dog and human bones have been found in burials dating back 14,000 years, so some archaeologists concluded that domestication of dogs too place then. But Robert Wayne and his team at UCLA examined through DNA testing found that dogs started to diverge from wolves about 135,000 years ago. He suggest, and Temple and I agree with him, that proto humans, wolves that were slowly becoming dogs, were developing together, and were already closely associated. Many finds of wolf bones and humans bones together,date from more than 100,000 years ago.This suggests that they were associating at a time when homo sapiens were just evolving from homo erectus. This means they had few tools, were perhaps pre linguistic. The wolves with their superior sense of smell and superior pack based hunting skills, probably taught the proto humans the value of cooperation with them and with each other. Grandin argues that human social structures resembles that of wolves, more closely that that of primates. Even stronger evidence is that fact that the mid-brain of humans, which handles sensory data, including scenting smell, shrank over 10,000 years ago, while the fore-brain which handles language, reasoning and planning skills remained the same. The suggestion is that many of the mid brain functions of humans were not needed so much because the dogs were handling that side of things. The camp dogs were scenting, hearing and identifying prey and dangerous threats, for the humans, so the human brain was free to specialise and organise, develop language and cultural skills. Grandin suggest that this is probably why homo sapiens were able to flourish, while Neanderthals with similar brains to humans, did not, because they were not cooperating with wolves or proto dogs.I think this evidence may well explain why so many humans, including me, have such a strong affinity with dogs, and wolves. We are ancient companions.Interested readers can find out more about my experiences with dogs, elephants and other animals, in my book: OF MICE & ZEN.ANIMAL ENCOUNTERS IN THE LIFE OF A WANDERING BUDDHIST (free samples of Goodreads and Amazon).As I have made clear, I greatly appreciated this book. One important detail on which I disagree with her, is on the use of shock collars and invisible electric fences on dogs who chase joggers and cyclists, or dogs who roam. She advocates these as necessary to prevent these problems. I disagree. Such devices often traumatize dogs and can cause the dog to get injured. One unfortunate collie was so traumatized by the shock fence, that she would never leave the house and started pooping on the floor. These devices are barbaric if used by careless, inexperienced people, and they are not necessary. I have trained many dogs not to chase people, vehicles, or livestock and not to run off, without recourse to such devices. It just takes more time and effort on the part of the trainer. You have to be able to bond with, and communicate with the dog, to predict its behaviour, and intervene then. Anyone resorting to these electric shock devices is simply evading that responsibility. I think this issue is one where Temple Grandin's background in livestock management works against her. There, the use of electric devices is seen as normal, but in dog care ? Surely not acceptable."
111,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15704502-colleen,5,"I wasn't able to read this book in one setting or even 2 settings and, maybe, that's a good thing because then I took the time to reflect on the way humans do things and why. It's intriguing to compare how Temple and I relate to animals and to reflect upon our differing realities. I shall reflect upon the following statement for a long time: ""Normal people can't see all those little changes without a lot of training and effort, because their brains process them unconsciously. So normal people are drawing what they ""see,"" which is the finished object, after their brains have put it all together. It's ironic that we always say autistic children are in their own little world because if Dr. Snyder is right it's normal people who are living inside their heads. Autistic people are experiencing the actual world much more directly and accurately than non-autistic people, with all their inattentional blindness, change blindness, and their every-other-kind-of blindness."" I was drawn to this book because I'm a born animal lover and because I have much curiosity about the natural world. I gained much perspective from Temple's book in regards to the how and way animals relate to world, but also gained a deeper understanding of the inner workings of human brain. Book initiated much reflection upon some of my preconceived assumptions of intelligence and those reflections definitely re-configured my understanding to include the many different types of animal geniuses.Because of how Temple described her reality, I have rearranged my assumed perceptions of what is the correct way to view the world; and I have adopted a better understanding of, and respect for, the autistic point of view. Temple's story reminds me to not be so quick to assume that my way is the right way. In regards to my life as an educator, I've gleaned more understanding of autistic children. I interacted with autistic children during my career, and those experiences caused me to assume that autistic children needed to interact with environment in a way that was quite rigid. After reading this book, I wouldn't describe my experiences with autistic children in quite that way. Now, I know that it wasn't so much that they were always trying to say their way was the right way, but, rather, that they just couldn't ""see"" things my way---and I couldn't see things their way. So, I don't think this book is about what's the right way or the wrong way to see the world; but, rather, the takeaway message is that human reality is affected by brain function, human experience, emotion, and context. It is highly valuable for all of us to share our realities of the world---and highly valuable for us to listen to the realities of others. I recommend this book for everyone. Another important take away is that most of us don't take the time to think about why we do things the way we do because that would just take too much time and be inefficient; but, oftentimes, it would be helpful and useful to reflect upon how and why we do things differently so we can compare our actions and results for the purpose of getting deeper understanding of alternate views. Since non-autistic people don't feel compelled to evaluate or alter their ""normal"" way of doing things (because those ways are an accepted way), it is likely non-autistic people also don't see the full ramification of doing some things in the ""normal"" way. On the other hand, the autistic person trying to cope with the majority viewpoint is compelled to do some analysis and evaluation in order to cope with the most-accepted standards of thinking and behavior imposed upon them. Temple describes many situations in which her non-standard thinking actually resulted in actions that were more acceptable to animals. She offers numerous stories on how the non-autistic person can learn from the autistic person about better ways of doing things by exploring alternative viewpoints and evaluating their assumptions about reality. Temple explains---in a nonjudgmental way---that the autistic view of the world is another reality, and that the autistic and non-autistic brain function differently resulting in some specific and differing autistic and non-autistic viewpoints and actions. Most enlightening to me is that the autistic reality offers the non-autistic person a window through which they can view their ""normal"" perceptions, actions, and viewpoints. Temple offers an alternative view of the non-autistic person's reality, which in the case of livestock management, encouraged humans to handle animals more humanely and more efficiently.This story has stirred in me the desire to reflect upon the assumptions I make about the BEST way to be with animals, and also has changed my view of autism. It's awesome when anyone, who resides a bit out of the norm, shares their story because we are reminded that change is good, that evaluation of our actions is important, and that the norm is only a norm for a short moment in time. I don't view autism negatively; but, rather, appreciate the autistic genius for seeing in pictures and noticing details that my brain ignores. Temple's story has encouraged me tap into the ignored realities of my daily existence."
112,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7729729-alison,2,"Temple Grandin is a huge name in animal welfare. Or, she was. She contributed amazingly to the field, but this book is definitely a product of its time.I couldn't finish it. Some of the anecdotes were interesting, but a lot of the information itself was outdated. Dominance theory hasn't been taken seriously in the animal world for some years now and this was the main theory of her book. The parts about how animal brains work and how she related it to her experience as an autistic woman were really interesting, but after the chapters on how you have to show pigs and horses and dogs who's boss I'm left wondering how much of the rest of it is out of date and considered ridiculous in 2019 by brain...scientists? I wonder how much of it even Ms. Grandin would still stand by.Even back when it was considered cutting edge, there were certain things that would have bothered me. She mashed personal opinion with scientific evidence with abandon. There was a lot of speculation, a lot of ""No one has done any studies on this specifically, but I bet that..."" which is not what I'm looking for in an educational read. I think that when you're writing from such a position of authority it's irresponsible to throw your opinion around like it's fact. It also didn't have the circumspection I've come to expect in pop science books. The first few chapters focusing on the basics of the field and disclaiming on how their results aren't necessarily definitive, how narrow the case study was, how new research is coming out, etc. I'm gonna be honest, I love that part. It was a little disappointing for it to be missing in one of the first books I've been able to read about my own field.From a writing standpoint, it was pretty awful. She's very ""write how you talk"" which makes it easy to follow, but it must take decades to have a conversation with her with the way she's constantly inserting irrelevant facts and stories. If she wants to write a memoir that's fine, but this book was supposed to be about a specific topic and she apparently had no editor to ask if paragraphs or entire pages were actually contributing to her point. This book could have been like 150 pages and been complete. I'm sorry Ms. Grandin but I'm not reading a book about animal behavior to find out how the government would be so much better if everyone just thought like you did.I did make it an admirable halfway through before giving up. I just have more valuable things to read with my time. If you're looking for a meaningful read about animal behavior, pick up something shorter that was written in the past couple of years."
113,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91724581-carol-aguilar,3,"	I read the book Animals In Translation. I discovered this book because it was in the no AR section and it caught my attention because it had the word Animals in it. I enjoyed the book in some parts and in some parts I didn't. In some parts it even made me angry.	The book was really good because Temple Grandin did a great way of explaining. I learned things about autism that I didn't know. I also really learned things about the brain.She really made sure you knew what autism is and how people with and without autism act and react, before saying how animals and people with autism have a connection and can help each other. She also explained a lot of things that were not related to autism. For example when she was talking about the behavior of humans and animals and that anthropomorphizing a animal is the worst thing you can do it really got me thinking. Do I anthropomorphize my pets and other animals. Is it dangerous if I do it? She also really explained that animals do and will feel emotion. She gave many examples of this for example the cats helping each other out during a delivery of a baby or saying the cows feel emotion when they are separated from their young. Even though they already “reached” a age in which they won't miss their young. This is where I start to not like the book. 	 What I didn't like was that Temple Grandin was saying all these great things about animals for example saying that humans and animals have different brain but also awfully a lot in common, saying how cows can be just like a dog and play just like one,and even saying how they can be a great companion for people with autism. But yet she talks about animals being used in labs and being tested on and even being used in her” humane” squeezing chute and humane ways to hand a animal going or getting ready for slaughter. It was very conflicting. It's like saying you love animals yet you still eat them. Or saying your against rape yet you eat dairy products.	 I think someone who would enjoy this book is anyone that is interested between the connection of animals with people with autism and even with people without it. Anyone also ready to read a book with a lot of information about the connection of humans and animals should read it."
114,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91381557-trey-hall,4,"Reading this fascinating collection of scientific experiments and phenomenological wonderings about animals' feelings, consciousness, and language was like trying to watch all at once the movements of a vast mobile on a windy balcony: you can sense that the different beauties, velocities, and fluctuations of all the pieces are connected, but your mind simply can't map the connections: in a way that leads to grandeur and awe, and occasionally to frustration at your perceptual limits.As a starting point, the author reflects on her own autism - and part of autistic perception, in general - as potentially similar to non-human animal patterns of perception and understanding. [I acknowledge this idea could be understandably offensive to some. Grandin writes in a full-on style and makes no apologies. Whether the science is far-out there or not, I'm not educated enough to say, but I found it compelling]. For example, she suggests that animals (whom she studies and loves) might share the same ""hyper-specific intelligence"" (not conceptual; not organizing the raw data perceived into any representative, and often smoothed-out, whole or schema; but seeing the minutiae of component parts without organizing them) and ""mental image language"" (thinking not in words or concepts but in pictures) that autistic people frequently describe having. From there she spends most of the book imagining what the multiple intelligences and emotional lives of animals might be like. I learned so much reading this book, but beyond learning, I experienced an increased sense of compassion for, friendship with, and sincere regard and love for animals, whose fear- and thought- and pain- and love- and joy-worlds, I'm convinced, are much more more dynamic, complex, and psychologically variegated than many scientists in particular and people in general think or allow themselves to think.For me, this expanding awareness raises serious ethical questions, to be sure - and I'm already a pescatarian - but more than that, it invites me into a deeper participation in my/our essential communion with all creatures, in the way I try to see, the way I pray, etc."
115,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44661992-michael,3,"My first thoughts about this book were: I wonder if I can get a refund from Colorado State University for the hundreds of dollars worth of tuition money I spent in Vet school for the privilege of listening to Temple Grandin present the exact same material as contained in this book. Given that in book form I was better able to concentrate on the material without being distracted by the author’s autistic mannerisms, I preferred the book form. Given that I checked the book out for free at the library I feel that I way overpaid in school.Temple Grandin is an interesting character, she is perhaps the most famous autistic person alive today. She believes that her autism causes her to think like a cow, and many view her as some sort of animal behavior autistic savant. I find these claims dubious at best. She does have a decent understanding of animal behavior, but has spent years studying it. It doesn’t sound as if it came naturally to her. As she tells a story of when she was young she couldn’t tell small dogs apart from cats because they were the same size. I think this shows that she wasn’t born with some innate understanding of animals, but actually started further behind most people. I believe she has worked hard to gain her understanding.One of my biggest problems with the book is that she spouts off old wives tales, stereotypes, anecdotal evidence, and her own untested theories as if they were all fact.She is fond of telling how she likes to lay down in the middle of a pen of cattle, and allow them come up and lick her. Yet I have been unable to grasp what insights she has gleaned by doing this. Being an individual who spends most of my time in cattle pens, I just keep thinking that is a disgusting place to lay down.With that said I must admit that despite her autism or perhaps because of it she has managed to turn her interest in animal behavior into a successful career. Additionally if my clients all had cattle handling facilities designed by her, and followed her principals it would make my life much easier."
116,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1300439-paula,2,"Like Temple Grandin, I believe that animals are more intelligent than we have given them credit for. I've read studies of crows, gray parrots, octopus, and ground squirrels in particular that reveal some amazing capabilities including strategizing, language, and tool making. So, I came into this text prepared. Grandin's comparisons between the capabilities, and limitations of autistic people with that of animals was interesting. Her understanding of ""normals"" was less impressive. Many of her claims about autistic people has more to do with intelligence than autism. For example, she claims autistic people are more observant than normal people. Whether this is true overall is speculative. I believe that intelligent people are more observant, and her claims to being hyper observant have as much to do with her intelligence as with her condition. She doesn't seem to separate the two at all. Autistic people have as broad a range of intelligence as normal people do. Yet, she doesn't parse out those traits that depend upon intelligence from those that depend upon an aberrant condition. She also claims that she has a particular insight into animal behavior and feelings that normal people cannot understand. This is also pure speculation. She deals mainly with ranchers, stockyard and slaughterhouse workers. These people have strong reason to believe that animals are less intelligent and less feeling than is likely the case. They do not represent all ""normals"". There are a great many normal animal trainers, and even pet owners who have great insight into the minds and feelings of animals. You don't have to be autistic to see that animals have feelings, and thoughts. You just have to care about animals, and not care about how much money you'll lose if the cattle keep getting injured. Her attitude toward veganism also shows a lack of understanding. She obviously did not study even the most rudimentary nutrition studies when she did her brief experiment in giving up meat. Watch The Game Changers if you think that eating vegan can leave anyone feeling weak! "
117,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2410849-juliet-wilson,4,"Subtitled 'the woman who thinks like a cow' this is a fascinating book about animal behaviour. Temple Grandin has autism and has used her different way of seeing the world as a way into understanding animals.Temple Grandin is an associate professor of animal science at Colorado State University. She has worked in the meat processing industry, helping to make slaughter houses more humane. As a vegetarian I didn't find this part of the book the easiest to read, but I have to admit that so many people are meat eaters who will never give up eating meat that it is vital that slaughter houses are made more humane. Also it is fascinating to read how the author thinks her way into the cow's mind, how it perceives the world and how it can be made to feel calmer and less threatened.The rest of the book looks at all kinds of animals, how they learn and how they relate to humans and whether the ways in which animals communicate can be considered to be true language, including the story of Alex the parrot, who seemed to be able to genuinely communicate and learn quicker than his owners and trainers expected . She outlines what makes dogs so good at being helper animals (particularly their sense of smell!) and how best to train dogs to increase their chances of growing up into well behaved, calm pets or working dogs (and she's a great believer in dogs working to give them a purpose in life!). The author constantly compares her own way of thinking as a person with autism to the way that animals think.All in all this is a fascinating book, whether your main interest is in autism in humans or in animal behaviour."

Temple Grandin writes forcefully and entertainingly about brains and perception and behaviors, both animal and human. Very useful ""Behavior and Training Troubleshooting Guide"" at the end.p.72: As the roosters got more and more aggressive, the humans unconsciously adjusted their perceptions of how a normal rooster should act. It was a case of the bad becoming normal, and it's a big danger in selective breeding programs. I've seen it many times.p.123: Some behaviorists say that the fact that all animals self-handicap might mean that the purpose of play fighting isn't to teach animals how to win but to teach them how to win and lose. p.193: From age eleven to age thirty-three, when I discovered antidepressant medication, I felt exactly the way you feel when you're about to defend your dissertation, only I felt that way all day long, every single day. I was in a constant, daily state of emergency. It was horrible.p.276: If language naturally evolves to serve the needs of tiny rodents with tiny rodent brains, then what's unique about language isn't the brilliant humans who invented it to communicate high-level abstract thoughts. What's unique about language is that the creatures who develop it are highly vulnerable to being eaten.p.288: But when you look at the jobs some dogs have invented for themselves using their advanced perceptual abilities, you're moving into the realm of true cognition, which is solving a problem under novel conditions."

Being close to animals brings some of it back.”Temple Grandin address two topics in this book: animals and autism. The connection between the two is far closer then I would have imagined. But by using her autistic mind, Grandin is able to understand animals in a way many people do not (or have to be trained to). As someone finding out late in life that they have Aspergers, her revelations on autism and autistic brains was eye-opening and affirming. Her ideas and research into animal behaviour and language are equally illuminating. I’m curious to know what we’ve learned about animal intelligence 15 years later. I suspect I’ll be reading more on this topic in future. There are a few moments in the book that show its age. Grandin uses ‘retarded’ several times, which I imagine was not seen as a slur 15 years back. And while she does so with no malice or condensation, for a modern reader it can be rather jarring. Additionally, there are a few stories of very severe animal abuse. Grandin uses these stories to argue in favour of animal welfare, but they are still quiet disturbing to read. These are things I feel is important for people to know going into a book that I can otherwise heartily recommend. Grandson’s love and fascination of animals is present in every page, and her work in increasing animal welfare in the meat industry was huge. If either topic is of interest to you, this book is worth your time.  "
120,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108010-tina,5,"Lauren recommended this book to me, and she was spot on in assuming I'd love it. So much interesting stuff here! It basically just describes a whole bunch of cool ways that animal brains work, with a healthy bit of info on how normal and autistic human brains work, too. Full of illustrative stories and experiments. As I was reading this book, I couldn't stop rambling on about everything in it to M. If you are interested in How Brains Work (and you have to know by now that I'm OBSESSED with the topic), I seriously recommend that you read this book. Now. Quick warning: It does contain quite a lot of stories about slaughterhouses, which was difficult for me to read at times. I much preferred when she talked about animal behavior that wasn't related to feed lots, etc. But despite that, I still loved this book and want to share all the facts from it with everyone I know. I wish I'd taken notes. Yes, I'm a nerd."
121,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/861650-laura,3,"I expected a little more from this book, after hearing about it constantly for several years in animal circles. When comparing thought processes and perception in animals and autistic people, Grandin provides some interesting insights in our dealings with animals. A good deal of this, however, is not as new or groundbreaking as she seems to feel it is, given anyone who has worked closely with animals for a time will come to the same realizations of what they see. When covering behavioral conepts in general, she tends not to distinguish between what are generally regarded as facts or hard theories, and what are individuals' hypotheses and pet theories. She simply chooses what she likes and presents it all as straight fact, which I find rather irritating and somewhat irresponsible coming from a PhD. Her anecdotes and examples are fascinating, but I'd suggest taking her renditions of them somewhat lightly and going to the original literature for more accurate accounts. "
122,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/766968-tami,5,"Animals in Translation is an amazing book. This book states that by looking at human autism, we can better under animals, the way they think, the way they behave, and how they see the world. The author is an animal scientist who works primarily with slaughter houses. She is also autistic. Before reading this book, I had very little comprehension about the way that autistic people see the world. I simply had no idea that seeing the world in a visual way was that much different than the way that I think. I now see that this different way of thinking has a lot of really interesting benefits, particularly when it comes to understanding other visual thinkers like the animals around us. As I read this book, I started to comprehend how much detail in life we normally ignore. So much of what we need to understand animals is simply looking at life from their perspective, both literally and figuratively speaking."
123,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1246511-alex,5,"A truly fascinating read. Grandin's synthesis of how human and animal brains works is by far the most compelling one I've read so far (and I've read a few!). Her anecdotes are truly fascinating (elephants that communicate over miles by beating on the ground! dogs that can detect human seizures long before they occur! dolphins that kill porpoises just for kicks!) and fodder for a lifetime of cocktail party conversations. But more vital is the synthetic whole she makes out of her work on animal behavior and her own autism, which is at once disarming and compelling. In the end, Gradin's frankness, honesty, and willingness to acknowledge the limitations of her knowledge makes her generalizations about minds, behavior, and evolution far more compelling than many of the more popular writers on the brain. This little book should be read by anyone who cares about animals, and/or anyone cares about how the mind works."

While reading this book, the reader realizes that often many people with autism have unique abilities that the rest of us can only dream of.i highly recommend this book; it is incredibly insightful. i found myself repeatedly finding such logic in Grandin's wisdom that just made such sense."

Unfortunately, kids will be forced to read some waste of time book in high school like Billy Bud or Romeo and Juliet when there are awesome thought provoking books like this. It was fascinating to feel the basic accessibility of this book instead of the normal, overly-verbose, academic prose that would fill this type of book. I wonder how much of the writing was done by Temple and how much by the co-author. Being autistic, is it even possible for Temple to write an entire book by herself? I have way too many questions now, but that's the whole point to a good science book."

She believes her autism gives her an edge in her profession as she believes she thinks a lot more like animals do. She speaks of herself as thinking in pictures, not words. She also writes of noticing a lot of details that normal people don't--but that animals do. I found the book interesting not only for what it had to say about animal behavior but also for what Grandin had to say about her own autism. However, I found the book repetitive and grew tired of it 3/4 of the way through, so I just skimmed the rest. This is a book that has been in my TBR stack for some time and which I've attempted to read in the past, and just never finished, though I sort of wanted to. This time I'm giving up. "

Her book is thought provoking and loaded with personal stories from her vast experience with dogs, horses cows, pigs and chickens.

140,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19143066-stewart-mcfarlane,5,"This is fascinating book on animal behaviour written by Temple Grandin, a remarkable woman, who lectures all over the world on animal welfare, especially livestock, and on the nature of autism. The book is co-authored by Catherine Johnson, a mother of two children with autism.Temple Grandin is an associate professor of animal science at Colorado State University. She courageously went public about her diagnosis of autism. She also has an international reputation in the meat-packing industry, for her ground-breaking designs of humane cattle-handling equipment, techniques, and setting standards of good practice in handling animals.Grandin has two main aims in this book. She aims to show how problems in animal behaviour can be resolved by understanding the causes of the behaviour. To this end, she has analysed livestock behaviour down to its smallest details, so that she can predict what an animal will do. She has extensive experience in being called in to trouble-shoot difficult behaviour in domestic and agricultural animals, including cattle,pigs, dogs and horses. She has synthesized the knowledge of animal breeders, trainers and ethologists, into rules and practical advice on how to manage difficult animals.Her second aim is to develop a new theory of autism. She argues that the autistic mind is closer to the animal mind than it is to the typical human mind, when it comes to perception of detail. This opens the possibility of new ways of understanding autism. There are autistic ""savants"" who can identify a prime number with uncanny speed, or can perform complex calculations faster than a computer.. In all of these instances, the individual has systematized a mathematical system. Grandin extends her understanding to living creatures.Grandin has tried to systematize animal behavior. She starts from the animal's perspective and asks; what kinds of stimuli might make an animal frightened? What kinds of stimuli might make an animal aggressive? What do we know about the neuroscience of animal drives that might help us predict its behaviour? Grandin's analysis of animal behaviour results in her understanding it to the point of being able to predict it, and to remedy faults and problems.Here are some examples of how slight changes in an animal's environment can produce strong, often alarming reactions. Changes in lighting from outside to inside building can frighten cattle and pigs. Pools of water can frighten them when caught in the light. Flapping objects such as coats or rags near where they have to walk can really scare them.Unfamiliar noises from generators etc can unnerve them and cause panic.As a dog trainer and elephant handler, I realise the importance of knowing your animal and trying to see things they way that the animal does. I have learned to read the body language of my dogs, so as to predict their behavior. Their running action when hunting squirrels is totally different from that when they have the scent of a bitch in season. My German Shepherd has a fast purposeful trot with his head up when he is planning the pursuit of an interesting female dog. He also stops looking around for me, because at that time I have temporarily ceased to exist for him, so if I want to stop him, I know I have to act fast with a stop command. If I know the bitch is friendly to him, I usually just let him get on with it and re-call him when his curiousity and/or lust is satisfied. I know one elephant in Chiang Mai Province who is terrified of small white birds, if they are feeding on the ground in a flock. She gets nervous and simply will not proceed past the birds. I just let her back up and find another route, or I dismount, leave her at a safe distance, and scare the birds off for her. She doesn't mind them at all if they are perched in the trees. She was probably startled by a flock of these birds when she was young.Many animal trainers and animal problem solvers such as Cesar Millan, who often deals with dog phobias, are aware of the importance of close observation and trying to see things the way the animal sees them. Grandin goes further in trying to systematize this knowledge. She has also examined the causes of aggression in domestic animals such as horses or dogs, and developed a set of rules. If a stallion is kept locked up and deprived of the opportunity to learn to socialise, it will be very aggressive to other stallions, and will try to rape mares. If a dog is not properly socialised with other dogs and people outside its family, it may well be aggressive, through fear. Or if it is allowed to be too dominant and intimidate its human family, then it may be aggressive to them. If it knows its place in the family, and is given clear boundaries, it will be contented and not cause such problems.Finally, she has examined animal breeding. If you cross a fast-growing rooster with a fast-growing hen, you get fast-growing chickens. But she identifies that such single-characteristic genetic breeding programmes always come with a down-side. The fast-growing offspring also have weak hearts, for example. If you cross fast-growing chickens with those selected for their strength, you get long-lived, fast-growing chickens, but they are monstrously aggressive. I think some of the accounts of the mistakes and cruelties inflicted on livestock here will cause more people to question the ethics of the whole process of commercial meat production, however well managed. In my view that is a good thing.Some readers may be shocked that Temple Grandin is saying that autistic people are more similar to animal than normal people. Isn't this suggesting that autistic people are subhuman? In fact, Grandin's claim is that animals have superior perception of detail, and so do people with autism. So, far from offending people with autism, she is if anything suggesting that non-autistic people have less sharp perception. In a way she is saying that it is the ""normal"" people who are handicapped, because they miss all this detail, and make many mistakes when trying to remember events. We know that this is the case from ""eye-witness"" testimony, which often turns out to be unreliable , because our brains construct memories, make assumptions, and change details and sequences, often in the very process of recalling them. She links the two themes of her book by arguing that a person with autism will have a greater affinity for animals than will a person without autism, because the same sorts of unexpected changes like flickering lights, or sudden small movements or sounds that might startle an animal, might also startle a person with autism. She goes further to argue that understanding animal perception might help us understand autistic perception.Getting back to the elephant example, Grandin mentions the fact that they use infrasonic (low rumbles) to communicate and possibly even seismic communication (ground vibrations) to send messages to their family members across distances as great as 25 miles. Elephants when distress, slam their trunks on the ground. The elephant I know with the white bird phobia does this if the birds get too near her. I agree with Temple here, that the elephant is communicating her distress to other elephants. In fact elephants do a whole range of things with their prehensile trunks. They explore their environment, comfort each other, pick up food and objects such as sticks to scratch with. Elephants normally sleep standing up, and often with their eyes open. You know when an elephant is asleep because its trunk is totally relaxed and resting on the ground at the tip. This is important because you should never startle a sleeping elephant. You should make a gentle sound, and let it wake up first, and you should never approach an elephant from behind or straight ahead of it. Their vision is poor and they are happier if you approach from the front but to one side, so they clearly see you coming.I am delighted to see that towards the end of the book, she discusses the evidence that humans co-evolved with wolves, in other words that we changed them and they changed us. This is something that I have long believed. Dog and human bones have been found in burials dating back 14,000 years, so some archaeologists concluded that domestication of dogs too place then. But Robert Wayne and his team at UCLA examined through DNA testing found that dogs started to diverge from wolves about 135,000 years ago. He suggest, and Temple and I agree with him, that proto humans, wolves that were slowly becoming dogs, were developing together, and were already closely associated. Many finds of wolf bones and humans bones together,date from more than 100,000 years ago.This suggests that they were associating at a time when homo sapiens were just evolving from homo erectus. This means they had few tools, were perhaps pre linguistic. The wolves with their superior sense of smell and superior pack based hunting skills, probably taught the proto humans the value of cooperation with them and with each other. Grandin argues that human social structures resembles that of wolves, more closely that that of primates. Even stronger evidence is that fact that the mid-brain of humans, which handles sensory data, including scenting smell, shrank over 10,000 years ago, while the fore-brain which handles language, reasoning and planning skills remained the same. The suggestion is that many of the mid brain functions of humans were not needed so much because the dogs were handling that side of things. The camp dogs were scenting, hearing and identifying prey and dangerous threats, for the humans, so the human brain was free to specialise and organise, develop language and cultural skills. Grandin suggest that this is probably why homo sapiens were able to flourish, while Neanderthals with similar brains to humans, did not, because they were not cooperating with wolves or proto dogs.I think this evidence may well explain why so many humans, including me, have such a strong affinity with dogs, and wolves. We are ancient companions.Interested readers can find out more about my experiences with dogs, elephants and other animals, in my book: OF MICE & ZEN.ANIMAL ENCOUNTERS IN THE LIFE OF A WANDERING BUDDHIST (free samples of Goodreads and Amazon).As I have made clear, I greatly appreciated this book. One important detail on which I disagree with her, is on the use of shock collars and invisible electric fences on dogs who chase joggers and cyclists, or dogs who roam. She advocates these as necessary to prevent these problems. I disagree. Such devices often traumatize dogs and can cause the dog to get injured. One unfortunate collie was so traumatized by the shock fence, that she would never leave the house and started pooping on the floor. These devices are barbaric if used by careless, inexperienced people, and they are not necessary. I have trained many dogs not to chase people, vehicles, or livestock and not to run off, without recourse to such devices. It just takes more time and effort on the part of the trainer. You have to be able to bond with, and communicate with the dog, to predict its behaviour, and intervene then. Anyone resorting to these electric shock devices is simply evading that responsibility. I think this issue is one where Temple Grandin's background in livestock management works against her. There, the use of electric devices is seen as normal, but in dog care ? Surely not acceptable."
141,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15704502-colleen,5,"I wasn't able to read this book in one setting or even 2 settings and, maybe, that's a good thing because then I took the time to reflect on the way humans do things and why. It's intriguing to compare how Temple and I relate to animals and to reflect upon our differing realities. I shall reflect upon the following statement for a long time: ""Normal people can't see all those little changes without a lot of training and effort, because their brains process them unconsciously. So normal people are drawing what they ""see,"" which is the finished object, after their brains have put it all together. It's ironic that we always say autistic children are in their own little world because if Dr. Snyder is right it's normal people who are living inside their heads. Autistic people are experiencing the actual world much more directly and accurately than non-autistic people, with all their inattentional blindness, change blindness, and their every-other-kind-of blindness."" I was drawn to this book because I'm a born animal lover and because I have much curiosity about the natural world. I gained much perspective from Temple's book in regards to the how and way animals relate to world, but also gained a deeper understanding of the inner workings of human brain. Book initiated much reflection upon some of my preconceived assumptions of intelligence and those reflections definitely re-configured my understanding to include the many different types of animal geniuses.Because of how Temple described her reality, I have rearranged my assumed perceptions of what is the correct way to view the world; and I have adopted a better understanding of, and respect for, the autistic point of view. Temple's story reminds me to not be so quick to assume that my way is the right way. In regards to my life as an educator, I've gleaned more understanding of autistic children. I interacted with autistic children during my career, and those experiences caused me to assume that autistic children needed to interact with environment in a way that was quite rigid. After reading this book, I wouldn't describe my experiences with autistic children in quite that way. Now, I know that it wasn't so much that they were always trying to say their way was the right way, but, rather, that they just couldn't ""see"" things my way---and I couldn't see things their way. So, I don't think this book is about what's the right way or the wrong way to see the world; but, rather, the takeaway message is that human reality is affected by brain function, human experience, emotion, and context. It is highly valuable for all of us to share our realities of the world---and highly valuable for us to listen to the realities of others. I recommend this book for everyone. Another important take away is that most of us don't take the time to think about why we do things the way we do because that would just take too much time and be inefficient; but, oftentimes, it would be helpful and useful to reflect upon how and why we do things differently so we can compare our actions and results for the purpose of getting deeper understanding of alternate views. Since non-autistic people don't feel compelled to evaluate or alter their ""normal"" way of doing things (because those ways are an accepted way), it is likely non-autistic people also don't see the full ramification of doing some things in the ""normal"" way. On the other hand, the autistic person trying to cope with the majority viewpoint is compelled to do some analysis and evaluation in order to cope with the most-accepted standards of thinking and behavior imposed upon them. Temple describes many situations in which her non-standard thinking actually resulted in actions that were more acceptable to animals. She offers numerous stories on how the non-autistic person can learn from the autistic person about better ways of doing things by exploring alternative viewpoints and evaluating their assumptions about reality. Temple explains---in a nonjudgmental way---that the autistic view of the world is another reality, and that the autistic and non-autistic brain function differently resulting in some specific and differing autistic and non-autistic viewpoints and actions. Most enlightening to me is that the autistic reality offers the non-autistic person a window through which they can view their ""normal"" perceptions, actions, and viewpoints. Temple offers an alternative view of the non-autistic person's reality, which in the case of livestock management, encouraged humans to handle animals more humanely and more efficiently.This story has stirred in me the desire to reflect upon the assumptions I make about the BEST way to be with animals, and also has changed my view of autism. It's awesome when anyone, who resides a bit out of the norm, shares their story because we are reminded that change is good, that evaluation of our actions is important, and that the norm is only a norm for a short moment in time. I don't view autism negatively; but, rather, appreciate the autistic genius for seeing in pictures and noticing details that my brain ignores. Temple's story has encouraged me tap into the ignored realities of my daily existence."
142,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7729729-alison,2,"Temple Grandin is a huge name in animal welfare. Or, she was. She contributed amazingly to the field, but this book is definitely a product of its time.I couldn't finish it. Some of the anecdotes were interesting, but a lot of the information itself was outdated. Dominance theory hasn't been taken seriously in the animal world for some years now and this was the main theory of her book. The parts about how animal brains work and how she related it to her experience as an autistic woman were really interesting, but after the chapters on how you have to show pigs and horses and dogs who's boss I'm left wondering how much of the rest of it is out of date and considered ridiculous in 2019 by brain...scientists? I wonder how much of it even Ms. Grandin would still stand by.Even back when it was considered cutting edge, there were certain things that would have bothered me. She mashed personal opinion with scientific evidence with abandon. There was a lot of speculation, a lot of ""No one has done any studies on this specifically, but I bet that..."" which is not what I'm looking for in an educational read. I think that when you're writing from such a position of authority it's irresponsible to throw your opinion around like it's fact. It also didn't have the circumspection I've come to expect in pop science books. The first few chapters focusing on the basics of the field and disclaiming on how their results aren't necessarily definitive, how narrow the case study was, how new research is coming out, etc. I'm gonna be honest, I love that part. It was a little disappointing for it to be missing in one of the first books I've been able to read about my own field.From a writing standpoint, it was pretty awful. She's very ""write how you talk"" which makes it easy to follow, but it must take decades to have a conversation with her with the way she's constantly inserting irrelevant facts and stories. If she wants to write a memoir that's fine, but this book was supposed to be about a specific topic and she apparently had no editor to ask if paragraphs or entire pages were actually contributing to her point. This book could have been like 150 pages and been complete. I'm sorry Ms. Grandin but I'm not reading a book about animal behavior to find out how the government would be so much better if everyone just thought like you did.I did make it an admirable halfway through before giving up. I just have more valuable things to read with my time. If you're looking for a meaningful read about animal behavior, pick up something shorter that was written in the past couple of years."
143,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91724581-carol-aguilar,3,"	I read the book Animals In Translation. I discovered this book because it was in the no AR section and it caught my attention because it had the word Animals in it. I enjoyed the book in some parts and in some parts I didn't. In some parts it even made me angry.	The book was really good because Temple Grandin did a great way of explaining. I learned things about autism that I didn't know. I also really learned things about the brain.She really made sure you knew what autism is and how people with and without autism act and react, before saying how animals and people with autism have a connection and can help each other. She also explained a lot of things that were not related to autism. For example when she was talking about the behavior of humans and animals and that anthropomorphizing a animal is the worst thing you can do it really got me thinking. Do I anthropomorphize my pets and other animals. Is it dangerous if I do it? She also really explained that animals do and will feel emotion. She gave many examples of this for example the cats helping each other out during a delivery of a baby or saying the cows feel emotion when they are separated from their young. Even though they already “reached” a age in which they won't miss their young. This is where I start to not like the book. 	 What I didn't like was that Temple Grandin was saying all these great things about animals for example saying that humans and animals have different brain but also awfully a lot in common, saying how cows can be just like a dog and play just like one,and even saying how they can be a great companion for people with autism. But yet she talks about animals being used in labs and being tested on and even being used in her” humane” squeezing chute and humane ways to hand a animal going or getting ready for slaughter. It was very conflicting. It's like saying you love animals yet you still eat them. Or saying your against rape yet you eat dairy products.	 I think someone who would enjoy this book is anyone that is interested between the connection of animals with people with autism and even with people without it. Anyone also ready to read a book with a lot of information about the connection of humans and animals should read it."
144,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91381557-trey-hall,4,"Reading this fascinating collection of scientific experiments and phenomenological wonderings about animals' feelings, consciousness, and language was like trying to watch all at once the movements of a vast mobile on a windy balcony: you can sense that the different beauties, velocities, and fluctuations of all the pieces are connected, but your mind simply can't map the connections: in a way that leads to grandeur and awe, and occasionally to frustration at your perceptual limits.As a starting point, the author reflects on her own autism - and part of autistic perception, in general - as potentially similar to non-human animal patterns of perception and understanding. [I acknowledge this idea could be understandably offensive to some. Grandin writes in a full-on style and makes no apologies. Whether the science is far-out there or not, I'm not educated enough to say, but I found it compelling]. For example, she suggests that animals (whom she studies and loves) might share the same ""hyper-specific intelligence"" (not conceptual; not organizing the raw data perceived into any representative, and often smoothed-out, whole or schema; but seeing the minutiae of component parts without organizing them) and ""mental image language"" (thinking not in words or concepts but in pictures) that autistic people frequently describe having. From there she spends most of the book imagining what the multiple intelligences and emotional lives of animals might be like. I learned so much reading this book, but beyond learning, I experienced an increased sense of compassion for, friendship with, and sincere regard and love for animals, whose fear- and thought- and pain- and love- and joy-worlds, I'm convinced, are much more more dynamic, complex, and psychologically variegated than many scientists in particular and people in general think or allow themselves to think.For me, this expanding awareness raises serious ethical questions, to be sure - and I'm already a pescatarian - but more than that, it invites me into a deeper participation in my/our essential communion with all creatures, in the way I try to see, the way I pray, etc."
145,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44661992-michael,3,"My first thoughts about this book were: I wonder if I can get a refund from Colorado State University for the hundreds of dollars worth of tuition money I spent in Vet school for the privilege of listening to Temple Grandin present the exact same material as contained in this book. Given that in book form I was better able to concentrate on the material without being distracted by the author’s autistic mannerisms, I preferred the book form. Given that I checked the book out for free at the library I feel that I way overpaid in school.Temple Grandin is an interesting character, she is perhaps the most famous autistic person alive today. She believes that her autism causes her to think like a cow, and many view her as some sort of animal behavior autistic savant. I find these claims dubious at best. She does have a decent understanding of animal behavior, but has spent years studying it. It doesn’t sound as if it came naturally to her. As she tells a story of when she was young she couldn’t tell small dogs apart from cats because they were the same size. I think this shows that she wasn’t born with some innate understanding of animals, but actually started further behind most people. I believe she has worked hard to gain her understanding.One of my biggest problems with the book is that she spouts off old wives tales, stereotypes, anecdotal evidence, and her own untested theories as if they were all fact.She is fond of telling how she likes to lay down in the middle of a pen of cattle, and allow them come up and lick her. Yet I have been unable to grasp what insights she has gleaned by doing this. Being an individual who spends most of my time in cattle pens, I just keep thinking that is a disgusting place to lay down.With that said I must admit that despite her autism or perhaps because of it she has managed to turn her interest in animal behavior into a successful career. Additionally if my clients all had cattle handling facilities designed by her, and followed her principals it would make my life much easier."
146,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1300439-paula,2,"Like Temple Grandin, I believe that animals are more intelligent than we have given them credit for. I've read studies of crows, gray parrots, octopus, and ground squirrels in particular that reveal some amazing capabilities including strategizing, language, and tool making. So, I came into this text prepared. Grandin's comparisons between the capabilities, and limitations of autistic people with that of animals was interesting. Her understanding of ""normals"" was less impressive. Many of her claims about autistic people has more to do with intelligence than autism. For example, she claims autistic people are more observant than normal people. Whether this is true overall is speculative. I believe that intelligent people are more observant, and her claims to being hyper observant have as much to do with her intelligence as with her condition. She doesn't seem to separate the two at all. Autistic people have as broad a range of intelligence as normal people do. Yet, she doesn't parse out those traits that depend upon intelligence from those that depend upon an aberrant condition. She also claims that she has a particular insight into animal behavior and feelings that normal people cannot understand. This is also pure speculation. She deals mainly with ranchers, stockyard and slaughterhouse workers. These people have strong reason to believe that animals are less intelligent and less feeling than is likely the case. They do not represent all ""normals"". There are a great many normal animal trainers, and even pet owners who have great insight into the minds and feelings of animals. You don't have to be autistic to see that animals have feelings, and thoughts. You just have to care about animals, and not care about how much money you'll lose if the cattle keep getting injured. Her attitude toward veganism also shows a lack of understanding. She obviously did not study even the most rudimentary nutrition studies when she did her brief experiment in giving up meat. Watch The Game Changers if you think that eating vegan can leave anyone feeling weak! "
147,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2410849-juliet-wilson,4,"Subtitled 'the woman who thinks like a cow' this is a fascinating book about animal behaviour. Temple Grandin has autism and has used her different way of seeing the world as a way into understanding animals.Temple Grandin is an associate professor of animal science at Colorado State University. She has worked in the meat processing industry, helping to make slaughter houses more humane. As a vegetarian I didn't find this part of the book the easiest to read, but I have to admit that so many people are meat eaters who will never give up eating meat that it is vital that slaughter houses are made more humane. Also it is fascinating to read how the author thinks her way into the cow's mind, how it perceives the world and how it can be made to feel calmer and less threatened.The rest of the book looks at all kinds of animals, how they learn and how they relate to humans and whether the ways in which animals communicate can be considered to be true language, including the story of Alex the parrot, who seemed to be able to genuinely communicate and learn quicker than his owners and trainers expected . She outlines what makes dogs so good at being helper animals (particularly their sense of smell!) and how best to train dogs to increase their chances of growing up into well behaved, calm pets or working dogs (and she's a great believer in dogs working to give them a purpose in life!). The author constantly compares her own way of thinking as a person with autism to the way that animals think.All in all this is a fascinating book, whether your main interest is in autism in humans or in animal behaviour."

Very useful ""Behavior and Training Troubleshooting Guide"" at the end.p.72: As the roosters got more and more aggressive, the humans unconsciously adjusted their perceptions of how a normal rooster should act. It was a case of the bad becoming normal, and it's a big danger in selective breeding programs. I've seen it many times.p.123: Some behaviorists say that the fact that all animals self-handicap might mean that the purpose of play fighting isn't to teach animals how to win but to teach them how to win and lose. p.193: From age eleven to age thirty-three, when I discovered antidepressant medication, I felt exactly the way you feel when you're about to defend your dissertation, only I felt that way all day long, every single day.

Being close to animals brings some of it back.”Temple Grandin address two topics in this book: animals and autism. The connection between the two is far closer then I would have imagined. But by using her autistic mind, Grandin is able to understand animals in a way many people do not (or have to be trained to). As someone finding out late in life that they have Aspergers, her revelations on autism and autistic brains was eye-opening and affirming. Her ideas and research into animal behaviour and language are equally illuminating. I’m curious to know what we’ve learned about animal intelligence 15 years later. I suspect I’ll be reading more on this topic in future. There are a few moments in the book that show its age. Grandin uses ‘retarded’ several times, which I imagine was not seen as a slur 15 years back. And while she does so with no malice or condensation, for a modern reader it can be rather jarring. Additionally, there are a few stories of very severe animal abuse. Grandin uses these stories to argue in favour of animal welfare, but they are still quiet disturbing to read. These are things I feel is important for people to know going into a book that I can otherwise heartily recommend. Grandson’s love and fascination of animals is present in every page, and her work in increasing animal welfare in the meat industry was huge. If either topic is of interest to you, this book is worth your time.  "
150,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108010-tina,5,"Lauren recommended this book to me, and she was spot on in assuming I'd love it. So much interesting stuff here! It basically just describes a whole bunch of cool ways that animal brains work, with a healthy bit of info on how normal and autistic human brains work, too. Full of illustrative stories and experiments. As I was reading this book, I couldn't stop rambling on about everything in it to M. If you are interested in How Brains Work (and you have to know by now that I'm OBSESSED with the topic), I seriously recommend that you read this book. Now. Quick warning: It does contain quite a lot of stories about slaughterhouses, which was difficult for me to read at times. I much preferred when she talked about animal behavior that wasn't related to feed lots, etc. But despite that, I still loved this book and want to share all the facts from it with everyone I know. I wish I'd taken notes. Yes, I'm a nerd."
151,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/861650-laura,3,"I expected a little more from this book, after hearing about it constantly for several years in animal circles. When comparing thought processes and perception in animals and autistic people, Grandin provides some interesting insights in our dealings with animals. A good deal of this, however, is not as new or groundbreaking as she seems to feel it is, given anyone who has worked closely with animals for a time will come to the same realizations of what they see. When covering behavioral conepts in general, she tends not to distinguish between what are generally regarded as facts or hard theories, and what are individuals' hypotheses and pet theories. She simply chooses what she likes and presents it all as straight fact, which I find rather irritating and somewhat irresponsible coming from a PhD. Her anecdotes and examples are fascinating, but I'd suggest taking her renditions of them somewhat lightly and going to the original literature for more accurate accounts. "
152,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/766968-tami,5,"Animals in Translation is an amazing book. This book states that by looking at human autism, we can better under animals, the way they think, the way they behave, and how they see the world. The author is an animal scientist who works primarily with slaughter houses. She is also autistic. Before reading this book, I had very little comprehension about the way that autistic people see the world. I simply had no idea that seeing the world in a visual way was that much different than the way that I think. I now see that this different way of thinking has a lot of really interesting benefits, particularly when it comes to understanding other visual thinkers like the animals around us. As I read this book, I started to comprehend how much detail in life we normally ignore. So much of what we need to understand animals is simply looking at life from their perspective, both literally and figuratively speaking."
153,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1246511-alex,5,"A truly fascinating read. Grandin's synthesis of how human and animal brains works is by far the most compelling one I've read so far (and I've read a few!). Her anecdotes are truly fascinating (elephants that communicate over miles by beating on the ground! dogs that can detect human seizures long before they occur! dolphins that kill porpoises just for kicks!) and fodder for a lifetime of cocktail party conversations. But more vital is the synthetic whole she makes out of her work on animal behavior and her own autism, which is at once disarming and compelling. In the end, Gradin's frankness, honesty, and willingness to acknowledge the limitations of her knowledge makes her generalizations about minds, behavior, and evolution far more compelling than many of the more popular writers on the brain. This little book should be read by anyone who cares about animals, and/or anyone cares about how the mind works."

While reading this book, the reader realizes that often many people with autism have unique abilities that the rest of us can only dream of.i highly recommend this book; it is incredibly insightful. i found myself repeatedly finding such logic in Grandin's wisdom that just made such sense."

Unfortunately, kids will be forced to read some waste of time book in high school like Billy Bud or Romeo and Juliet when there are awesome thought provoking books like this. It was fascinating to feel the basic accessibility of this book instead of the normal, overly-verbose, academic prose that would fill this type of book. I wonder how much of the writing was done by Temple and how much by the co-author. Being autistic, is it even possible for Temple to write an entire book by herself? I have way too many questions now, but that's the whole point to a good science book."

She also writes of noticing a lot of details that normal people don't--but that animals do. I found the book interesting not only for what it had to say about animal behavior but also for what Grandin had to say about her own autism. However, I found the book repetitive and grew tired of it 3/4 of the way through, so I just skimmed the rest. This is a book that has been in my TBR stack for some time and which I've attempted to read in the past, and just never finished, though I sort of wanted to. This time I'm giving up. "

170,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19143066-stewart-mcfarlane,5,"This is fascinating book on animal behaviour written by Temple Grandin, a remarkable woman, who lectures all over the world on animal welfare, especially livestock, and on the nature of autism. The book is co-authored by Catherine Johnson, a mother of two children with autism.Temple Grandin is an associate professor of animal science at Colorado State University. She courageously went public about her diagnosis of autism. She also has an international reputation in the meat-packing industry, for her ground-breaking designs of humane cattle-handling equipment, techniques, and setting standards of good practice in handling animals.Grandin has two main aims in this book. She aims to show how problems in animal behaviour can be resolved by understanding the causes of the behaviour. To this end, she has analysed livestock behaviour down to its smallest details, so that she can predict what an animal will do. She has extensive experience in being called in to trouble-shoot difficult behaviour in domestic and agricultural animals, including cattle,pigs, dogs and horses. She has synthesized the knowledge of animal breeders, trainers and ethologists, into rules and practical advice on how to manage difficult animals.Her second aim is to develop a new theory of autism. She argues that the autistic mind is closer to the animal mind than it is to the typical human mind, when it comes to perception of detail. This opens the possibility of new ways of understanding autism. There are autistic ""savants"" who can identify a prime number with uncanny speed, or can perform complex calculations faster than a computer.. In all of these instances, the individual has systematized a mathematical system. Grandin extends her understanding to living creatures.Grandin has tried to systematize animal behavior. She starts from the animal's perspective and asks; what kinds of stimuli might make an animal frightened? What kinds of stimuli might make an animal aggressive? What do we know about the neuroscience of animal drives that might help us predict its behaviour? Grandin's analysis of animal behaviour results in her understanding it to the point of being able to predict it, and to remedy faults and problems.Here are some examples of how slight changes in an animal's environment can produce strong, often alarming reactions. Changes in lighting from outside to inside building can frighten cattle and pigs. Pools of water can frighten them when caught in the light. Flapping objects such as coats or rags near where they have to walk can really scare them.Unfamiliar noises from generators etc can unnerve them and cause panic.As a dog trainer and elephant handler, I realise the importance of knowing your animal and trying to see things they way that the animal does. I have learned to read the body language of my dogs, so as to predict their behavior. Their running action when hunting squirrels is totally different from that when they have the scent of a bitch in season. My German Shepherd has a fast purposeful trot with his head up when he is planning the pursuit of an interesting female dog. He also stops looking around for me, because at that time I have temporarily ceased to exist for him, so if I want to stop him, I know I have to act fast with a stop command. If I know the bitch is friendly to him, I usually just let him get on with it and re-call him when his curiousity and/or lust is satisfied. I know one elephant in Chiang Mai Province who is terrified of small white birds, if they are feeding on the ground in a flock. She gets nervous and simply will not proceed past the birds. I just let her back up and find another route, or I dismount, leave her at a safe distance, and scare the birds off for her. She doesn't mind them at all if they are perched in the trees. She was probably startled by a flock of these birds when she was young.Many animal trainers and animal problem solvers such as Cesar Millan, who often deals with dog phobias, are aware of the importance of close observation and trying to see things the way the animal sees them. Grandin goes further in trying to systematize this knowledge. She has also examined the causes of aggression in domestic animals such as horses or dogs, and developed a set of rules. If a stallion is kept locked up and deprived of the opportunity to learn to socialise, it will be very aggressive to other stallions, and will try to rape mares. If a dog is not properly socialised with other dogs and people outside its family, it may well be aggressive, through fear. Or if it is allowed to be too dominant and intimidate its human family, then it may be aggressive to them. If it knows its place in the family, and is given clear boundaries, it will be contented and not cause such problems.Finally, she has examined animal breeding. If you cross a fast-growing rooster with a fast-growing hen, you get fast-growing chickens. But she identifies that such single-characteristic genetic breeding programmes always come with a down-side. The fast-growing offspring also have weak hearts, for example. If you cross fast-growing chickens with those selected for their strength, you get long-lived, fast-growing chickens, but they are monstrously aggressive. I think some of the accounts of the mistakes and cruelties inflicted on livestock here will cause more people to question the ethics of the whole process of commercial meat production, however well managed. In my view that is a good thing.Some readers may be shocked that Temple Grandin is saying that autistic people are more similar to animal than normal people. Isn't this suggesting that autistic people are subhuman? In fact, Grandin's claim is that animals have superior perception of detail, and so do people with autism. So, far from offending people with autism, she is if anything suggesting that non-autistic people have less sharp perception. In a way she is saying that it is the ""normal"" people who are handicapped, because they miss all this detail, and make many mistakes when trying to remember events. We know that this is the case from ""eye-witness"" testimony, which often turns out to be unreliable , because our brains construct memories, make assumptions, and change details and sequences, often in the very process of recalling them. She links the two themes of her book by arguing that a person with autism will have a greater affinity for animals than will a person without autism, because the same sorts of unexpected changes like flickering lights, or sudden small movements or sounds that might startle an animal, might also startle a person with autism. She goes further to argue that understanding animal perception might help us understand autistic perception.Getting back to the elephant example, Grandin mentions the fact that they use infrasonic (low rumbles) to communicate and possibly even seismic communication (ground vibrations) to send messages to their family members across distances as great as 25 miles. Elephants when distress, slam their trunks on the ground. The elephant I know with the white bird phobia does this if the birds get too near her. I agree with Temple here, that the elephant is communicating her distress to other elephants. In fact elephants do a whole range of things with their prehensile trunks. They explore their environment, comfort each other, pick up food and objects such as sticks to scratch with. Elephants normally sleep standing up, and often with their eyes open. You know when an elephant is asleep because its trunk is totally relaxed and resting on the ground at the tip. This is important because you should never startle a sleeping elephant. You should make a gentle sound, and let it wake up first, and you should never approach an elephant from behind or straight ahead of it. Their vision is poor and they are happier if you approach from the front but to one side, so they clearly see you coming.I am delighted to see that towards the end of the book, she discusses the evidence that humans co-evolved with wolves, in other words that we changed them and they changed us. This is something that I have long believed. Dog and human bones have been found in burials dating back 14,000 years, so some archaeologists concluded that domestication of dogs too place then. But Robert Wayne and his team at UCLA examined through DNA testing found that dogs started to diverge from wolves about 135,000 years ago. He suggest, and Temple and I agree with him, that proto humans, wolves that were slowly becoming dogs, were developing together, and were already closely associated. Many finds of wolf bones and humans bones together,date from more than 100,000 years ago.This suggests that they were associating at a time when homo sapiens were just evolving from homo erectus. This means they had few tools, were perhaps pre linguistic. The wolves with their superior sense of smell and superior pack based hunting skills, probably taught the proto humans the value of cooperation with them and with each other. Grandin argues that human social structures resembles that of wolves, more closely that that of primates. Even stronger evidence is that fact that the mid-brain of humans, which handles sensory data, including scenting smell, shrank over 10,000 years ago, while the fore-brain which handles language, reasoning and planning skills remained the same. The suggestion is that many of the mid brain functions of humans were not needed so much because the dogs were handling that side of things. The camp dogs were scenting, hearing and identifying prey and dangerous threats, for the humans, so the human brain was free to specialise and organise, develop language and cultural skills. Grandin suggest that this is probably why homo sapiens were able to flourish, while Neanderthals with similar brains to humans, did not, because they were not cooperating with wolves or proto dogs.I think this evidence may well explain why so many humans, including me, have such a strong affinity with dogs, and wolves. We are ancient companions.Interested readers can find out more about my experiences with dogs, elephants and other animals, in my book: OF MICE & ZEN.ANIMAL ENCOUNTERS IN THE LIFE OF A WANDERING BUDDHIST (free samples of Goodreads and Amazon).As I have made clear, I greatly appreciated this book. One important detail on which I disagree with her, is on the use of shock collars and invisible electric fences on dogs who chase joggers and cyclists, or dogs who roam. She advocates these as necessary to prevent these problems. I disagree. Such devices often traumatize dogs and can cause the dog to get injured. One unfortunate collie was so traumatized by the shock fence, that she would never leave the house and started pooping on the floor. These devices are barbaric if used by careless, inexperienced people, and they are not necessary. I have trained many dogs not to chase people, vehicles, or livestock and not to run off, without recourse to such devices. It just takes more time and effort on the part of the trainer. You have to be able to bond with, and communicate with the dog, to predict its behaviour, and intervene then. Anyone resorting to these electric shock devices is simply evading that responsibility. I think this issue is one where Temple Grandin's background in livestock management works against her. There, the use of electric devices is seen as normal, but in dog care ? Surely not acceptable."
171,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15704502-colleen,5,"I wasn't able to read this book in one setting or even 2 settings and, maybe, that's a good thing because then I took the time to reflect on the way humans do things and why. It's intriguing to compare how Temple and I relate to animals and to reflect upon our differing realities. I shall reflect upon the following statement for a long time: ""Normal people can't see all those little changes without a lot of training and effort, because their brains process them unconsciously. So normal people are drawing what they ""see,"" which is the finished object, after their brains have put it all together. It's ironic that we always say autistic children are in their own little world because if Dr. Snyder is right it's normal people who are living inside their heads. Autistic people are experiencing the actual world much more directly and accurately than non-autistic people, with all their inattentional blindness, change blindness, and their every-other-kind-of blindness."" I was drawn to this book because I'm a born animal lover and because I have much curiosity about the natural world. I gained much perspective from Temple's book in regards to the how and way animals relate to world, but also gained a deeper understanding of the inner workings of human brain. Book initiated much reflection upon some of my preconceived assumptions of intelligence and those reflections definitely re-configured my understanding to include the many different types of animal geniuses.Because of how Temple described her reality, I have rearranged my assumed perceptions of what is the correct way to view the world; and I have adopted a better understanding of, and respect for, the autistic point of view. Temple's story reminds me to not be so quick to assume that my way is the right way. In regards to my life as an educator, I've gleaned more understanding of autistic children. I interacted with autistic children during my career, and those experiences caused me to assume that autistic children needed to interact with environment in a way that was quite rigid. After reading this book, I wouldn't describe my experiences with autistic children in quite that way. Now, I know that it wasn't so much that they were always trying to say their way was the right way, but, rather, that they just couldn't ""see"" things my way---and I couldn't see things their way. So, I don't think this book is about what's the right way or the wrong way to see the world; but, rather, the takeaway message is that human reality is affected by brain function, human experience, emotion, and context. It is highly valuable for all of us to share our realities of the world---and highly valuable for us to listen to the realities of others. I recommend this book for everyone. Another important take away is that most of us don't take the time to think about why we do things the way we do because that would just take too much time and be inefficient; but, oftentimes, it would be helpful and useful to reflect upon how and why we do things differently so we can compare our actions and results for the purpose of getting deeper understanding of alternate views. Since non-autistic people don't feel compelled to evaluate or alter their ""normal"" way of doing things (because those ways are an accepted way), it is likely non-autistic people also don't see the full ramification of doing some things in the ""normal"" way. On the other hand, the autistic person trying to cope with the majority viewpoint is compelled to do some analysis and evaluation in order to cope with the most-accepted standards of thinking and behavior imposed upon them. Temple describes many situations in which her non-standard thinking actually resulted in actions that were more acceptable to animals. She offers numerous stories on how the non-autistic person can learn from the autistic person about better ways of doing things by exploring alternative viewpoints and evaluating their assumptions about reality. Temple explains---in a nonjudgmental way---that the autistic view of the world is another reality, and that the autistic and non-autistic brain function differently resulting in some specific and differing autistic and non-autistic viewpoints and actions. Most enlightening to me is that the autistic reality offers the non-autistic person a window through which they can view their ""normal"" perceptions, actions, and viewpoints. Temple offers an alternative view of the non-autistic person's reality, which in the case of livestock management, encouraged humans to handle animals more humanely and more efficiently.This story has stirred in me the desire to reflect upon the assumptions I make about the BEST way to be with animals, and also has changed my view of autism. It's awesome when anyone, who resides a bit out of the norm, shares their story because we are reminded that change is good, that evaluation of our actions is important, and that the norm is only a norm for a short moment in time. I don't view autism negatively; but, rather, appreciate the autistic genius for seeing in pictures and noticing details that my brain ignores. Temple's story has encouraged me tap into the ignored realities of my daily existence."
172,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7729729-alison,2,"Temple Grandin is a huge name in animal welfare. Or, she was. She contributed amazingly to the field, but this book is definitely a product of its time.I couldn't finish it. Some of the anecdotes were interesting, but a lot of the information itself was outdated. Dominance theory hasn't been taken seriously in the animal world for some years now and this was the main theory of her book. The parts about how animal brains work and how she related it to her experience as an autistic woman were really interesting, but after the chapters on how you have to show pigs and horses and dogs who's boss I'm left wondering how much of the rest of it is out of date and considered ridiculous in 2019 by brain...scientists? I wonder how much of it even Ms. Grandin would still stand by.Even back when it was considered cutting edge, there were certain things that would have bothered me. She mashed personal opinion with scientific evidence with abandon. There was a lot of speculation, a lot of ""No one has done any studies on this specifically, but I bet that..."" which is not what I'm looking for in an educational read. I think that when you're writing from such a position of authority it's irresponsible to throw your opinion around like it's fact. It also didn't have the circumspection I've come to expect in pop science books. The first few chapters focusing on the basics of the field and disclaiming on how their results aren't necessarily definitive, how narrow the case study was, how new research is coming out, etc. I'm gonna be honest, I love that part. It was a little disappointing for it to be missing in one of the first books I've been able to read about my own field.From a writing standpoint, it was pretty awful. She's very ""write how you talk"" which makes it easy to follow, but it must take decades to have a conversation with her with the way she's constantly inserting irrelevant facts and stories. If she wants to write a memoir that's fine, but this book was supposed to be about a specific topic and she apparently had no editor to ask if paragraphs or entire pages were actually contributing to her point. This book could have been like 150 pages and been complete. I'm sorry Ms. Grandin but I'm not reading a book about animal behavior to find out how the government would be so much better if everyone just thought like you did.I did make it an admirable halfway through before giving up. I just have more valuable things to read with my time. If you're looking for a meaningful read about animal behavior, pick up something shorter that was written in the past couple of years."
173,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91724581-carol-aguilar,3,"	I read the book Animals In Translation. I discovered this book because it was in the no AR section and it caught my attention because it had the word Animals in it. I enjoyed the book in some parts and in some parts I didn't. In some parts it even made me angry.	The book was really good because Temple Grandin did a great way of explaining. I learned things about autism that I didn't know. I also really learned things about the brain.She really made sure you knew what autism is and how people with and without autism act and react, before saying how animals and people with autism have a connection and can help each other. She also explained a lot of things that were not related to autism. For example when she was talking about the behavior of humans and animals and that anthropomorphizing a animal is the worst thing you can do it really got me thinking. Do I anthropomorphize my pets and other animals. Is it dangerous if I do it? She also really explained that animals do and will feel emotion. She gave many examples of this for example the cats helping each other out during a delivery of a baby or saying the cows feel emotion when they are separated from their young. Even though they already “reached” a age in which they won't miss their young. This is where I start to not like the book. 	 What I didn't like was that Temple Grandin was saying all these great things about animals for example saying that humans and animals have different brain but also awfully a lot in common, saying how cows can be just like a dog and play just like one,and even saying how they can be a great companion for people with autism. But yet she talks about animals being used in labs and being tested on and even being used in her” humane” squeezing chute and humane ways to hand a animal going or getting ready for slaughter. It was very conflicting. It's like saying you love animals yet you still eat them. Or saying your against rape yet you eat dairy products.	 I think someone who would enjoy this book is anyone that is interested between the connection of animals with people with autism and even with people without it. Anyone also ready to read a book with a lot of information about the connection of humans and animals should read it."
174,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91381557-trey-hall,4,"Reading this fascinating collection of scientific experiments and phenomenological wonderings about animals' feelings, consciousness, and language was like trying to watch all at once the movements of a vast mobile on a windy balcony: you can sense that the different beauties, velocities, and fluctuations of all the pieces are connected, but your mind simply can't map the connections: in a way that leads to grandeur and awe, and occasionally to frustration at your perceptual limits.As a starting point, the author reflects on her own autism - and part of autistic perception, in general - as potentially similar to non-human animal patterns of perception and understanding. [I acknowledge this idea could be understandably offensive to some. Grandin writes in a full-on style and makes no apologies. Whether the science is far-out there or not, I'm not educated enough to say, but I found it compelling]. For example, she suggests that animals (whom she studies and loves) might share the same ""hyper-specific intelligence"" (not conceptual; not organizing the raw data perceived into any representative, and often smoothed-out, whole or schema; but seeing the minutiae of component parts without organizing them) and ""mental image language"" (thinking not in words or concepts but in pictures) that autistic people frequently describe having. From there she spends most of the book imagining what the multiple intelligences and emotional lives of animals might be like. I learned so much reading this book, but beyond learning, I experienced an increased sense of compassion for, friendship with, and sincere regard and love for animals, whose fear- and thought- and pain- and love- and joy-worlds, I'm convinced, are much more more dynamic, complex, and psychologically variegated than many scientists in particular and people in general think or allow themselves to think.For me, this expanding awareness raises serious ethical questions, to be sure - and I'm already a pescatarian - but more than that, it invites me into a deeper participation in my/our essential communion with all creatures, in the way I try to see, the way I pray, etc."
175,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44661992-michael,3,"My first thoughts about this book were: I wonder if I can get a refund from Colorado State University for the hundreds of dollars worth of tuition money I spent in Vet school for the privilege of listening to Temple Grandin present the exact same material as contained in this book. Given that in book form I was better able to concentrate on the material without being distracted by the author’s autistic mannerisms, I preferred the book form. Given that I checked the book out for free at the library I feel that I way overpaid in school.Temple Grandin is an interesting character, she is perhaps the most famous autistic person alive today. She believes that her autism causes her to think like a cow, and many view her as some sort of animal behavior autistic savant. I find these claims dubious at best. She does have a decent understanding of animal behavior, but has spent years studying it. It doesn’t sound as if it came naturally to her. As she tells a story of when she was young she couldn’t tell small dogs apart from cats because they were the same size. I think this shows that she wasn’t born with some innate understanding of animals, but actually started further behind most people. I believe she has worked hard to gain her understanding.One of my biggest problems with the book is that she spouts off old wives tales, stereotypes, anecdotal evidence, and her own untested theories as if they were all fact.She is fond of telling how she likes to lay down in the middle of a pen of cattle, and allow them come up and lick her. Yet I have been unable to grasp what insights she has gleaned by doing this. Being an individual who spends most of my time in cattle pens, I just keep thinking that is a disgusting place to lay down.With that said I must admit that despite her autism or perhaps because of it she has managed to turn her interest in animal behavior into a successful career. Additionally if my clients all had cattle handling facilities designed by her, and followed her principals it would make my life much easier."
176,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1300439-paula,2,"Like Temple Grandin, I believe that animals are more intelligent than we have given them credit for. I've read studies of crows, gray parrots, octopus, and ground squirrels in particular that reveal some amazing capabilities including strategizing, language, and tool making. So, I came into this text prepared. Grandin's comparisons between the capabilities, and limitations of autistic people with that of animals was interesting. Her understanding of ""normals"" was less impressive. Many of her claims about autistic people has more to do with intelligence than autism. For example, she claims autistic people are more observant than normal people. Whether this is true overall is speculative. I believe that intelligent people are more observant, and her claims to being hyper observant have as much to do with her intelligence as with her condition. She doesn't seem to separate the two at all. Autistic people have as broad a range of intelligence as normal people do. Yet, she doesn't parse out those traits that depend upon intelligence from those that depend upon an aberrant condition. She also claims that she has a particular insight into animal behavior and feelings that normal people cannot understand. This is also pure speculation. She deals mainly with ranchers, stockyard and slaughterhouse workers. These people have strong reason to believe that animals are less intelligent and less feeling than is likely the case. They do not represent all ""normals"". There are a great many normal animal trainers, and even pet owners who have great insight into the minds and feelings of animals. You don't have to be autistic to see that animals have feelings, and thoughts. You just have to care about animals, and not care about how much money you'll lose if the cattle keep getting injured. Her attitude toward veganism also shows a lack of understanding. She obviously did not study even the most rudimentary nutrition studies when she did her brief experiment in giving up meat. Watch The Game Changers if you think that eating vegan can leave anyone feeling weak! "
177,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2410849-juliet-wilson,4,"Subtitled 'the woman who thinks like a cow' this is a fascinating book about animal behaviour. Temple Grandin has autism and has used her different way of seeing the world as a way into understanding animals.Temple Grandin is an associate professor of animal science at Colorado State University. She has worked in the meat processing industry, helping to make slaughter houses more humane. As a vegetarian I didn't find this part of the book the easiest to read, but I have to admit that so many people are meat eaters who will never give up eating meat that it is vital that slaughter houses are made more humane. Also it is fascinating to read how the author thinks her way into the cow's mind, how it perceives the world and how it can be made to feel calmer and less threatened.The rest of the book looks at all kinds of animals, how they learn and how they relate to humans and whether the ways in which animals communicate can be considered to be true language, including the story of Alex the parrot, who seemed to be able to genuinely communicate and learn quicker than his owners and trainers expected . She outlines what makes dogs so good at being helper animals (particularly their sense of smell!) and how best to train dogs to increase their chances of growing up into well behaved, calm pets or working dogs (and she's a great believer in dogs working to give them a purpose in life!). The author constantly compares her own way of thinking as a person with autism to the way that animals think.All in all this is a fascinating book, whether your main interest is in autism in humans or in animal behaviour."

It was a case of the bad becoming normal, and it's a big danger in selective breeding programs.

Being close to animals brings some of it back.”Temple Grandin address two topics in this book: animals and autism. The connection between the two is far closer then I would have imagined. But by using her autistic mind, Grandin is able to understand animals in a way many people do not (or have to be trained to). As someone finding out late in life that they have Aspergers, her revelations on autism and autistic brains was eye-opening and affirming. Her ideas and research into animal behaviour and language are equally illuminating. I’m curious to know what we’ve learned about animal intelligence 15 years later. I suspect I’ll be reading more on this topic in future. There are a few moments in the book that show its age. Grandin uses ‘retarded’ several times, which I imagine was not seen as a slur 15 years back. And while she does so with no malice or condensation, for a modern reader it can be rather jarring. Additionally, there are a few stories of very severe animal abuse. Grandin uses these stories to argue in favour of animal welfare, but they are still quiet disturbing to read. These are things I feel is important for people to know going into a book that I can otherwise heartily recommend. Grandson’s love and fascination of animals is present in every page, and her work in increasing animal welfare in the meat industry was huge. If either topic is of interest to you, this book is worth your time.  "

It basically just describes a whole bunch of cool ways that animal brains work, with a healthy bit of info on how normal and autistic human brains work, too. Full of illustrative stories and experiments. As I was reading this book, I couldn't stop rambling on about everything in it to M. If you are interested in How Brains Work (and you have to know by now that I'm OBSESSED with the topic), I seriously recommend that you read this book. Now. Quick warning: It does contain quite a lot of stories about slaughterhouses, which was difficult for me to read at times. I much preferred when she talked about animal behavior that wasn't related to feed lots, etc. But despite that, I still loved this book and want to share all the facts from it with everyone I know. I wish I'd taken notes. Yes, I'm a nerd."
181,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/861650-laura,3,"I expected a little more from this book, after hearing about it constantly for several years in animal circles. When comparing thought processes and perception in animals and autistic people, Grandin provides some interesting insights in our dealings with animals. A good deal of this, however, is not as new or groundbreaking as she seems to feel it is, given anyone who has worked closely with animals for a time will come to the same realizations of what they see. When covering behavioral conepts in general, she tends not to distinguish between what are generally regarded as facts or hard theories, and what are individuals' hypotheses and pet theories. She simply chooses what she likes and presents it all as straight fact, which I find rather irritating and somewhat irresponsible coming from a PhD. Her anecdotes and examples are fascinating, but I'd suggest taking her renditions of them somewhat lightly and going to the original literature for more accurate accounts. "
182,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/766968-tami,5,"Animals in Translation is an amazing book. This book states that by looking at human autism, we can better under animals, the way they think, the way they behave, and how they see the world. The author is an animal scientist who works primarily with slaughter houses. She is also autistic. Before reading this book, I had very little comprehension about the way that autistic people see the world. I simply had no idea that seeing the world in a visual way was that much different than the way that I think. I now see that this different way of thinking has a lot of really interesting benefits, particularly when it comes to understanding other visual thinkers like the animals around us. As I read this book, I started to comprehend how much detail in life we normally ignore. So much of what we need to understand animals is simply looking at life from their perspective, both literally and figuratively speaking."

Grandin's synthesis of how human and animal brains works is by far the most compelling one I've read so far (and I've read a few!). Her anecdotes are truly fascinating (elephants that communicate over miles by beating on the ground! dogs that can detect human seizures long before they occur! dolphins that kill porpoises just for kicks!) and fodder for a lifetime of cocktail party conversations. But more vital is the synthetic whole she makes out of her work on animal behavior and her own autism, which is at once disarming and compelling. In the end, Gradin's frankness, honesty, and willingness to acknowledge the limitations of her knowledge makes her generalizations about minds, behavior, and evolution far more compelling than many of the more popular writers on the brain. This little book should be read by anyone who cares about animals, and/or anyone cares about how the mind works."

While reading this book, the reader realizes that often many people with autism have unique abilities that the rest of us can only dream of.i highly recommend this book; it is incredibly insightful. i found myself repeatedly finding such logic in Grandin's wisdom that just made such sense."

Unfortunately, kids will be forced to read some waste of time book in high school like Billy Bud or Romeo and Juliet when there are awesome thought provoking books like this. It was fascinating to feel the basic accessibility of this book instead of the normal, overly-verbose, academic prose that would fill this type of book. I wonder how much of the writing was done by Temple and how much by the co-author. Being autistic, is it even possible for Temple to write an entire book by herself? I have way too many questions now, but that's the whole point to a good science book."

She also writes of noticing a lot of details that normal people don't--but that animals do. I found the book interesting not only for what it had to say about animal behavior but also for what Grandin had to say about her own autism. However, I found the book repetitive and grew tired of it 3/4 of the way through, so I just skimmed the rest. This is a book that has been in my TBR stack for some time and which I've attempted to read in the past, and just never finished, though I sort of wanted to. This time I'm giving up. "

Her book is thought provoking and loaded with personal stories from her vast experience with dogs, horses cows, pigs and chickens.

I will no longer have the disdain for crows I have previously felt--they are really quite intelligent(though I may still find them a little creepy in large groups). The author, who is autistic has long had a special connection to animals and is now an expert on animal behavior. She describes animals in many different ways from their feelings to their thoughts(and gives amazing evidence about language abilities). Dogs and cows are probably discussed the most, but other animals are also included. Really fascinating details that help me understand our neurotic dog in a whole new way."

Like others have pointed out, this is just a collection of anecdotes and personal beliefs rather than animal science. Not sure if the lack of citations are on purpose but she should know better.What bothered me the most was how she tried to pass beliefs as fact even at times when it's clear she knows nothing about the subject in question.This was my first Temple Grandin book, now I doubt I'll read anything else by her."

It makes neuroscience accessible and gives us insight into the autistic mind in the way a non-autistic author never could. I'm a vegetarian and thought I might hate that she works for slaughterhouses, but I know that people are not going to give up meat and anything that makes it more humane is commendable."

200,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19143066-stewart-mcfarlane,5,"This is fascinating book on animal behaviour written by Temple Grandin, a remarkable woman, who lectures all over the world on animal welfare, especially livestock, and on the nature of autism. The book is co-authored by Catherine Johnson, a mother of two children with autism.Temple Grandin is an associate professor of animal science at Colorado State University. She courageously went public about her diagnosis of autism. She also has an international reputation in the meat-packing industry, for her ground-breaking designs of humane cattle-handling equipment, techniques, and setting standards of good practice in handling animals.Grandin has two main aims in this book. She aims to show how problems in animal behaviour can be resolved by understanding the causes of the behaviour. To this end, she has analysed livestock behaviour down to its smallest details, so that she can predict what an animal will do. She has extensive experience in being called in to trouble-shoot difficult behaviour in domestic and agricultural animals, including cattle,pigs, dogs and horses. She has synthesized the knowledge of animal breeders, trainers and ethologists, into rules and practical advice on how to manage difficult animals.Her second aim is to develop a new theory of autism. She argues that the autistic mind is closer to the animal mind than it is to the typical human mind, when it comes to perception of detail. This opens the possibility of new ways of understanding autism. There are autistic ""savants"" who can identify a prime number with uncanny speed, or can perform complex calculations faster than a computer.. In all of these instances, the individual has systematized a mathematical system. Grandin extends her understanding to living creatures.Grandin has tried to systematize animal behavior. She starts from the animal's perspective and asks; what kinds of stimuli might make an animal frightened? What kinds of stimuli might make an animal aggressive? What do we know about the neuroscience of animal drives that might help us predict its behaviour? Grandin's analysis of animal behaviour results in her understanding it to the point of being able to predict it, and to remedy faults and problems.Here are some examples of how slight changes in an animal's environment can produce strong, often alarming reactions. Changes in lighting from outside to inside building can frighten cattle and pigs. Pools of water can frighten them when caught in the light. Flapping objects such as coats or rags near where they have to walk can really scare them.Unfamiliar noises from generators etc can unnerve them and cause panic.As a dog trainer and elephant handler, I realise the importance of knowing your animal and trying to see things they way that the animal does. I have learned to read the body language of my dogs, so as to predict their behavior. Their running action when hunting squirrels is totally different from that when they have the scent of a bitch in season. My German Shepherd has a fast purposeful trot with his head up when he is planning the pursuit of an interesting female dog. He also stops looking around for me, because at that time I have temporarily ceased to exist for him, so if I want to stop him, I know I have to act fast with a stop command. If I know the bitch is friendly to him, I usually just let him get on with it and re-call him when his curiousity and/or lust is satisfied. I know one elephant in Chiang Mai Province who is terrified of small white birds, if they are feeding on the ground in a flock. She gets nervous and simply will not proceed past the birds. I just let her back up and find another route, or I dismount, leave her at a safe distance, and scare the birds off for her. She doesn't mind them at all if they are perched in the trees. She was probably startled by a flock of these birds when she was young.Many animal trainers and animal problem solvers such as Cesar Millan, who often deals with dog phobias, are aware of the importance of close observation and trying to see things the way the animal sees them. Grandin goes further in trying to systematize this knowledge. She has also examined the causes of aggression in domestic animals such as horses or dogs, and developed a set of rules. If a stallion is kept locked up and deprived of the opportunity to learn to socialise, it will be very aggressive to other stallions, and will try to rape mares. If a dog is not properly socialised with other dogs and people outside its family, it may well be aggressive, through fear. Or if it is allowed to be too dominant and intimidate its human family, then it may be aggressive to them. If it knows its place in the family, and is given clear boundaries, it will be contented and not cause such problems.Finally, she has examined animal breeding. If you cross a fast-growing rooster with a fast-growing hen, you get fast-growing chickens. But she identifies that such single-characteristic genetic breeding programmes always come with a down-side. The fast-growing offspring also have weak hearts, for example. If you cross fast-growing chickens with those selected for their strength, you get long-lived, fast-growing chickens, but they are monstrously aggressive. I think some of the accounts of the mistakes and cruelties inflicted on livestock here will cause more people to question the ethics of the whole process of commercial meat production, however well managed. In my view that is a good thing.Some readers may be shocked that Temple Grandin is saying that autistic people are more similar to animal than normal people. Isn't this suggesting that autistic people are subhuman? In fact, Grandin's claim is that animals have superior perception of detail, and so do people with autism. So, far from offending people with autism, she is if anything suggesting that non-autistic people have less sharp perception. In a way she is saying that it is the ""normal"" people who are handicapped, because they miss all this detail, and make many mistakes when trying to remember events. We know that this is the case from ""eye-witness"" testimony, which often turns out to be unreliable , because our brains construct memories, make assumptions, and change details and sequences, often in the very process of recalling them. She links the two themes of her book by arguing that a person with autism will have a greater affinity for animals than will a person without autism, because the same sorts of unexpected changes like flickering lights, or sudden small movements or sounds that might startle an animal, might also startle a person with autism. She goes further to argue that understanding animal perception might help us understand autistic perception.Getting back to the elephant example, Grandin mentions the fact that they use infrasonic (low rumbles) to communicate and possibly even seismic communication (ground vibrations) to send messages to their family members across distances as great as 25 miles. Elephants when distress, slam their trunks on the ground. The elephant I know with the white bird phobia does this if the birds get too near her. I agree with Temple here, that the elephant is communicating her distress to other elephants. In fact elephants do a whole range of things with their prehensile trunks. They explore their environment, comfort each other, pick up food and objects such as sticks to scratch with. Elephants normally sleep standing up, and often with their eyes open. You know when an elephant is asleep because its trunk is totally relaxed and resting on the ground at the tip. This is important because you should never startle a sleeping elephant. You should make a gentle sound, and let it wake up first, and you should never approach an elephant from behind or straight ahead of it. Their vision is poor and they are happier if you approach from the front but to one side, so they clearly see you coming.I am delighted to see that towards the end of the book, she discusses the evidence that humans co-evolved with wolves, in other words that we changed them and they changed us. This is something that I have long believed. Dog and human bones have been found in burials dating back 14,000 years, so some archaeologists concluded that domestication of dogs too place then. But Robert Wayne and his team at UCLA examined through DNA testing found that dogs started to diverge from wolves about 135,000 years ago. He suggest, and Temple and I agree with him, that proto humans, wolves that were slowly becoming dogs, were developing together, and were already closely associated. Many finds of wolf bones and humans bones together,date from more than 100,000 years ago.This suggests that they were associating at a time when homo sapiens were just evolving from homo erectus. This means they had few tools, were perhaps pre linguistic. The wolves with their superior sense of smell and superior pack based hunting skills, probably taught the proto humans the value of cooperation with them and with each other. Grandin argues that human social structures resembles that of wolves, more closely that that of primates. Even stronger evidence is that fact that the mid-brain of humans, which handles sensory data, including scenting smell, shrank over 10,000 years ago, while the fore-brain which handles language, reasoning and planning skills remained the same. The suggestion is that many of the mid brain functions of humans were not needed so much because the dogs were handling that side of things. The camp dogs were scenting, hearing and identifying prey and dangerous threats, for the humans, so the human brain was free to specialise and organise, develop language and cultural skills. Grandin suggest that this is probably why homo sapiens were able to flourish, while Neanderthals with similar brains to humans, did not, because they were not cooperating with wolves or proto dogs.I think this evidence may well explain why so many humans, including me, have such a strong affinity with dogs, and wolves. We are ancient companions.Interested readers can find out more about my experiences with dogs, elephants and other animals, in my book: OF MICE & ZEN.ANIMAL ENCOUNTERS IN THE LIFE OF A WANDERING BUDDHIST (free samples of Goodreads and Amazon).As I have made clear, I greatly appreciated this book. One important detail on which I disagree with her, is on the use of shock collars and invisible electric fences on dogs who chase joggers and cyclists, or dogs who roam. She advocates these as necessary to prevent these problems. I disagree. Such devices often traumatize dogs and can cause the dog to get injured. One unfortunate collie was so traumatized by the shock fence, that she would never leave the house and started pooping on the floor. These devices are barbaric if used by careless, inexperienced people, and they are not necessary. I have trained many dogs not to chase people, vehicles, or livestock and not to run off, without recourse to such devices. It just takes more time and effort on the part of the trainer. You have to be able to bond with, and communicate with the dog, to predict its behaviour, and intervene then. Anyone resorting to these electric shock devices is simply evading that responsibility. I think this issue is one where Temple Grandin's background in livestock management works against her. There, the use of electric devices is seen as normal, but in dog care ? Surely not acceptable."
201,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15704502-colleen,5,"I wasn't able to read this book in one setting or even 2 settings and, maybe, that's a good thing because then I took the time to reflect on the way humans do things and why. It's intriguing to compare how Temple and I relate to animals and to reflect upon our differing realities. I shall reflect upon the following statement for a long time: ""Normal people can't see all those little changes without a lot of training and effort, because their brains process them unconsciously. So normal people are drawing what they ""see,"" which is the finished object, after their brains have put it all together. It's ironic that we always say autistic children are in their own little world because if Dr. Snyder is right it's normal people who are living inside their heads. Autistic people are experiencing the actual world much more directly and accurately than non-autistic people, with all their inattentional blindness, change blindness, and their every-other-kind-of blindness."" I was drawn to this book because I'm a born animal lover and because I have much curiosity about the natural world. I gained much perspective from Temple's book in regards to the how and way animals relate to world, but also gained a deeper understanding of the inner workings of human brain. Book initiated much reflection upon some of my preconceived assumptions of intelligence and those reflections definitely re-configured my understanding to include the many different types of animal geniuses.Because of how Temple described her reality, I have rearranged my assumed perceptions of what is the correct way to view the world; and I have adopted a better understanding of, and respect for, the autistic point of view. Temple's story reminds me to not be so quick to assume that my way is the right way. In regards to my life as an educator, I've gleaned more understanding of autistic children. I interacted with autistic children during my career, and those experiences caused me to assume that autistic children needed to interact with environment in a way that was quite rigid. After reading this book, I wouldn't describe my experiences with autistic children in quite that way. Now, I know that it wasn't so much that they were always trying to say their way was the right way, but, rather, that they just couldn't ""see"" things my way---and I couldn't see things their way. So, I don't think this book is about what's the right way or the wrong way to see the world; but, rather, the takeaway message is that human reality is affected by brain function, human experience, emotion, and context. It is highly valuable for all of us to share our realities of the world---and highly valuable for us to listen to the realities of others. I recommend this book for everyone. Another important take away is that most of us don't take the time to think about why we do things the way we do because that would just take too much time and be inefficient; but, oftentimes, it would be helpful and useful to reflect upon how and why we do things differently so we can compare our actions and results for the purpose of getting deeper understanding of alternate views. Since non-autistic people don't feel compelled to evaluate or alter their ""normal"" way of doing things (because those ways are an accepted way), it is likely non-autistic people also don't see the full ramification of doing some things in the ""normal"" way. On the other hand, the autistic person trying to cope with the majority viewpoint is compelled to do some analysis and evaluation in order to cope with the most-accepted standards of thinking and behavior imposed upon them. Temple describes many situations in which her non-standard thinking actually resulted in actions that were more acceptable to animals. She offers numerous stories on how the non-autistic person can learn from the autistic person about better ways of doing things by exploring alternative viewpoints and evaluating their assumptions about reality. Temple explains---in a nonjudgmental way---that the autistic view of the world is another reality, and that the autistic and non-autistic brain function differently resulting in some specific and differing autistic and non-autistic viewpoints and actions. Most enlightening to me is that the autistic reality offers the non-autistic person a window through which they can view their ""normal"" perceptions, actions, and viewpoints. Temple offers an alternative view of the non-autistic person's reality, which in the case of livestock management, encouraged humans to handle animals more humanely and more efficiently.This story has stirred in me the desire to reflect upon the assumptions I make about the BEST way to be with animals, and also has changed my view of autism. It's awesome when anyone, who resides a bit out of the norm, shares their story because we are reminded that change is good, that evaluation of our actions is important, and that the norm is only a norm for a short moment in time. I don't view autism negatively; but, rather, appreciate the autistic genius for seeing in pictures and noticing details that my brain ignores. Temple's story has encouraged me tap into the ignored realities of my daily existence."
202,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7729729-alison,2,"Temple Grandin is a huge name in animal welfare. Or, she was. She contributed amazingly to the field, but this book is definitely a product of its time.I couldn't finish it. Some of the anecdotes were interesting, but a lot of the information itself was outdated. Dominance theory hasn't been taken seriously in the animal world for some years now and this was the main theory of her book. The parts about how animal brains work and how she related it to her experience as an autistic woman were really interesting, but after the chapters on how you have to show pigs and horses and dogs who's boss I'm left wondering how much of the rest of it is out of date and considered ridiculous in 2019 by brain...scientists? I wonder how much of it even Ms. Grandin would still stand by.Even back when it was considered cutting edge, there were certain things that would have bothered me. She mashed personal opinion with scientific evidence with abandon. There was a lot of speculation, a lot of ""No one has done any studies on this specifically, but I bet that..."" which is not what I'm looking for in an educational read. I think that when you're writing from such a position of authority it's irresponsible to throw your opinion around like it's fact. It also didn't have the circumspection I've come to expect in pop science books. The first few chapters focusing on the basics of the field and disclaiming on how their results aren't necessarily definitive, how narrow the case study was, how new research is coming out, etc. I'm gonna be honest, I love that part. It was a little disappointing for it to be missing in one of the first books I've been able to read about my own field.From a writing standpoint, it was pretty awful. She's very ""write how you talk"" which makes it easy to follow, but it must take decades to have a conversation with her with the way she's constantly inserting irrelevant facts and stories. If she wants to write a memoir that's fine, but this book was supposed to be about a specific topic and she apparently had no editor to ask if paragraphs or entire pages were actually contributing to her point. This book could have been like 150 pages and been complete. I'm sorry Ms. Grandin but I'm not reading a book about animal behavior to find out how the government would be so much better if everyone just thought like you did.I did make it an admirable halfway through before giving up. I just have more valuable things to read with my time. If you're looking for a meaningful read about animal behavior, pick up something shorter that was written in the past couple of years."
203,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91724581-carol-aguilar,3,"	I read the book Animals In Translation. I discovered this book because it was in the no AR section and it caught my attention because it had the word Animals in it. I enjoyed the book in some parts and in some parts I didn't. In some parts it even made me angry.	The book was really good because Temple Grandin did a great way of explaining. I learned things about autism that I didn't know. I also really learned things about the brain.She really made sure you knew what autism is and how people with and without autism act and react, before saying how animals and people with autism have a connection and can help each other. She also explained a lot of things that were not related to autism. For example when she was talking about the behavior of humans and animals and that anthropomorphizing a animal is the worst thing you can do it really got me thinking. Do I anthropomorphize my pets and other animals. Is it dangerous if I do it? She also really explained that animals do and will feel emotion. She gave many examples of this for example the cats helping each other out during a delivery of a baby or saying the cows feel emotion when they are separated from their young. Even though they already “reached” a age in which they won't miss their young. This is where I start to not like the book. 	 What I didn't like was that Temple Grandin was saying all these great things about animals for example saying that humans and animals have different brain but also awfully a lot in common, saying how cows can be just like a dog and play just like one,and even saying how they can be a great companion for people with autism. But yet she talks about animals being used in labs and being tested on and even being used in her” humane” squeezing chute and humane ways to hand a animal going or getting ready for slaughter. It was very conflicting. It's like saying you love animals yet you still eat them. Or saying your against rape yet you eat dairy products.	 I think someone who would enjoy this book is anyone that is interested between the connection of animals with people with autism and even with people without it. Anyone also ready to read a book with a lot of information about the connection of humans and animals should read it."
204,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91381557-trey-hall,4,"Reading this fascinating collection of scientific experiments and phenomenological wonderings about animals' feelings, consciousness, and language was like trying to watch all at once the movements of a vast mobile on a windy balcony: you can sense that the different beauties, velocities, and fluctuations of all the pieces are connected, but your mind simply can't map the connections: in a way that leads to grandeur and awe, and occasionally to frustration at your perceptual limits.As a starting point, the author reflects on her own autism - and part of autistic perception, in general - as potentially similar to non-human animal patterns of perception and understanding. [I acknowledge this idea could be understandably offensive to some. Grandin writes in a full-on style and makes no apologies. Whether the science is far-out there or not, I'm not educated enough to say, but I found it compelling]. For example, she suggests that animals (whom she studies and loves) might share the same ""hyper-specific intelligence"" (not conceptual; not organizing the raw data perceived into any representative, and often smoothed-out, whole or schema; but seeing the minutiae of component parts without organizing them) and ""mental image language"" (thinking not in words or concepts but in pictures) that autistic people frequently describe having. From there she spends most of the book imagining what the multiple intelligences and emotional lives of animals might be like. I learned so much reading this book, but beyond learning, I experienced an increased sense of compassion for, friendship with, and sincere regard and love for animals, whose fear- and thought- and pain- and love- and joy-worlds, I'm convinced, are much more more dynamic, complex, and psychologically variegated than many scientists in particular and people in general think or allow themselves to think.For me, this expanding awareness raises serious ethical questions, to be sure - and I'm already a pescatarian - but more than that, it invites me into a deeper participation in my/our essential communion with all creatures, in the way I try to see, the way I pray, etc."
205,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44661992-michael,3,"My first thoughts about this book were: I wonder if I can get a refund from Colorado State University for the hundreds of dollars worth of tuition money I spent in Vet school for the privilege of listening to Temple Grandin present the exact same material as contained in this book. Given that in book form I was better able to concentrate on the material without being distracted by the author’s autistic mannerisms, I preferred the book form. Given that I checked the book out for free at the library I feel that I way overpaid in school.Temple Grandin is an interesting character, she is perhaps the most famous autistic person alive today. She believes that her autism causes her to think like a cow, and many view her as some sort of animal behavior autistic savant. I find these claims dubious at best. She does have a decent understanding of animal behavior, but has spent years studying it. It doesn’t sound as if it came naturally to her. As she tells a story of when she was young she couldn’t tell small dogs apart from cats because they were the same size. I think this shows that she wasn’t born with some innate understanding of animals, but actually started further behind most people. I believe she has worked hard to gain her understanding.One of my biggest problems with the book is that she spouts off old wives tales, stereotypes, anecdotal evidence, and her own untested theories as if they were all fact.She is fond of telling how she likes to lay down in the middle of a pen of cattle, and allow them come up and lick her. Yet I have been unable to grasp what insights she has gleaned by doing this. Being an individual who spends most of my time in cattle pens, I just keep thinking that is a disgusting place to lay down.With that said I must admit that despite her autism or perhaps because of it she has managed to turn her interest in animal behavior into a successful career. Additionally if my clients all had cattle handling facilities designed by her, and followed her principals it would make my life much easier."
206,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1300439-paula,2,"Like Temple Grandin, I believe that animals are more intelligent than we have given them credit for. I've read studies of crows, gray parrots, octopus, and ground squirrels in particular that reveal some amazing capabilities including strategizing, language, and tool making. So, I came into this text prepared. Grandin's comparisons between the capabilities, and limitations of autistic people with that of animals was interesting. Her understanding of ""normals"" was less impressive. Many of her claims about autistic people has more to do with intelligence than autism. For example, she claims autistic people are more observant than normal people. Whether this is true overall is speculative. I believe that intelligent people are more observant, and her claims to being hyper observant have as much to do with her intelligence as with her condition. She doesn't seem to separate the two at all. Autistic people have as broad a range of intelligence as normal people do. Yet, she doesn't parse out those traits that depend upon intelligence from those that depend upon an aberrant condition. She also claims that she has a particular insight into animal behavior and feelings that normal people cannot understand. This is also pure speculation. She deals mainly with ranchers, stockyard and slaughterhouse workers. These people have strong reason to believe that animals are less intelligent and less feeling than is likely the case. They do not represent all ""normals"". There are a great many normal animal trainers, and even pet owners who have great insight into the minds and feelings of animals. You don't have to be autistic to see that animals have feelings, and thoughts. You just have to care about animals, and not care about how much money you'll lose if the cattle keep getting injured. Her attitude toward veganism also shows a lack of understanding. She obviously did not study even the most rudimentary nutrition studies when she did her brief experiment in giving up meat. Watch The Game Changers if you think that eating vegan can leave anyone feeling weak! "
207,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2410849-juliet-wilson,4,"Subtitled 'the woman who thinks like a cow' this is a fascinating book about animal behaviour. Temple Grandin has autism and has used her different way of seeing the world as a way into understanding animals.Temple Grandin is an associate professor of animal science at Colorado State University. She has worked in the meat processing industry, helping to make slaughter houses more humane. As a vegetarian I didn't find this part of the book the easiest to read, but I have to admit that so many people are meat eaters who will never give up eating meat that it is vital that slaughter houses are made more humane. Also it is fascinating to read how the author thinks her way into the cow's mind, how it perceives the world and how it can be made to feel calmer and less threatened.The rest of the book looks at all kinds of animals, how they learn and how they relate to humans and whether the ways in which animals communicate can be considered to be true language, including the story of Alex the parrot, who seemed to be able to genuinely communicate and learn quicker than his owners and trainers expected . She outlines what makes dogs so good at being helper animals (particularly their sense of smell!) and how best to train dogs to increase their chances of growing up into well behaved, calm pets or working dogs (and she's a great believer in dogs working to give them a purpose in life!). The author constantly compares her own way of thinking as a person with autism to the way that animals think.All in all this is a fascinating book, whether your main interest is in autism in humans or in animal behaviour."

Very useful ""Behavior and Training Troubleshooting Guide"" at the end.p.72: As the roosters got more and more aggressive, the humans unconsciously adjusted their perceptions of how a normal rooster should act. It was a case of the bad becoming normal, and it's a big danger in selective breeding programs.

Being close to animals brings some of it back.”Temple Grandin address two topics in this book: animals and autism. The connection between the two is far closer then I would have imagined. But by using her autistic mind, Grandin is able to understand animals in a way many people do not (or have to be trained to). As someone finding out late in life that they have Aspergers, her revelations on autism and autistic brains was eye-opening and affirming. Her ideas and research into animal behaviour and language are equally illuminating. I’m curious to know what we’ve learned about animal intelligence 15 years later. I suspect I’ll be reading more on this topic in future. There are a few moments in the book that show its age. Grandin uses ‘retarded’ several times, which I imagine was not seen as a slur 15 years back. And while she does so with no malice or condensation, for a modern reader it can be rather jarring. Additionally, there are a few stories of very severe animal abuse. Grandin uses these stories to argue in favour of animal welfare, but they are still quiet disturbing to read. These are things I feel is important for people to know going into a book that I can otherwise heartily recommend. Grandson’s love and fascination of animals is present in every page, and her work in increasing animal welfare in the meat industry was huge. If either topic is of interest to you, this book is worth your time.  "
210,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108010-tina,5,"Lauren recommended this book to me, and she was spot on in assuming I'd love it. So much interesting stuff here! It basically just describes a whole bunch of cool ways that animal brains work, with a healthy bit of info on how normal and autistic human brains work, too. Full of illustrative stories and experiments. As I was reading this book, I couldn't stop rambling on about everything in it to M. If you are interested in How Brains Work (and you have to know by now that I'm OBSESSED with the topic), I seriously recommend that you read this book. Now. Quick warning: It does contain quite a lot of stories about slaughterhouses, which was difficult for me to read at times. I much preferred when she talked about animal behavior that wasn't related to feed lots, etc. But despite that, I still loved this book and want to share all the facts from it with everyone I know. I wish I'd taken notes. Yes, I'm a nerd."
211,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/861650-laura,3,"I expected a little more from this book, after hearing about it constantly for several years in animal circles. When comparing thought processes and perception in animals and autistic people, Grandin provides some interesting insights in our dealings with animals. A good deal of this, however, is not as new or groundbreaking as she seems to feel it is, given anyone who has worked closely with animals for a time will come to the same realizations of what they see. When covering behavioral conepts in general, she tends not to distinguish between what are generally regarded as facts or hard theories, and what are individuals' hypotheses and pet theories. She simply chooses what she likes and presents it all as straight fact, which I find rather irritating and somewhat irresponsible coming from a PhD. Her anecdotes and examples are fascinating, but I'd suggest taking her renditions of them somewhat lightly and going to the original literature for more accurate accounts. "
212,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/766968-tami,5,"Animals in Translation is an amazing book. This book states that by looking at human autism, we can better under animals, the way they think, the way they behave, and how they see the world. The author is an animal scientist who works primarily with slaughter houses. She is also autistic. Before reading this book, I had very little comprehension about the way that autistic people see the world. I simply had no idea that seeing the world in a visual way was that much different than the way that I think. I now see that this different way of thinking has a lot of really interesting benefits, particularly when it comes to understanding other visual thinkers like the animals around us. As I read this book, I started to comprehend how much detail in life we normally ignore. So much of what we need to understand animals is simply looking at life from their perspective, both literally and figuratively speaking."
213,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1246511-alex,5,"A truly fascinating read. Grandin's synthesis of how human and animal brains works is by far the most compelling one I've read so far (and I've read a few!). Her anecdotes are truly fascinating (elephants that communicate over miles by beating on the ground! dogs that can detect human seizures long before they occur! dolphins that kill porpoises just for kicks!) and fodder for a lifetime of cocktail party conversations. But more vital is the synthetic whole she makes out of her work on animal behavior and her own autism, which is at once disarming and compelling. In the end, Gradin's frankness, honesty, and willingness to acknowledge the limitations of her knowledge makes her generalizations about minds, behavior, and evolution far more compelling than many of the more popular writers on the brain. This little book should be read by anyone who cares about animals, and/or anyone cares about how the mind works."
214,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4084325-carole,4,"i loved this book. the author is living a full, productive life as an animal scientist. the author has autism, and she has the incredible ability to see the world through some animals' eyes, or rather understand animals and their abilities in a way that is refreshing and very real. this book is not about the shortcomings of people with autism, or all of the things that animals can't do or understand; rather, it's about all of the extraordinary, invaluable talents that animals have, that perhaps we don't fully understand. While reading this book, the reader realizes that often many people with autism have unique abilities that the rest of us can only dream of.i highly recommend this book; it is incredibly insightful. i found myself repeatedly finding such logic in Grandin's wisdom that just made such sense."
215,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/912850-jon,5,"Really a 4.5 star book, but I'll give it five do to the limited nature of the grading system.This book really changed my perspective on how I view animals (and autistic people!). Unfortunately, kids will be forced to read some waste of time book in high school like Billy Bud or Romeo and Juliet when there are awesome thought provoking books like this. It was fascinating to feel the basic accessibility of this book instead of the normal, overly-verbose, academic prose that would fill this type of book. I wonder how much of the writing was done by Temple and how much by the co-author. Being autistic, is it even possible for Temple to write an entire book by herself? I have way too many questions now, but that's the whole point to a good science book."
216,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1436259-ruth,3,"The author of the book is autistic and an expert in animal behavior. She believes her autism gives her an edge in her profession as she believes she thinks a lot more like animals do. She speaks of herself as thinking in pictures, not words. She also writes of noticing a lot of details that normal people don't--but that animals do. I found the book interesting not only for what it had to say about animal behavior but also for what Grandin had to say about her own autism. However, I found the book repetitive and grew tired of it 3/4 of the way through, so I just skimmed the rest. This is a book that has been in my TBR stack for some time and which I've attempted to read in the past, and just never finished, though I sort of wanted to. This time I'm giving up. "

From her own unique perspecitive as a person who has overcome autism, Grandin is able to understand animals so well that she is called on to manage animal behavior problems all around the country. Her book is thought provoking and loaded with personal stories from her vast experience with dogs, horses cows, pigs and chickens. She includes an excellent overveiw of contemporary neurological science views that help show how the brains of animals work, in comparison with humans. A perfect mix of storytelling and science, the book is entertaining and enlightening."

I will no longer have the disdain for crows I have previously felt--they are really quite intelligent(though I may still find them a little creepy in large groups). The author, who is autistic has long had a special connection to animals and is now an expert on animal behavior. She describes animals in many different ways from their feelings to their thoughts(and gives amazing evidence about language abilities). Dogs and cows are probably discussed the most, but other animals are also included. Really fascinating details that help me understand our neurotic dog in a whole new way."

Like others have pointed out, this is just a collection of anecdotes and personal beliefs rather than animal science. Not sure if the lack of citations are on purpose but she should know better.What bothered me the most was how she tried to pass beliefs as fact even at times when it's clear she knows nothing about the subject in question.This was my first Temple Grandin book, now I doubt I'll read anything else by her."

It makes neuroscience accessible and gives us insight into the autistic mind in the way a non-autistic author never could.

230,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19143066-stewart-mcfarlane,5,"This is fascinating book on animal behaviour written by Temple Grandin, a remarkable woman, who lectures all over the world on animal welfare, especially livestock, and on the nature of autism. The book is co-authored by Catherine Johnson, a mother of two children with autism.Temple Grandin is an associate professor of animal science at Colorado State University. She courageously went public about her diagnosis of autism. She also has an international reputation in the meat-packing industry, for her ground-breaking designs of humane cattle-handling equipment, techniques, and setting standards of good practice in handling animals.Grandin has two main aims in this book. She aims to show how problems in animal behaviour can be resolved by understanding the causes of the behaviour. To this end, she has analysed livestock behaviour down to its smallest details, so that she can predict what an animal will do. She has extensive experience in being called in to trouble-shoot difficult behaviour in domestic and agricultural animals, including cattle,pigs, dogs and horses. She has synthesized the knowledge of animal breeders, trainers and ethologists, into rules and practical advice on how to manage difficult animals.Her second aim is to develop a new theory of autism. She argues that the autistic mind is closer to the animal mind than it is to the typical human mind, when it comes to perception of detail. This opens the possibility of new ways of understanding autism. There are autistic ""savants"" who can identify a prime number with uncanny speed, or can perform complex calculations faster than a computer.. In all of these instances, the individual has systematized a mathematical system. Grandin extends her understanding to living creatures.Grandin has tried to systematize animal behavior. She starts from the animal's perspective and asks; what kinds of stimuli might make an animal frightened? What kinds of stimuli might make an animal aggressive? What do we know about the neuroscience of animal drives that might help us predict its behaviour? Grandin's analysis of animal behaviour results in her understanding it to the point of being able to predict it, and to remedy faults and problems.Here are some examples of how slight changes in an animal's environment can produce strong, often alarming reactions. Changes in lighting from outside to inside building can frighten cattle and pigs. Pools of water can frighten them when caught in the light. Flapping objects such as coats or rags near where they have to walk can really scare them.Unfamiliar noises from generators etc can unnerve them and cause panic.As a dog trainer and elephant handler, I realise the importance of knowing your animal and trying to see things they way that the animal does. I have learned to read the body language of my dogs, so as to predict their behavior. Their running action when hunting squirrels is totally different from that when they have the scent of a bitch in season. My German Shepherd has a fast purposeful trot with his head up when he is planning the pursuit of an interesting female dog. He also stops looking around for me, because at that time I have temporarily ceased to exist for him, so if I want to stop him, I know I have to act fast with a stop command. If I know the bitch is friendly to him, I usually just let him get on with it and re-call him when his curiousity and/or lust is satisfied. I know one elephant in Chiang Mai Province who is terrified of small white birds, if they are feeding on the ground in a flock. She gets nervous and simply will not proceed past the birds. I just let her back up and find another route, or I dismount, leave her at a safe distance, and scare the birds off for her. She doesn't mind them at all if they are perched in the trees. She was probably startled by a flock of these birds when she was young.Many animal trainers and animal problem solvers such as Cesar Millan, who often deals with dog phobias, are aware of the importance of close observation and trying to see things the way the animal sees them. Grandin goes further in trying to systematize this knowledge. She has also examined the causes of aggression in domestic animals such as horses or dogs, and developed a set of rules. If a stallion is kept locked up and deprived of the opportunity to learn to socialise, it will be very aggressive to other stallions, and will try to rape mares. If a dog is not properly socialised with other dogs and people outside its family, it may well be aggressive, through fear. Or if it is allowed to be too dominant and intimidate its human family, then it may be aggressive to them. If it knows its place in the family, and is given clear boundaries, it will be contented and not cause such problems.Finally, she has examined animal breeding. If you cross a fast-growing rooster with a fast-growing hen, you get fast-growing chickens. But she identifies that such single-characteristic genetic breeding programmes always come with a down-side. The fast-growing offspring also have weak hearts, for example. If you cross fast-growing chickens with those selected for their strength, you get long-lived, fast-growing chickens, but they are monstrously aggressive. I think some of the accounts of the mistakes and cruelties inflicted on livestock here will cause more people to question the ethics of the whole process of commercial meat production, however well managed. In my view that is a good thing.Some readers may be shocked that Temple Grandin is saying that autistic people are more similar to animal than normal people. Isn't this suggesting that autistic people are subhuman? In fact, Grandin's claim is that animals have superior perception of detail, and so do people with autism. So, far from offending people with autism, she is if anything suggesting that non-autistic people have less sharp perception. In a way she is saying that it is the ""normal"" people who are handicapped, because they miss all this detail, and make many mistakes when trying to remember events. We know that this is the case from ""eye-witness"" testimony, which often turns out to be unreliable , because our brains construct memories, make assumptions, and change details and sequences, often in the very process of recalling them. She links the two themes of her book by arguing that a person with autism will have a greater affinity for animals than will a person without autism, because the same sorts of unexpected changes like flickering lights, or sudden small movements or sounds that might startle an animal, might also startle a person with autism. She goes further to argue that understanding animal perception might help us understand autistic perception.Getting back to the elephant example, Grandin mentions the fact that they use infrasonic (low rumbles) to communicate and possibly even seismic communication (ground vibrations) to send messages to their family members across distances as great as 25 miles. Elephants when distress, slam their trunks on the ground. The elephant I know with the white bird phobia does this if the birds get too near her. I agree with Temple here, that the elephant is communicating her distress to other elephants. In fact elephants do a whole range of things with their prehensile trunks. They explore their environment, comfort each other, pick up food and objects such as sticks to scratch with. Elephants normally sleep standing up, and often with their eyes open. You know when an elephant is asleep because its trunk is totally relaxed and resting on the ground at the tip. This is important because you should never startle a sleeping elephant. You should make a gentle sound, and let it wake up first, and you should never approach an elephant from behind or straight ahead of it. Their vision is poor and they are happier if you approach from the front but to one side, so they clearly see you coming.I am delighted to see that towards the end of the book, she discusses the evidence that humans co-evolved with wolves, in other words that we changed them and they changed us. This is something that I have long believed. Dog and human bones have been found in burials dating back 14,000 years, so some archaeologists concluded that domestication of dogs too place then. But Robert Wayne and his team at UCLA examined through DNA testing found that dogs started to diverge from wolves about 135,000 years ago. He suggest, and Temple and I agree with him, that proto humans, wolves that were slowly becoming dogs, were developing together, and were already closely associated. Many finds of wolf bones and humans bones together,date from more than 100,000 years ago.This suggests that they were associating at a time when homo sapiens were just evolving from homo erectus. This means they had few tools, were perhaps pre linguistic. The wolves with their superior sense of smell and superior pack based hunting skills, probably taught the proto humans the value of cooperation with them and with each other. Grandin argues that human social structures resembles that of wolves, more closely that that of primates. Even stronger evidence is that fact that the mid-brain of humans, which handles sensory data, including scenting smell, shrank over 10,000 years ago, while the fore-brain which handles language, reasoning and planning skills remained the same. The suggestion is that many of the mid brain functions of humans were not needed so much because the dogs were handling that side of things. The camp dogs were scenting, hearing and identifying prey and dangerous threats, for the humans, so the human brain was free to specialise and organise, develop language and cultural skills. Grandin suggest that this is probably why homo sapiens were able to flourish, while Neanderthals with similar brains to humans, did not, because they were not cooperating with wolves or proto dogs.I think this evidence may well explain why so many humans, including me, have such a strong affinity with dogs, and wolves. We are ancient companions.Interested readers can find out more about my experiences with dogs, elephants and other animals, in my book: OF MICE & ZEN.ANIMAL ENCOUNTERS IN THE LIFE OF A WANDERING BUDDHIST (free samples of Goodreads and Amazon).As I have made clear, I greatly appreciated this book. One important detail on which I disagree with her, is on the use of shock collars and invisible electric fences on dogs who chase joggers and cyclists, or dogs who roam. She advocates these as necessary to prevent these problems. I disagree. Such devices often traumatize dogs and can cause the dog to get injured. One unfortunate collie was so traumatized by the shock fence, that she would never leave the house and started pooping on the floor. These devices are barbaric if used by careless, inexperienced people, and they are not necessary. I have trained many dogs not to chase people, vehicles, or livestock and not to run off, without recourse to such devices. It just takes more time and effort on the part of the trainer. You have to be able to bond with, and communicate with the dog, to predict its behaviour, and intervene then. Anyone resorting to these electric shock devices is simply evading that responsibility. I think this issue is one where Temple Grandin's background in livestock management works against her. There, the use of electric devices is seen as normal, but in dog care ? Surely not acceptable."
231,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15704502-colleen,5,"I wasn't able to read this book in one setting or even 2 settings and, maybe, that's a good thing because then I took the time to reflect on the way humans do things and why. It's intriguing to compare how Temple and I relate to animals and to reflect upon our differing realities. I shall reflect upon the following statement for a long time: ""Normal people can't see all those little changes without a lot of training and effort, because their brains process them unconsciously. So normal people are drawing what they ""see,"" which is the finished object, after their brains have put it all together. It's ironic that we always say autistic children are in their own little world because if Dr. Snyder is right it's normal people who are living inside their heads. Autistic people are experiencing the actual world much more directly and accurately than non-autistic people, with all their inattentional blindness, change blindness, and their every-other-kind-of blindness."" I was drawn to this book because I'm a born animal lover and because I have much curiosity about the natural world. I gained much perspective from Temple's book in regards to the how and way animals relate to world, but also gained a deeper understanding of the inner workings of human brain. Book initiated much reflection upon some of my preconceived assumptions of intelligence and those reflections definitely re-configured my understanding to include the many different types of animal geniuses.Because of how Temple described her reality, I have rearranged my assumed perceptions of what is the correct way to view the world; and I have adopted a better understanding of, and respect for, the autistic point of view. Temple's story reminds me to not be so quick to assume that my way is the right way. In regards to my life as an educator, I've gleaned more understanding of autistic children. I interacted with autistic children during my career, and those experiences caused me to assume that autistic children needed to interact with environment in a way that was quite rigid. After reading this book, I wouldn't describe my experiences with autistic children in quite that way. Now, I know that it wasn't so much that they were always trying to say their way was the right way, but, rather, that they just couldn't ""see"" things my way---and I couldn't see things their way. So, I don't think this book is about what's the right way or the wrong way to see the world; but, rather, the takeaway message is that human reality is affected by brain function, human experience, emotion, and context. It is highly valuable for all of us to share our realities of the world---and highly valuable for us to listen to the realities of others. I recommend this book for everyone. Another important take away is that most of us don't take the time to think about why we do things the way we do because that would just take too much time and be inefficient; but, oftentimes, it would be helpful and useful to reflect upon how and why we do things differently so we can compare our actions and results for the purpose of getting deeper understanding of alternate views. Since non-autistic people don't feel compelled to evaluate or alter their ""normal"" way of doing things (because those ways are an accepted way), it is likely non-autistic people also don't see the full ramification of doing some things in the ""normal"" way. On the other hand, the autistic person trying to cope with the majority viewpoint is compelled to do some analysis and evaluation in order to cope with the most-accepted standards of thinking and behavior imposed upon them. Temple describes many situations in which her non-standard thinking actually resulted in actions that were more acceptable to animals. She offers numerous stories on how the non-autistic person can learn from the autistic person about better ways of doing things by exploring alternative viewpoints and evaluating their assumptions about reality. Temple explains---in a nonjudgmental way---that the autistic view of the world is another reality, and that the autistic and non-autistic brain function differently resulting in some specific and differing autistic and non-autistic viewpoints and actions. Most enlightening to me is that the autistic reality offers the non-autistic person a window through which they can view their ""normal"" perceptions, actions, and viewpoints. Temple offers an alternative view of the non-autistic person's reality, which in the case of livestock management, encouraged humans to handle animals more humanely and more efficiently.This story has stirred in me the desire to reflect upon the assumptions I make about the BEST way to be with animals, and also has changed my view of autism. It's awesome when anyone, who resides a bit out of the norm, shares their story because we are reminded that change is good, that evaluation of our actions is important, and that the norm is only a norm for a short moment in time. I don't view autism negatively; but, rather, appreciate the autistic genius for seeing in pictures and noticing details that my brain ignores. Temple's story has encouraged me tap into the ignored realities of my daily existence."
232,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7729729-alison,2,"Temple Grandin is a huge name in animal welfare. Or, she was. She contributed amazingly to the field, but this book is definitely a product of its time.I couldn't finish it. Some of the anecdotes were interesting, but a lot of the information itself was outdated. Dominance theory hasn't been taken seriously in the animal world for some years now and this was the main theory of her book. The parts about how animal brains work and how she related it to her experience as an autistic woman were really interesting, but after the chapters on how you have to show pigs and horses and dogs who's boss I'm left wondering how much of the rest of it is out of date and considered ridiculous in 2019 by brain...scientists? I wonder how much of it even Ms. Grandin would still stand by.Even back when it was considered cutting edge, there were certain things that would have bothered me. She mashed personal opinion with scientific evidence with abandon. There was a lot of speculation, a lot of ""No one has done any studies on this specifically, but I bet that..."" which is not what I'm looking for in an educational read. I think that when you're writing from such a position of authority it's irresponsible to throw your opinion around like it's fact. It also didn't have the circumspection I've come to expect in pop science books. The first few chapters focusing on the basics of the field and disclaiming on how their results aren't necessarily definitive, how narrow the case study was, how new research is coming out, etc. I'm gonna be honest, I love that part. It was a little disappointing for it to be missing in one of the first books I've been able to read about my own field.From a writing standpoint, it was pretty awful. She's very ""write how you talk"" which makes it easy to follow, but it must take decades to have a conversation with her with the way she's constantly inserting irrelevant facts and stories. If she wants to write a memoir that's fine, but this book was supposed to be about a specific topic and she apparently had no editor to ask if paragraphs or entire pages were actually contributing to her point. This book could have been like 150 pages and been complete. I'm sorry Ms. Grandin but I'm not reading a book about animal behavior to find out how the government would be so much better if everyone just thought like you did.I did make it an admirable halfway through before giving up. I just have more valuable things to read with my time. If you're looking for a meaningful read about animal behavior, pick up something shorter that was written in the past couple of years."
233,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91724581-carol-aguilar,3,"	I read the book Animals In Translation. I discovered this book because it was in the no AR section and it caught my attention because it had the word Animals in it. I enjoyed the book in some parts and in some parts I didn't. In some parts it even made me angry.	The book was really good because Temple Grandin did a great way of explaining. I learned things about autism that I didn't know. I also really learned things about the brain.She really made sure you knew what autism is and how people with and without autism act and react, before saying how animals and people with autism have a connection and can help each other. She also explained a lot of things that were not related to autism. For example when she was talking about the behavior of humans and animals and that anthropomorphizing a animal is the worst thing you can do it really got me thinking. Do I anthropomorphize my pets and other animals. Is it dangerous if I do it? She also really explained that animals do and will feel emotion. She gave many examples of this for example the cats helping each other out during a delivery of a baby or saying the cows feel emotion when they are separated from their young. Even though they already “reached” a age in which they won't miss their young. This is where I start to not like the book. 	 What I didn't like was that Temple Grandin was saying all these great things about animals for example saying that humans and animals have different brain but also awfully a lot in common, saying how cows can be just like a dog and play just like one,and even saying how they can be a great companion for people with autism. But yet she talks about animals being used in labs and being tested on and even being used in her” humane” squeezing chute and humane ways to hand a animal going or getting ready for slaughter. It was very conflicting. It's like saying you love animals yet you still eat them. Or saying your against rape yet you eat dairy products.	 I think someone who would enjoy this book is anyone that is interested between the connection of animals with people with autism and even with people without it. Anyone also ready to read a book with a lot of information about the connection of humans and animals should read it."
234,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91381557-trey-hall,4,"Reading this fascinating collection of scientific experiments and phenomenological wonderings about animals' feelings, consciousness, and language was like trying to watch all at once the movements of a vast mobile on a windy balcony: you can sense that the different beauties, velocities, and fluctuations of all the pieces are connected, but your mind simply can't map the connections: in a way that leads to grandeur and awe, and occasionally to frustration at your perceptual limits.As a starting point, the author reflects on her own autism - and part of autistic perception, in general - as potentially similar to non-human animal patterns of perception and understanding. [I acknowledge this idea could be understandably offensive to some. Grandin writes in a full-on style and makes no apologies. Whether the science is far-out there or not, I'm not educated enough to say, but I found it compelling]. For example, she suggests that animals (whom she studies and loves) might share the same ""hyper-specific intelligence"" (not conceptual; not organizing the raw data perceived into any representative, and often smoothed-out, whole or schema; but seeing the minutiae of component parts without organizing them) and ""mental image language"" (thinking not in words or concepts but in pictures) that autistic people frequently describe having. From there she spends most of the book imagining what the multiple intelligences and emotional lives of animals might be like. I learned so much reading this book, but beyond learning, I experienced an increased sense of compassion for, friendship with, and sincere regard and love for animals, whose fear- and thought- and pain- and love- and joy-worlds, I'm convinced, are much more more dynamic, complex, and psychologically variegated than many scientists in particular and people in general think or allow themselves to think.For me, this expanding awareness raises serious ethical questions, to be sure - and I'm already a pescatarian - but more than that, it invites me into a deeper participation in my/our essential communion with all creatures, in the way I try to see, the way I pray, etc."
235,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44661992-michael,3,"My first thoughts about this book were: I wonder if I can get a refund from Colorado State University for the hundreds of dollars worth of tuition money I spent in Vet school for the privilege of listening to Temple Grandin present the exact same material as contained in this book. Given that in book form I was better able to concentrate on the material without being distracted by the author’s autistic mannerisms, I preferred the book form. Given that I checked the book out for free at the library I feel that I way overpaid in school.Temple Grandin is an interesting character, she is perhaps the most famous autistic person alive today. She believes that her autism causes her to think like a cow, and many view her as some sort of animal behavior autistic savant. I find these claims dubious at best. She does have a decent understanding of animal behavior, but has spent years studying it. It doesn’t sound as if it came naturally to her. As she tells a story of when she was young she couldn’t tell small dogs apart from cats because they were the same size. I think this shows that she wasn’t born with some innate understanding of animals, but actually started further behind most people. I believe she has worked hard to gain her understanding.One of my biggest problems with the book is that she spouts off old wives tales, stereotypes, anecdotal evidence, and her own untested theories as if they were all fact.She is fond of telling how she likes to lay down in the middle of a pen of cattle, and allow them come up and lick her. Yet I have been unable to grasp what insights she has gleaned by doing this. Being an individual who spends most of my time in cattle pens, I just keep thinking that is a disgusting place to lay down.With that said I must admit that despite her autism or perhaps because of it she has managed to turn her interest in animal behavior into a successful career. Additionally if my clients all had cattle handling facilities designed by her, and followed her principals it would make my life much easier."
236,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1300439-paula,2,"Like Temple Grandin, I believe that animals are more intelligent than we have given them credit for. I've read studies of crows, gray parrots, octopus, and ground squirrels in particular that reveal some amazing capabilities including strategizing, language, and tool making. So, I came into this text prepared. Grandin's comparisons between the capabilities, and limitations of autistic people with that of animals was interesting. Her understanding of ""normals"" was less impressive. Many of her claims about autistic people has more to do with intelligence than autism. For example, she claims autistic people are more observant than normal people. Whether this is true overall is speculative. I believe that intelligent people are more observant, and her claims to being hyper observant have as much to do with her intelligence as with her condition. She doesn't seem to separate the two at all. Autistic people have as broad a range of intelligence as normal people do. Yet, she doesn't parse out those traits that depend upon intelligence from those that depend upon an aberrant condition. She also claims that she has a particular insight into animal behavior and feelings that normal people cannot understand. This is also pure speculation. She deals mainly with ranchers, stockyard and slaughterhouse workers. These people have strong reason to believe that animals are less intelligent and less feeling than is likely the case. They do not represent all ""normals"". There are a great many normal animal trainers, and even pet owners who have great insight into the minds and feelings of animals. You don't have to be autistic to see that animals have feelings, and thoughts. You just have to care about animals, and not care about how much money you'll lose if the cattle keep getting injured. Her attitude toward veganism also shows a lack of understanding. She obviously did not study even the most rudimentary nutrition studies when she did her brief experiment in giving up meat. Watch The Game Changers if you think that eating vegan can leave anyone feeling weak! "
237,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2410849-juliet-wilson,4,"Subtitled 'the woman who thinks like a cow' this is a fascinating book about animal behaviour. Temple Grandin has autism and has used her different way of seeing the world as a way into understanding animals.Temple Grandin is an associate professor of animal science at Colorado State University. She has worked in the meat processing industry, helping to make slaughter houses more humane. As a vegetarian I didn't find this part of the book the easiest to read, but I have to admit that so many people are meat eaters who will never give up eating meat that it is vital that slaughter houses are made more humane. Also it is fascinating to read how the author thinks her way into the cow's mind, how it perceives the world and how it can be made to feel calmer and less threatened.The rest of the book looks at all kinds of animals, how they learn and how they relate to humans and whether the ways in which animals communicate can be considered to be true language, including the story of Alex the parrot, who seemed to be able to genuinely communicate and learn quicker than his owners and trainers expected . She outlines what makes dogs so good at being helper animals (particularly their sense of smell!) and how best to train dogs to increase their chances of growing up into well behaved, calm pets or working dogs (and she's a great believer in dogs working to give them a purpose in life!). The author constantly compares her own way of thinking as a person with autism to the way that animals think.All in all this is a fascinating book, whether your main interest is in autism in humans or in animal behaviour."

Very useful ""Behavior and Training Troubleshooting Guide"" at the end.p.72: As the roosters got more and more aggressive, the humans unconsciously adjusted their perceptions of how a normal rooster should act. It was a case of the bad becoming normal, and it's a big danger in selective breeding programs. I've seen it many times.p.123: Some behaviorists say that the fact that all animals self-handicap might mean that the purpose of play fighting isn't to teach animals how to win but to teach them how to win and lose. p.193: From age eleven to age thirty-three, when I discovered antidepressant medication, I felt exactly the way you feel when you're about to defend your dissertation, only I felt that way all day long, every single day. I was in a constant, daily state of emergency. It was horrible.p.276: If language naturally evolves to serve the needs of tiny rodents with tiny rodent brains, then what's unique about language isn't the brilliant humans who invented it to communicate high-level abstract thoughts. What's unique about language is that the creatures who develop it are highly vulnerable to being eaten.p.288: But when you look at the jobs some dogs have invented for themselves using their advanced perceptual abilities, you're moving into the realm of true cognition, which is solving a problem under novel conditions."

Being close to animals brings some of it back.”Temple Grandin address two topics in this book: animals and autism. The connection between the two is far closer then I would have imagined. But by using her autistic mind, Grandin is able to understand animals in a way many people do not (or have to be trained to). As someone finding out late in life that they have Aspergers, her revelations on autism and autistic brains was eye-opening and affirming. Her ideas and research into animal behaviour and language are equally illuminating. I’m curious to know what we’ve learned about animal intelligence 15 years later. I suspect I’ll be reading more on this topic in future. There are a few moments in the book that show its age. Grandin uses ‘retarded’ several times, which I imagine was not seen as a slur 15 years back. And while she does so with no malice or condensation, for a modern reader it can be rather jarring. Additionally, there are a few stories of very severe animal abuse. Grandin uses these stories to argue in favour of animal welfare, but they are still quiet disturbing to read. These are things I feel is important for people to know going into a book that I can otherwise heartily recommend. Grandson’s love and fascination of animals is present in every page, and her work in increasing animal welfare in the meat industry was huge. If either topic is of interest to you, this book is worth your time.  "
240,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108010-tina,5,"Lauren recommended this book to me, and she was spot on in assuming I'd love it. So much interesting stuff here! It basically just describes a whole bunch of cool ways that animal brains work, with a healthy bit of info on how normal and autistic human brains work, too. Full of illustrative stories and experiments. As I was reading this book, I couldn't stop rambling on about everything in it to M. If you are interested in How Brains Work (and you have to know by now that I'm OBSESSED with the topic), I seriously recommend that you read this book. Now. Quick warning: It does contain quite a lot of stories about slaughterhouses, which was difficult for me to read at times. I much preferred when she talked about animal behavior that wasn't related to feed lots, etc. But despite that, I still loved this book and want to share all the facts from it with everyone I know. I wish I'd taken notes. Yes, I'm a nerd."
241,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/861650-laura,3,"I expected a little more from this book, after hearing about it constantly for several years in animal circles. When comparing thought processes and perception in animals and autistic people, Grandin provides some interesting insights in our dealings with animals. A good deal of this, however, is not as new or groundbreaking as she seems to feel it is, given anyone who has worked closely with animals for a time will come to the same realizations of what they see. When covering behavioral conepts in general, she tends not to distinguish between what are generally regarded as facts or hard theories, and what are individuals' hypotheses and pet theories. She simply chooses what she likes and presents it all as straight fact, which I find rather irritating and somewhat irresponsible coming from a PhD. Her anecdotes and examples are fascinating, but I'd suggest taking her renditions of them somewhat lightly and going to the original literature for more accurate accounts. "
242,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/766968-tami,5,"Animals in Translation is an amazing book. This book states that by looking at human autism, we can better under animals, the way they think, the way they behave, and how they see the world. The author is an animal scientist who works primarily with slaughter houses. She is also autistic. Before reading this book, I had very little comprehension about the way that autistic people see the world. I simply had no idea that seeing the world in a visual way was that much different than the way that I think. I now see that this different way of thinking has a lot of really interesting benefits, particularly when it comes to understanding other visual thinkers like the animals around us. As I read this book, I started to comprehend how much detail in life we normally ignore. So much of what we need to understand animals is simply looking at life from their perspective, both literally and figuratively speaking."
243,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1246511-alex,5,"A truly fascinating read. Grandin's synthesis of how human and animal brains works is by far the most compelling one I've read so far (and I've read a few!). Her anecdotes are truly fascinating (elephants that communicate over miles by beating on the ground! dogs that can detect human seizures long before they occur! dolphins that kill porpoises just for kicks!) and fodder for a lifetime of cocktail party conversations. But more vital is the synthetic whole she makes out of her work on animal behavior and her own autism, which is at once disarming and compelling. In the end, Gradin's frankness, honesty, and willingness to acknowledge the limitations of her knowledge makes her generalizations about minds, behavior, and evolution far more compelling than many of the more popular writers on the brain. This little book should be read by anyone who cares about animals, and/or anyone cares about how the mind works."

While reading this book, the reader realizes that often many people with autism have unique abilities that the rest of us can only dream of.i highly recommend this book; it is incredibly insightful. i found myself repeatedly finding such logic in Grandin's wisdom that just made such sense."

Unfortunately, kids will be forced to read some waste of time book in high school like Billy Bud or Romeo and Juliet when there are awesome thought provoking books like this. It was fascinating to feel the basic accessibility of this book instead of the normal, overly-verbose, academic prose that would fill this type of book. I wonder how much of the writing was done by Temple and how much by the co-author. Being autistic, is it even possible for Temple to write an entire book by herself? I have way too many questions now, but that's the whole point to a good science book."

She believes her autism gives her an edge in her profession as she believes she thinks a lot more like animals do. She speaks of herself as thinking in pictures, not words. She also writes of noticing a lot of details that normal people don't--but that animals do. I found the book interesting not only for what it had to say about animal behavior but also for what Grandin had to say about her own autism. However, I found the book repetitive and grew tired of it 3/4 of the way through, so I just skimmed the rest. This is a book that has been in my TBR stack for some time and which I've attempted to read in the past, and just never finished, though I sort of wanted to. This time I'm giving up. "

Her book is thought provoking and loaded with personal stories from her vast experience with dogs, horses cows, pigs and chickens.

260,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19143066-stewart-mcfarlane,5,"This is fascinating book on animal behaviour written by Temple Grandin, a remarkable woman, who lectures all over the world on animal welfare, especially livestock, and on the nature of autism. The book is co-authored by Catherine Johnson, a mother of two children with autism.Temple Grandin is an associate professor of animal science at Colorado State University. She courageously went public about her diagnosis of autism. She also has an international reputation in the meat-packing industry, for her ground-breaking designs of humane cattle-handling equipment, techniques, and setting standards of good practice in handling animals.Grandin has two main aims in this book. She aims to show how problems in animal behaviour can be resolved by understanding the causes of the behaviour. To this end, she has analysed livestock behaviour down to its smallest details, so that she can predict what an animal will do. She has extensive experience in being called in to trouble-shoot difficult behaviour in domestic and agricultural animals, including cattle,pigs, dogs and horses. She has synthesized the knowledge of animal breeders, trainers and ethologists, into rules and practical advice on how to manage difficult animals.Her second aim is to develop a new theory of autism. She argues that the autistic mind is closer to the animal mind than it is to the typical human mind, when it comes to perception of detail. This opens the possibility of new ways of understanding autism. There are autistic ""savants"" who can identify a prime number with uncanny speed, or can perform complex calculations faster than a computer.. In all of these instances, the individual has systematized a mathematical system. Grandin extends her understanding to living creatures.Grandin has tried to systematize animal behavior. She starts from the animal's perspective and asks; what kinds of stimuli might make an animal frightened? What kinds of stimuli might make an animal aggressive? What do we know about the neuroscience of animal drives that might help us predict its behaviour? Grandin's analysis of animal behaviour results in her understanding it to the point of being able to predict it, and to remedy faults and problems.Here are some examples of how slight changes in an animal's environment can produce strong, often alarming reactions. Changes in lighting from outside to inside building can frighten cattle and pigs. Pools of water can frighten them when caught in the light. Flapping objects such as coats or rags near where they have to walk can really scare them.Unfamiliar noises from generators etc can unnerve them and cause panic.As a dog trainer and elephant handler, I realise the importance of knowing your animal and trying to see things they way that the animal does. I have learned to read the body language of my dogs, so as to predict their behavior. Their running action when hunting squirrels is totally different from that when they have the scent of a bitch in season. My German Shepherd has a fast purposeful trot with his head up when he is planning the pursuit of an interesting female dog. He also stops looking around for me, because at that time I have temporarily ceased to exist for him, so if I want to stop him, I know I have to act fast with a stop command. If I know the bitch is friendly to him, I usually just let him get on with it and re-call him when his curiousity and/or lust is satisfied. I know one elephant in Chiang Mai Province who is terrified of small white birds, if they are feeding on the ground in a flock. She gets nervous and simply will not proceed past the birds. I just let her back up and find another route, or I dismount, leave her at a safe distance, and scare the birds off for her. She doesn't mind them at all if they are perched in the trees. She was probably startled by a flock of these birds when she was young.Many animal trainers and animal problem solvers such as Cesar Millan, who often deals with dog phobias, are aware of the importance of close observation and trying to see things the way the animal sees them. Grandin goes further in trying to systematize this knowledge. She has also examined the causes of aggression in domestic animals such as horses or dogs, and developed a set of rules. If a stallion is kept locked up and deprived of the opportunity to learn to socialise, it will be very aggressive to other stallions, and will try to rape mares. If a dog is not properly socialised with other dogs and people outside its family, it may well be aggressive, through fear. Or if it is allowed to be too dominant and intimidate its human family, then it may be aggressive to them. If it knows its place in the family, and is given clear boundaries, it will be contented and not cause such problems.Finally, she has examined animal breeding. If you cross a fast-growing rooster with a fast-growing hen, you get fast-growing chickens. But she identifies that such single-characteristic genetic breeding programmes always come with a down-side. The fast-growing offspring also have weak hearts, for example. If you cross fast-growing chickens with those selected for their strength, you get long-lived, fast-growing chickens, but they are monstrously aggressive. I think some of the accounts of the mistakes and cruelties inflicted on livestock here will cause more people to question the ethics of the whole process of commercial meat production, however well managed. In my view that is a good thing.Some readers may be shocked that Temple Grandin is saying that autistic people are more similar to animal than normal people. Isn't this suggesting that autistic people are subhuman? In fact, Grandin's claim is that animals have superior perception of detail, and so do people with autism. So, far from offending people with autism, she is if anything suggesting that non-autistic people have less sharp perception. In a way she is saying that it is the ""normal"" people who are handicapped, because they miss all this detail, and make many mistakes when trying to remember events. We know that this is the case from ""eye-witness"" testimony, which often turns out to be unreliable , because our brains construct memories, make assumptions, and change details and sequences, often in the very process of recalling them. She links the two themes of her book by arguing that a person with autism will have a greater affinity for animals than will a person without autism, because the same sorts of unexpected changes like flickering lights, or sudden small movements or sounds that might startle an animal, might also startle a person with autism. She goes further to argue that understanding animal perception might help us understand autistic perception.Getting back to the elephant example, Grandin mentions the fact that they use infrasonic (low rumbles) to communicate and possibly even seismic communication (ground vibrations) to send messages to their family members across distances as great as 25 miles. Elephants when distress, slam their trunks on the ground. The elephant I know with the white bird phobia does this if the birds get too near her. I agree with Temple here, that the elephant is communicating her distress to other elephants. In fact elephants do a whole range of things with their prehensile trunks. They explore their environment, comfort each other, pick up food and objects such as sticks to scratch with. Elephants normally sleep standing up, and often with their eyes open. You know when an elephant is asleep because its trunk is totally relaxed and resting on the ground at the tip. This is important because you should never startle a sleeping elephant. You should make a gentle sound, and let it wake up first, and you should never approach an elephant from behind or straight ahead of it. Their vision is poor and they are happier if you approach from the front but to one side, so they clearly see you coming.I am delighted to see that towards the end of the book, she discusses the evidence that humans co-evolved with wolves, in other words that we changed them and they changed us. This is something that I have long believed. Dog and human bones have been found in burials dating back 14,000 years, so some archaeologists concluded that domestication of dogs too place then. But Robert Wayne and his team at UCLA examined through DNA testing found that dogs started to diverge from wolves about 135,000 years ago. He suggest, and Temple and I agree with him, that proto humans, wolves that were slowly becoming dogs, were developing together, and were already closely associated. Many finds of wolf bones and humans bones together,date from more than 100,000 years ago.This suggests that they were associating at a time when homo sapiens were just evolving from homo erectus. This means they had few tools, were perhaps pre linguistic. The wolves with their superior sense of smell and superior pack based hunting skills, probably taught the proto humans the value of cooperation with them and with each other. Grandin argues that human social structures resembles that of wolves, more closely that that of primates. Even stronger evidence is that fact that the mid-brain of humans, which handles sensory data, including scenting smell, shrank over 10,000 years ago, while the fore-brain which handles language, reasoning and planning skills remained the same. The suggestion is that many of the mid brain functions of humans were not needed so much because the dogs were handling that side of things. The camp dogs were scenting, hearing and identifying prey and dangerous threats, for the humans, so the human brain was free to specialise and organise, develop language and cultural skills. Grandin suggest that this is probably why homo sapiens were able to flourish, while Neanderthals with similar brains to humans, did not, because they were not cooperating with wolves or proto dogs.I think this evidence may well explain why so many humans, including me, have such a strong affinity with dogs, and wolves. We are ancient companions.Interested readers can find out more about my experiences with dogs, elephants and other animals, in my book: OF MICE & ZEN.ANIMAL ENCOUNTERS IN THE LIFE OF A WANDERING BUDDHIST (free samples of Goodreads and Amazon).As I have made clear, I greatly appreciated this book. One important detail on which I disagree with her, is on the use of shock collars and invisible electric fences on dogs who chase joggers and cyclists, or dogs who roam. She advocates these as necessary to prevent these problems. I disagree. Such devices often traumatize dogs and can cause the dog to get injured. One unfortunate collie was so traumatized by the shock fence, that she would never leave the house and started pooping on the floor. These devices are barbaric if used by careless, inexperienced people, and they are not necessary. I have trained many dogs not to chase people, vehicles, or livestock and not to run off, without recourse to such devices. It just takes more time and effort on the part of the trainer. You have to be able to bond with, and communicate with the dog, to predict its behaviour, and intervene then. Anyone resorting to these electric shock devices is simply evading that responsibility. I think this issue is one where Temple Grandin's background in livestock management works against her. There, the use of electric devices is seen as normal, but in dog care ? Surely not acceptable."
261,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15704502-colleen,5,"I wasn't able to read this book in one setting or even 2 settings and, maybe, that's a good thing because then I took the time to reflect on the way humans do things and why. It's intriguing to compare how Temple and I relate to animals and to reflect upon our differing realities. I shall reflect upon the following statement for a long time: ""Normal people can't see all those little changes without a lot of training and effort, because their brains process them unconsciously. So normal people are drawing what they ""see,"" which is the finished object, after their brains have put it all together. It's ironic that we always say autistic children are in their own little world because if Dr. Snyder is right it's normal people who are living inside their heads. Autistic people are experiencing the actual world much more directly and accurately than non-autistic people, with all their inattentional blindness, change blindness, and their every-other-kind-of blindness."" I was drawn to this book because I'm a born animal lover and because I have much curiosity about the natural world. I gained much perspective from Temple's book in regards to the how and way animals relate to world, but also gained a deeper understanding of the inner workings of human brain. Book initiated much reflection upon some of my preconceived assumptions of intelligence and those reflections definitely re-configured my understanding to include the many different types of animal geniuses.Because of how Temple described her reality, I have rearranged my assumed perceptions of what is the correct way to view the world; and I have adopted a better understanding of, and respect for, the autistic point of view. Temple's story reminds me to not be so quick to assume that my way is the right way. In regards to my life as an educator, I've gleaned more understanding of autistic children. I interacted with autistic children during my career, and those experiences caused me to assume that autistic children needed to interact with environment in a way that was quite rigid. After reading this book, I wouldn't describe my experiences with autistic children in quite that way. Now, I know that it wasn't so much that they were always trying to say their way was the right way, but, rather, that they just couldn't ""see"" things my way---and I couldn't see things their way. So, I don't think this book is about what's the right way or the wrong way to see the world; but, rather, the takeaway message is that human reality is affected by brain function, human experience, emotion, and context. It is highly valuable for all of us to share our realities of the world---and highly valuable for us to listen to the realities of others. I recommend this book for everyone. Another important take away is that most of us don't take the time to think about why we do things the way we do because that would just take too much time and be inefficient; but, oftentimes, it would be helpful and useful to reflect upon how and why we do things differently so we can compare our actions and results for the purpose of getting deeper understanding of alternate views. Since non-autistic people don't feel compelled to evaluate or alter their ""normal"" way of doing things (because those ways are an accepted way), it is likely non-autistic people also don't see the full ramification of doing some things in the ""normal"" way. On the other hand, the autistic person trying to cope with the majority viewpoint is compelled to do some analysis and evaluation in order to cope with the most-accepted standards of thinking and behavior imposed upon them. Temple describes many situations in which her non-standard thinking actually resulted in actions that were more acceptable to animals. She offers numerous stories on how the non-autistic person can learn from the autistic person about better ways of doing things by exploring alternative viewpoints and evaluating their assumptions about reality. Temple explains---in a nonjudgmental way---that the autistic view of the world is another reality, and that the autistic and non-autistic brain function differently resulting in some specific and differing autistic and non-autistic viewpoints and actions. Most enlightening to me is that the autistic reality offers the non-autistic person a window through which they can view their ""normal"" perceptions, actions, and viewpoints. Temple offers an alternative view of the non-autistic person's reality, which in the case of livestock management, encouraged humans to handle animals more humanely and more efficiently.This story has stirred in me the desire to reflect upon the assumptions I make about the BEST way to be with animals, and also has changed my view of autism. It's awesome when anyone, who resides a bit out of the norm, shares their story because we are reminded that change is good, that evaluation of our actions is important, and that the norm is only a norm for a short moment in time. I don't view autism negatively; but, rather, appreciate the autistic genius for seeing in pictures and noticing details that my brain ignores. Temple's story has encouraged me tap into the ignored realities of my daily existence."
262,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7729729-alison,2,"Temple Grandin is a huge name in animal welfare. Or, she was. She contributed amazingly to the field, but this book is definitely a product of its time.I couldn't finish it. Some of the anecdotes were interesting, but a lot of the information itself was outdated. Dominance theory hasn't been taken seriously in the animal world for some years now and this was the main theory of her book. The parts about how animal brains work and how she related it to her experience as an autistic woman were really interesting, but after the chapters on how you have to show pigs and horses and dogs who's boss I'm left wondering how much of the rest of it is out of date and considered ridiculous in 2019 by brain...scientists? I wonder how much of it even Ms. Grandin would still stand by.Even back when it was considered cutting edge, there were certain things that would have bothered me. She mashed personal opinion with scientific evidence with abandon. There was a lot of speculation, a lot of ""No one has done any studies on this specifically, but I bet that..."" which is not what I'm looking for in an educational read. I think that when you're writing from such a position of authority it's irresponsible to throw your opinion around like it's fact. It also didn't have the circumspection I've come to expect in pop science books. The first few chapters focusing on the basics of the field and disclaiming on how their results aren't necessarily definitive, how narrow the case study was, how new research is coming out, etc. I'm gonna be honest, I love that part. It was a little disappointing for it to be missing in one of the first books I've been able to read about my own field.From a writing standpoint, it was pretty awful. She's very ""write how you talk"" which makes it easy to follow, but it must take decades to have a conversation with her with the way she's constantly inserting irrelevant facts and stories. If she wants to write a memoir that's fine, but this book was supposed to be about a specific topic and she apparently had no editor to ask if paragraphs or entire pages were actually contributing to her point. This book could have been like 150 pages and been complete. I'm sorry Ms. Grandin but I'm not reading a book about animal behavior to find out how the government would be so much better if everyone just thought like you did.I did make it an admirable halfway through before giving up. I just have more valuable things to read with my time. If you're looking for a meaningful read about animal behavior, pick up something shorter that was written in the past couple of years."
263,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91724581-carol-aguilar,3,"	I read the book Animals In Translation. I discovered this book because it was in the no AR section and it caught my attention because it had the word Animals in it. I enjoyed the book in some parts and in some parts I didn't. In some parts it even made me angry.	The book was really good because Temple Grandin did a great way of explaining. I learned things about autism that I didn't know. I also really learned things about the brain.She really made sure you knew what autism is and how people with and without autism act and react, before saying how animals and people with autism have a connection and can help each other. She also explained a lot of things that were not related to autism. For example when she was talking about the behavior of humans and animals and that anthropomorphizing a animal is the worst thing you can do it really got me thinking. Do I anthropomorphize my pets and other animals. Is it dangerous if I do it? She also really explained that animals do and will feel emotion. She gave many examples of this for example the cats helping each other out during a delivery of a baby or saying the cows feel emotion when they are separated from their young. Even though they already “reached” a age in which they won't miss their young. This is where I start to not like the book. 	 What I didn't like was that Temple Grandin was saying all these great things about animals for example saying that humans and animals have different brain but also awfully a lot in common, saying how cows can be just like a dog and play just like one,and even saying how they can be a great companion for people with autism. But yet she talks about animals being used in labs and being tested on and even being used in her” humane” squeezing chute and humane ways to hand a animal going or getting ready for slaughter. It was very conflicting. It's like saying you love animals yet you still eat them. Or saying your against rape yet you eat dairy products.	 I think someone who would enjoy this book is anyone that is interested between the connection of animals with people with autism and even with people without it. Anyone also ready to read a book with a lot of information about the connection of humans and animals should read it."
264,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91381557-trey-hall,4,"Reading this fascinating collection of scientific experiments and phenomenological wonderings about animals' feelings, consciousness, and language was like trying to watch all at once the movements of a vast mobile on a windy balcony: you can sense that the different beauties, velocities, and fluctuations of all the pieces are connected, but your mind simply can't map the connections: in a way that leads to grandeur and awe, and occasionally to frustration at your perceptual limits.As a starting point, the author reflects on her own autism - and part of autistic perception, in general - as potentially similar to non-human animal patterns of perception and understanding. [I acknowledge this idea could be understandably offensive to some. Grandin writes in a full-on style and makes no apologies. Whether the science is far-out there or not, I'm not educated enough to say, but I found it compelling]. For example, she suggests that animals (whom she studies and loves) might share the same ""hyper-specific intelligence"" (not conceptual; not organizing the raw data perceived into any representative, and often smoothed-out, whole or schema; but seeing the minutiae of component parts without organizing them) and ""mental image language"" (thinking not in words or concepts but in pictures) that autistic people frequently describe having. From there she spends most of the book imagining what the multiple intelligences and emotional lives of animals might be like. I learned so much reading this book, but beyond learning, I experienced an increased sense of compassion for, friendship with, and sincere regard and love for animals, whose fear- and thought- and pain- and love- and joy-worlds, I'm convinced, are much more more dynamic, complex, and psychologically variegated than many scientists in particular and people in general think or allow themselves to think.For me, this expanding awareness raises serious ethical questions, to be sure - and I'm already a pescatarian - but more than that, it invites me into a deeper participation in my/our essential communion with all creatures, in the way I try to see, the way I pray, etc."
265,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44661992-michael,3,"My first thoughts about this book were: I wonder if I can get a refund from Colorado State University for the hundreds of dollars worth of tuition money I spent in Vet school for the privilege of listening to Temple Grandin present the exact same material as contained in this book. Given that in book form I was better able to concentrate on the material without being distracted by the author’s autistic mannerisms, I preferred the book form. Given that I checked the book out for free at the library I feel that I way overpaid in school.Temple Grandin is an interesting character, she is perhaps the most famous autistic person alive today. She believes that her autism causes her to think like a cow, and many view her as some sort of animal behavior autistic savant. I find these claims dubious at best. She does have a decent understanding of animal behavior, but has spent years studying it. It doesn’t sound as if it came naturally to her. As she tells a story of when she was young she couldn’t tell small dogs apart from cats because they were the same size. I think this shows that she wasn’t born with some innate understanding of animals, but actually started further behind most people. I believe she has worked hard to gain her understanding.One of my biggest problems with the book is that she spouts off old wives tales, stereotypes, anecdotal evidence, and her own untested theories as if they were all fact.She is fond of telling how she likes to lay down in the middle of a pen of cattle, and allow them come up and lick her. Yet I have been unable to grasp what insights she has gleaned by doing this. Being an individual who spends most of my time in cattle pens, I just keep thinking that is a disgusting place to lay down.With that said I must admit that despite her autism or perhaps because of it she has managed to turn her interest in animal behavior into a successful career. Additionally if my clients all had cattle handling facilities designed by her, and followed her principals it would make my life much easier."
266,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1300439-paula,2,"Like Temple Grandin, I believe that animals are more intelligent than we have given them credit for. I've read studies of crows, gray parrots, octopus, and ground squirrels in particular that reveal some amazing capabilities including strategizing, language, and tool making. So, I came into this text prepared. Grandin's comparisons between the capabilities, and limitations of autistic people with that of animals was interesting. Her understanding of ""normals"" was less impressive. Many of her claims about autistic people has more to do with intelligence than autism. For example, she claims autistic people are more observant than normal people. Whether this is true overall is speculative. I believe that intelligent people are more observant, and her claims to being hyper observant have as much to do with her intelligence as with her condition. She doesn't seem to separate the two at all. Autistic people have as broad a range of intelligence as normal people do. Yet, she doesn't parse out those traits that depend upon intelligence from those that depend upon an aberrant condition. She also claims that she has a particular insight into animal behavior and feelings that normal people cannot understand. This is also pure speculation. She deals mainly with ranchers, stockyard and slaughterhouse workers. These people have strong reason to believe that animals are less intelligent and less feeling than is likely the case. They do not represent all ""normals"". There are a great many normal animal trainers, and even pet owners who have great insight into the minds and feelings of animals. You don't have to be autistic to see that animals have feelings, and thoughts. You just have to care about animals, and not care about how much money you'll lose if the cattle keep getting injured. Her attitude toward veganism also shows a lack of understanding. She obviously did not study even the most rudimentary nutrition studies when she did her brief experiment in giving up meat. Watch The Game Changers if you think that eating vegan can leave anyone feeling weak! "

Temple Grandin has autism and has used her different way of seeing the world as a way into understanding animals.Temple Grandin is an associate professor of animal science at Colorado State University. She has worked in the meat processing industry, helping to make slaughter houses more humane. As a vegetarian I didn't find this part of the book the easiest to read, but I have to admit that so many people are meat eaters who will never give up eating meat that it is vital that slaughter houses are made more humane. Also it is fascinating to read how the author thinks her way into the cow's mind, how it perceives the world and how it can be made to feel calmer and less threatened.The rest of the book looks at all kinds of animals, how they learn and how they relate to humans and whether the ways in which animals communicate can be considered to be true language, including the story of Alex the parrot, who seemed to be able to genuinely communicate and learn quicker than his owners and trainers expected . She outlines what makes dogs so good at being helper animals (particularly their sense of smell!) and how best to train dogs to increase their chances of growing up into well behaved, calm pets or working dogs (and she's a great believer in dogs working to give them a purpose in life!). The author constantly compares her own way of thinking as a person with autism to the way that animals think.All in all this is a fascinating book, whether your main interest is in autism in humans or in animal behaviour."

It was a case of the bad becoming normal, and it's a big danger in selective breeding programs.

Being close to animals brings some of it back.”Temple Grandin address two topics in this book: animals and autism. The connection between the two is far closer then I would have imagined. But by using her autistic mind, Grandin is able to understand animals in a way many people do not (or have to be trained to). As someone finding out late in life that they have Aspergers, her revelations on autism and autistic brains was eye-opening and affirming. Her ideas and research into animal behaviour and language are equally illuminating. I’m curious to know what we’ve learned about animal intelligence 15 years later. I suspect I’ll be reading more on this topic in future. There are a few moments in the book that show its age. Grandin uses ‘retarded’ several times, which I imagine was not seen as a slur 15 years back. And while she does so with no malice or condensation, for a modern reader it can be rather jarring. Additionally, there are a few stories of very severe animal abuse. Grandin uses these stories to argue in favour of animal welfare, but they are still quiet disturbing to read. These are things I feel is important for people to know going into a book that I can otherwise heartily recommend. Grandson’s love and fascination of animals is present in every page, and her work in increasing animal welfare in the meat industry was huge. If either topic is of interest to you, this book is worth your time.  "
270,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108010-tina,5,"Lauren recommended this book to me, and she was spot on in assuming I'd love it. So much interesting stuff here! It basically just describes a whole bunch of cool ways that animal brains work, with a healthy bit of info on how normal and autistic human brains work, too. Full of illustrative stories and experiments. As I was reading this book, I couldn't stop rambling on about everything in it to M. If you are interested in How Brains Work (and you have to know by now that I'm OBSESSED with the topic), I seriously recommend that you read this book. Now. Quick warning: It does contain quite a lot of stories about slaughterhouses, which was difficult for me to read at times. I much preferred when she talked about animal behavior that wasn't related to feed lots, etc. But despite that, I still loved this book and want to share all the facts from it with everyone I know. I wish I'd taken notes. Yes, I'm a nerd."
271,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/861650-laura,3,"I expected a little more from this book, after hearing about it constantly for several years in animal circles. When comparing thought processes and perception in animals and autistic people, Grandin provides some interesting insights in our dealings with animals. A good deal of this, however, is not as new or groundbreaking as she seems to feel it is, given anyone who has worked closely with animals for a time will come to the same realizations of what they see. When covering behavioral conepts in general, she tends not to distinguish between what are generally regarded as facts or hard theories, and what are individuals' hypotheses and pet theories. She simply chooses what she likes and presents it all as straight fact, which I find rather irritating and somewhat irresponsible coming from a PhD. Her anecdotes and examples are fascinating, but I'd suggest taking her renditions of them somewhat lightly and going to the original literature for more accurate accounts. "
272,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/766968-tami,5,"Animals in Translation is an amazing book. This book states that by looking at human autism, we can better under animals, the way they think, the way they behave, and how they see the world. The author is an animal scientist who works primarily with slaughter houses. She is also autistic. Before reading this book, I had very little comprehension about the way that autistic people see the world. I simply had no idea that seeing the world in a visual way was that much different than the way that I think. I now see that this different way of thinking has a lot of really interesting benefits, particularly when it comes to understanding other visual thinkers like the animals around us. As I read this book, I started to comprehend how much detail in life we normally ignore. So much of what we need to understand animals is simply looking at life from their perspective, both literally and figuratively speaking."

Grandin's synthesis of how human and animal brains works is by far the most compelling one I've read so far (and I've read a few!). Her anecdotes are truly fascinating (elephants that communicate over miles by beating on the ground! dogs that can detect human seizures long before they occur! dolphins that kill porpoises just for kicks!) and fodder for a lifetime of cocktail party conversations. But more vital is the synthetic whole she makes out of her work on animal behavior and her own autism, which is at once disarming and compelling. In the end, Gradin's frankness, honesty, and willingness to acknowledge the limitations of her knowledge makes her generalizations about minds, behavior, and evolution far more compelling than many of the more popular writers on the brain. This little book should be read by anyone who cares about animals, and/or anyone cares about how the mind works."

It was fascinating to feel the basic accessibility of this book instead of the normal, overly-verbose, academic prose that would fill this type of book. I wonder how much of the writing was done by Temple and how much by the co-author. Being autistic, is it even possible for Temple to write an entire book by herself?

I found the book interesting not only for what it had to say about animal behavior but also for what Grandin had to say about her own autism. However, I found the book repetitive and grew tired of it 3/4 of the way through, so I just skimmed the rest.

290,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19143066-stewart-mcfarlane,5,"This is fascinating book on animal behaviour written by Temple Grandin, a remarkable woman, who lectures all over the world on animal welfare, especially livestock, and on the nature of autism. The book is co-authored by Catherine Johnson, a mother of two children with autism.Temple Grandin is an associate professor of animal science at Colorado State University. She courageously went public about her diagnosis of autism. She also has an international reputation in the meat-packing industry, for her ground-breaking designs of humane cattle-handling equipment, techniques, and setting standards of good practice in handling animals.Grandin has two main aims in this book. She aims to show how problems in animal behaviour can be resolved by understanding the causes of the behaviour. To this end, she has analysed livestock behaviour down to its smallest details, so that she can predict what an animal will do. She has extensive experience in being called in to trouble-shoot difficult behaviour in domestic and agricultural animals, including cattle,pigs, dogs and horses. She has synthesized the knowledge of animal breeders, trainers and ethologists, into rules and practical advice on how to manage difficult animals.Her second aim is to develop a new theory of autism. She argues that the autistic mind is closer to the animal mind than it is to the typical human mind, when it comes to perception of detail. This opens the possibility of new ways of understanding autism. There are autistic ""savants"" who can identify a prime number with uncanny speed, or can perform complex calculations faster than a computer.. In all of these instances, the individual has systematized a mathematical system. Grandin extends her understanding to living creatures.Grandin has tried to systematize animal behavior. She starts from the animal's perspective and asks; what kinds of stimuli might make an animal frightened? What kinds of stimuli might make an animal aggressive? What do we know about the neuroscience of animal drives that might help us predict its behaviour? Grandin's analysis of animal behaviour results in her understanding it to the point of being able to predict it, and to remedy faults and problems.Here are some examples of how slight changes in an animal's environment can produce strong, often alarming reactions. Changes in lighting from outside to inside building can frighten cattle and pigs. Pools of water can frighten them when caught in the light. Flapping objects such as coats or rags near where they have to walk can really scare them.Unfamiliar noises from generators etc can unnerve them and cause panic.As a dog trainer and elephant handler, I realise the importance of knowing your animal and trying to see things they way that the animal does. I have learned to read the body language of my dogs, so as to predict their behavior. Their running action when hunting squirrels is totally different from that when they have the scent of a bitch in season. My German Shepherd has a fast purposeful trot with his head up when he is planning the pursuit of an interesting female dog. He also stops looking around for me, because at that time I have temporarily ceased to exist for him, so if I want to stop him, I know I have to act fast with a stop command. If I know the bitch is friendly to him, I usually just let him get on with it and re-call him when his curiousity and/or lust is satisfied. I know one elephant in Chiang Mai Province who is terrified of small white birds, if they are feeding on the ground in a flock. She gets nervous and simply will not proceed past the birds. I just let her back up and find another route, or I dismount, leave her at a safe distance, and scare the birds off for her. She doesn't mind them at all if they are perched in the trees. She was probably startled by a flock of these birds when she was young.Many animal trainers and animal problem solvers such as Cesar Millan, who often deals with dog phobias, are aware of the importance of close observation and trying to see things the way the animal sees them. Grandin goes further in trying to systematize this knowledge. She has also examined the causes of aggression in domestic animals such as horses or dogs, and developed a set of rules. If a stallion is kept locked up and deprived of the opportunity to learn to socialise, it will be very aggressive to other stallions, and will try to rape mares. If a dog is not properly socialised with other dogs and people outside its family, it may well be aggressive, through fear. Or if it is allowed to be too dominant and intimidate its human family, then it may be aggressive to them. If it knows its place in the family, and is given clear boundaries, it will be contented and not cause such problems.Finally, she has examined animal breeding. If you cross a fast-growing rooster with a fast-growing hen, you get fast-growing chickens. But she identifies that such single-characteristic genetic breeding programmes always come with a down-side. The fast-growing offspring also have weak hearts, for example. If you cross fast-growing chickens with those selected for their strength, you get long-lived, fast-growing chickens, but they are monstrously aggressive. I think some of the accounts of the mistakes and cruelties inflicted on livestock here will cause more people to question the ethics of the whole process of commercial meat production, however well managed. In my view that is a good thing.Some readers may be shocked that Temple Grandin is saying that autistic people are more similar to animal than normal people. Isn't this suggesting that autistic people are subhuman? In fact, Grandin's claim is that animals have superior perception of detail, and so do people with autism. So, far from offending people with autism, she is if anything suggesting that non-autistic people have less sharp perception. In a way she is saying that it is the ""normal"" people who are handicapped, because they miss all this detail, and make many mistakes when trying to remember events. We know that this is the case from ""eye-witness"" testimony, which often turns out to be unreliable , because our brains construct memories, make assumptions, and change details and sequences, often in the very process of recalling them. She links the two themes of her book by arguing that a person with autism will have a greater affinity for animals than will a person without autism, because the same sorts of unexpected changes like flickering lights, or sudden small movements or sounds that might startle an animal, might also startle a person with autism. She goes further to argue that understanding animal perception might help us understand autistic perception.Getting back to the elephant example, Grandin mentions the fact that they use infrasonic (low rumbles) to communicate and possibly even seismic communication (ground vibrations) to send messages to their family members across distances as great as 25 miles. Elephants when distress, slam their trunks on the ground. The elephant I know with the white bird phobia does this if the birds get too near her. I agree with Temple here, that the elephant is communicating her distress to other elephants. In fact elephants do a whole range of things with their prehensile trunks. They explore their environment, comfort each other, pick up food and objects such as sticks to scratch with. Elephants normally sleep standing up, and often with their eyes open. You know when an elephant is asleep because its trunk is totally relaxed and resting on the ground at the tip. This is important because you should never startle a sleeping elephant. You should make a gentle sound, and let it wake up first, and you should never approach an elephant from behind or straight ahead of it. Their vision is poor and they are happier if you approach from the front but to one side, so they clearly see you coming.I am delighted to see that towards the end of the book, she discusses the evidence that humans co-evolved with wolves, in other words that we changed them and they changed us. This is something that I have long believed. Dog and human bones have been found in burials dating back 14,000 years, so some archaeologists concluded that domestication of dogs too place then. But Robert Wayne and his team at UCLA examined through DNA testing found that dogs started to diverge from wolves about 135,000 years ago. He suggest, and Temple and I agree with him, that proto humans, wolves that were slowly becoming dogs, were developing together, and were already closely associated. Many finds of wolf bones and humans bones together,date from more than 100,000 years ago.This suggests that they were associating at a time when homo sapiens were just evolving from homo erectus. This means they had few tools, were perhaps pre linguistic. The wolves with their superior sense of smell and superior pack based hunting skills, probably taught the proto humans the value of cooperation with them and with each other. Grandin argues that human social structures resembles that of wolves, more closely that that of primates. Even stronger evidence is that fact that the mid-brain of humans, which handles sensory data, including scenting smell, shrank over 10,000 years ago, while the fore-brain which handles language, reasoning and planning skills remained the same. The suggestion is that many of the mid brain functions of humans were not needed so much because the dogs were handling that side of things. The camp dogs were scenting, hearing and identifying prey and dangerous threats, for the humans, so the human brain was free to specialise and organise, develop language and cultural skills. Grandin suggest that this is probably why homo sapiens were able to flourish, while Neanderthals with similar brains to humans, did not, because they were not cooperating with wolves or proto dogs.I think this evidence may well explain why so many humans, including me, have such a strong affinity with dogs, and wolves. We are ancient companions.Interested readers can find out more about my experiences with dogs, elephants and other animals, in my book: OF MICE & ZEN.ANIMAL ENCOUNTERS IN THE LIFE OF A WANDERING BUDDHIST (free samples of Goodreads and Amazon).As I have made clear, I greatly appreciated this book. One important detail on which I disagree with her, is on the use of shock collars and invisible electric fences on dogs who chase joggers and cyclists, or dogs who roam. She advocates these as necessary to prevent these problems. I disagree. Such devices often traumatize dogs and can cause the dog to get injured. One unfortunate collie was so traumatized by the shock fence, that she would never leave the house and started pooping on the floor. These devices are barbaric if used by careless, inexperienced people, and they are not necessary. I have trained many dogs not to chase people, vehicles, or livestock and not to run off, without recourse to such devices. It just takes more time and effort on the part of the trainer. You have to be able to bond with, and communicate with the dog, to predict its behaviour, and intervene then. Anyone resorting to these electric shock devices is simply evading that responsibility. I think this issue is one where Temple Grandin's background in livestock management works against her. There, the use of electric devices is seen as normal, but in dog care ? Surely not acceptable."
291,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15704502-colleen,5,"I wasn't able to read this book in one setting or even 2 settings and, maybe, that's a good thing because then I took the time to reflect on the way humans do things and why. It's intriguing to compare how Temple and I relate to animals and to reflect upon our differing realities. I shall reflect upon the following statement for a long time: ""Normal people can't see all those little changes without a lot of training and effort, because their brains process them unconsciously. So normal people are drawing what they ""see,"" which is the finished object, after their brains have put it all together. It's ironic that we always say autistic children are in their own little world because if Dr. Snyder is right it's normal people who are living inside their heads. Autistic people are experiencing the actual world much more directly and accurately than non-autistic people, with all their inattentional blindness, change blindness, and their every-other-kind-of blindness."" I was drawn to this book because I'm a born animal lover and because I have much curiosity about the natural world. I gained much perspective from Temple's book in regards to the how and way animals relate to world, but also gained a deeper understanding of the inner workings of human brain. Book initiated much reflection upon some of my preconceived assumptions of intelligence and those reflections definitely re-configured my understanding to include the many different types of animal geniuses.Because of how Temple described her reality, I have rearranged my assumed perceptions of what is the correct way to view the world; and I have adopted a better understanding of, and respect for, the autistic point of view. Temple's story reminds me to not be so quick to assume that my way is the right way. In regards to my life as an educator, I've gleaned more understanding of autistic children. I interacted with autistic children during my career, and those experiences caused me to assume that autistic children needed to interact with environment in a way that was quite rigid. After reading this book, I wouldn't describe my experiences with autistic children in quite that way. Now, I know that it wasn't so much that they were always trying to say their way was the right way, but, rather, that they just couldn't ""see"" things my way---and I couldn't see things their way. So, I don't think this book is about what's the right way or the wrong way to see the world; but, rather, the takeaway message is that human reality is affected by brain function, human experience, emotion, and context. It is highly valuable for all of us to share our realities of the world---and highly valuable for us to listen to the realities of others. I recommend this book for everyone. Another important take away is that most of us don't take the time to think about why we do things the way we do because that would just take too much time and be inefficient; but, oftentimes, it would be helpful and useful to reflect upon how and why we do things differently so we can compare our actions and results for the purpose of getting deeper understanding of alternate views. Since non-autistic people don't feel compelled to evaluate or alter their ""normal"" way of doing things (because those ways are an accepted way), it is likely non-autistic people also don't see the full ramification of doing some things in the ""normal"" way. On the other hand, the autistic person trying to cope with the majority viewpoint is compelled to do some analysis and evaluation in order to cope with the most-accepted standards of thinking and behavior imposed upon them. Temple describes many situations in which her non-standard thinking actually resulted in actions that were more acceptable to animals. She offers numerous stories on how the non-autistic person can learn from the autistic person about better ways of doing things by exploring alternative viewpoints and evaluating their assumptions about reality. Temple explains---in a nonjudgmental way---that the autistic view of the world is another reality, and that the autistic and non-autistic brain function differently resulting in some specific and differing autistic and non-autistic viewpoints and actions. Most enlightening to me is that the autistic reality offers the non-autistic person a window through which they can view their ""normal"" perceptions, actions, and viewpoints. Temple offers an alternative view of the non-autistic person's reality, which in the case of livestock management, encouraged humans to handle animals more humanely and more efficiently.This story has stirred in me the desire to reflect upon the assumptions I make about the BEST way to be with animals, and also has changed my view of autism. It's awesome when anyone, who resides a bit out of the norm, shares their story because we are reminded that change is good, that evaluation of our actions is important, and that the norm is only a norm for a short moment in time. I don't view autism negatively; but, rather, appreciate the autistic genius for seeing in pictures and noticing details that my brain ignores. Temple's story has encouraged me tap into the ignored realities of my daily existence."
292,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7729729-alison,2,"Temple Grandin is a huge name in animal welfare. Or, she was. She contributed amazingly to the field, but this book is definitely a product of its time.I couldn't finish it. Some of the anecdotes were interesting, but a lot of the information itself was outdated. Dominance theory hasn't been taken seriously in the animal world for some years now and this was the main theory of her book. The parts about how animal brains work and how she related it to her experience as an autistic woman were really interesting, but after the chapters on how you have to show pigs and horses and dogs who's boss I'm left wondering how much of the rest of it is out of date and considered ridiculous in 2019 by brain...scientists? I wonder how much of it even Ms. Grandin would still stand by.Even back when it was considered cutting edge, there were certain things that would have bothered me. She mashed personal opinion with scientific evidence with abandon. There was a lot of speculation, a lot of ""No one has done any studies on this specifically, but I bet that..."" which is not what I'm looking for in an educational read. I think that when you're writing from such a position of authority it's irresponsible to throw your opinion around like it's fact. It also didn't have the circumspection I've come to expect in pop science books. The first few chapters focusing on the basics of the field and disclaiming on how their results aren't necessarily definitive, how narrow the case study was, how new research is coming out, etc. I'm gonna be honest, I love that part. It was a little disappointing for it to be missing in one of the first books I've been able to read about my own field.From a writing standpoint, it was pretty awful. She's very ""write how you talk"" which makes it easy to follow, but it must take decades to have a conversation with her with the way she's constantly inserting irrelevant facts and stories. If she wants to write a memoir that's fine, but this book was supposed to be about a specific topic and she apparently had no editor to ask if paragraphs or entire pages were actually contributing to her point. This book could have been like 150 pages and been complete. I'm sorry Ms. Grandin but I'm not reading a book about animal behavior to find out how the government would be so much better if everyone just thought like you did.I did make it an admirable halfway through before giving up. I just have more valuable things to read with my time. If you're looking for a meaningful read about animal behavior, pick up something shorter that was written in the past couple of years."
293,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91724581-carol-aguilar,3,"	I read the book Animals In Translation. I discovered this book because it was in the no AR section and it caught my attention because it had the word Animals in it. I enjoyed the book in some parts and in some parts I didn't. In some parts it even made me angry.	The book was really good because Temple Grandin did a great way of explaining. I learned things about autism that I didn't know. I also really learned things about the brain.She really made sure you knew what autism is and how people with and without autism act and react, before saying how animals and people with autism have a connection and can help each other. She also explained a lot of things that were not related to autism. For example when she was talking about the behavior of humans and animals and that anthropomorphizing a animal is the worst thing you can do it really got me thinking. Do I anthropomorphize my pets and other animals. Is it dangerous if I do it? She also really explained that animals do and will feel emotion. She gave many examples of this for example the cats helping each other out during a delivery of a baby or saying the cows feel emotion when they are separated from their young. Even though they already “reached” a age in which they won't miss their young. This is where I start to not like the book. 	 What I didn't like was that Temple Grandin was saying all these great things about animals for example saying that humans and animals have different brain but also awfully a lot in common, saying how cows can be just like a dog and play just like one,and even saying how they can be a great companion for people with autism. But yet she talks about animals being used in labs and being tested on and even being used in her” humane” squeezing chute and humane ways to hand a animal going or getting ready for slaughter. It was very conflicting. It's like saying you love animals yet you still eat them. Or saying your against rape yet you eat dairy products.	 I think someone who would enjoy this book is anyone that is interested between the connection of animals with people with autism and even with people without it. Anyone also ready to read a book with a lot of information about the connection of humans and animals should read it."
294,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91381557-trey-hall,4,"Reading this fascinating collection of scientific experiments and phenomenological wonderings about animals' feelings, consciousness, and language was like trying to watch all at once the movements of a vast mobile on a windy balcony: you can sense that the different beauties, velocities, and fluctuations of all the pieces are connected, but your mind simply can't map the connections: in a way that leads to grandeur and awe, and occasionally to frustration at your perceptual limits.As a starting point, the author reflects on her own autism - and part of autistic perception, in general - as potentially similar to non-human animal patterns of perception and understanding. [I acknowledge this idea could be understandably offensive to some. Grandin writes in a full-on style and makes no apologies. Whether the science is far-out there or not, I'm not educated enough to say, but I found it compelling]. For example, she suggests that animals (whom she studies and loves) might share the same ""hyper-specific intelligence"" (not conceptual; not organizing the raw data perceived into any representative, and often smoothed-out, whole or schema; but seeing the minutiae of component parts without organizing them) and ""mental image language"" (thinking not in words or concepts but in pictures) that autistic people frequently describe having. From there she spends most of the book imagining what the multiple intelligences and emotional lives of animals might be like. I learned so much reading this book, but beyond learning, I experienced an increased sense of compassion for, friendship with, and sincere regard and love for animals, whose fear- and thought- and pain- and love- and joy-worlds, I'm convinced, are much more more dynamic, complex, and psychologically variegated than many scientists in particular and people in general think or allow themselves to think.For me, this expanding awareness raises serious ethical questions, to be sure - and I'm already a pescatarian - but more than that, it invites me into a deeper participation in my/our essential communion with all creatures, in the way I try to see, the way I pray, etc."
295,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44661992-michael,3,"My first thoughts about this book were: I wonder if I can get a refund from Colorado State University for the hundreds of dollars worth of tuition money I spent in Vet school for the privilege of listening to Temple Grandin present the exact same material as contained in this book. Given that in book form I was better able to concentrate on the material without being distracted by the author’s autistic mannerisms, I preferred the book form. Given that I checked the book out for free at the library I feel that I way overpaid in school.Temple Grandin is an interesting character, she is perhaps the most famous autistic person alive today. She believes that her autism causes her to think like a cow, and many view her as some sort of animal behavior autistic savant. I find these claims dubious at best. She does have a decent understanding of animal behavior, but has spent years studying it. It doesn’t sound as if it came naturally to her. As she tells a story of when she was young she couldn’t tell small dogs apart from cats because they were the same size. I think this shows that she wasn’t born with some innate understanding of animals, but actually started further behind most people. I believe she has worked hard to gain her understanding.One of my biggest problems with the book is that she spouts off old wives tales, stereotypes, anecdotal evidence, and her own untested theories as if they were all fact.She is fond of telling how she likes to lay down in the middle of a pen of cattle, and allow them come up and lick her. Yet I have been unable to grasp what insights she has gleaned by doing this. Being an individual who spends most of my time in cattle pens, I just keep thinking that is a disgusting place to lay down.With that said I must admit that despite her autism or perhaps because of it she has managed to turn her interest in animal behavior into a successful career. Additionally if my clients all had cattle handling facilities designed by her, and followed her principals it would make my life much easier."
296,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1300439-paula,2,"Like Temple Grandin, I believe that animals are more intelligent than we have given them credit for. I've read studies of crows, gray parrots, octopus, and ground squirrels in particular that reveal some amazing capabilities including strategizing, language, and tool making. So, I came into this text prepared. Grandin's comparisons between the capabilities, and limitations of autistic people with that of animals was interesting. Her understanding of ""normals"" was less impressive. Many of her claims about autistic people has more to do with intelligence than autism. For example, she claims autistic people are more observant than normal people. Whether this is true overall is speculative. I believe that intelligent people are more observant, and her claims to being hyper observant have as much to do with her intelligence as with her condition. She doesn't seem to separate the two at all. Autistic people have as broad a range of intelligence as normal people do. Yet, she doesn't parse out those traits that depend upon intelligence from those that depend upon an aberrant condition. She also claims that she has a particular insight into animal behavior and feelings that normal people cannot understand. This is also pure speculation. She deals mainly with ranchers, stockyard and slaughterhouse workers. These people have strong reason to believe that animals are less intelligent and less feeling than is likely the case. They do not represent all ""normals"". There are a great many normal animal trainers, and even pet owners who have great insight into the minds and feelings of animals. You don't have to be autistic to see that animals have feelings, and thoughts. You just have to care about animals, and not care about how much money you'll lose if the cattle keep getting injured. Her attitude toward veganism also shows a lack of understanding. She obviously did not study even the most rudimentary nutrition studies when she did her brief experiment in giving up meat. Watch The Game Changers if you think that eating vegan can leave anyone feeling weak! "
297,0156031442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2410849-juliet-wilson,4,"Subtitled 'the woman who thinks like a cow' this is a fascinating book about animal behaviour. Temple Grandin has autism and has used her different way of seeing the world as a way into understanding animals.Temple Grandin is an associate professor of animal science at Colorado State University. She has worked in the meat processing industry, helping to make slaughter houses more humane. As a vegetarian I didn't find this part of the book the easiest to read, but I have to admit that so many people are meat eaters who will never give up eating meat that it is vital that slaughter houses are made more humane. Also it is fascinating to read how the author thinks her way into the cow's mind, how it perceives the world and how it can be made to feel calmer and less threatened.The rest of the book looks at all kinds of animals, how they learn and how they relate to humans and whether the ways in which animals communicate can be considered to be true language, including the story of Alex the parrot, who seemed to be able to genuinely communicate and learn quicker than his owners and trainers expected . She outlines what makes dogs so good at being helper animals (particularly their sense of smell!) and how best to train dogs to increase their chances of growing up into well behaved, calm pets or working dogs (and she's a great believer in dogs working to give them a purpose in life!). The author constantly compares her own way of thinking as a person with autism to the way that animals think.All in all this is a fascinating book, whether your main interest is in autism in humans or in animal behaviour."

It was a case of the bad becoming normal, and it's a big danger in selective breeding programs.

Being close to animals brings some of it back.”Temple Grandin address two topics in this book: animals and autism. The connection between the two is far closer then I would have imagined. But by using her autistic mind, Grandin is able to understand animals in a way many people do not (or have to be trained to). As someone finding out late in life that they have Aspergers, her revelations on autism and autistic brains was eye-opening and affirming. Her ideas and research into animal behaviour and language are equally illuminating. I’m curious to know what we’ve learned about animal intelligence 15 years later. I suspect I’ll be reading more on this topic in future. There are a few moments in the book that show its age. Grandin uses ‘retarded’ several times, which I imagine was not seen as a slur 15 years back. And while she does so with no malice or condensation, for a modern reader it can be rather jarring. Additionally, there are a few stories of very severe animal abuse. Grandin uses these stories to argue in favour of animal welfare, but they are still quiet disturbing to read. These are things I feel is important for people to know going into a book that I can otherwise heartily recommend. Grandson’s love and fascination of animals is present in every page, and her work in increasing animal welfare in the meat industry was huge. If either topic is of interest to you, this book is worth your time.  "
