0,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg,4,"This book is split between general anecdotes about animals the author has kept and studied, and more specific details about observed behaviors of particular species of animals, notably water shrews, domestic dogs (his dog of choice was the Alsatian, a puppy Alsatian is seen here with a cat that looks like a fatter Mooncheese)and jackdaws. The writing style is light and humorous while still being fascinating about the observed ways animals interact in relatively natural environments. There were some similarities between this book and the Gerald Durrell book, The Drunken Forest I read a few weeks ago. I enjoyed this book greatly. I feel like I owe it a better review than I'm going to give it, but I'm not feeling especially inspired to get thoughts from inside my head out in to the internets world. The authors approach to observing and living with animals (he keeps them mostly at his house and property in relative non-captivity) is to view them on their own terms. Even though the animals aren't in their fully natural environment, he goes to great lengths to allow them to freely move about and behave as they naturally would. From his observations he shows that many animals have quite remarkable intelligences, especially when the behaviors are studied in-themselves and not looked anthropomorphically, he's a big proponent to the idea that a lot of misunderstanding about animals comes from people comparing animal behavior to human qualities. I had a lot of fun reading this book. I'm not having so much fun trying to write a review, so I'm going to stop. I'd recommend this though, and I tried to get Karen to read it but she said she was too busy because of 'school', or some nonsense like that.One fault I did find with the book; I don't like reading that foxes aren't really as smart as everyone thinks they are. I'll just keep to my own opinions here and not listen to some 'scientist'. I'll treat this fact just like a conservative treats scientists about global-warming. LalalalalalaAnd in other animal news, but not having anything to do with this book (because Raccoons aren't found in Europe, or so I am led to believe if the BBC magazine about nature is to be believed), I discovered last night that there is a raccoon living on my street here in Queens! (this isn't the raccoon living on my street, I didn't have the time to whip out my camera and snap a picture of him, but this one lives in Central Park)."
1,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9777942-joe,5,"Did you know that, when it comes to combat, a turkey fights like a wolf while a peacock fights like a panther? Did you know that fish can suffer from brain-teasers? How about that jackdaws don't innately know to fear their natural predators; relying on social learning over instinct? Before I read King Solomon's Ring I didn't know any of this.Before I read this book I thought I knew a lot about animal behavior so I was shocked by how much I learned. This book was written in the 1950s and every chapter held revelations. The prose isn't perfect for the modern ear; the result of sixty years stylistic age, a translation from German and a writer who was first a scientist. But despite all this, the text proves engaging, informative and clear. Lorenz's passion for his work shines through and his sense of humor survives the translation.But most interesting of all is Lorenz himself; as close to a real-world Dr. Doolittle as may ever live. His antics with animals mystified friends and strangers (including once when he called to his lost pet bird at a train station, causing it to swoop down to him) and more than once one of his experiments ended in tragedy (such as the fate of a large toad he housed with the wrong animals.) He was a man who loved animals but warned against anthropomorphism and he invented a whole branch of science (ethology) purely out of curiosity. So give this book a read and maybe you'll see the animal world a little different. I do.Edited 11-20-2017"
2,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2682871-gini,5,"This is one of the most wonderful books I've read in a long time. It was recommended to me years ago by a friend who lived on a farm in Vermont. He said it was the best book on animals ever. IT's so much more than that. Lorenz was an animal behaviorist who, at times, writes like a poet. The translation from German is beautiful. The book is laugh-out-loud funny in places, horrifying in others (such as the descriptions of how water shrews or water beetle larvae eat their prey.)It was written in 1951 after World War I, which Lorenz only mentions in passing. I looked him up on the Internet: he won a noble prize in 1973 and changed his focus from animals to people. However I also learned he was a member of the Nazi Party. He served as a medic in the war until he was captured and thrown in a Russian prison. (When he was released he took his pet starling). It's hard to reconcile the gentle author of this book with someone who could buy in to Nazi principles about race. He was able to clear his name publicly but I it sadly affected my impression of the book. His past was always lurking in the background. Still I would recommend it to anyone. "
3,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48775114-alice,4,"Lorenz's understanding of animals' social rules and behavior is uncanny. If it weren't for his detailed explanation of all his observations and how he obtained them I would believe him to be a true Dr Doolittle. In addition to his amazing knowledge he is a patient narrator, he introduces the reader to each species with no hurry and eases him into the animal's habitat and social hierarchy. By the time the chapter is over you can't help feeling like you've observed the jackdaws and water-shrews with Lorenz and grown familiar with their ways. In addition to patience, the famous ethologist is very clear while presenting his findings. He's witty and profoundly passionate, I felt like I got to know him as well as the animals. He isn't all science, he tells personal stories, funny ones too that made me snicker, while always being extremely respectful. His relentless steps to follow the animals of his current observation often brought him into the most ridiculous situations, I have no doubt the city of Altenberg had a very different opinion from my own on Lorenz, probably more along the lines of a madman than a pioneer. After surprising me with the intricate mechanisms in the de-throning of the ruling jackdaw tyrant he stated as follows: ""You think I humanize the animal? [...] Believe me, I am not mistakenly assigning human properties to animals: on the contrary, I am showing you what an enormous animal inheritance remains in man, to this day.""This passage clearly stated what had been one of Lorenz's objectives all along in the book. One that I had been ignoring behind all the fun facts about animals. The insights on human nature are unexpectedly striking and truly thought-provoking. Although this isn't exactly a page-turner I really enjoyed learning everything this book had to offer. I don't think I've ever found such a profound respect for someone in a book as I have for Lorenz in reading ""King Solomon's Ring"". His dedication to the study of animal behavior is something I've never seen before and admire deeply. I recommend this to all curious animal-lovers, you won't regret it. If this hasn't been sufficient to convince you here are some of the most fun and interesting pieces of knowledge that will stay with me long after putting this volume back on its shelf. You'll only know more by reading the full thing!I learnt that:•large parrots and cockatoos can suffer from boredom•the lion is the laziest predatory beast•swans in zoos are rendered incapable of flight by the operation of pinioning one wing•if you ever wish to buy birds Lorenz recommends a married bullfinch pair as an excellent choice for sweet singing small birds and a starling, or the smaller siskin, for company and affection. •to the domesticated dog, its owner is the combination of the alpha male of a dog-person pack and the affectionate mother •contrary to popular belief, even when at the point of starvation a wild wolf will not attack a fellow member of its pack •in birds there is no law of attraction of opposites aka sexually mature volatiles may court individuals of the same sex•jackdaws know through acquired knowledge their enemies, not by innate instinct, they are quite literally informed through the handing-down of information from the old generation to the next. •jackdaws also go through a period of what a man could only define as engagement and marriage, although no rings are involved here, for obvious reasons•cichlids fishes may sometimes skin each other"
4,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61573845-aliceinbagend-lydiamae,3,A wonderful book filled with amazing animal facts that are weaved in the book in a extremely interesting way...
5,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20282621-antonia,5,"The first time I read this great little book was in high school. Revisiting it some 40 years later, I found it just as charming as when I first read it. King Solomon and Lorenz are one and the same; both adept at communicating with social animals, including jackdaws, ravens, water shrews, dogs, geese, and a myriad of others that were kept in or around Lorenz's home in Altenberg, Austria. Lorenz's observations about the social structures and habits of these animals are written in laymen's terms with much humor but not lacking scientific insight. The seriousness of the last chapter revealing the nature of man and how he wields his weapons without mercy lets the reader reflect on Lorenz's prediction that man will not survive since, unlike the wolf or dog, he has no inhibitions about destroying his own kind. This is a great little book for everyone who loves animals and loves observation of nature."
6,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8350499-will,5,"Beyond hysterical. A typical sentence: ""A large Nemestrinus monkey bursting with energy, owned by my friend, the late Count Thun-Hohenstein, possessed, even when adult, a deeply rooted respect for an ancient Javanese monkey half of his size who had tyrannized him in the days of his youth."""
7,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54820207-vladimir,3,"Not that good as ""On Aggression"" (one of my favorites), but lovely. Lorentz writes about animals with passion and wit."

(And i'm sure as hell he had great fun while doing it, it's obvious from his tales he loved all kinds of animals.)Also, it had some interesting new knowledge for me, who considers herself a quite knowledgeable animal lover. I didn't know - for example - that the famous geese following Lorenz like he's their mother thing was an accident. He didn't expect them to imprint on him this hard. I laughed more than I expected first :)"
9,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85359480-chris-downes,5,"This book is a such a treat. Supplemented with his own whimsical little drawings, King Solomon's Ring is full of tales about Lorenz's attempts - not all of which were successful but all fascinating in their own way - to keep wild animals in his Austrian homestead. I'll never look at jackdaws the same ever again!"
10,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6258443-kinch,5,"A total delight! Lorenz opens up a world at once scientific and magical, his connection with the animals he writes about is inspiring and honestly I wish more of us led lives connected to other living beings like he did"
11,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7560311-arun,5,"This writ by a scientist who not only 'did' Science, but breathed science, ate science, drank science - lived science - is one of the most breathtaking accounts a person can read of man's relation to that of natural world. In our busy lives we often forget how nature looks; in our mindless urbanisation we often forget how extravagant the lives of animals are.Lorenz is a scientist who remained a scientist throughout his life; even up to his death. The title that Lorenz is the man who can talk with animals is entirely true. In this enthralling and entertaining writ-up, he not only provides to the reader a glimpse at the wonders we miss but also was extremely successful in creating an urge to live the life that he lived; live a life with nature, not away from it.Most of the accounts that he details he takes in lighter vain although it is quite clear how much of a loss his animals incurred to him - financial, societal status and, at times, peace. But yet the man takes it all in humour, for he understands animal language - he knew that they did not intend the damages.How wonderful might he have felt - a male - to having acted as the 'mother' of many baby gosling! How tremendously happy he would have felt when his Jock (jackdaw) would come by flying, searching for him amid a huge crowd in the railway station! How extraordinary his persistence is when the jackdaws regularly mess things up! Here we see a man who is not just a 'scientist,' but a true 'naturalist.'This book will instil in the reader a deep urge to rear animals in their homes. This book will detail the reader of how marvellous a relationship that we humans miss. This book will bless the reader with occassional heart-warming smiles, upon feeling vicariously the joy Lorenz had had with his animals. This book though was written in a cheerful way throughout will nonetheless warn the reader of a potential self-destruction that we may create on ourselves. This book is a book that the reader will never regret to having read."
12,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1349220-serena,2,"King Solomon’s Ring by Konrad Lorenz, an Austrian ethologist, is not your typical science book in that it is written with a less-scientific audience in mind. Complete with minimal illustrations from Lorenz, the book does not read like a scientific experiment that can be precisely duplicated, but more like a series of observations and anecdotes from a man who invited the wild into his home. Unlike King Solomon, Lorenz claims not to need a magic ring to learn the language of animals and to communicate with them. While there are discussions of domesticated and wild dogs, among other animals, Lorenz mainly focuses on the behaviors of the water shrew, his aquarium fish, and the Jackdaw.While considered a premier examination of animal behavior and discussing in detail the phenomenon of imprinting, on some occasions he appears to anthropomorphize these animals, making them seem more human than they are, particularly when discussing their mating rituals. Lorenz also is very descriptive of the animals and their interactions with one another and with the humans who lived in the home and surrounding neighborhood. These descriptions, while interesting to a scientist, may border on tedium for others.Read the full review:http://savvyverseandwit.com/2012/11/k..."
13,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4802663-deborah-ideiosepius,5,"A lovely book which was on my suggested reading list for a final year, zoology, advanced animal behaviour course. This is a wonderfully book written by a keen observer of animal behaviour. Konrad Lorenz is a Nobel prize winner for physiology of medicine and one of the founders of ethology – the systematic study of animal behaviour. It is a rare treat that such an important book be so readable and so enticing to all who love animals."
14,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26922906-lindsey,5,"Very delightful book, and anyone who has an interest in animal behavior/ old school naturalists should read this. Much lighter than Meet Meets Dog, and more informative since he includes chapters on a variety of animals, including water shrews (my favorite chapter). "
15,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17106919-matthias,5,"I loved this book. Some of the information might be a little outdated. But I loved reading about the Jackdaw colony with the love triangle between Bluegold, Rightred and Leftgreen. Lorenz touches on anthropomorphising non-human animals, first telling us that we shouldn't do it too much but that it's not inherently incorrect either. ""This does not invest the animal with human properties, but on the contrary, shows up the still remaining animal in man."" He also touched on a relevant point today very briefly, ""It is typical of this extraordinary state of fixation of sexual desire on a particular and unnatural object that it cannot be reversed."" Take out the word 'unnatural' and here you have the truth that sexuality can't be reversed, even in the most extremes of cases where a peacock finds his sexual desires unfulfilled because he only wants a tortoises affections! And I have little doubt that this also applies to gender identity. While the right may argue for conversion therapy and that transsexuals are mentally ill, the left argues that both are social constructs. The right is wrong, and the left is somewhat correct, there are some social and environmental elements to both, but there comes the point where it ultimately becomes fixed and is no longer 'fluid.' We're born with predispositions towards one direction more than the other, and the environment will either nurture it to the fullest degree or not. Lorenz ultimately voices ideas that I've tried and wanted to find the words to but never quite managed. This book has some funny little stories about his life and relationships with animals. If you share the same enthusiasm, you will be reminded of your own times when you were 'caught' perhaps crawling around a bush dressed up in a ghillie suit to get a better view of that wren. Or perhaps you prefer to dress up as the Devil to disguise yourself while ringing corvids, so they don't recognise you later and mob you. "
16,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2143739-amy-turner,5,"Lorenz is best known for his work getting baby birds to imprint on him. Here's a selection from the book about that:""At the beginning of these experiments, I had sat myself down in the grass amongst the ducklings, and in order to to make them follow me, had dragged myself, sitting, away from them. As soon, however, as I stood up and tried, in a standing posture, to lead them on, they gave up, peered searchingly on all sides, but not upward towards me and it was not long before they began that penetrating piping of abandoned ducklings that we are accustomed simply to call ""crying"". They were unable to adapt themselves to the fact that their foster-mother had become so tall. So I was forced to move along, squatting low, if I wished them to follow me. This was not very comfortable; still less comfortable was the fact that the mallard mother quacks unintermittently. If I ceased for even the space of half a minute from my melodious ""Quagh, gegegeg"", the necks of the ducklings became longer and longer corresponding exactly to ""long faces"" in human children--and did I then not immediately recommence quacking, the shrill weeping began anew. As soon as I was silent, they seemed to think that I had died or perhaps that I loved them no more.""The book is full of interesting stories and philosophical musings about birds, dogs and other animals, including human beings. The whimsical illustrations by the author show that despite his scientific fame, he didn't take himself too seriously. "
17,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51465850-jeremy,3,"This was an unusual read that was not anywhere close to what I had expected, yet was surprisingly interesting. Rather than talking about King Solomon's ability to speak with animals through the use of a magical ring, Lorenz shares his personal experiences in raising and talking with animals. Having gained many unique insights due to a closer and more intimate relationship with geese, jackdaws, dogs, and water shrews, Lorenz is able to take the reader with him on a study of animal behavior. Although Lorenz was often times viewed by his neighbors as a deranged bird calling madman, he was able to summon his birds on several occasions by using the calls he deciphered after years of observing their behavior. Not only is animal behavior a topic of discussion in this book, but so were the topics of animal care, misconceptions regarding animal species, and anthropomorphism. Overall, this was a strange book that made me question as to why I was reading it, but the curious nature of the author himself kept me attached. It was full of surprising stories about his life and also instilled in me a greater desire to buy an animal as a pet and watch its life unfold. Read it if you have the time and a copy readily available, but I would not go out of my way to find this particular book. "
18,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10603029-kimberlie,4,"Really interesting and insightful book into several species of animals I am not familiar with (jackdaws, shrews) and some that I am (starlings, dogs.) I enjoyed the first 2/3rds of the book so much I could barely put it down. Once I did, it was increasingly difficult to return to. I think the chapter on dogs lost my interest, so I ended up scanning the rest and reading the interesting parts.I love reading lines that sort of highlight themselves because you can relate to them so deeply. On page 30 (paperback publ 1997 Meridan) is a quote that I had to re-read and even share with friends:""...for he who has once seen the intimate beauty of nature. cannot tear himself away from it again. He must become either a poet or a naturalist and, if his eyes are good and his powers of observation are sharp enough, he may well become both."" Originally written in German, the translator did an amazing job of making the English version almost lyrical. "
19,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91823857-mark-s-wife-sue,5,"Lorenz is one of the most famous ethnologists, deservedly so. In this book he relates much of his personal experiences with animals he has owned and raised, and some others. Though much of it is about dogs (hooray! dogs) his observances include cats, birds, and other animals. My edition included small illustrations by the author. Though I really was most interested in understanding dog psychology, I found the jackdaw chapters very compelling. Who knew? I liked the anecdote about the little bird wife who moved up the social ladder. You don’t worry about the guy at the top, you worry about getting past the guy right above you and staying above the one below. I also found his tales about dogs of his past, about the countryside he lived in, rich and nostalgic. Lorenz was at the top in his field, and this book shows us that he was also kind, caring and wanted to know and understand these other species who also have complicated lives."
20,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39312163-emily,4,"This is one of the darker, more disconcerting books I've read. On the surface it's an extremely charming quasi-memoir, an account by a naturalist of many animals he's kept, what he's learned in studying them, and their many endearing behaviors. The English translation is cozier than a favorite sweater, and my edition is adorned with delightful sketches in the margins.However, the book is full of quiet references to the recent war. All these animals lived at his house before the war; the surrounding Austrian landscape was beautiful until the war; during the war the author had an extended absence from home.Konrad Lorenz joined the Nazi party in 1938. He wrote papers on the scientific justification of Nazi eugenics policies. He was a military psychologist conducting racial studies on ""German-Polish half-breeds."" He was also a Soviet prisoner of war for four years, captured at the Russian front. He attempted to obscure these facts in later life, but he was a prominent scientist - winner of the Nobel prize! - and the details all came out eventually.There are multiple haunting passages in the book where he compares the nature of the animals he studies to the nature of humanity, often determining that humans are the more bestial. He's in a position to know."
21,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6638898-tim-weed,5,"Not always a page-turner, but this closely observed classic contains surprising insights about (non-human) animal behavior that still feel entirely fresh. Lorenz was an original, a brilliant scientist and thinker with a practical bent and a knack for sustained empirical observation. The results are intermittently revelatory, and interested humans still stand to learn a great deal. It might even permanently change your perspective!"
22,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54230327-david,5,"Lorenz's insight to animal behaviour is truly unique as he has spent most of his life living extremely close to animals. In this book he depicts the deep feelings, thoughts and social behaviour of a wide variety of animals. Lorenz's language is easily digestible, his storytelling is highly entertaining and his humour is superb. Relaxing and enjoyable reading."

The five stars fail to do justice to the outstanding content of the book. I might be biased though because of my lack of knowledge of ethology, zoology, and ornithology the domains in which Konrad Lorenz was a towering figure. However, I have learned surprising and exciting facts about mental life and the behavior of familiar animals and birds. The fact that Konrad Lorenz had all these animals in his yard, and he had the patience of observing their behavior and care for there well-being for long years is jaw-dropping. In light of the theory of evolution and taking into account the insights of the author, now I understand better the world around me. Wonderful book!"

43,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21611728-g-j-griffiths,5,"King Solomon's Ring by Konrad LorenzA simply wonderful book for anyone who has a love of animals, and is curious and fascinated by their behaviour. Konrad Lorenz is so obviously fond of his subjects but at the same time he treats them with a scientific distance and methodology that is worthy of emulation by other animal behaviourists. He demonstrates in this small book, written mainly for the layperson, an ability to write with wit and charm that captivates the reader from the first page.It is understandable, through the writing of such as Konrad Lorenz, why others are inspired to become zoologists, biologists and behaviour scientists. He devotes his whole house to his animal subjects and it is filled with animal chaos. The reader is kept entertained and amused throughout the book. We read about an intelligent raven; the wonders of an aquarium; the “taming of a shrew”; a hilarious tale of two men who carry a canoe followed by goslings, a dog and some ducklings. And all these tales are illustrated by his simple and (that word again) charming drawings.His book enables readers to understand animals more and, while it may not be considered a scientific treatise in the strict sense, Konrad Lorenz’s studies remain significant in the field of animal behaviour; thus this book remains extremely readable and a classic.I can recommend this book to adults and children alike, indeed all those who wonder what goes on in an animal’s mind and particularly to those young people considering a future career in the field of animal studies. It has much to offer anyone with no interest in animal behaviour since it is written with such respect, humour and charm that it serves as a reminder about the wonderful world of nature that so often seems to be forgotten by so many.I loved this book so much I had to refer to it in my novel, So What’s Next!So What's Next!"
44,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1089821-cora,4,"King Solomon's Ring is considered a classic on the subject of animal behavior. Konrad Lorenz was an ethologist (someone who studies animal behavior) who raised many animals at his home to study. Although he raised the animals and kept them at his home, he gave them free range of his home and the world around him in order to get a more realistic view of their behavior in their natural environment. In this book, Lorenz tells the reader about his observations of a number of animal species. The writing of the books is observational rather than scientific and very accessible to someone without a science background. One thing I found especially interesting is how World War II seemed to have affected Lorenz. He was German and much of his research was done in the 1930s and beyond. Although the book is about his observations of the animals, there are times when he allows how the war affected him to seep into the writing. For example after observing two doves tear each other apart in when he put them together in a cage for breeding purposes he writes, ""Only in two other instances have I seen similar horrible lacerations inflicted on their own kind by vertebrates: once, as an observer of the embittered fights of cichlid fishes who sometimes actually skin each other, and again as a field surgeon, in the late war, where the highest of all vertebrates perpetrated mass mutilations on members of his own species."" I would recommend this book to anyone interested in animal behavior or animals in general. There is a fun section on dogs and how their behavior is influenced by their wolf or jackal ancestors."

46,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45669105-toby,4," This is a great book written by the famous ethologist Konrad Lorenz. Having learned of his research with Greylag Geese and Jackdaws in an Ecology course, I grew interested in the man's work. I finally got around to reading this book years later and it has really made me regain an interest and appreciation for animals. In this book he tells of the many animals he has kept or studied over his life and elucidates their peculiar activities and interesting methods of survival. It is written at times with charm and can be really funny: He tells hilarious stories about his talking birds and how he got mallards to follow him as their mother by quacking. Other parts of the book are more detailed in describing the complex behaviour and interactions of various creatures, notably the fighting and mating behaviours of sticklebacks, siamese fighting-fish, and cichlids, the peculiar path-habits that watershrews form, and the social systems of jackdaws. This is great science writing, for it explains a decent amount of scientific information without ever challenging the reader. It explores the unique behaviours each species has developed, which are extremely surprising and complex at times, but is also insightful in getting us to understand the reasons for these differences. It is also really fun to learn about what an eccentric and committed character Lorenz was. The man loved his creatures and was extremely devoted to learning of their ways. He is an inspiration to all naturalists and scientists."

It is a book about animal behaviour by an Austrian ethologist, Konrad Lorenz. It originally came out in the later 40's, and while some of the prose is slightly dated, it is a wonderful read.Lorenz observed and documented all kinds of animals from the time he was a child, but is most well known for his work with jackdaws and greylag geese. Having watched both ""Winged Migration"" and ""The Making of Winged Migration,"" two films I also highly recommend (the making of is on the same DVD as the main feature), Lorenz's writing about imprinting on baby animals was fascinating.The whole time I was reading this book, I was enjoying it, but I was also wondering ""what made Midgely go so crazy for this work?""

Lorenz is able to transmit the joy of knowing animals in the simplest of iconic stories. Just think: this man LIVED the boyhood fantasy of befriending animals--I will never forget the description of calling to a raven soaring far overhead, which brought the bird down after a steep dive and flaring of wings onto his shoulder. It sends shivers down my spine to think of it. On a related note, his final chapters on the instincts of more dangerous animals to withhold their powers of destruction against their own species could provide the basis of a compelling analysis of nonviolence--indeed, Lorenz himself makes this connection to the ""turn the other cheek"" of the Sermon on the Mount. I would imagine there is some fruitful psychological study to be done here."

It struck me though that one of the defining characteristics of ethology as a field is the observation of animals in their natural environment. Scientists going into the field to observer their chosen species ""making a living"" as my advisor always said. In contrast to the comparative psychologists with their selected lab animals, running experiments and seeing what these animals were capable of. But when you read this book you realize Lorenz was not out in the field watching animals making a living, he was socializing them and letting them make a living in his house! I have mixed feelings about this as I myself work with socialized animals, although I don't generally let them run rampant in my house. It isn't necessarily good or bad, just interesting that this was not the case initially. "
51,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1744748-iris,4,"The bird behavior fascinated me, especially the social life of jackdaws and their ability to recognize human individuals.

The English translation was published in 1952. It's a seminal account of human-animal observation that has influenced generations of scientists and citizen scientists since its publication.

In addition this book is an excellent example of how knowledge aquired through science can be expressed in a beautiful artistic way without sacreficing neutrality. The story of the life of the jackdaws which takes place in the second to last chapter could probably be adapted as a full length motion picture and win every award known to man.

This is a wonderful collection of anecdotes from his personal life overrun with animals. He believes strongly that you cannot study a creature in a cage and so had all manner of wildlife (tamed and otherwise) given free reign of his house and surrounding areas. Detailed observations from a scientific mind in a time when animal behavior didn't have to be completley defined by quantitative data points and a little anthropomorphizing (gasp!) was regarded as just fine.

The book is a series of essays from his experiments and observations, not at all like the ususal scientific reads. The observations are intelligible to those un-scientific, but interested-in-animals kind of people. I found the chapters on the moles and dog types fascinating and entertaining. "

He demonstrates in this small book, written mainly for the layperson, an ability to write with wit and charm that captivates the reader from the first page.It is understandable, through the writing of such as Konrad Lorenz, why others are inspired to become zoologists, biologists and behaviour scientists. He devotes his whole house to his animal subjects and it is filled with animal chaos. The reader is kept entertained and amused throughout the book.

103,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21611728-g-j-griffiths,5,"King Solomon's Ring by Konrad LorenzA simply wonderful book for anyone who has a love of animals, and is curious and fascinated by their behaviour. Konrad Lorenz is so obviously fond of his subjects but at the same time he treats them with a scientific distance and methodology that is worthy of emulation by other animal behaviourists. He demonstrates in this small book, written mainly for the layperson, an ability to write with wit and charm that captivates the reader from the first page.It is understandable, through the writing of such as Konrad Lorenz, why others are inspired to become zoologists, biologists and behaviour scientists. He devotes his whole house to his animal subjects and it is filled with animal chaos. The reader is kept entertained and amused throughout the book. We read about an intelligent raven; the wonders of an aquarium; the “taming of a shrew”; a hilarious tale of two men who carry a canoe followed by goslings, a dog and some ducklings. And all these tales are illustrated by his simple and (that word again) charming drawings.His book enables readers to understand animals more and, while it may not be considered a scientific treatise in the strict sense, Konrad Lorenz’s studies remain significant in the field of animal behaviour; thus this book remains extremely readable and a classic.I can recommend this book to adults and children alike, indeed all those who wonder what goes on in an animal’s mind and particularly to those young people considering a future career in the field of animal studies. It has much to offer anyone with no interest in animal behaviour since it is written with such respect, humour and charm that it serves as a reminder about the wonderful world of nature that so often seems to be forgotten by so many.I loved this book so much I had to refer to it in my novel, So What’s Next!So What's Next!"
104,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1089821-cora,4,"King Solomon's Ring is considered a classic on the subject of animal behavior. Konrad Lorenz was an ethologist (someone who studies animal behavior) who raised many animals at his home to study. Although he raised the animals and kept them at his home, he gave them free range of his home and the world around him in order to get a more realistic view of their behavior in their natural environment. In this book, Lorenz tells the reader about his observations of a number of animal species. The writing of the books is observational rather than scientific and very accessible to someone without a science background. One thing I found especially interesting is how World War II seemed to have affected Lorenz. He was German and much of his research was done in the 1930s and beyond. Although the book is about his observations of the animals, there are times when he allows how the war affected him to seep into the writing. For example after observing two doves tear each other apart in when he put them together in a cage for breeding purposes he writes, ""Only in two other instances have I seen similar horrible lacerations inflicted on their own kind by vertebrates: once, as an observer of the embittered fights of cichlid fishes who sometimes actually skin each other, and again as a field surgeon, in the late war, where the highest of all vertebrates perpetrated mass mutilations on members of his own species."" I would recommend this book to anyone interested in animal behavior or animals in general. There is a fun section on dogs and how their behavior is influenced by their wolf or jackal ancestors."
105,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4926601-jennifer,5,"This book took me a long time to read. It was recommended to me by my dad back in August 2014. I didn't pick it up until November 2015 and I just finished it now. My dad's note was:""The other day, I happened to do a search on a book that I loved when I was in college back in 1972, and found there is a reprint (on Kindle as well): http://books.google.com/books/about/K...The author, Konrad Lorenz, was a Nobel prize winner, who studied animal behavior by raising animals himself. He described many animals in this book; including Cichlids and Siamese Fighting Fishes, etc. The one I read was a Chinese translation; I loved it, I believe you will too.Love,Dad""My dad is rarely emotional so this is an extremely emotional note from my father. Reading this book made me feel closer to him. I've watched many nature shows with my dad, raised fish with him, and this book brought everything together.It was hard for me to decide if this book was fiction or non-fiction for a long time. I looked it up later and it's categorized at non-fiction. I understand all the facts about animals are true, but the way he writes and the intimacy of the animals helps this book read more like fiction. I am someone who is rarely able to read non-fiction, but this book actually kept my attention the whole time. I am sad I finished it, though I very much see myself rereading throughout my lifetime.Friends, if you read this review and are close to me, especially if you know my father, you may want to at least try this book.<3 This feels like the most emotional review I've written."
106,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45669105-toby,4," This is a great book written by the famous ethologist Konrad Lorenz. Having learned of his research with Greylag Geese and Jackdaws in an Ecology course, I grew interested in the man's work. I finally got around to reading this book years later and it has really made me regain an interest and appreciation for animals. In this book he tells of the many animals he has kept or studied over his life and elucidates their peculiar activities and interesting methods of survival. It is written at times with charm and can be really funny: He tells hilarious stories about his talking birds and how he got mallards to follow him as their mother by quacking. Other parts of the book are more detailed in describing the complex behaviour and interactions of various creatures, notably the fighting and mating behaviours of sticklebacks, siamese fighting-fish, and cichlids, the peculiar path-habits that watershrews form, and the social systems of jackdaws. This is great science writing, for it explains a decent amount of scientific information without ever challenging the reader. It explores the unique behaviours each species has developed, which are extremely surprising and complex at times, but is also insightful in getting us to understand the reasons for these differences. It is also really fun to learn about what an eccentric and committed character Lorenz was. The man loved his creatures and was extremely devoted to learning of their ways. He is an inspiration to all naturalists and scientists."
107,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/758460-alexa-elam,4,"I read this book because Mary Midgely recommended it so highly in her autobiography ""The Owl of Minerva"" (which I so highly recommend to anyone who may be reading this). It is a book about animal behaviour by an Austrian ethologist, Konrad Lorenz. It originally came out in the later 40's, and while some of the prose is slightly dated, it is a wonderful read.Lorenz observed and documented all kinds of animals from the time he was a child, but is most well known for his work with jackdaws and greylag geese. Having watched both ""Winged Migration"" and ""The Making of Winged Migration,"" two films I also highly recommend (the making of is on the same DVD as the main feature), Lorenz's writing about imprinting on baby animals was fascinating.The whole time I was reading this book, I was enjoying it, but I was also wondering ""what made Midgely go so crazy for this work?"" Once I got to the final two chapters, it all clicked, I found myself terribly moved, and understood clearly how this ethologist inspired a great philosopher to formulate her thoughts and put pen to paper."
108,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/654572-father-nick,4,"I wish I'd come across this book a long, long time ago. Clarkie handed it to me on my last trip to Eighth Day and it's been a night time read for the last couple of weeks. Lorenz is able to transmit the joy of knowing animals in the simplest of iconic stories. Just think: this man LIVED the boyhood fantasy of befriending animals--I will never forget the description of calling to a raven soaring far overhead, which brought the bird down after a steep dive and flaring of wings onto his shoulder. It sends shivers down my spine to think of it. On a related note, his final chapters on the instincts of more dangerous animals to withhold their powers of destruction against their own species could provide the basis of a compelling analysis of nonviolence--indeed, Lorenz himself makes this connection to the ""turn the other cheek"" of the Sermon on the Mount. I would imagine there is some fruitful psychological study to be done here."
109,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5657908-silvia,0,"I decided not to rate this book. Why? Five stars aren't enough.King Solomon's Ring, by my new guru Konrad Lorenz (don't get me wrong, he already was. He just became..My supercool guru), is the book I was looking for.

To tell you the truth, it filled my heart with joy and tenderness. I know, that seems lame/stupid, but I'm trying to be honest here. You just turn the last page (well, I have the Kindle version. I don't know, you just click the last page?) and you can't help wondering ""what? where am I at? who I am?"". I still can't get over the fact that I do not own a freaking crow. Life is unjust.

110,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1201174-kathryn,3,"A fun book and a classic in animal behavior, since it is the memoir of one of the founders of ethology. It struck me though that one of the defining characteristics of ethology as a field is the observation of animals in their natural environment. Scientists going into the field to observer their chosen species ""making a living"" as my advisor always said. In contrast to the comparative psychologists with their selected lab animals, running experiments and seeing what these animals were capable of. But when you read this book you realize Lorenz was not out in the field watching animals making a living, he was socializing them and letting them make a living in his house! I have mixed feelings about this as I myself work with socialized animals, although I don't generally let them run rampant in my house. It isn't necessarily good or bad, just interesting that this was not the case initially. "
111,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1744748-iris,4,"The bird behavior fascinated me, especially the social life of jackdaws and their ability to recognize human individuals. I recently saw a PBS program about crows that proved they not only learn to recognize people but will pass this information along to their offspring. The chapter on buying animals was full of sound advice, such as ""And remember, too, if you are an over-sensitive person, that the life of your friend is much shorter than your own and a sad parting, after ten or fifteen years, is inevitable."" The English translation was published in 1952. It's a seminal account of human-animal observation that has influenced generations of scientists and citizen scientists since its publication. David Attenborough's Life Stories (PBS Nature series) pays tribute to Lorenz in the opening scenes. "
112,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1239758-nathan-nifong,5,"This is an absolutely excptional book. Lorenz describes the lives of fighting fish, mallard ducks, water shrews, jackdaws, dytiscus larvae, sticklebacks, dogs, parrots, monkeys and many other interesting animals in language that makes it obvious how much he admires all animals. In addition this book is an excellent example of how knowledge aquired through science can be expressed in a beautiful artistic way without sacreficing neutrality. The story of the life of the jackdaws which takes place in the second to last chapter could probably be adapted as a full length motion picture and win every award known to man. The last chapter (morals and weapons) however should probably have been moved or left out all together."

Having learned of his research with Greylag Geese and Jackdaws in an Ecology course, I grew interested in the man's work. I finally got around to reading this book years later and it has really made me regain an interest and appreciation for animals. In this book he tells of the many animals he has kept or studied over his life and elucidates their peculiar activities and interesting methods of survival. It is written at times with charm and can be really funny: He tells hilarious stories about his talking birds and how he got mallards to follow him as their mother by quacking. Other parts of the book are more detailed in describing the complex behaviour and interactions of various creatures, notably the fighting and mating behaviours of sticklebacks, siamese fighting-fish, and cichlids, the peculiar path-habits that watershrews form, and the social systems of jackdaws. This is great science writing, for it explains a decent amount of scientific information without ever challenging the reader. It explores the unique behaviours each species has developed, which are extremely surprising and complex at times, but is also insightful in getting us to understand the reasons for these differences. It is also really fun to learn about what an eccentric and committed character Lorenz was. The man loved his creatures and was extremely devoted to learning of their ways. He is an inspiration to all naturalists and scientists."

It originally came out in the later 40's, and while some of the prose is slightly dated, it is a wonderful read.Lorenz observed and documented all kinds of animals from the time he was a child, but is most well known for his work with jackdaws and greylag geese. Having watched both ""Winged Migration"" and ""The Making of Winged Migration,"" two films I also highly recommend (the making of is on the same DVD as the main feature), Lorenz's writing about imprinting on baby animals was fascinating.The whole time I was reading this book, I was enjoying it, but I was also wondering ""what made Midgely go so crazy for this work?""

Just think: this man LIVED the boyhood fantasy of befriending animals--I will never forget the description of calling to a raven soaring far overhead, which brought the bird down after a steep dive and flaring of wings onto his shoulder. It sends shivers down my spine to think of it. On a related note, his final chapters on the instincts of more dangerous animals to withhold their powers of destruction against their own species could provide the basis of a compelling analysis of nonviolence--indeed, Lorenz himself makes this connection to the ""turn the other cheek"" of the Sermon on the Mount.

163,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21611728-g-j-griffiths,5,"King Solomon's Ring by Konrad LorenzA simply wonderful book for anyone who has a love of animals, and is curious and fascinated by their behaviour. Konrad Lorenz is so obviously fond of his subjects but at the same time he treats them with a scientific distance and methodology that is worthy of emulation by other animal behaviourists. He demonstrates in this small book, written mainly for the layperson, an ability to write with wit and charm that captivates the reader from the first page.It is understandable, through the writing of such as Konrad Lorenz, why others are inspired to become zoologists, biologists and behaviour scientists. He devotes his whole house to his animal subjects and it is filled with animal chaos. The reader is kept entertained and amused throughout the book. We read about an intelligent raven; the wonders of an aquarium; the “taming of a shrew”; a hilarious tale of two men who carry a canoe followed by goslings, a dog and some ducklings. And all these tales are illustrated by his simple and (that word again) charming drawings.His book enables readers to understand animals more and, while it may not be considered a scientific treatise in the strict sense, Konrad Lorenz’s studies remain significant in the field of animal behaviour; thus this book remains extremely readable and a classic.I can recommend this book to adults and children alike, indeed all those who wonder what goes on in an animal’s mind and particularly to those young people considering a future career in the field of animal studies. It has much to offer anyone with no interest in animal behaviour since it is written with such respect, humour and charm that it serves as a reminder about the wonderful world of nature that so often seems to be forgotten by so many.I loved this book so much I had to refer to it in my novel, So What’s Next!So What's Next!"
164,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1089821-cora,4,"King Solomon's Ring is considered a classic on the subject of animal behavior. Konrad Lorenz was an ethologist (someone who studies animal behavior) who raised many animals at his home to study. Although he raised the animals and kept them at his home, he gave them free range of his home and the world around him in order to get a more realistic view of their behavior in their natural environment. In this book, Lorenz tells the reader about his observations of a number of animal species. The writing of the books is observational rather than scientific and very accessible to someone without a science background. One thing I found especially interesting is how World War II seemed to have affected Lorenz. He was German and much of his research was done in the 1930s and beyond. Although the book is about his observations of the animals, there are times when he allows how the war affected him to seep into the writing. For example after observing two doves tear each other apart in when he put them together in a cage for breeding purposes he writes, ""Only in two other instances have I seen similar horrible lacerations inflicted on their own kind by vertebrates: once, as an observer of the embittered fights of cichlid fishes who sometimes actually skin each other, and again as a field surgeon, in the late war, where the highest of all vertebrates perpetrated mass mutilations on members of his own species."" I would recommend this book to anyone interested in animal behavior or animals in general. There is a fun section on dogs and how their behavior is influenced by their wolf or jackal ancestors."

193,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21611728-g-j-griffiths,5,"King Solomon's Ring by Konrad LorenzA simply wonderful book for anyone who has a love of animals, and is curious and fascinated by their behaviour. Konrad Lorenz is so obviously fond of his subjects but at the same time he treats them with a scientific distance and methodology that is worthy of emulation by other animal behaviourists. He demonstrates in this small book, written mainly for the layperson, an ability to write with wit and charm that captivates the reader from the first page.It is understandable, through the writing of such as Konrad Lorenz, why others are inspired to become zoologists, biologists and behaviour scientists. He devotes his whole house to his animal subjects and it is filled with animal chaos. The reader is kept entertained and amused throughout the book. We read about an intelligent raven; the wonders of an aquarium; the “taming of a shrew”; a hilarious tale of two men who carry a canoe followed by goslings, a dog and some ducklings. And all these tales are illustrated by his simple and (that word again) charming drawings.His book enables readers to understand animals more and, while it may not be considered a scientific treatise in the strict sense, Konrad Lorenz’s studies remain significant in the field of animal behaviour; thus this book remains extremely readable and a classic.I can recommend this book to adults and children alike, indeed all those who wonder what goes on in an animal’s mind and particularly to those young people considering a future career in the field of animal studies. It has much to offer anyone with no interest in animal behaviour since it is written with such respect, humour and charm that it serves as a reminder about the wonderful world of nature that so often seems to be forgotten by so many.I loved this book so much I had to refer to it in my novel, So What’s Next!So What's Next!"
194,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1089821-cora,4,"King Solomon's Ring is considered a classic on the subject of animal behavior. Konrad Lorenz was an ethologist (someone who studies animal behavior) who raised many animals at his home to study. Although he raised the animals and kept them at his home, he gave them free range of his home and the world around him in order to get a more realistic view of their behavior in their natural environment. In this book, Lorenz tells the reader about his observations of a number of animal species. The writing of the books is observational rather than scientific and very accessible to someone without a science background. One thing I found especially interesting is how World War II seemed to have affected Lorenz. He was German and much of his research was done in the 1930s and beyond. Although the book is about his observations of the animals, there are times when he allows how the war affected him to seep into the writing. For example after observing two doves tear each other apart in when he put them together in a cage for breeding purposes he writes, ""Only in two other instances have I seen similar horrible lacerations inflicted on their own kind by vertebrates: once, as an observer of the embittered fights of cichlid fishes who sometimes actually skin each other, and again as a field surgeon, in the late war, where the highest of all vertebrates perpetrated mass mutilations on members of his own species."" I would recommend this book to anyone interested in animal behavior or animals in general. There is a fun section on dogs and how their behavior is influenced by their wolf or jackal ancestors."

Reading this book made me feel closer to him. I've watched many nature shows with my dad, raised fish with him, and this book brought everything together.It was hard for me to decide if this book was fiction or non-fiction for a long time. I looked it up later and it's categorized at non-fiction. I understand all the facts about animals are true, but the way he writes and the intimacy of the animals helps this book read more like fiction. I am someone who is rarely able to read non-fiction, but this book actually kept my attention the whole time. I am sad I finished it, though I very much see myself rereading throughout my lifetime.Friends, if you read this review and are close to me, especially if you know my father, you may want to at least try this book.<3 This feels like the most emotional review I've written."
196,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45669105-toby,4," This is a great book written by the famous ethologist Konrad Lorenz. Having learned of his research with Greylag Geese and Jackdaws in an Ecology course, I grew interested in the man's work. I finally got around to reading this book years later and it has really made me regain an interest and appreciation for animals. In this book he tells of the many animals he has kept or studied over his life and elucidates their peculiar activities and interesting methods of survival. It is written at times with charm and can be really funny: He tells hilarious stories about his talking birds and how he got mallards to follow him as their mother by quacking. Other parts of the book are more detailed in describing the complex behaviour and interactions of various creatures, notably the fighting and mating behaviours of sticklebacks, siamese fighting-fish, and cichlids, the peculiar path-habits that watershrews form, and the social systems of jackdaws. This is great science writing, for it explains a decent amount of scientific information without ever challenging the reader. It explores the unique behaviours each species has developed, which are extremely surprising and complex at times, but is also insightful in getting us to understand the reasons for these differences. It is also really fun to learn about what an eccentric and committed character Lorenz was. The man loved his creatures and was extremely devoted to learning of their ways. He is an inspiration to all naturalists and scientists."
197,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/758460-alexa-elam,4,"I read this book because Mary Midgely recommended it so highly in her autobiography ""The Owl of Minerva"" (which I so highly recommend to anyone who may be reading this). It is a book about animal behaviour by an Austrian ethologist, Konrad Lorenz. It originally came out in the later 40's, and while some of the prose is slightly dated, it is a wonderful read.Lorenz observed and documented all kinds of animals from the time he was a child, but is most well known for his work with jackdaws and greylag geese. Having watched both ""Winged Migration"" and ""The Making of Winged Migration,"" two films I also highly recommend (the making of is on the same DVD as the main feature), Lorenz's writing about imprinting on baby animals was fascinating.The whole time I was reading this book, I was enjoying it, but I was also wondering ""what made Midgely go so crazy for this work?"" Once I got to the final two chapters, it all clicked, I found myself terribly moved, and understood clearly how this ethologist inspired a great philosopher to formulate her thoughts and put pen to paper."
198,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/654572-father-nick,4,"I wish I'd come across this book a long, long time ago. Clarkie handed it to me on my last trip to Eighth Day and it's been a night time read for the last couple of weeks. Lorenz is able to transmit the joy of knowing animals in the simplest of iconic stories. Just think: this man LIVED the boyhood fantasy of befriending animals--I will never forget the description of calling to a raven soaring far overhead, which brought the bird down after a steep dive and flaring of wings onto his shoulder. It sends shivers down my spine to think of it. On a related note, his final chapters on the instincts of more dangerous animals to withhold their powers of destruction against their own species could provide the basis of a compelling analysis of nonviolence--indeed, Lorenz himself makes this connection to the ""turn the other cheek"" of the Sermon on the Mount. I would imagine there is some fruitful psychological study to be done here."
199,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5657908-silvia,0,"I decided not to rate this book. Why? Five stars aren't enough.King Solomon's Ring, by my new guru Konrad Lorenz (don't get me wrong, he already was. He just became..My supercool guru), is the book I was looking for.

To tell you the truth, it filled my heart with joy and tenderness. I know, that seems lame/stupid, but I'm trying to be honest here. You just turn the last page (well, I have the Kindle version. I don't know, you just click the last page?) and you can't help wondering ""what? where am I at? who I am?"". I still can't get over the fact that I do not own a freaking crow. Life is unjust.

200,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1201174-kathryn,3,"A fun book and a classic in animal behavior, since it is the memoir of one of the founders of ethology. It struck me though that one of the defining characteristics of ethology as a field is the observation of animals in their natural environment. Scientists going into the field to observer their chosen species ""making a living"" as my advisor always said. In contrast to the comparative psychologists with their selected lab animals, running experiments and seeing what these animals were capable of. But when you read this book you realize Lorenz was not out in the field watching animals making a living, he was socializing them and letting them make a living in his house! I have mixed feelings about this as I myself work with socialized animals, although I don't generally let them run rampant in my house. It isn't necessarily good or bad, just interesting that this was not the case initially. "
201,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1744748-iris,4,"The bird behavior fascinated me, especially the social life of jackdaws and their ability to recognize human individuals. I recently saw a PBS program about crows that proved they not only learn to recognize people but will pass this information along to their offspring. The chapter on buying animals was full of sound advice, such as ""And remember, too, if you are an over-sensitive person, that the life of your friend is much shorter than your own and a sad parting, after ten or fifteen years, is inevitable."" The English translation was published in 1952. It's a seminal account of human-animal observation that has influenced generations of scientists and citizen scientists since its publication. David Attenborough's Life Stories (PBS Nature series) pays tribute to Lorenz in the opening scenes. "
202,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1239758-nathan-nifong,5,"This is an absolutely excptional book. Lorenz describes the lives of fighting fish, mallard ducks, water shrews, jackdaws, dytiscus larvae, sticklebacks, dogs, parrots, monkeys and many other interesting animals in language that makes it obvious how much he admires all animals. In addition this book is an excellent example of how knowledge aquired through science can be expressed in a beautiful artistic way without sacreficing neutrality. The story of the life of the jackdaws which takes place in the second to last chapter could probably be adapted as a full length motion picture and win every award known to man. The last chapter (morals and weapons) however should probably have been moved or left out all together."
203,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/579016-reenie,4,"Fascinating insights from everyone's favourite Nazi scientist (let's face it, there's not much in the way of choices with anything to recommend them) about the behaviour of animals. I particularly enjoyed the accounts of courtship and aggressive behavior in three fish species - sticklebacks, cichlids and betta fish, but I thought he was a bit harsh on the intelligence (or lack thereof) of birds, especially parrots, at times seeming to wilfully overlook and dismiss examples of intelligent behavior, because 'after all, they're birds', and at the time, the comparative anatomists had decided for everyone that birds couldn't possibly be capable of intelligent behavior. But generally, this is both touching and thought-inducing."
204,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1978459-susan,4,"Published in 1952 when scientists were becoming suspicious that animals, even the lowest on the ladder of complexity, have WAY more going on that simply hard-wired instinct. Konrad Lorenz was one of the first Ethologists. Reading these stories is like meditating. How carefully, painstakingly, and often hilariously Lorenz scrutinized the animals he saw in his native Austria. It is charmingly written and translated and not a fast read. The author included small simple-lined illustrations throughout the book, also charming.""......for he who has once seen the intimate beauty of nature cannot tear himself away from it again. He must become either a poet or a naturalist, and, if his eyes are good and his powers of observation sharp enough, he may well become both."""
205,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/861650-laura,5,Anyone who studies animal behavior has heard of ethologist Konrad Lorenz (and have probably seen pictures of him being followed by a string of imprinted goslings). This is a wonderful collection of anecdotes from his personal life overrun with animals. He believes strongly that you cannot study a creature in a cage and so had all manner of wildlife (tamed and otherwise) given free reign of his house and surrounding areas. Detailed observations from a scientific mind in a time when animal behavior didn't have to be completley defined by quantitative data points and a little anthropomorphizing (gasp!) was regarded as just fine.
206,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2560991-amanda,3,"I read about halfway through and then just gave up. It was an interesting and engaging read, but there's only so much I would want to know about *one man*'s behavioral observations of birds and insects. No matter how brilliant, insightful, or well-credentialed he may be.Some of his points about the intelligence of birds seems to be terribly false and outdated. Those parts in the book made me want to stop reading... I wondered how many more outdated things I might find, which might become ingrained into memory as fact if I kept reading.Very humorous, at times."
207,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1411924-pamela,4,"Konrad Lorenz wrote these observations in the late 1940s in Austria; they are translated for English readers. This is a rare look at animal behavior from a scientific point of view, yet this scientist is most interested in animals that interact with him (and others that are just ""interesting""). The book is a series of essays from his experiments and observations, not at all like the ususal scientific reads. The observations are intelligible to those un-scientific, but interested-in-animals kind of people. I found the chapters on the moles and dog types fascinating and entertaining. "

253,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21611728-g-j-griffiths,5,"King Solomon's Ring by Konrad LorenzA simply wonderful book for anyone who has a love of animals, and is curious and fascinated by their behaviour. Konrad Lorenz is so obviously fond of his subjects but at the same time he treats them with a scientific distance and methodology that is worthy of emulation by other animal behaviourists. He demonstrates in this small book, written mainly for the layperson, an ability to write with wit and charm that captivates the reader from the first page.It is understandable, through the writing of such as Konrad Lorenz, why others are inspired to become zoologists, biologists and behaviour scientists. He devotes his whole house to his animal subjects and it is filled with animal chaos. The reader is kept entertained and amused throughout the book. We read about an intelligent raven; the wonders of an aquarium; the “taming of a shrew”; a hilarious tale of two men who carry a canoe followed by goslings, a dog and some ducklings. And all these tales are illustrated by his simple and (that word again) charming drawings.His book enables readers to understand animals more and, while it may not be considered a scientific treatise in the strict sense, Konrad Lorenz’s studies remain significant in the field of animal behaviour; thus this book remains extremely readable and a classic.I can recommend this book to adults and children alike, indeed all those who wonder what goes on in an animal’s mind and particularly to those young people considering a future career in the field of animal studies. It has much to offer anyone with no interest in animal behaviour since it is written with such respect, humour and charm that it serves as a reminder about the wonderful world of nature that so often seems to be forgotten by so many.I loved this book so much I had to refer to it in my novel, So What’s Next!So What's Next!"
254,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1089821-cora,4,"King Solomon's Ring is considered a classic on the subject of animal behavior. Konrad Lorenz was an ethologist (someone who studies animal behavior) who raised many animals at his home to study. Although he raised the animals and kept them at his home, he gave them free range of his home and the world around him in order to get a more realistic view of their behavior in their natural environment. In this book, Lorenz tells the reader about his observations of a number of animal species. The writing of the books is observational rather than scientific and very accessible to someone without a science background. One thing I found especially interesting is how World War II seemed to have affected Lorenz. He was German and much of his research was done in the 1930s and beyond. Although the book is about his observations of the animals, there are times when he allows how the war affected him to seep into the writing. For example after observing two doves tear each other apart in when he put them together in a cage for breeding purposes he writes, ""Only in two other instances have I seen similar horrible lacerations inflicted on their own kind by vertebrates: once, as an observer of the embittered fights of cichlid fishes who sometimes actually skin each other, and again as a field surgeon, in the late war, where the highest of all vertebrates perpetrated mass mutilations on members of his own species."" I would recommend this book to anyone interested in animal behavior or animals in general. There is a fun section on dogs and how their behavior is influenced by their wolf or jackal ancestors."
255,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4926601-jennifer,5,"This book took me a long time to read. It was recommended to me by my dad back in August 2014. I didn't pick it up until November 2015 and I just finished it now. My dad's note was:""The other day, I happened to do a search on a book that I loved when I was in college back in 1972, and found there is a reprint (on Kindle as well): http://books.google.com/books/about/K...The author, Konrad Lorenz, was a Nobel prize winner, who studied animal behavior by raising animals himself. He described many animals in this book; including Cichlids and Siamese Fighting Fishes, etc. The one I read was a Chinese translation; I loved it, I believe you will too.Love,Dad""My dad is rarely emotional so this is an extremely emotional note from my father. Reading this book made me feel closer to him. I've watched many nature shows with my dad, raised fish with him, and this book brought everything together.It was hard for me to decide if this book was fiction or non-fiction for a long time. I looked it up later and it's categorized at non-fiction. I understand all the facts about animals are true, but the way he writes and the intimacy of the animals helps this book read more like fiction. I am someone who is rarely able to read non-fiction, but this book actually kept my attention the whole time. I am sad I finished it, though I very much see myself rereading throughout my lifetime.Friends, if you read this review and are close to me, especially if you know my father, you may want to at least try this book.<3 This feels like the most emotional review I've written."
256,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45669105-toby,4," This is a great book written by the famous ethologist Konrad Lorenz. Having learned of his research with Greylag Geese and Jackdaws in an Ecology course, I grew interested in the man's work. I finally got around to reading this book years later and it has really made me regain an interest and appreciation for animals. In this book he tells of the many animals he has kept or studied over his life and elucidates their peculiar activities and interesting methods of survival. It is written at times with charm and can be really funny: He tells hilarious stories about his talking birds and how he got mallards to follow him as their mother by quacking. Other parts of the book are more detailed in describing the complex behaviour and interactions of various creatures, notably the fighting and mating behaviours of sticklebacks, siamese fighting-fish, and cichlids, the peculiar path-habits that watershrews form, and the social systems of jackdaws. This is great science writing, for it explains a decent amount of scientific information without ever challenging the reader. It explores the unique behaviours each species has developed, which are extremely surprising and complex at times, but is also insightful in getting us to understand the reasons for these differences. It is also really fun to learn about what an eccentric and committed character Lorenz was. The man loved his creatures and was extremely devoted to learning of their ways. He is an inspiration to all naturalists and scientists."

282,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45648634-yanxiao-zhang,5,Very interesting book. Highly recommended. Animals are adorable..
283,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21611728-g-j-griffiths,5,"King Solomon's Ring by Konrad LorenzA simply wonderful book for anyone who has a love of animals, and is curious and fascinated by their behaviour. Konrad Lorenz is so obviously fond of his subjects but at the same time he treats them with a scientific distance and methodology that is worthy of emulation by other animal behaviourists. He demonstrates in this small book, written mainly for the layperson, an ability to write with wit and charm that captivates the reader from the first page.It is understandable, through the writing of such as Konrad Lorenz, why others are inspired to become zoologists, biologists and behaviour scientists. He devotes his whole house to his animal subjects and it is filled with animal chaos. The reader is kept entertained and amused throughout the book. We read about an intelligent raven; the wonders of an aquarium; the “taming of a shrew”; a hilarious tale of two men who carry a canoe followed by goslings, a dog and some ducklings. And all these tales are illustrated by his simple and (that word again) charming drawings.His book enables readers to understand animals more and, while it may not be considered a scientific treatise in the strict sense, Konrad Lorenz’s studies remain significant in the field of animal behaviour; thus this book remains extremely readable and a classic.I can recommend this book to adults and children alike, indeed all those who wonder what goes on in an animal’s mind and particularly to those young people considering a future career in the field of animal studies. It has much to offer anyone with no interest in animal behaviour since it is written with such respect, humour and charm that it serves as a reminder about the wonderful world of nature that so often seems to be forgotten by so many.I loved this book so much I had to refer to it in my novel, So What’s Next!So What's Next!"
284,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1089821-cora,4,"King Solomon's Ring is considered a classic on the subject of animal behavior. Konrad Lorenz was an ethologist (someone who studies animal behavior) who raised many animals at his home to study. Although he raised the animals and kept them at his home, he gave them free range of his home and the world around him in order to get a more realistic view of their behavior in their natural environment. In this book, Lorenz tells the reader about his observations of a number of animal species. The writing of the books is observational rather than scientific and very accessible to someone without a science background. One thing I found especially interesting is how World War II seemed to have affected Lorenz. He was German and much of his research was done in the 1930s and beyond. Although the book is about his observations of the animals, there are times when he allows how the war affected him to seep into the writing. For example after observing two doves tear each other apart in when he put them together in a cage for breeding purposes he writes, ""Only in two other instances have I seen similar horrible lacerations inflicted on their own kind by vertebrates: once, as an observer of the embittered fights of cichlid fishes who sometimes actually skin each other, and again as a field surgeon, in the late war, where the highest of all vertebrates perpetrated mass mutilations on members of his own species."" I would recommend this book to anyone interested in animal behavior or animals in general. There is a fun section on dogs and how their behavior is influenced by their wolf or jackal ancestors."
285,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4926601-jennifer,5,"This book took me a long time to read. It was recommended to me by my dad back in August 2014. I didn't pick it up until November 2015 and I just finished it now. My dad's note was:""The other day, I happened to do a search on a book that I loved when I was in college back in 1972, and found there is a reprint (on Kindle as well): http://books.google.com/books/about/K...The author, Konrad Lorenz, was a Nobel prize winner, who studied animal behavior by raising animals himself. He described many animals in this book; including Cichlids and Siamese Fighting Fishes, etc. The one I read was a Chinese translation; I loved it, I believe you will too.Love,Dad""My dad is rarely emotional so this is an extremely emotional note from my father. Reading this book made me feel closer to him. I've watched many nature shows with my dad, raised fish with him, and this book brought everything together.It was hard for me to decide if this book was fiction or non-fiction for a long time. I looked it up later and it's categorized at non-fiction. I understand all the facts about animals are true, but the way he writes and the intimacy of the animals helps this book read more like fiction. I am someone who is rarely able to read non-fiction, but this book actually kept my attention the whole time. I am sad I finished it, though I very much see myself rereading throughout my lifetime.Friends, if you read this review and are close to me, especially if you know my father, you may want to at least try this book.<3 This feels like the most emotional review I've written."
286,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45669105-toby,4," This is a great book written by the famous ethologist Konrad Lorenz. Having learned of his research with Greylag Geese and Jackdaws in an Ecology course, I grew interested in the man's work. I finally got around to reading this book years later and it has really made me regain an interest and appreciation for animals. In this book he tells of the many animals he has kept or studied over his life and elucidates their peculiar activities and interesting methods of survival. It is written at times with charm and can be really funny: He tells hilarious stories about his talking birds and how he got mallards to follow him as their mother by quacking. Other parts of the book are more detailed in describing the complex behaviour and interactions of various creatures, notably the fighting and mating behaviours of sticklebacks, siamese fighting-fish, and cichlids, the peculiar path-habits that watershrews form, and the social systems of jackdaws. This is great science writing, for it explains a decent amount of scientific information without ever challenging the reader. It explores the unique behaviours each species has developed, which are extremely surprising and complex at times, but is also insightful in getting us to understand the reasons for these differences. It is also really fun to learn about what an eccentric and committed character Lorenz was. The man loved his creatures and was extremely devoted to learning of their ways. He is an inspiration to all naturalists and scientists."
287,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/758460-alexa-elam,4,"I read this book because Mary Midgely recommended it so highly in her autobiography ""The Owl of Minerva"" (which I so highly recommend to anyone who may be reading this). It is a book about animal behaviour by an Austrian ethologist, Konrad Lorenz. It originally came out in the later 40's, and while some of the prose is slightly dated, it is a wonderful read.Lorenz observed and documented all kinds of animals from the time he was a child, but is most well known for his work with jackdaws and greylag geese. Having watched both ""Winged Migration"" and ""The Making of Winged Migration,"" two films I also highly recommend (the making of is on the same DVD as the main feature), Lorenz's writing about imprinting on baby animals was fascinating.The whole time I was reading this book, I was enjoying it, but I was also wondering ""what made Midgely go so crazy for this work?"" Once I got to the final two chapters, it all clicked, I found myself terribly moved, and understood clearly how this ethologist inspired a great philosopher to formulate her thoughts and put pen to paper."
288,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/654572-father-nick,4,"I wish I'd come across this book a long, long time ago. Clarkie handed it to me on my last trip to Eighth Day and it's been a night time read for the last couple of weeks. Lorenz is able to transmit the joy of knowing animals in the simplest of iconic stories. Just think: this man LIVED the boyhood fantasy of befriending animals--I will never forget the description of calling to a raven soaring far overhead, which brought the bird down after a steep dive and flaring of wings onto his shoulder. It sends shivers down my spine to think of it. On a related note, his final chapters on the instincts of more dangerous animals to withhold their powers of destruction against their own species could provide the basis of a compelling analysis of nonviolence--indeed, Lorenz himself makes this connection to the ""turn the other cheek"" of the Sermon on the Mount. I would imagine there is some fruitful psychological study to be done here."
289,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5657908-silvia,0,"I decided not to rate this book. Why? Five stars aren't enough.King Solomon's Ring, by my new guru Konrad Lorenz (don't get me wrong, he already was. He just became..My supercool guru), is the book I was looking for. A book about animals, written by a person who genuinely loved animals, meant for people who genuinely love animals.It made me cry and laugh. To tell you the truth, it filled my heart with joy and tenderness. I know, that seems lame/stupid, but I'm trying to be honest here. You just turn the last page (well, I have the Kindle version. I don't know, you just click the last page?) and you can't help wondering ""what? where am I at? who I am?"". I still can't get over the fact that I do not own a freaking crow. Life is unjust.

290,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1201174-kathryn,3,"A fun book and a classic in animal behavior, since it is the memoir of one of the founders of ethology. It struck me though that one of the defining characteristics of ethology as a field is the observation of animals in their natural environment. Scientists going into the field to observer their chosen species ""making a living"" as my advisor always said. In contrast to the comparative psychologists with their selected lab animals, running experiments and seeing what these animals were capable of. But when you read this book you realize Lorenz was not out in the field watching animals making a living, he was socializing them and letting them make a living in his house! I have mixed feelings about this as I myself work with socialized animals, although I don't generally let them run rampant in my house. It isn't necessarily good or bad, just interesting that this was not the case initially. "
291,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1744748-iris,4,"The bird behavior fascinated me, especially the social life of jackdaws and their ability to recognize human individuals. I recently saw a PBS program about crows that proved they not only learn to recognize people but will pass this information along to their offspring. The chapter on buying animals was full of sound advice, such as ""And remember, too, if you are an over-sensitive person, that the life of your friend is much shorter than your own and a sad parting, after ten or fifteen years, is inevitable."" The English translation was published in 1952. It's a seminal account of human-animal observation that has influenced generations of scientists and citizen scientists since its publication. David Attenborough's Life Stories (PBS Nature series) pays tribute to Lorenz in the opening scenes. "
292,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1239758-nathan-nifong,5,"This is an absolutely excptional book. Lorenz describes the lives of fighting fish, mallard ducks, water shrews, jackdaws, dytiscus larvae, sticklebacks, dogs, parrots, monkeys and many other interesting animals in language that makes it obvious how much he admires all animals. In addition this book is an excellent example of how knowledge aquired through science can be expressed in a beautiful artistic way without sacreficing neutrality. The story of the life of the jackdaws which takes place in the second to last chapter could probably be adapted as a full length motion picture and win every award known to man. The last chapter (morals and weapons) however should probably have been moved or left out all together."
293,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/579016-reenie,4,"Fascinating insights from everyone's favourite Nazi scientist (let's face it, there's not much in the way of choices with anything to recommend them) about the behaviour of animals. I particularly enjoyed the accounts of courtship and aggressive behavior in three fish species - sticklebacks, cichlids and betta fish, but I thought he was a bit harsh on the intelligence (or lack thereof) of birds, especially parrots, at times seeming to wilfully overlook and dismiss examples of intelligent behavior, because 'after all, they're birds', and at the time, the comparative anatomists had decided for everyone that birds couldn't possibly be capable of intelligent behavior. But generally, this is both touching and thought-inducing."
294,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1978459-susan,4,"Published in 1952 when scientists were becoming suspicious that animals, even the lowest on the ladder of complexity, have WAY more going on that simply hard-wired instinct. Konrad Lorenz was one of the first Ethologists. Reading these stories is like meditating. How carefully, painstakingly, and often hilariously Lorenz scrutinized the animals he saw in his native Austria. It is charmingly written and translated and not a fast read. The author included small simple-lined illustrations throughout the book, also charming.""......for he who has once seen the intimate beauty of nature cannot tear himself away from it again. He must become either a poet or a naturalist, and, if his eyes are good and his powers of observation sharp enough, he may well become both."""
295,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/861650-laura,5,Anyone who studies animal behavior has heard of ethologist Konrad Lorenz (and have probably seen pictures of him being followed by a string of imprinted goslings). This is a wonderful collection of anecdotes from his personal life overrun with animals. He believes strongly that you cannot study a creature in a cage and so had all manner of wildlife (tamed and otherwise) given free reign of his house and surrounding areas. Detailed observations from a scientific mind in a time when animal behavior didn't have to be completley defined by quantitative data points and a little anthropomorphizing (gasp!) was regarded as just fine.
296,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2560991-amanda,3,"I read about halfway through and then just gave up. It was an interesting and engaging read, but there's only so much I would want to know about *one man*'s behavioral observations of birds and insects. No matter how brilliant, insightful, or well-credentialed he may be.Some of his points about the intelligence of birds seems to be terribly false and outdated. Those parts in the book made me want to stop reading... I wondered how many more outdated things I might find, which might become ingrained into memory as fact if I kept reading.Very humorous, at times."
297,0415267471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1411924-pamela,4,"Konrad Lorenz wrote these observations in the late 1940s in Austria; they are translated for English readers. This is a rare look at animal behavior from a scientific point of view, yet this scientist is most interested in animals that interact with him (and others that are just ""interesting""). The book is a series of essays from his experiments and observations, not at all like the ususal scientific reads. The observations are intelligible to those un-scientific, but interested-in-animals kind of people. I found the chapters on the moles and dog types fascinating and entertaining. "

I read it when I was a sailor and it caused me to exchange my life at sea for one in the forest and field. Today, both of my sons are biologists and I'm pleased that this book has not only impacted our lives, but allowed us to grow and learn to help our planet.I hope those who read it get the same feeling.I own an original edition and am pleased that the author illustrated his own book.

Mind you, I have an obsession with books about animals, and so yes this was an unusual book for a 16 year old to read. I am definitely biased towards books about animals.I will just say that this books is a fascinating look at how birds communicate, the way other animals relate to each other and to humans, and the simple life in Germany after WWII.I've read this book at least 10 times since I first read it in about 1975 and it is one of my all time favorite books."
