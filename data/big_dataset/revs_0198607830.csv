0,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3038974-steve-van-slyke,4,"I selected this book for two reasons. First, I was looking for something else to read by Nick Lane after reading Power, Sex, Suicide: Mitochondria and the Meaning of Life, and second, I'm fascinated by the story of how free oxygen arose in Earth's atmosphere.One of the key points Lane makes about the world of science today is that it has become so fragmented and specialized that, for example, biologists often know little about geology, and vice versa for geologists. He hopes that science writers can help to fill the gaps by attempting to synthesize the disparate banks of knowledge that all relate to a common topic.In a way, the book really two books. The first is about how early life supercharged the atmosphere with oxygen, and possibly saved the planet from a fate similar to Mars or Venus by creating the ozone layer. And then how oxygen caused the “explosion” of life forms much more complex than the bacteria which created the excess oxygen in the first place. Amid this is a fascinating discussion of LUCA, the Last Universal Common Ancestor, and how today, even though we don't know what exactly it was, we can describe many attributes that it must have had.And in the second “book” the topic is how this abundance of oxygen now affects life today, particularly its affects on humans, primarily through the action of free radicals, oxygen-based molecules with unpaired electrons. Anti-oxidant supplements, it turns out, may not confer their hyped benefits, and in some instances of mega dosing, may be harmful.The discussion of oxygen's relation to ageing and age related diseases such as Alzheimer's and diabetes is both fascinating and scary. In conclusion Lane states: “...oxygen is not just the engine of evolution and life, but also the single most important cause of ageing and age-related disease.”At times I was a little overwhelmed by the complexity of the biochemistry discussions, but those didn't last long. I hope to read this one again soon with the idea that more of it will sink in the second time around. Definitely a worthwhile read."

In my case, one was a con and the other a potential pro. The author claims this book is for the general public. No, it is not. Even people who love this book admit this is a hard read. An educational background in biochemistry with some understanding of geochemistry and genetics are a remarkable plus. Other than that you need a lot of patience. Despite my moderate knowledge in these fields (low level college), I read this book incredibly slowly for the first third. Eventually I became reluctant to read it at all, so I gave myself permission to skim. Did I learn a lot? Yes. In fact, it's an incredibly fact dense book, especially if you don't mind the history of all the studies leading to current speculations on oxygen and its influence on life. Much--okay, page per page, it's probably most--of the book is dedicated to fleshing out the research that has theories on oxygen. Most negative reviews focus on this aspect. You can't read this book for it's conclusions, you have to enjoy reading the process. A part of me would love to come back in a few years after bulking up my biochemistry background so that I can read faster and hold the information instead of letting the thoughts bounce back.Here's the thing. If I could follow the book better I'd probably give it 4 stars--I truly suspect it'd be that fun and enlightening if it was accessible. However, this is where the mismatch of author intent and execution have to be my priority when deciding how I feel about the book overall. What's the point of great content if it's too disheartening to read because it's a few too many humps of challenges to bother with? No point. I did like what I did learn, but I can't give it any more credit than the 2 stars I'll give it. If I come back, I might rebalance it in consideration of it's value of knowledge as whole versus how much of that whole I grasped as a ""general audience"" the first time."
3,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172572-lemar,5,"Nick Lane is courageous enough to draw conclusions about the vital role of oxygen, both in the emergence of life and in aging. Many science writers duck this challenge, Lane does not and his book is the better for it. His affection for this element is marvelous; if asked to differentiate Star Trek from Star Wars it would not surprise readers of this book to hear that oxygen played a part! ""if water is the foundation of life, and oxygen is its engine. Without oxygen, life on earth would never have got beyond a slime in the oceans, and the earth would probably have ended its days in the stability of Mars or Venus.""He begins his comprehensive account at the earliest formation of Earth and the anaerobic microbes that were the true and only pioneers, the sole instance of emergent life. Long thought to have had no process for dealing with oxygen, then a trace element, Lane sides with those who challenge the prevailing wisdom that life evolved in an ascending path of increasing complexity, especially in regard to the biggest threat posed by oxygen, the production of free radicals. He explores the fascinating science surrounding LUCA, the Last Universal Common Ancestor. Through analysis of the ubiquitous ancient Hox genes,  ""We now realize that many simple single-celled organisms, which we once thought were relics from a primitive age that had never evolved a complex lifestyle, have instead lost their ancient sophistication.""The idea that life is continually adaptive to prevailing levels of oxygen by in turns increasing and decreasing physical size and metabolic complexity is a central idea of this book.The second half of the book takes on the biology of the human body and it's aging process as affected by oxygen. Here again Lane is unafraid to take a position and even advances his own theory which he refers to as the ""double-agent"" theory: ""infectious disease cause a rise in oxidative stress, which is largely responsible for coordinating our genetic response the infection. As we age mitochondrial respiration also causes a rise in oxidative stress, which activates essentially the same genes through a common mechanism that involves transcription factors like NFkB."" His conclusion is that we need to focus our attention on delaying the aging process, not on our current focus of gene editing. Genes are too complex in that many code for protection in reproductive years then become harmful in old age so editing them is much less effective than delaying the aging process thereby extending life by delaying the harmful effects these genes cause. He sees the aging process not in terms of years but rather in terms of the accumulation of oxidative stress. I found the level of detailed scientific discussion challenging, and that's what I was hoping for!"
4,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20494551-tweedledum,5,"Nick Lane's exploration of the role of oxygen in the life of our planet is nothing if not comprehensive. It seems that he has left no stone unturned in his mission to tell the story of the remarkable way in which life harnessed oxygen, contained it, made use of it and out of this came more and more life. The extra-ordinary role of mitochondria in this epic story is also explored in meticulous detail. At a certain point the focus shifts from life to senescence and asks is aging and death due to the ultimate failure of the mitochondria to ""manage"" oxygen in our bodies. At least I think that is the thrust of the last couple of chapters. Interestingly Lane highlights research that suggests that longevity often correlates with having survived several childhood illnesses the effect of which is to effectively toughen up the body and therefore preventing autoimmune disease.... A summary could read perhaps: Much ""illness"" is our body going on overdrive against real or imagined enemies... Fighting real enemies enables the body to be able to tell the difference.... So much detail was packed into this book, which definitely requires quite a good level of biological and bio-chemical background knowledge to fully appreciate. I struggled at times to follow this explanation and that research but even though my science study days are long past I felt able to follow the gist of most of the information. I must say that the natural history fascinated me and was quite mind blowing. The medical discussions and research I personally found less interesting but to anyone working in this field I would thoroughly recommend this book as Lane has pulled together so much diverse information and research and demonstrated the links between them. This element is so often absent in laboratories where research may be conducted for its own sake, or to promote a particular drug, with little joined up thinking. Oxygen is the key to life on Earth in all its diversity. Well I guess that is something many high school students know, or have been taught. But Lane shows us how and why. I began the book curious to know more about oxygen. I ended in a state of awe about life itself. "
5,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,2,"I’ve tried twice to read this in full, and found that though at the beginning it’s engaging and interesting, the sheer level of detail starts to wear on me. This time, I was well served by having the first year of a BSc behind me: it’s easier to understand what the by-products of photosynthesis are when you have a good grasp of how photosynthesis works, and why it generates highly reactive intermediates. Despite Lane’s aim at the general reader, then, perhaps it’s worth noting that at least some knowledge of chemistry is very helpful in understanding what Lane is saying.The problem with his theories is that he includes so much speculative material, and when I went looking for some corroboration, this review in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine is pretty damning:""These are generalities, and the identification of more specific points of reservations and disagreement in the text will depend on the particular interests and expertise of the individual reader. Various statements that are questionable, perverse or just wrong will be picked up by medical readers.""And indeed, I have to admit that despite my lack of specialist knowledge, on the topic of genetics I could see some flaws. It’s well enough known now, I think, that so-called “junk DNA” is in large part no such thing; damage by radiation to any part of the DNA can be damaging (though “junk” may not be involved in that point in an organism’s lifecycle, may have repetitions which ameliorate the effect of the damage, etc). I know this book is from 2002, and that view of “junk DNA” is relatively new (enough that Nessa Carey’s book on it wasn’t unnecessary!), so perhaps I shouldn’t judge too harshly. But it’s definitely shaky ground, and if I can see that as a layman, I don’t know how much to trust in his expertise in other areas (though it’s worth noting he is a biochemist).The subject is interesting; Nick Lane’s introduction to it piques the interest. But I don’t think he follows through on his promises, and if you do read it, I would do so with caution.Originally posted here."

For a more civil assessment, see review in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine: “He compounds his difficulties by including much speculative material. Lane clearly enjoys the counter-intuitive and the iconoclastic, but the reader must be given a sufficiently detailed conventional context in which the more controversial observations can be adequately appraised—particularly the general reader to whom this book is directed. The scope and diversity of the subject matter makes this requirement almost impossible to achieve with uniform success. Lane also has a disconcerting tendency to argue from overtly weak grounds (‘... evidence is not compelling, but is certainly intriguing’ [p. 139]) and, even more surprisingly, he sometimes reinstates the intuitive interpretations and responses which he has previously disparaged.” http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/artic...

Obviously, it concerns oxygen and its effect on everything on earth, and how it started life as we know it on our planet. Lane combines engineering, organic and inorganic chemistry with evolutionary studies, paleontology, and research medicine, to explain the world. He also deals with the recent research on free radicals and their effect on health and on the phenomena of aging and of immortality. This is the part of the book I found most interesting, what he writes of diseases and their impact, particularly Alzheimer's and diabetes. Nevertheless, a lot of what he writes are theories with which I do not agree. I do like his style of writing and look forward to reading other books he has written."

10,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18293816-bill-leach,5,"Origins of Oxygen- earth's early atmosphere seems to have been mostly nitrogen from volcanic action- oxygen was initially formed by the breakdown of water by UV rays; however much of this reacted with iron, locking it up, while the hydrogen escaped earth- over billions of years, this process cost Mars and Venus their atmospheres- photosynthesis produced oxygen in sufficient quantity that it overwhelmed the iron, allowing oxygen to accumulate- the oxygen also reacted with the free hydrogen, preserving the waterThree Billion Years of Microbial Evolution- evidence of life has been found as early as 3.85 bya; evidence of eukaryote life (steranes) has been found from 2.7 bya- by 2.2 bya, oxygen levels started to rise, reaching 5-18 % of current levels- however, no complex life developed- earth went into a snowball condition about 750 mya- at 540 mya, the Cambrian explosion of complex life forms occurredOxygen and the Rise of the Giants- earth's oxygen level climbed to 35 % during the Carboniferous period, allowing the development of giant arthropods- the oxygen level dropped to about 15 % at the end of the Permian, possibly due to massive firestorms enabled by the high oxygen levelsOxygen Poisoning- respiration generates free radicals as intermediates between oxygen and water - hydroxyl radicals, hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radicals- free radicals, radiation, heat, toxins and other forms of stress damage DNA- life has developed a number of mechanisms for disposing of the free radicals before they damage the DNA, and for repairing damaged DNARadiation and the Evolution of Photosynthesis- it is likely that these defences developed early on (4 bya), largely in response to radiation- photosynthesis combines CO2 and water to form sugars and oxygen - the oxygen comes from the water, not the CO2- plants absorb red light for photosynthesis, causing them to appear green- earth's early atmosphere contained significant concentrations of the oxidant hydrogen peroxide- it appears that the antioxidant catalase evolved in shallow water bacteria in response to the hydrogen peroxide- in a further step, a number of catalase molecules formed around the H2S based photosynthetic apparatus and with a few small changes became capable of absorbing higher energy photons and splitting water- it appears that catalase only evolved onceLast Ancestor in an Age Before Oxygen- a Last Universal Common Ancestor is apparent due to the common basis for all DNA and the use of only right-handed molecules- the archaea split from the bacteria 3.8-4 bya- the eukaryotes split from the archaea 2.5-3 bya- eukaryotes acquired mitochondria and chloroplasts around 2 bya, by engulfing bacteria- bacteria and archaea share 16 genes for respiration, suggesting that respiration evolved before the split- initially, UV radiation generated hydrogen peroxide and the respiratory mechanisms evolved to utilized it; these later evolved to process oxygenVitamin C- the various chemical reactions of vitamin C in the body are describedLiving with Oxygen- the complexity of the anti-oxidant processes in the body are investigated- the benefits of fruit and vegetables have not been duplicated by taking anti-oxidant supplements- it is possible that mild toxins in fruit stimulate the production of stress proteinsTrade-off's in the Evolution of Ageing- the cause of ageing seems to have elements of programmed cell death and of the accumulation of wear and tear over the lifetime (stochastic theories)- as bacteria do not age, it seems the ageing has evolved suggesting that it confers some evolutionary advantage- the disposable soma theory states that the body lasts only long enough to carry out reproduction - longer life only consumes resources that may be in short supply- this is substantiated by the inverse relationship between lifespan and fecundity over the various animal species- an increase in lifespan decreases fecundity - caloric restriction in humans does so - animals living in protected situations have longer lifespans but produce fewer offspringThe Triangle of Food, Sex and Longevity- there appears to be a distinction between ageing and age-related disease: some centenarians die of muscle wastage rather than disease- a number of gerontogenes which can double or triple the lifespans of simple animals have been discovered- insulin controls the triangle of nutrition, reproduction and longevity- high blood glucose stimulates insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGF's) which gears up the body for reproduction, throwing longevity to the wind- mutation of daf-2 confers insulin resistance, thus extending life- peoples that have historically lived with starvation have the thrifty genotype, which features a resistance to insulin - however, a high carbohydrate diet imposed on insulin resistance causes a loss of control of insulin levels leading to type 2 diabetes- the introduction of farming with a regular supply of milk may have caused Europeans to lose the thrifty genotype and insulin resistanceRate of Living and the Need for Sexes- the rate of living idea is live fast, die young- While animals appear to have a lifetime number of heartbeats, perhaps more significantly they have appear to have a lifetime energy potential of 60,000 litres of oxygen per kilogram- some animals exceed this number significantly: bats live 20 years, while mice live 3 years; pigeons live 35 years compared to rats at 4 years- the long living animals have been shown to produce fewer free radicals: pigeon mitochondria produce 10% the free radicals, compared to rats- there are good grounds for thinking that improving resistance to oxidative stress will slow ageing in animals- caloric restriction does not slow the metabolism, but increases stress resistance and lowers insulin levels, shifting the body away from sex and towards bodily maintenance- the rate of ageing is determined by the level of resources committed to prevention and repair- oxidative stress is particularly prevalent in mitochondria - the lifetime of a cell depends on the activity of it's mitochondria - cell lifetime varies with the number of mitochondria present- as to sex, the eggs are produced early in life and the mitochondria switched off, minimizing oxidative stress; sperm are produced continuously with active mitochondria for movement; at union, the damaged mitochondria from the sperm are scrapped, leaving the offspring with undamaged mitochondria- therefore, breathing oxygen is linked with both ageing and the origins of gender- the maximum human lifespan of 115 to 120 years is close to the mitochondrial burn-out in long lived neurons, heart and skeletal cellsThe Double-Agent Theory of Ageing and Disease- infection produces oxidative stress, triggering the immune system and inflammation- in age, the mitochondria leak free radicals increasing the level of oxidative stress, eventually leading to chronic low level infection- the rise in oxidative stress causes changes in gene expression- Alzheimer's disease seems to be brought on by increasing oxidative stress in the brain- factors that lower oxidative stress, such as aspirin and vitamin A, can postpone dementia by a few years and maybe indefinitely- smoking and high blood glucose increase oxidative stress- a third of cancers (more in the developing world) are brought on by infection - hepatitis, etc.Lessons From Evolution on the Future of Ageing- which came first, the chicken or the egg? bacteria acquire traits that are passed to their offspring (chicken first) while in sexual species the genetic change occurs at fertilization (egg first)- antioxidants have been proposed as a cure for ageing, but experimental evidence has provided no support- great 3 page summary of the evolution of life on page 318- oxidative stress is a signalling mechanism that underpins the cell's genetic response to injury- malaria infections in youth appear to result in suppression of the immune system - while this results in fewer autoimmune diseases in later life, it also opens the door to severe infections such as tuberculosis- there is rising support for the idea that we need regular infections for the immune system to develop properly: the rising incidence of autoimmune diseases is instructive- evidence that those that suffer many infections in youth leads to immunosuppression making disease in later years less frequent- in the future, we may learn to modulate the immune system, thus improving health in old age- can humans develop more efficient mitochondria like the birds? some Japanese have a gene for a more efficient mitochondria- exercise benefits mitochondria as it stimulates the replication of the viable stock- mental activity may do the same; there is evidence that it helps protect against Alzheimer's disease"

It synthesizes many areas of science to describe the role of oxygen in the history of our planet, life on the planet and ageing and age-related diseases. Indeed, the latter comes as something of a surprise, since Lane seems to synthesize a new theory of ageing and age-related diseases, which you wouldn't expect in a popular science book.However, it's not quite a popular science book. It has not just scope but also a depth (especially in the chemistry) hat was often beyond me. Even so, each chapter is well enough written that, even if the entirety of the science is not intelligible, the thrust of the chapter is still very clear."

13,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43062016-steve-jones,5,"This is the best popular science book that I have read in years. The first half covers the role of oxygen in the evolution of life, including how and when the oxygen content of the atmosphere evolved from virtually zero concentration to the present 21% by volume. The most fascinating part of this account is the resolution of the apparent paradox of how life on Earth coped with photosynthetic cyanobacteria ""inventing"" a form of chlorophyll which created a toxic waste product : Oxygen. The resolution of this ""paradox"" lies in the fact that Oxygen creates free radicals in living organisms in a chain of reactions four long with Oxygen at one end and water at the other; the amazing fact is that the reverse of this chain of reactions (from water to Oxygen) can be initiated by ionising radiation, so that the toxic effects of radiation poisoning and ""Oxygen poisoning"" are virtually identical. The earliest forms of life in the surface layers of the ocean were exposed to UV radiation because the lack of Oxygen (and hence ozone) in the atmosphere meant that it could reach the Earth's surface. Consequently, life evolved defences that could soak up the free radicals produced by ionising radiation, and so, when cyanobacteria invented a form of photosynthesis that yielded Oxygen as a waste product, they had the defences in place to cope with this toxic waste. The accounts of this are absolutely fascinating, and eye-opening at the same time. The second half of this excellent book deals with the role of Oxygen in many killer diseases and why we age. Read this brilliant book; you won't regret it."
14,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4215702-jenny-brown,3,"I was so enthusiastic about Lane's book about mitochondria that this book was a bit of a let down. In particular, unlike the case with the other book, Lane ventured here into describing a topic I'm familiar with--metabolic diseases, most notably diabetes and alzheimers, and when he did so, his writing shook my confidence in his reporting because of the way he grossly oversimplified issues and accepted theories that are based on flawed or questionable research. I realize this book was written a while ago before there was a large body of research calling into question the theories he assumes explain origins of diabetes and alzheimers but I was following these subject areas back at the time he was writing and if you looked closely at the primary research--not just at the few articles that were highlighted in the wider press because they confirmed the Just So stories people wanted to believe--there was ample evidence then that the mainstream analysis was faulty. That said, his argument against supplementing with antioxidants was cogent and has been borne out by subsequent research that documents that people who supplement with antioxidants are more prone to die than people who don't--and that antioxidants block the benefits of exercise. But his interpretation of the role of oxidative stress as a primary cause for diabetes, and his nutritional recommendations, are murkily written, confusing, and at times as wrong as Pauling's theories about Vitamin C. Which is frustrating because this is a topic I would really like to understand better.  "

16,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9904609-carl-eric,5,"A very well-written book. The author puts forth some very interesting ideas about how oxygen and oxidation underlie many biological functions and problems. I'm not really qualified to really make a judgement call on whether he is right on all points, but I find the arguments both plausible and convincing. Especially since he manages to link it all to the history of life on Earth and the evolution of all domains of life. He also neatly kicks out a number of currently-dominant theories, such as the pre-Cambrian oxygen catastrophe. This is the part where I really cannot tell whether he is right or not. However, he makes a plausible argument and is careful to note where the currently available evidence in support of his argument is not yet sufficient.In any case, a very interesting read for anyone interested in evolution, biochemistry or medicine. Medicine? Yes indeed. The author also examines the effects of oxygen (free radicals) on health, and whether currently fashionable antioxidant treatments are actually useful."

18,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110387269-xiang-yang,5,"This is really a brilliant book. I finished the whole book within three days. Totally enjoying it. I was amazed by the extraordinary range of knowledge of the author, Nick Lane, covering environmental geology, biochemistry, medicine. And all these knowledge was wrapped in the net of evolutionary biology. The core idea of the book is the energy is the core of biology, a thought which is largely in line with previous distinguished physicist, Schodinger. As a common way of generating energy for all living things on earth, the respiratory chain utilizing oxygen and sunlight provides a great opportunity for life to take a great leap in the way of evolution, as well as bringing a great challenge at the same time, that is, how to cope with the oxidative stress brought about by this energy-generating process, represented by various kinds of oxygen free radicals. The author further on argues that oxygen free radicals lie at the crossroads of several seeming unrelated research fields, including aging or senescence, life span, infectious disease, autoimmune disease, necessity of sex, mitochondria related disorders, on and on. All these interesting topics certainly play a role in making this book so popular. On the other hand, the thinking process, the theories, the hypothesis and arguments, are all based on solid experimental evidence, thus earning this book’s reputation as science. Just like the author said in the last chapter, researchers have been busy collecting data and evidence too much, while thinking or summarizing too little. This book just fills the thinking gap in research.----------edited on 2020-3-11After completing the book, I have tried to make short summaries about the content of each chapter. Here i just put it out for those interested. A brief summary for the book Power, Sex and suicide Chemiosmotic force and iron-sulphur minerals are the two most important components of primitive cells, where the electron transmission and ATP formation is happening. Electron transmission were completed on the inner membrane of mitochondria. And it’s essential to keep the flow of electron along this chain happy and smooth, for electron leakage would form free radicals, consequences of which will be disastrous for a single cell. From an evolutionary perspective, there are advantages for mitochondria to retain some of the original genes instead of transferring all to the cell nucleus. Due to relatively higher mutation rate of mitochondrial DNA compared to nuclear DNA, mitochondria with defect in the respiratory protein chains would be destroyed and out-competed by their healthy counterparts. If all the relevant genes were transferred to the nucleus, then it would be difficult for the nucleus to identify which mitochondria need new proteins and which don’t. You can compare this inefficiency to the bureaucracy of Soviet-Union centralized planning system.  As for the size difference between prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells, the core idea is the limitation conferred by energy efficiency. Membrane structure is where the cellular respiration happens. So as the cell increases in volume to the third power of diameter, the membrane surface area only increases to the second power of diameter, which means the energy generation for a unit volume decreases. And size or volume is the prerequisite for structure complexity. Eukaryotic cells overcome this limitation by the classical endosymbiosis which internalized the energy production process and freed cells from the surface-area-volume-ratio limitation. An eukaryotic cell could always increase the number of mitochondria to cope with energy requirements associated with larger size. Bacteria take another approach in this evolutionary competition: they get rid of superfluous genes that are not vital to maintain the daily living and reproduction process just to achieve a faster rate of amplification.  The relation between mitochondria and host cell is way more than just peaceful coexistence and mutual cooperation. The two entities may diverge sometimes with their selfish interests in mind. And this divergence of interests lead to the genesis of multicellular organisms and sex. Various kinds of stress from the external environment might lead the host cell to lose the ability of replication, where the mitochondria would promote gene exchange and recombination through sex, where the mutated genes could be repaired. And mitochondria accomplish this using the free-radicals signal. After this recombination, host cell continues to divide happily with the mitochondria dividing more happily.  However, for multi-cellular organisms, the unrestrained sex behavior and gene recombination is detrimental the organism as whole. If there is something serious wrong with a single cell inside a multi-cellular organism, the best choice for the organism is to replace the single cell with a healthy one. And this was also achieved through the free-radicals signal, which would trigger a series of events: depolarization of inner membrane, release of cytochrome C, Caspase flowing into nucleus to trigger the apoptosis process. Here we must point it out that this free-radical induced apoptosis has to be monitored carefully and try to strike a balance. One way to modulate this process is through the decoupling of electron transmission and ATP formation, thus leading to the emergence of warm-blood animals, which then promotes the rapid spread of animals from tropical areas to temperate and frigid regions. The fundamental mechanism behind is two kinds of outflow for the proton gradient. The proton gradient between two sides of the membrane could be used to generate either heat or ATP. For humans living in different regions, like Africans and Scandinavians, proportion of the two was quite different.  Sex in multi-cellular organisms: in order for the respiratory chains to work normally, the core proteins coded by mitochondrial DNA and other peripheral units coded by nuclear DNA have to interact with nanoscopic accuracy. And one way to keep this accurate interaction is to match one set of mitochondrial DNA with one set of nuclear DNA. And this was achieved during the fertilization, when mitochondria from the sperm were blocked out of the oocyte, which means only maternal mitochondria were left to the next generation. Ageing in human: the mutation rate of genes in mitochondria is much higher than that in cell nucleus. Those damaged mitochondria were rapidly repaired or replaced by other normally functioning mitochondria. As time goes by, the pool of normal mitochondria gradually dries out, which means the cell cannot work normally and enter into apoptosis. It is by this process that we get old. The ageing process is not determined by the absolute time we have lived by, but by the total amount of free-radical leakage that has accumulated over these years. This also has something to do with all kinds of degenerative conditions associated with the ageing process, including hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease and neurodegenerative conditions among many others. So modulating the free-radical leakage rate may provide a potential cure for all these age-related conditions. 	Now we can conclude by saying that mitochondria is at the heart of life. Combined with the theory of evolution, mitochondria provide a powerful explanation for a myriad of seemingly unrelated phenomena: the origin of life, the genesis of sex, the appearance of endothermic animals, the utility of sperm and oocyte, the process of ageing and finally the inevitable death of human beings.

That being said, the topic was fascinating and the information I could glean from it was really eye opening. The thing is that this book is very heavy in many different disciplines of science. You will read about geology, paleontology, genetics, chemistry, organic chemistry, molecular biology, cell biology, and more. This isn't a book you just sit down to read for entertainment, to get the most out of it, it really demands your time and focus."
20,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5858523-christopher-zeeb,3,The book was very slow going in the beginning with the history of how oxygen appeared on Earth. Kinda redundant and technical. Thesecond half of the book was much better. It discussed how free radicals affect our health and aging and the role of mitochondria in the production of free radicals. It also discussed how antioxidants work and how effective they are in combatting free radicals. I found this to be very interesting and easier to follow.
21,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2170150-sheng-peng,3,"I learned that the hype about antioxidant pretty much died out in the 70s in the medical community. And I learned that vegetables and fruits are good for you but nobody is sure why they are. And I also learned that birds live really long. Overall, interesting book. Writing is mediocre, as most of the analogies are lame and muddling rather than elucidating and after the barrage of factoids the enlightenment never come."
22,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2853516-emily,5,An interesting look at the molecule oxygen and its impact on human life and evolution. I found the theory of fecundity versus longevity particularly compeling. One almost wants to reread this book several times to absorb all of Lane's theories. This may be a good idea in a society that is obsessed with antioxidants and generally clueless as to their actual function.
23,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13773191-jonas-gehrlein,4,The book gives a complete overview over oxygen`s effect on life though the book you can see which experiments that lead to Lane`s conclusions.His points at the end on oxygen effect on aging and the workings of Alzheimers and cancer are wellformed and worth reading.
24,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89796323-viktoria-tomcheva,5,"Oxygen has had extraordinary effects on life. Three hundred million years ago, in Carboniferous times, dragonflies grew as big as seagulls, with wingspans of nearly a metre. Researchers claim they could have flown only if the air had contained more oxygen than today - probably as much as 35 per cent. Giant spiders, tree-ferns, marine rock formations and fossil charcoals all tell the same story. High oxygen levels may also explain the global firestorm that contributed to the demise of the dinosaurs after the asteroid impact. The strange and profound effects that oxygen has had on the evolution of life pose a riddle, which this book sets out to answer. Oxygen is a toxic gas. Divers breathing pure oxygen at depth suffer from convulsions and lung injury. Fruit flies raised at twice normal atmospheric levels of oxygen live half as long as their siblings. Reactive forms of oxygen, known as free radicals, are thought to cause ageing in people. Yet if atmospheric oxygen reached 35 per cent in the Carboniferous, why did it promote exuberant growth, instead of rapid ageing and death? Oxygen takes the reader on an enthralling journey, as gripping as a thriller, as it unravels the unexpected ways in which oxygen spurred the evolution of life and death. The book explains far more than the size of ancient insects: it shows how oxygen underpins the origin of biological complexity, the birth of photosynthesis, the sudden evolution of animals, the need for two sexes, the accelerated ageing of cloned animals like Dolly the sheep, and the surprisingly long lives of bats and birds. Drawing on this grand evolutionary canvas, Oxygen offers fresh perspectives on our own lives and deaths, explaining modern killer diseases, why we age, and what we can do about it. Advancing revelatory new ideas, following chains of evidence, the book ranges through many disciplines, from environmental sciences to molecular medicine. The result is a captivating vision of contemporary science and a humane synthesis of our place in nature. This remarkable book will redefine the way we think about the world."
25,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69411959-aaron,4," Quick Notes:1.) This book states it is targeted towards the 'general public', however I would argue that one needs at least some general understanding of the multitude of scientific fields, including but not limited to: cellular biology, molecular biology, organic chemistry, genetics, geology and paleontology just for starters.2.) Furthermore, Lane's work is a lot of speculation which he provides sufficient plausibility, but is also humble enough to admit in not so few words that it is speculation on his part. Given that this book is two decades old, I'll give him a pass on his ideas of 'junk DNA'.3.) Unlike 'Storm In A Teacup', Lane's book is a bit choppy, spanning back and forth between science fields which even after settling down in a quiet place and reading the physical book at a snails pace, I found to be a bit disorienting at times. I think it would've served both his work and the reader better to have stuck to a particular field and then tied in the relative fields afterwards.4.) Last critique, the early chapters seemed a bit repetitive. The seemingly constant regurgitation of how oxygen appeared on Earth seemed to be an energy drain. However, the book did a magnificent job of recovering in the latter half.Would I recommend this book to just anyone? Absolutely not. I'd say one has to have a serious appetite to digest a book as dense as this.Good thing for Lane, I've the appetite for knowledge like a supermassive black hole. I do intend on looking into Lane's other novels: 'Power, Sex, Suicide: Mitochondria and the Meaning of Life' as well as 'The Vital Question: Energy, Evolution, and the Origins of Complex Life'."
26,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/447506-curtis-bozif,5,"Super interesting book that covers the formation of the earth, the beginning of life on our planet, evolution, genetics, health, lifestyle, diet, etc. Lot's of new information to me like:1. LUCA, the last universal common ancestor or last universal cellular ancestor (LUCA), is the most recent population of organisms from which all organisms now living on Earth have a common descent, the most recent common ancestor of all current life on Earth. 2. The Great Oxidation Even or Catastrophe might not have been a catastrophe at all. Meaning, a surplus of oxygen in the atmosphere after the invention of photosynthesis might not have caused a mass extinction as has been widely speculated. 3. Photosynthesis evolved only once.4. Were it not for the invention of photosynthesis, which created a surplus of oxygen in the atmosphere, which in turn helped to create an ozone layer, Earth would have lost it's liquid oceans to evaporation as happened to the liquid oceans on Mars and Venus. This also points to the fact that if life ever existed on Mars and Venus, it certainly never evolved the ability to photosynthesis. 5. Mitochondria, by taking up residence, or more likely, seeking refuge inside a the cell membrane, might have found a way to perpetuate the conditions of a low-oxygen environment from which it originally evolved as a bacteria billions of years ago! Whoa!Finally, I listed to the audio book which was read by Nigel Patterson. Patterson might be my favorite narrator. I could listen to him read just about anything."
27,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71259486-david-chen,5,"Took some time and some on and off reading, but very excellent book. Nick Lane provides an excellent background and overview of just how important and integral oxygen has been to the proliferation of life on Earth as well as its continued integral role in life and death.Starting out from primordial origins, he describes the evolution of life as it had to deal with free oxygen radicals formed by ultraviolet splitting of the sun, transitions to the development of photosynthetic organisms and the subsequently rapid population of the land, oceans, and atmosphere with molecular oxygen, and finally ends with a discussion on aging and the role of free oxygen radicals in its cause.It is a dense, yet accessible and satisfying work that will keep you hooked when you’re not overwhelmed by the connections he made, and regardless of your knowledge background, it is accessible enough to keep readers from a diversity of interests satisfied. I for one felt quite vindicated for not taking vitamin supplements and instead eating fruits and vegetables like a normal person should. For medical researchers reading this book, this might vindicate that overwhelming feeling you have that oxygen might be affecting that disease you’re studying. Whatever your interests, you will find something interesting from reading this book."
28,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71595-robert,4,"I had already 2 other Nick Lane books before reading this, so I had a good idea of what to expect. One thing I am realizing now: All Nick Lane's books are the same! They all address these topics:-How life evolved-What chemical reactions happened-Evolutionary theories to explain why things happened the way they didBut he writes so well that I don't mind at all the significant overlap between his different books.Here are some things that stood out to me in this book:(1) Oxygen is toxic to life. It was obvious once he explained it but I had never thought about it this way. I thought Oxygen was supposed to be GOOD for you!(2) ""Antioxidants"" are probably useless. Again, his explanation makes sense. Indeed, most ""supplements"" are probably useless.(3) Vitamin C is an antioxidant, it's necessary ... but it's not a magical cure for aging.(4) Calorie restriction might work by triggering your body to switch into cellular repair mode and away from reproduction mode.(5) I enjoyed his discussion of the different theories for why aging even exists.Now, I should note that this was the very FIRST book that Nick Lane wrote. If you like these topics I would recommend that you first read his newest book ""The Vital Question"", which covers some of the same topics but in an even more reader friendly way."
29,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97866709-david-cook,5,"I've learnt so muchIf only for the explanation of why we talk about mitochondrial Eve rather than mitochondrial Adam, it would have been worth the effort of reading this book. However there is so many other elements that have all been woven into a coherent theory that I'm really glad I stayed for the whole book.This isn't an easy read, my degree is in zoology (albeit many years in the past) and I struggled with both concepts and theory. I don't think your average lay person is going to follow everything but even if they don't I believe they will get a lot from it. That doesn't mean that the author's writing is at fault, just that the subject matter is technical.If Nick Lane has hit the nail on the head with his hypothesis then this might be one of the most important things you ever read!"

Overall I would say this is a better version of Nick Lane's following book, ""Power, Sex, Suicide"", however I can honestly recommend reading both books. ""Power, Sex, Suicide"" has some new perspectives on the topics introduced in ""Oxygen"", and is also an easier read for laypeople.The sheer amount of knowledge that this book contains, and its clear and genius narrative of tying evolutionary theory into aging research makes this a 5/5 read.

I say this because I look at the world differently now after reading it, than I did before reading it. For example, what can man ever really know about the earliest life forms? I used to believe that this was an area for pure speculation and that there was no scientific way of learning what actually happened. Dr. Lane changed my thinking. He has built a logical case fact by fact for the characteristics LUCA must have possessed. LUCA is shorthand for the Last Universal Common Ancestor for all living things. Another surprise is the adaptation for oxygen resistance by early life forms long before certain bacteria evolved which employed photosynthesis and added oxygen to our atmosphere. Again, Dr. Lane builds a solid case using fact upon fact.As the title suggests, oxygen is the common theme of the book. Yet, the presence of oxygen in our planet or any planet is equivalent to announcing that life is present. Dr. Lane is a biochemist and he has taken on a huge task in tackling this topic. I believe that he did an admiral job of it. He has drawn on research from the four corners of the world and organized the book into a systematic approach for introducing the facts. It is rare to find a book so loaded with information. I often found that I missed vital information if I let my focus lapse. I might have let my mind wander, while reading, only to learn I missed a key point when I refocused and read it again.Dr. Lane works hard and skillfully to explain the scientific points, that he is making. He is able to bring the subject matter down to the level of the average reader. And yet, some of the material is highly complex. I would advise potential readers of this book to at least learn about the basics of DNA, genes and protein production in the cells before tackling this book. You might read ""DNA, The Secret of Life"" by James Watson and/or ""Genome"" by Matt Ridley. A faster alternative to reading these books is a GOOGLE search with DNA, RNA, genes, polypeptides, proteins, as possible key words. There are some great websites for learning basic facts these days.""Oxygen, the Molecule that made the World"" will take you on a fantastic journey though time. Life began soon after our planet cooled enough to support it perhaps four billion years ago. Oxygen played a most vital role in this story. Oxygen is both life-supporting and toxic. This dual role is key to the story. Multi-celled life forms evolved at least partially as a defense against the rising oxygen levels nearly a billion years ago. Learn about the high oxygen levels of the Carboniferous Period where dragon flies were giants. Dr. Lane works his way forward to the evolution of man and finally the concerns of modern medicine. A large area of the final chapters are devoted to why we fail with age and what, if anything, we can do about it.Ralph Hermansen August 23,2010 "

88,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13334219-ralph-hermansen,5,"""Oxygen, The Molecule that made the World"" by Nick Lane.I found this to be a very important book. I say this because I look at the world differently now after reading it, than I did before reading it. For example, what can man ever really know about the earliest life forms? I used to believe that this was an area for pure speculation and that there was no scientific way of learning what actually happened. Dr. Lane changed my thinking. He has built a logical case fact by fact for the characteristics LUCA must have possessed. LUCA is shorthand for the Last Universal Common Ancestor for all living things. Another surprise is the adaptation for oxygen resistance by early life forms long before certain bacteria evolved which employed photosynthesis and added oxygen to our atmosphere. Again, Dr. Lane builds a solid case using fact upon fact.As the title suggests, oxygen is the common theme of the book. Yet, the presence of oxygen in our planet or any planet is equivalent to announcing that life is present. Dr. Lane is a biochemist and he has taken on a huge task in tackling this topic. I believe that he did an admiral job of it. He has drawn on research from the four corners of the world and organized the book into a systematic approach for introducing the facts. It is rare to find a book so loaded with information. I often found that I missed vital information if I let my focus lapse. I might have let my mind wander, while reading, only to learn I missed a key point when I refocused and read it again.Dr. Lane works hard and skillfully to explain the scientific points, that he is making. He is able to bring the subject matter down to the level of the average reader. And yet, some of the material is highly complex. I would advise potential readers of this book to at least learn about the basics of DNA, genes and protein production in the cells before tackling this book. You might read ""DNA, The Secret of Life"" by James Watson and/or ""Genome"" by Matt Ridley. A faster alternative to reading these books is a GOOGLE search with DNA, RNA, genes, polypeptides, proteins, as possible key words. There are some great websites for learning basic facts these days.""Oxygen, the Molecule that made the World"" will take you on a fantastic journey though time. Life began soon after our planet cooled enough to support it perhaps four billion years ago. Oxygen played a most vital role in this story. Oxygen is both life-supporting and toxic. This dual role is key to the story. Multi-celled life forms evolved at least partially as a defense against the rising oxygen levels nearly a billion years ago. Learn about the high oxygen levels of the Carboniferous Period where dragon flies were giants. Dr. Lane works his way forward to the evolution of man and finally the concerns of modern medicine. A large area of the final chapters are devoted to why we fail with age and what, if anything, we can do about it.Ralph Hermansen August 23,2010 "
89,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,4,"This is an extremely interesting and well written book about oxygen - how oxygen spurred the evolution of life, the functioning of oxygen in biological systems, aging, how oxygen relates to everyday life (besides breathing), amongst others. The nice thing about this book is that the author assumes his readers are intelligent and so doesn't simplify his writing or the concepts so much that it practically turns into gibberish. NOTE: The author's view of junk DNA is a bit dated - the book was published in 2002 and research on junk DNA has advanced since then.

Luckily I have a background in biology so for me it was easier to read, but even then there was a great deal of new information I have managed to learn from this masterpiece. Overall I would say this is a better version of Nick Lane's following book, ""Power, Sex, Suicide"", however I can honestly recommend reading both books. ""Power, Sex, Suicide"" has some new perspectives on the topics introduced in ""Oxygen"", and is also an easier read for laypeople.The sheer amount of knowledge that this book contains, and its clear and genius narrative of tying evolutionary theory into aging research makes this a 5/5 read. I can whole-heartedly recommend this if you are deeply interested in biology, and want to read an actual SCIENCE book."

However, I have a few issues with it, foremost of which is the poor choice of title for the book. As a chemist, I did enjoy the first half of the book that dealt with geology, paleobiology and the history of the planet as a whole from the context of oxygen. However, in the second half, Nick Lane's convoluted writing, in tangents nonetheless, loses track of the protagonist, the molecule O2. He draws upon his background in biology and medicine to add a good few chapters on sex, ageing and evolution, each of which discusses the role of oxygen as a footnote at best. I suspect readers with a background similar to the author's will thoroughly enjoy the book. Overall, this is a good piece of science writing. Misleading or not, I did learn a lot of new things."

Where did oxygen come from? How did it lead to the development of complex life on Earth? These are two fascinating questions eloquently answered in this book. How does oxidative stress and free radicals affect us today? Antioxidants might not be the miracle cure many have been led to believe. How does all this link to ageing and age-related disease?

148,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13334219-ralph-hermansen,5,"""Oxygen, The Molecule that made the World"" by Nick Lane.I found this to be a very important book. I say this because I look at the world differently now after reading it, than I did before reading it. For example, what can man ever really know about the earliest life forms? I used to believe that this was an area for pure speculation and that there was no scientific way of learning what actually happened. Dr. Lane changed my thinking. He has built a logical case fact by fact for the characteristics LUCA must have possessed. LUCA is shorthand for the Last Universal Common Ancestor for all living things. Another surprise is the adaptation for oxygen resistance by early life forms long before certain bacteria evolved which employed photosynthesis and added oxygen to our atmosphere. Again, Dr. Lane builds a solid case using fact upon fact.As the title suggests, oxygen is the common theme of the book. Yet, the presence of oxygen in our planet or any planet is equivalent to announcing that life is present. Dr. Lane is a biochemist and he has taken on a huge task in tackling this topic. I believe that he did an admiral job of it. He has drawn on research from the four corners of the world and organized the book into a systematic approach for introducing the facts. It is rare to find a book so loaded with information. I often found that I missed vital information if I let my focus lapse. I might have let my mind wander, while reading, only to learn I missed a key point when I refocused and read it again.Dr. Lane works hard and skillfully to explain the scientific points, that he is making. He is able to bring the subject matter down to the level of the average reader. And yet, some of the material is highly complex. I would advise potential readers of this book to at least learn about the basics of DNA, genes and protein production in the cells before tackling this book. You might read ""DNA, The Secret of Life"" by James Watson and/or ""Genome"" by Matt Ridley. A faster alternative to reading these books is a GOOGLE search with DNA, RNA, genes, polypeptides, proteins, as possible key words. There are some great websites for learning basic facts these days.""Oxygen, the Molecule that made the World"" will take you on a fantastic journey though time. Life began soon after our planet cooled enough to support it perhaps four billion years ago. Oxygen played a most vital role in this story. Oxygen is both life-supporting and toxic. This dual role is key to the story. Multi-celled life forms evolved at least partially as a defense against the rising oxygen levels nearly a billion years ago. Learn about the high oxygen levels of the Carboniferous Period where dragon flies were giants. Dr. Lane works his way forward to the evolution of man and finally the concerns of modern medicine. A large area of the final chapters are devoted to why we fail with age and what, if anything, we can do about it.Ralph Hermansen August 23,2010 "
149,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,4,"This is an extremely interesting and well written book about oxygen - how oxygen spurred the evolution of life, the functioning of oxygen in biological systems, aging, how oxygen relates to everyday life (besides breathing), amongst others. The nice thing about this book is that the author assumes his readers are intelligent and so doesn't simplify his writing or the concepts so much that it practically turns into gibberish.

Luckily I have a background in biology so for me it was easier to read, but even then there was a great deal of new information I have managed to learn from this masterpiece. Overall I would say this is a better version of Nick Lane's following book, ""Power, Sex, Suicide"", however I can honestly recommend reading both books. ""Power, Sex, Suicide"" has some new perspectives on the topics introduced in ""Oxygen"", and is also an easier read for laypeople.The sheer amount of knowledge that this book contains, and its clear and genius narrative of tying evolutionary theory into aging research makes this a 5/5 read.

However, I have a few issues with it, foremost of which is the poor choice of title for the book. As a chemist, I did enjoy the first half of the book that dealt with geology, paleobiology and the history of the planet as a whole from the context of oxygen. However, in the second half, Nick Lane's convoluted writing, in tangents nonetheless, loses track of the protagonist, the molecule O2. He draws upon his background in biology and medicine to add a good few chapters on sex, ageing and evolution, each of which discusses the role of oxygen as a footnote at best. I suspect readers with a background similar to the author's will thoroughly enjoy the book. Overall, this is a good piece of science writing. Misleading or not, I did learn a lot of new things."

Where did oxygen come from? How did it lead to the development of complex life on Earth? These are two fascinating questions eloquently answered in this book. How does oxidative stress and free radicals affect us today? Antioxidants might not be the miracle cure many have been led to believe. How does all this link to ageing and age-related disease?

208,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13334219-ralph-hermansen,5,"""Oxygen, The Molecule that made the World"" by Nick Lane.I found this to be a very important book. I say this because I look at the world differently now after reading it, than I did before reading it. For example, what can man ever really know about the earliest life forms? I used to believe that this was an area for pure speculation and that there was no scientific way of learning what actually happened. Dr. Lane changed my thinking. He has built a logical case fact by fact for the characteristics LUCA must have possessed. LUCA is shorthand for the Last Universal Common Ancestor for all living things. Another surprise is the adaptation for oxygen resistance by early life forms long before certain bacteria evolved which employed photosynthesis and added oxygen to our atmosphere. Again, Dr. Lane builds a solid case using fact upon fact.As the title suggests, oxygen is the common theme of the book. Yet, the presence of oxygen in our planet or any planet is equivalent to announcing that life is present. Dr. Lane is a biochemist and he has taken on a huge task in tackling this topic. I believe that he did an admiral job of it. He has drawn on research from the four corners of the world and organized the book into a systematic approach for introducing the facts. It is rare to find a book so loaded with information. I often found that I missed vital information if I let my focus lapse. I might have let my mind wander, while reading, only to learn I missed a key point when I refocused and read it again.Dr. Lane works hard and skillfully to explain the scientific points, that he is making. He is able to bring the subject matter down to the level of the average reader. And yet, some of the material is highly complex. I would advise potential readers of this book to at least learn about the basics of DNA, genes and protein production in the cells before tackling this book. You might read ""DNA, The Secret of Life"" by James Watson and/or ""Genome"" by Matt Ridley. A faster alternative to reading these books is a GOOGLE search with DNA, RNA, genes, polypeptides, proteins, as possible key words. There are some great websites for learning basic facts these days.""Oxygen, the Molecule that made the World"" will take you on a fantastic journey though time. Life began soon after our planet cooled enough to support it perhaps four billion years ago. Oxygen played a most vital role in this story. Oxygen is both life-supporting and toxic. This dual role is key to the story. Multi-celled life forms evolved at least partially as a defense against the rising oxygen levels nearly a billion years ago. Learn about the high oxygen levels of the Carboniferous Period where dragon flies were giants. Dr. Lane works his way forward to the evolution of man and finally the concerns of modern medicine. A large area of the final chapters are devoted to why we fail with age and what, if anything, we can do about it.Ralph Hermansen August 23,2010 "
209,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,4,"This is an extremely interesting and well written book about oxygen - how oxygen spurred the evolution of life, the functioning of oxygen in biological systems, aging, how oxygen relates to everyday life (besides breathing), amongst others. The nice thing about this book is that the author assumes his readers are intelligent and so doesn't simplify his writing or the concepts so much that it practically turns into gibberish. NOTE: The author's view of junk DNA is a bit dated - the book was published in 2002 and research on junk DNA has advanced since then. Some other information might also be dated, but that is simply how science and science writing work.OTHER RELATED RECOMMENDED BOOKS:* The Emerald Planet: How Plants Changed Earth's History by David Beerling * Why We Get Sick: The New Science of Darwinian Medicine by Randolph M.

210,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108654860-k-v-r-bence,5,"This book must be a hard read for laypeople, however it is definitely worth all the suffering as its probably one of the best science books I have ever read. Luckily I have a background in biology so for me it was easier to read, but even then there was a great deal of new information I have managed to learn from this masterpiece. Overall I would say this is a better version of Nick Lane's following book, ""Power, Sex, Suicide"", however I can honestly recommend reading both books. ""Power, Sex, Suicide"" has some new perspectives on the topics introduced in ""Oxygen"", and is also an easier read for laypeople.The sheer amount of knowledge that this book contains, and its clear and genius narrative of tying evolutionary theory into aging research makes this a 5/5 read. I can whole-heartedly recommend this if you are deeply interested in biology, and want to read an actual SCIENCE book."
211,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21148981-adharsh-raghavan,4,"A very informative book on the role of oxygen in shaping the world as we know it. However, I have a few issues with it, foremost of which is the poor choice of title for the book. As a chemist, I did enjoy the first half of the book that dealt with geology, paleobiology and the history of the planet as a whole from the context of oxygen. However, in the second half, Nick Lane's convoluted writing, in tangents nonetheless, loses track of the protagonist, the molecule O2. He draws upon his background in biology and medicine to add a good few chapters on sex, ageing and evolution, each of which discusses the role of oxygen as a footnote at best. I suspect readers with a background similar to the author's will thoroughly enjoy the book. Overall, this is a good piece of science writing. Misleading or not, I did learn a lot of new things."

Where did oxygen come from? How did it lead to the development of complex life on Earth? These are two fascinating questions eloquently answered in this book. How does oxidative stress and free radicals affect us today? Antioxidants might not be the miracle cure many have been led to believe. How does all this link to ageing and age-related disease? These are all answered in this book. This is science writing at its best. Technical at times but well explained. I found my eyes opened even more to the sheer magnificence of evolution.

213,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4158765-christopher-murphy,5,"Well written and informative. It is quite hard to find good science communicators these days, and although Mr. Lane sometimes has to get quite complex, I find that he always brings it back to a summary that makes it clear to folks of many academic levels how much they know and how much they don't. Which is great, because works that make people think they understand more than they do are often quite troublesome in the current day and age. Hard to say if the ideas and hypotheses put forward by the book will pan out of course, but the writing is great, and the ideas intriguing. "

268,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13334219-ralph-hermansen,5,"""Oxygen, The Molecule that made the World"" by Nick Lane.I found this to be a very important book. I say this because I look at the world differently now after reading it, than I did before reading it. For example, what can man ever really know about the earliest life forms? I used to believe that this was an area for pure speculation and that there was no scientific way of learning what actually happened. Dr. Lane changed my thinking. He has built a logical case fact by fact for the characteristics LUCA must have possessed. LUCA is shorthand for the Last Universal Common Ancestor for all living things. Another surprise is the adaptation for oxygen resistance by early life forms long before certain bacteria evolved which employed photosynthesis and added oxygen to our atmosphere. Again, Dr. Lane builds a solid case using fact upon fact.As the title suggests, oxygen is the common theme of the book. Yet, the presence of oxygen in our planet or any planet is equivalent to announcing that life is present. Dr. Lane is a biochemist and he has taken on a huge task in tackling this topic. I believe that he did an admiral job of it. He has drawn on research from the four corners of the world and organized the book into a systematic approach for introducing the facts. It is rare to find a book so loaded with information. I often found that I missed vital information if I let my focus lapse. I might have let my mind wander, while reading, only to learn I missed a key point when I refocused and read it again.Dr. Lane works hard and skillfully to explain the scientific points, that he is making. He is able to bring the subject matter down to the level of the average reader. And yet, some of the material is highly complex. I would advise potential readers of this book to at least learn about the basics of DNA, genes and protein production in the cells before tackling this book. You might read ""DNA, The Secret of Life"" by James Watson and/or ""Genome"" by Matt Ridley. A faster alternative to reading these books is a GOOGLE search with DNA, RNA, genes, polypeptides, proteins, as possible key words. There are some great websites for learning basic facts these days.""Oxygen, the Molecule that made the World"" will take you on a fantastic journey though time. Life began soon after our planet cooled enough to support it perhaps four billion years ago. Oxygen played a most vital role in this story. Oxygen is both life-supporting and toxic. This dual role is key to the story. Multi-celled life forms evolved at least partially as a defense against the rising oxygen levels nearly a billion years ago. Learn about the high oxygen levels of the Carboniferous Period where dragon flies were giants. Dr. Lane works his way forward to the evolution of man and finally the concerns of modern medicine. A large area of the final chapters are devoted to why we fail with age and what, if anything, we can do about it.Ralph Hermansen August 23,2010 "
269,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,4,"This is an extremely interesting and well written book about oxygen - how oxygen spurred the evolution of life, the functioning of oxygen in biological systems, aging, how oxygen relates to everyday life (besides breathing), amongst others. The nice thing about this book is that the author assumes his readers are intelligent and so doesn't simplify his writing or the concepts so much that it practically turns into gibberish. NOTE: The author's view of junk DNA is a bit dated - the book was published in 2002 and research on junk DNA has advanced since then. Some other information might also be dated, but that is simply how science and science writing work.OTHER RELATED RECOMMENDED BOOKS:* The Emerald Planet: How Plants Changed Earth's History by David Beerling * Why We Get Sick: The New Science of Darwinian Medicine by Randolph M.

270,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108654860-k-v-r-bence,5,"This book must be a hard read for laypeople, however it is definitely worth all the suffering as its probably one of the best science books I have ever read. Luckily I have a background in biology so for me it was easier to read, but even then there was a great deal of new information I have managed to learn from this masterpiece. Overall I would say this is a better version of Nick Lane's following book, ""Power, Sex, Suicide"", however I can honestly recommend reading both books. ""Power, Sex, Suicide"" has some new perspectives on the topics introduced in ""Oxygen"", and is also an easier read for laypeople.The sheer amount of knowledge that this book contains, and its clear and genius narrative of tying evolutionary theory into aging research makes this a 5/5 read. I can whole-heartedly recommend this if you are deeply interested in biology, and want to read an actual SCIENCE book."
271,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21148981-adharsh-raghavan,4,"A very informative book on the role of oxygen in shaping the world as we know it. However, I have a few issues with it, foremost of which is the poor choice of title for the book. As a chemist, I did enjoy the first half of the book that dealt with geology, paleobiology and the history of the planet as a whole from the context of oxygen. However, in the second half, Nick Lane's convoluted writing, in tangents nonetheless, loses track of the protagonist, the molecule O2. He draws upon his background in biology and medicine to add a good few chapters on sex, ageing and evolution, each of which discusses the role of oxygen as a footnote at best. I suspect readers with a background similar to the author's will thoroughly enjoy the book. Overall, this is a good piece of science writing. Misleading or not, I did learn a lot of new things."
272,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24497967-matt,5,"Oxygen giveth life, and it taketh away.This is a fascinating book looking at the role oxygen has played from some 3.5 billion years ago to how it affects our biology today. Where did oxygen come from? How did it lead to the development of complex life on Earth? These are two fascinating questions eloquently answered in this book. How does oxidative stress and free radicals affect us today? Antioxidants might not be the miracle cure many have been led to believe. How does all this link to ageing and age-related disease? These are all answered in this book. This is science writing at its best. Technical at times but well explained. I found my eyes opened even more to the sheer magnificence of evolution. A superb read! "
273,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4158765-christopher-murphy,5,"Well written and informative. It is quite hard to find good science communicators these days, and although Mr. Lane sometimes has to get quite complex, I find that he always brings it back to a summary that makes it clear to folks of many academic levels how much they know and how much they don't. Which is great, because works that make people think they understand more than they do are often quite troublesome in the current day and age. Hard to say if the ideas and hypotheses put forward by the book will pan out of course, but the writing is great, and the ideas intriguing. "
274,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97017413-john,4,"Wow, this book is deep. Covers some complex Earth Sciences and Biology, not for the novice scientist! Very interesting introduction to how Oxygen ended up on the Earth and how it held onto it before it leads onto why evolution ended up using Oxygen and the legacy it has left in our ageing and eventual death. I'm only marking it down a star because it is so complex in places it could leave many readers completely lost."
275,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/811366-esmeralda-rupp-spangle,5,"I don't think such a short book has ever taken me so long to read. This is not a bad thing, in fact- it's because I was so fascinated by the subject matter that I would read and re-read entire chapters so that I could competently grasp the chemistry and biology involved. I found this to be enormously engaging and educational, and I am looking forward to reading more from this author. "
276,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5913732-rena,3,I will say that overall this book was quite intriguing. It was pretty heavily scientific and not really any new theories that I have not heard before. It gets a little bio-heavy for my taste (since this was recommended to me through some of my chemistry connections) but it's all very clearly stated.
277,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58936389-avi-eisenman,4,"I can't say I understood 100% of the science in this book, but the parts I did understand were intriguing enough to keep reading. A fascinating deep-dive into the origins of Oxygen, its influence on our world, as we know it, and how it holds the keys to life, aging, death, and more. "
278,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1343721-becky,4,"This book tied together geology, biogeochemistry, cell biology and medicine. I learned much from my unfamiliar areas and made many great connections to pull into my lectures and understanding. Occasionally overstated, but well-written popular science. "
279,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56496878-david-arch,5,"Fascinating read....Lanes argument that one must look through the prism of evolution to understand our biochemistry is illuminating. The role of oxidative stress in life cycles is a revelation. The informational density of this book, at least for me, require multiple readings"
280,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4976224-shane-graham,4,"I enjoyed this book quite a bit.It gets a bit technical in the middle (been a while since biology and chemistry at Uni) and I had to slog through, but it picks back up in the last third and finishes strong."
281,0198607830,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96809218-robert-inocencio-jr,4," Very well written, and very informational because I’m a science geek, but definitely not a novice level starter. The beginning few chapters and the last 2 chapters are more geared to an intermediate level but the middle gets technical if your not a molecular biologist. "
