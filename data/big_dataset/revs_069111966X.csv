It's not one of those ""esoteric knowledge revealed"" books nor a book which promises you'll get an Abel prize or a Fields Medal someday.What this books is, is a systematic and incredibly instructive overview of guidelines in mathematical problem solving, which are, as the author put it - ""natural, simple, obvious, and proceed from plain common sense.""If you've ever put yourself against a serious problem which you really, really, really wanted to have solved, the book probably won't teach you anything that you didn't know already. However, I have to say it twice, the book is written in a style so instructive that I'm pretty sure just about anybody could benefit from it. In my opinion, this is definitely one of those books that every mathematician and everyone using mathematics (or even dealing with difficult problems of non-mathematical nature) should read and even perhaps have one lying around... just in case you feel like solving the Riemann hypothesis :P (or something wee bit easier for that matter XD)"
1,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/261589-jeff,4,"George Polya's classic How to Solve It is a seminal work in mathematics education. Written in 1945 and referenced in almost every math education text related to problem solving I've ever read, this book is a short exploration of the general heuristic for solving mathematical problems. While the writing is a bit clunky (Polya was a mathematician and English was not his first language), the ideas are so deeply useful that they continue to have relevance not just for solving mathematical problems, but for solving any problem in any field.Polya's general steps for solving problems include the following four steps: 1. understand the problem, 2. devise a plan, 3. carry out the plan, and 4. look back and examine the solution. These are simple and easy to remember steps, but powerful in their applicability to the most basic to the most complex problems that we face and are at the heart of learning. Over the years, different writers have revised these steps (added, taken away, shifted the wording and emphasis) the essential points still hold.In addition, to the overall framework of Polya's heuristic and its generalizable nature, what I really like about this work is the fact that I can revisit it for nuggets of wisdom. The third section and roughly half of the book is taken up with ""A Short Dictionary of Heuristic"" which is a great resource. Each entry is a short essay on a given topic that weighs on either the nature of problem solving or the history of problem solving. One useful framework, that I took away immediately is the difference between ""Problems to Solve"" and ""Problems to Prove."" Making a distinction between these two types of problems it is easy to see that we often focus in education on problems to solve, but I and many students love finding out why (problems to prove).So that said, I think this is a book that I will come back to and reference: a true classic in the educational literature.

Okay so we are all more or less familiar with his genius, but how many with his meant-to-be-simple-yet-intuitive works?As a matter of fact I was a bit let down when I looked up the contents of the book after buying it for the first time. Why to waste money on some information you are already familiar with? But the book is quite something else to tell the truth. Firstly, it tells you the difference between a teacher and a researcher. You don't need to be a know-it-all to be a good teacher. However being a good teacher is probably even tougher, it demands time, practice, devotion and sound principles. He should try to teach the student discreetly, unobtrusively. You should know how to approach a problem, could it into something interesting for the listening fellas, and most importantly be an enthusiastic listener and observer. Saying which the book is not meant only for math-lovers, but for everyone else out there who is either a student or a teacher.Meanwhile you may have heard of the age old Reductio Ad Absurdum, but have you ever thought of an interpretation like this?"" Irony adopts, to all appearance, a certain opinion and stresses it and overstresses it till it leads to a manifest absurdity.""The best part of the book, though is the third one: SHORT DICTIONARY OF HEURISTIC. Polya's heuristic strategies are undoubtedly quite well known. And though many of them does sound familiar enough, I don't think there's another author who can put it forward that simply. If yes, most probably he's paying a homage to Polya. So, conclusion? Well it's not just an 
'A New Aspect of Mathematical Method' 
as said. It's also a great example of lucid literature. Also I didn't think my money wasted. Neither will anyone,or so I believe. It's considered by many an equivalent to The Bible in matters of teaching. Well,I hope that makes some sense."
3,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,3,"Polya tries to explain how to become a better 'problem solver', and how to guide others to better solve problems themselves. The core of the content is terrific, and gets you thinking about 'how to best think'.Unfortunately, almost everything gets repeated numerous times, and as a whole the books ends up being thoroughly redundant. You don't really need to read beyond the first 36 pages (the rest of the book consists of a 'problem solving dictionary', and here's where the redundancy begins). The problems in the back, presented to test your polished problem solving skills, are pretty awesome - definitely try to solve them yourself! One of my favorites: ""A bear, starting at point P, walked one mile due south. Then he changed direction and walked one mile due east. Then he turned again to the left and walked one mile due north, and arrived exactly at the point P he start from. What was the color of the bear?"" And no, this isn't a trick question - the answer makes perfect sense!"
4,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/266417-louis,5,"This is a book I wish I had read at the beginning of grad school. How to Solve It is not as much about methods of solving mathematical problems as it is about various approaches to solving problems in general. The method he uses to teach problem solving is to apply the approaches to problems of geometry. This is actually in line with the ancient greek (Aristotle) opinion that the young should learn geometry first, then when they have learned logic and how to prove things with physical reality, then they can go on to things such as philosophy or politics.The first part of How to Solve It are essays on how to teach and how to approach problems in general. His view on teaching is leading a student to think. Giving the student problems where the answer is not the goal, but the experience in seeing a new type of problem. This is contrasted with viewing teaching as a series of cookbook or algorithms to be taught. It also means the role of the teacher is to provide the problem, then give only what is necessary to nudge the student in the direction needed for the student to discover the method of solution. And presumably, to be able to develop methods for other problems the student has not seen before. Very much like what graduate school is supposed to be.The bulk of How to Solve It describes a wide range of approaches to problem solving. Some are familiar to a variety of disciplines such as business, crisis management, or general analysis. Some are more familiar to those in sciences or mathematics. But the illustrations are understandable to anyone past a first or second year of high school mathematics, making them much more understandable then, say, a graduate course in real analysis.If I was in the position of working with first year graduate students in anything, I would recommend this book as something to read before they arrive on campus. It provides a good first exposure to many problem-solving approaches and an exhortation on how to think logically and analytically, that will suit them well when they are faced with the complicated subject matter that is ahead of them."
5,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,2,"This is one of those mathematical ""classics"" that those of us with a training in math are supposed to love. Fact of the matter is that it is poorly written and pedestrian in nature. If you are seeking insight into how mathematicians think and approach problem-solving, give this one a miss. You'd be far better off to read Hardy's ""A Mathematician's Apology"" (dated, but still charming), or Ian Stewart's recent ""Letters to a Mathematician"" (charming and not dated at all)."
6,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5868960-omar-halabieh,5,"I recently finished reading How To Solve It - A New Aspect Of Mathematical Method - by George Polya.Below are key excerpts from this book that I found particularly insightful: A great discovery solves a great problem but there is a grain of discovery in the solution of any problem. Your problem may be modest; but if it challenges your curiosity and brings into play your inventive faculties, and if you solve it by your own means, you may experience the tension and enjoy the triumph of discovery. Such experiences at a susceptible age may create a taste for mental work and leave their imprint on mind and character for a lifetime. Studying the methods of solving problems, we perceive another face of mathematics. Yes, mathematics has two faces; it is the rigorous science of Euclid but it is also something else. Mathematics presented in the Euclidean way appears as a systematic, deductive science; but mathematics in the making appears as an experimental, inductive science. Both aspects are as old as the science of mathematics itself. But the second aspect is new in one respect; mathematics ""in statu nascendi,' in the process of being invented, has never before been presented in quite this manner to the student, or to the teacher himself, or to the general public. Trying to find the solution, we may repeatedly change our point of view, our way of looking at the problem. We have to shift our position again and again. Our conception of the problem is likely to be rather incomplete when we start the work; our outlook is different when we have made some progress; it is again different when we have almost obtained the solution. Where should I start? Start from the statement of the problem. What can I dot Visualize the problem as a whole as clearly and as vividly as you can. Do not concern yourself with details for the moment. What can I gain by doing so? You should understand the problem, familiarize yourself with it, impress its purpose on your mind. The attention bestowed on the problem may also stimulate your memory and prepare for the recollection of relevant points. It would be a mistake to think that solving problems is a purely ""intellectual affair""; determination and emotions play an important role. Lukewarm determination and sleepy consent to do a little something may be enough for a routine problem in the classroom. But, to solve a serious scientific problem, will power is needed that can outlast years of toil and bitter disappointments. If you cannot solve the proposed problem do not let this failure afflict you too much but try to find consolation with some easier success, try to solve first some related problem; then you may find courage to attack your original problem again. Do not forget that human superiority consists in going around an obstacle that cannot be overcome directly, in devising some suitable auxiliary problem when the original one appears insoluble. The future mathematician should be a clever problem-solver:; but to be a clever problem-solver is not enough. due time, he should solve significant mathematical problems; and first he should find out for which kind of problems his native gift is particularly suited.In closing: Going around an obstacle is what we do in solving any kind of problem: the experiment has a sort of symbolic value. The hen acted like people who solve their problem muddling: through, trying again and again, and succeeding eventually by some lucky accident without much insight into the reasons for their success. The dog who scratched and jumped and barked before turning around solved his problem about as well as we did ours about the two containers. Imagining a scale that shows the waterline in our containers was a sort of almost useless scratching, showing only that what we seek lies deeper under the surface. We also tried to work forwards first, and came to the idea of turning round afterwards. The dog who, after brief inspection of the situation, turned round and dashed off gives, rightly or wrongly, the impression of superior insight. No, we should not even blame the hen for her clumsiness. There is a certain difficulty in turning round, in going away from the goal, in proceeding without looking continually at the aim, in not following the direct path to the desired end. There is an obvious analogy between her difficulties and our difficulties.A highly recommended read in the area of problem solving."

10,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19710738-h-ctor-iv-n-patricio-moreno,5,One of the most useful books I've read in my life. It's an authentic treasure to everyone interested in problem-solving (and every one of us has enough problems to be interested in with problem-solving).I think this should be one of the obligatory lectures for high-school or college education because it states clearly the steps one intuitively follows when trying to solve a problem mathematical or not.The key takeaways for me are:1. If you conceive a plan to solve the problem you're almost done.2. Going around obstacles is a good way of solving problems.3. If you cannot solve the problem you have right now you could try several distinct strategies:- Change the problem- Change the expected result- Change the conditions- Change everything -> Anything that could make you improve your understanding of the problem could help.
11,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14945161-sandy-maguire,3,"I'm conflicted about this book. There is a lot of good advice around the art of problem solving, but my god is there a lot of shit too. The layout is mostly a big alphabetical glossary of _math things_ --- everything from leading questions to notions of symmetry to anecdotes about absentminded professors --- and the layout doesn't particularly help. It's not organized by topic or ordered by first things first, it's just plopped down alphabetically. As such, it's hard to get into the flow.This book however is lacking primarily in that it deals with how to solve ""well-posed questions,"" which is to say, toy problems. There is very little about conducting your own open-ended research, and about how to turn wisps of ideas into well-posed ones."
12,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17738039-michael,1,"This book was used as a reference in several of the other books I have read, and I understood it to be more of a general methodology of problem solving when I decided to read it. It is written in a somewhat awkward style, to an audience that is difficult to discern, and with enough repetition that I had to skip pages at a time to get to the next topic. This was frustrating as I really wanted to like this book. When Polya does focus on the generalized concepts of problem solving, he has wonderful insight. But that alone would fill less than five pages of the text. The level of pedantism regarding terminology here that I found boringly intolerable and eventually I dreaded picking the book back up because I got it already. Ultimately I failed to find in this book what has made it so successful. ""The List"" is a great problem-solving approach, but that's just the pre-introduction page, and doesn't justify the remaining 253."

I saw the book getting recommended again in other popular software talks and conferences and I decided to treat myself to the book. 100% worth it.Although the direct audience is math/logic/science teachers and students, the principles laid down in this book are generally applicable in other forms knowledge work e.g policy, entrepreneurship, academia and so on and so forth.It might be a bit intimidating to start the book without a technical background because the author relies on mathematical examples to make his points, but you can gloss over these examples and try to create your own examples or try and apply it to a problem that you are facing at work.For the principles in this book to stick you have to be consistent. Here is a quote from the book that highlights this well‚ÄúSolving problems is a practical skill like, let us say, swimming. We acquire any practical skill by imitation and practice. Trying to swim, you imitate what other people do with their hands and feet to keep their heads above water, and, finally, you learn to swim by practicing swimming.

16,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3860498-linah,5,"This is such a great book. Polya lays out the different approaches you can take to solve a problem. He primarily uses Euclidean geometry to explain the possible ways to approach different problems. This is especially great when you have to analyze a problem that you haven't seen before - where and how to begin? He goes through the problem-solving process in detail, beginning with the detailed analysis of the question and then the systematic synthesis of the answer. This book really changed how I see math, especially abstract math. I have a much deeper understanding and appreciation for abstract math after reading this book. The problems at the end of the book are challenging but fun when you finally (if at all) figure out what the trick is."

Introduce suitable notation.Separate the various parts of the condition.

Can you check the argument?Can you derive the result differently? Can you see it at a glance?Can you use the result, or the method, for some other problem?"
22,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38201925-bartosz,4,"On the surface How to Solve It by George P√≥lya is a short little book about strategies of solving mathematical problems. Deep down, however, it is not a book about mathematics, but it's a book devoted to heuristic - the study of methods and rules of discovery and invention.The book is divided into four parts ""In The Classroom"" - tips for the educator on guiding a student, ""How To Solve It"" - presenting the main questions you should ask yourself while solving problems, ""Short Dictionary of Heuristic"" - a not so short list of approaches and methods of problem solving along with people associated with the study of heuristic (like Pappus, Descartes). The last part is devoted to a ""hands on"" approach of problem solving - describing several short problems along with hints and solutions.First of all, I really liked the book. The four steps outlined in the book: \1 understand the problem \2 devise a plan \3 carry out the plan \4 review/extend; go straight to the heart of the matter and are universally applicable in any domain. Those rules might be obvious, but articulating and defining them in a clear way is definitely not. I had so much fun finding analogues between the problem solving approaches in mathematics and other domains like software engineering or puzzles or exclaiming ""so true!"" and ""wow!"" after an insightful passage. The list of heuristic methods in the third part is incredibly useful and I often wished I knew of this book when I was in high school or university.What I didn't like was the layout of the third part - instead of making a (not so) short dictionary of heuristic, I think, the book would benefit from introducing the heuristic methods in a principled way instead of ordering them alphabetically.All in all, I really enjoyed the book and had more fun then I would have thought possible with ""a math book""."
23,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2348903-greg-talbot,5,"Elegance in solving problems is not strictly a mathematical skill set. Polya wisely formats word problems, critical thinking problems, and yes mathematical problems that occasionally are intimidating.But one of the big takeaways is that problems are only as hard as they are unresolved. Not only does Polya give excellent ideas for solving problems: creating auxiliary problems, using heuristics, working backwards. Each example that Polya gives takes concentration and critical analysis. But when you decompress a problem into it's bare elements (variables, constants), the problem becomes manageable, even if not easily solvable.Some of the big takeaways for me from this book are the following:1) Always look from the end, trying to solve a problem2) Problem Solving is: data + unknowns + conditions. Everything is in that. Generalizing a specific problem into that, is going to give you a better road map.3) Always revisit a problem when you finish. It's not as important to get a correct answer, as it is to come to an understanding of what that problem is4) Understanding the problem is the place to start.5) Analogies help us to create similar problems, that we can then take those lessons and solve our original problem.Polya's revelations remind me very much of a brain training book. The focus is mathematics, but the principles are universal. For those looking for a book both accessible and profound, it gets my highest recommendation. "

Likely, it had to do with some teaching and presenting, as well as the interest I mustered not being totally repelled in the hoisting of what curriculum mandates must-be-learned. This book takes a simple, interesting approach and though it's written in the 40s, many benefits remain to-be-had from popularity outside its field. For me, beginning this book, I recalled how as an undergrad tutor for ESL students, our classroom utilized math word problems to bridge what was already an advanced proclivity for many of the Chinese students there - math - into the English language. In an American neighborhood where one could live a basically full-life with little knowledge of English, it gave cause for a leap.Here Polya uses words to bridge people into the world of mathematical concept, so often performed solely by numbers and symbols in its mechanics, we do not as often highlight the immense language of meaning signified within any method. And in a society where these mechanics can at times feel assumed and tiresomely already-done, it grants the charm of discovery and rediscovery and lends the value of everyday affirmation through exploration.So good."
26,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89099-ben,4,"This is a cool book. It's a comparatively rare thing for a first-class mathematician to write really seriously and thoughtfully about math education; at least it's not something I've come across too much. And it's been about a year and a half since I read anything about math education I didn't feel like I already knew. (Props to the _Young Mathematicians at Work_ series by Fosnot and Dolk, which was the last thing I read like that...)The thing that makes this book unusual is that it's about the actual anatomy of solving problems you don't already have a formula for. Like, what does an effective problem-solver really do when they try to solve a problem? What is the actual process by which novel problems are contemplated, relevant bodies of knowledge called upon, resources found, and solutions formulated? What parts of the process are creative and what parts are rigorous? What can one do to get some traction when one is stuck? Somehow, in all my years of reading and thinking about math education, I've never seen an attempt to systematically formulate answers to these questions; but that's what Polya is trying to do here (and substantially succeeding)."

It's had a great deal of influence on how I approach math. It's one of the best math books I've ever read, and quite possibly the best book on mathematical problem solving ever written. There are two copies of it floating around my lab at Berkeley, evidence, i think, that I'm not the only one who appreciates it.Polya was a first rate mathematician, and his book is devoted to explaining simply and usefully how a good mathematician tries to solve math problems. It's organized as a list of strategies to use, or questions to ask during problem solving. There are sections, for instance, on ""drawing figures"", and ""Do you know a related problem?"" with examples, and detailed advice.It's short, engagingly written, witty, and easy to follow. I cannot recommend it too highly to anyone who has to deal with mathematical problems (in science, engineering, or the like) on even an occasional basis."

However, I think I read this at the wrong time - it could have fascinated me much more had I read it in the early 2000s (then again, there was not any translation to Vietnamese back then, and I suspect my mediocre English back then would not let me finish it).Still, the way I went at the book is that I skimmed through most of it, only stopping at the particular instances I found new/ relevant/ interesting. I skipped a lot of the examples (I know, I know, I'm still feeling guilty about it!) , regardless I found many good gems in the long stretch of text. The creator's paradox, for example, is something I've learned the hard way, but seeing it packed into a concept helped organize my thinking a lot. I would have given it a much higher rating as a middleschool to highschool student. I like the chapter at the end though. Fun questions. "

I'm always looking for educational texts on analytical methods, so this one caught my eye. What an amazing find! P√≥lya presents the reader with a list of steps to use when analyzing a problem and breaks each one down comprehensively. The entire book references back upon itself repeatedly, so you can always circle back to important, related points.The writing style is quirky, yet approachable, and very direct. The author's referencing of, ""The slower, dim student"", made me laugh out loud in amusing surprise.The text is not long but it took me over a month to read because every couple of pages, I had to stop and digest what I'd read, or write down new thoughts about some problem that I could apply his methods on. Even better, the methods he describes are not just relevant to mathematics but are applicable to a wide range of analysis and problem-solving.This is a phenomenal book and I only wish I'd been introduced to it earlier in my life."

However, some of the math examples were completely above my level of comprehension, and I had to bribe myself to read through those droll parts to understand what the author was trying to illustrate rather than just skipping. I had to read the book twice, because I kept ""checking out"" after those droll parts, but the second time I read it, the concepts it was trying to teach really started clicking. This book helped open my eyes to the reasons why I started struggling when I got to college level math. It emphasized how important it is to understand the problem itself, the usefulness of drawing diagrams, and how important it is to go back over the answer and take time to learn how the problem works, and avoid falling in the trap of just memorizing formulas to fill in.All in all, I plan to keep this on my shelf for a while, so I can go back and review the concepts until they become second nature to me. The strategies suggested definitely deserve careful practice to learn fully. "

Many of the entries overlapped.I stumbled across the book as a recommendation to programmers: this isn't fully appropriate. As a prerequisite, you should be thoroughly acquainted with high school geometry, algebra and basic calculus, as well as having modest experience in proof-based mathematics.

Being a mathematician, mathematics is the context in which most discussion occurs and in which most examples are given. However, in some sense the focus on mathematics is just one long running example. What the book is really trying to do is teach problem solving. It is trying to give you the essential concepts of successful problem solving as well as giving you a bag of tricks and techniques that you can use on your own.The book reads easily enough. However, the tone of the writing does on occasion tend to be just a bit unintentionally condescending. Most math books from this era that I have read suffer this same problem, so I don't fault this book or the author per se, just the era."

The math is very accessible, as it does not require any higher level maths to understand the examples. A familiarity with geometry and algebra would suffice. The book has historical significance as being a pioneer in attempting to address problem solving techniques in a organized and rigorous way. The organization of his techniques is alphabetical by title and Polya does not attempt to offer any over arching structure to his techniques. As he wisely points out the subject is far too vast. Any such organizing principles would require such a level of over simplification as to not have any usefulness. A good read for the beginner to mathematics. "

It may be a little tough for a beginner to cut through all his writing to the heart of it, but it's well worth the read.

The main takeaway of the book is 'the list [of rhetorical/guiding questions]' which is put forth immediately at the outset. The book then follows in 4 parts. The first part is excellent (5 starts) in that the author makes it easy to see what questions to ask to help in understanding the problem, discovering ideas & devising a plan, carrying out the plan and looking back (the four phases). This part is the heart of the book and has plenty of explanation and examples.The second part (4 stars) is just 4 pages and is completely optional.*The third part (4 stars) is quite massive and the alphabetical sorting of articles would most likely discourage any reader. The key here is to follow what the author said in the introduction: read Heuristics and Modern Heuristics and you would find them point to other articles in the 'Dictionary'. While they do not point to all articles, the pointed articles do end up pointing to rest of the articles. If you find some articles more interesting/relevant the others you can certainly customize. I do however disagree with the author that you shouldn't read the articles quickly. Actually most articles are just words (not much equations). It's very natural to read them very quickly. However, I would make an important point here: be selective and feel free to leave articles on topics that do not seem challenging to you. I did read many articles because I wanted to read the book exhaustively to review it well; they didn't provide any additional value indeed. I ended up skipping most articles. Having done research in both applied math and engineering, I didn't find the articles in the Dictionary even mildly useful. The article turned out to be just perspectives. Having said that, I did find these articles quite useful or at least interesting:1. Puzzles2. Reductio ab absurdum and indirect proof3. Working backwardsThe fourth and final part (5 stars) is a collection of some very nice problems, with some good hints and detailed solutions. Personally, I only solved a few of them because the Part 1 have all that I was looking for from the book.*See note in my reading status update of this book.Part 1: Section 1-5; Section 6-17; Section 18-20 (end);Part 2: FullPart 3: FullPart 4: Full"
45,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35579306-alex,4,"This book is in desperate need of an update, some of the content feels redundant and it retains its archaic manner of speaking from 1945. Polya had a way of making the simplest algebraic and geometric operations seem like magic, and I don‚Äôt particularly mean that as a compliment. There were large sections of this book that I drudged through only to realize that I gained nothing from it and was so fatigued by it that I couldn‚Äôt bare to reread those sections. Some of this is my own fault, in that I‚Äôm not as current on some geometry as I could have been going into this read. For example, I didn‚Äôt know what a ‚Äòparallelpiped‚Äô was and looked it up several times, it didn‚Äôt quite stick with me until it got brought up in my Calc 3 class.However, it wasn‚Äôt all bad! I definitely feel as if I gained some insight into solving problems, especially mathematically. I‚Äôve taken his list to heart when solving problems. I‚Äôll often ask myself ‚ÄòWhat is the unknown?‚Äô, ‚ÄòWhat are the data?‚Äô, or ‚ÄòDo I know a similar or auxiliary problem?‚Äô. I may at some point in the future attempt to reread this so that I can pick up on new things that I stubbornly skipped. My biggest advice to anyone who plans on reading this (or, heaven forbid, is required to read this) is to have patience with it and know that there will be sections you may have to reread a few times to understand what Polya is getting at. It took me seven months of on and off reading, finishing several other books in the process, to finish this and you will most likely benefit from taking your time as well. Good luck!"

They may sometimes go to bed after an exhausting attempt, spend time with her in his dreams, and then wake up with a ""eureka"" moment. However, without proper experience, they may give up easily. Their feelings will get hurt. The teacher must intervene, helping them get back up and try again. She won't keep her suitor away forever if he pursues her diligently. When he wins her favor, he will know the ecstasy of romance, and want to commit to her for life. If you have fallen out of love, Polya's method encourages falling back in love over and over again. You may not get the solution immediately, or on your third try, but you can learn to consider different perspectives. You can create auxiliary problems whose solutions will help you with the original. By seeing the end from the beginning, you can trace your steps backward, and then reverse. Through this process, you will see the problem from so many fresh angles to inspire you.

Here are my key take-aways from the book:-First ask if you understand the unknown and ask futher general questions about the data and the conditions. (p. 2)-Common sense and generality are characteristics of helpful suggestions and questions that one can give to a student. Hints should be on such a level that they could have come from the student himself. Only then, the student will see how he could have connected thoughts that were already present to ask a promising question. (p. 4)-Induction and mathematical induction: Induction is the process of discovering general laws from observing instances while mathematical induction is used to prove theorems of a certain kind. There is little logical connection between the two, but they are often used together. One could, for example, find that the sum of the first n cubes is a square from induction. This could be proved using mathematical induction. (pp. 117-120)"

277,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97123149-jurgen-neuer,4,This book is not primarily aimed at mathematicians. The ideas in this book help with all types of problem solving.Polya's little books has stood the test of time and should be read or at least on your reading list.
278,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41972609-rixx,3,"How to Solve It is decent, but overrated ‚Äì the first 10% are pretty good, and then there are a few nuggets of really good advice interspersed with the neverending examples of the principles introduced in the first part."
279,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3114636-lara-thompson,4,"The only ‚Äúdownside‚Äù is that the book gets as repetitive as a math teacher must be. This is full of fun analogies, tidy problems in geometry, word puzzles, logic. Definitely gives a nice framework for solving problems!"
280,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8841115-veena,5,It is a good idea to read how to break down a problem before solving it.It definitely gets a little mathematical but also interesting.
281,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6230200-alexander-matyasko,5,This book requires slow reading because changing thinking is a slow process. It can be helpful to someone who is struggling with math. It can be helpful to someone to step up their mathematical skills. I would definitely try to revisit it every few years!
282,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43122553-masatoshi-nishimura,3,"I found this book ok. I know there's a historical value, but aside from that, I think there're better books like Problem Solving 101. I'd still recommend this if you're into math."
283,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44164449-phillip-johnson,3,Good advice. Somewhat abstract. Better for high school or undergraduates and more geared towards mathematics.
284,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58217129-anurag-ohri,2,"The book did not feel like it was properly structured. It does contain many good ideas, but they are repeated multiple times as you go on."
285,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29573450-brandon-henke,3,The heuristics of mathematical problem solving.
286,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12958065-gregg,3,"Strangely organized, still insightful"
287,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63083071-mainak-jas,5,Read it long ago. But it was a fun book as far as I can remember.
288,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78864406-heather-gray,4,Very good book for improving mathematical thinking and problem-solving skills.
289,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14938891-andr,5,Important heuristics for everyone but particulary useful for the ones that solve problems for living.
290,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/165324-hom-sack,5,Just delightful. I wish I had read this in High School. It would have made mathematics even more enjoyable.
291,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316757-rohit,5,"Learnt how to think about problem solving, has transferable skills!"
292,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18999579-denis-korsunov,3,"Well, it was too classic, too nerdy."
293,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35390768-resmiranda,5,"Absolutely, deliciously wonderful."
294,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8794821-mark,3,"Good thoughts and interesting, but no structure."
295,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90861638-sulis,5,i want to read
296,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89199052-stefano,5,So great for a beginner/intermediate in Math!
297,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14952344-benson-liu,5,A must for anyone into adopting the way of thinking in mathematics.
298,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7046700-adam-schweigert,3,"pretty brutal to read, but he makes some good points!"
299,069111966X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88906946-snehansh-akhaury,2,Contains some good guidance about approaching problem solving.I found it a difficult read.
