Empathy betrays us only when we take it as a moral guide.""- Paul Bloom, Against EmpathyI'm a sucker for pop psychology or moral philosophy or moral politics books. Kinda my jam. I'm also a fan of books that flip certain general assumptions about what is an absolute good. I remember first reading a book called In Defense of Elitism years ago after my freshman year in college. It was a catchy title, and fairly interesting little treatise, and it made me think. Bloom's 'Against Empathy' fits into the same category as William A. Henry III defense of Elitist behavior. Neither is saying it is good to be bad. They are just saying we need to still examine our character heroes and assumptions about what really is a good.Basically, Paul Bloom (a professor of psychology at Yale) is arguing that using empathy to make decisions about policy, etc., is perhaps a bad idea. He is specifically talking about the Bill Clinton ""I feel your pain"" kinda empathy, not the I can identify that you are in pain, cognitive psychology. Because of certain biases built into our brain, using empathy as a guide instead of rationality, rules, and reason typically leads to us making inferior social and political choices. We are replacing something that might be better done with our brain with an inferior tool, guided by our heart and our emotions. That is it. He has narrowed the definition of empathy down to ""feeling what others feel"" and makes sure to NOT conflate empathy with morality or compassion. His arguments are mainly valid, from my perspective. His title is clever. His prose and stories are so, so. I think the book is worth the time, but it wasn't great writing and a bit padded and repetitive. Otherwise, yeah, I feel it."
1,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,2,"I’ve been on an odd sort of journey with this book. First of all, I came to it as a bit of a convert. You see, I’ve been doing research at work into intercultural understanding and multiculturalism, and a lot of the theory around that starts from the premise that for students to become interculturally understanding they first need to learn empathy. This hardly seems controversial – I mean, we have all read To Kill a Mockingbird, and so walking a mile in my shoes seems to be pretty good advice. But then, in the middle of last year, I mentioned to the woman who sits beside me at work that I was starting to think empathy might not be the unbridled good that I’d always taken it to be. I was almost expecting to be told to not be so bloody-minded and contrary, but instead she suggested I read Megan Boler’s ‘The Risks of Empathy: Interrogating multiculturalism’s gaze’. There’s only one thing worse than being a smartarse academic who challenges the otherwise unchallengeable – and that is being late to the game. Damn! If there is any consolation to be found, it is in the fact that this book was published in 2016, and Boler’s article was printed in 1997 – so, I’m not the only one late here.There were things that annoyed me about this book. I was really surprised that it spent quite so much time referencing pop-psy books and writers. I mean, people like Pinker, Malcolm Gladwell and Sam Harris. The author is a professor of psychology at Yale. I know this book is written for a popular audience, but that still seems deeply strange behaviour to me. You might not think so, but one of the first things they teach you when you are becoming an academic is to go for the source of ideas, rather than the popularisers. I have problems with both Harris and Pinker – so, amusingly enough, I experienced precisely the heightened sense of cynicism he was discussing throughout this book right from the off. I’m happy to admit that the problem is my own bias – but even given my bias, it still strikes me as strange that someone in his position wouldn't be using academic references and standards more, even while writing for a popular audience.Okay, so what is the problem with apple pie and motherhood? Or rather empathy? Well, as he says here, one of the problems is that empathy provides something of a spotlight. You can’t show empathy to more than one person at a time. If empathy means walking a mile in someone else’s shoes, well, that’s a mile in only one person’s shoes you can walk at any given time. And since there are over 7 billion people in the world, well, that’s a lot of walking you are going to have to do. By the way, 7 billion miles is another 50% further again out into space as the journey from here to Pluto. And as Boler makes clear, the problem with empathy is that there are people’s shoes that are simply not going to fit you - I'm never going to really know what it feels like to be intersexual or transexual - and my best intentioned guesses are likely to be well off the mark. And there will be shoes you simply will never be able to bring yourself to put your foot inside. But does that then mean those people do not deserve your empathy or the potential benefits that come from your empathy? Does it mean they ought to be treated badly? Am I only required to feel sympathy for people I can ultimately ‘understand’ and put myself in their place? A case in point. My daughter spent a year in Japan and while she was there she went out with a Japanese boy for a while. One night he decided to give her a real treat. They went to an up market restaurant and he ordered Fugo for them – fugo is otherwise known as the fish that kills. Well, sort of – because actually most fugo is now farmed, rather than caught in the ocean, and so it never gets to eat the algae it would use to produce the poison that can kill you. You know, it is the same old story, when myth and fact conflict, print the myth. That wasn’t the part of the story that bothered my daughter, though – you know, the part about her new boyfriend trying to poison her. The problem was that the fish arrived at the table very much alive (at least to my daughter's eyes) – it had been filleted alive only moments before arriving at the table, and so the fillets were still moving on the plate - 'moving'? 'Quivering'? Anyway, she told her boyfriend that there was simply no way she could bring herself to put an ‘alive’ piece of fish into her mouth. Her boyfriend looked at her dumbfounded - not least because this was probably costing him an arm and a leg, and kept saying to her – ‘but it’s so fresh – it’s so delicious’. This cultural difference was so great and so fascinating to her that she ended up writing her Honours thesis around it.This is basically my criticism of this book. While there is lots of discussion about empathy, and the problems of empathy – and most of these I agree with (you know, nationalism neatly divides the world into those you can and can’t feel empathy for) I think one of the mechanisms that helps ensure empathy cannot develop that is underestimated in this book is disgust. You know, as Pinker himself says in one of his books, the reason for food taboos in cultures is to ensure that you don’t end up marrying someone from outside your ‘group’ – and these food taboos are always taboos to do with meat. No religion bars the eating of carrots – but eating pork…or eating alive fish... And if you can’t share food with someone, it is very hard to develop any other form of relationship with them. This is part of the reason why Christianity, which from the very beginning sought to be a universal religion, rejected the food taboos of the commandments in the Old Testament. A companion is literally someone you eat with (from the Latin for ‘with bread’) – stopping people from eating together puts a significant obstacle in the way of them becoming friends.But the other thing that annoyed me about this is something else I’ve been reading about lately – that the most effective way to overcome cultural differences (to develop empathy, to get people to understand each other despite their cultural differences) is to do what you can to get them to actively work together toward a common goal. A really good book on this is O’Connor’s The Nature of Prejudice. Which then brings me to my final concern with this book – it’s the ‘we just need to be more rational’ bias it displays. I’ve got nothing against reason, per se, but he ends this book by saying that reason is objective (basically the same for everyone no matter their background) and so it is our main hope. And, to be honest, as much as I would quite like that to be the case, it isn’t hard to see the number of times ‘reason’ has been used to demonise entire populations. You know, one of this guy’s heroes, as I've already mentioned, is Sam Harris – and Sam's ‘all of Islam is evil’ approach to world politics seems to me to be lacking both empathy and compassion (and 'reason' if it comes to that). It makes me a bit ill to think of how he has used his 'reason' to effectively justify god knows how many millions of deaths since 9/11. Like I said at the beginning of this review – I don’t think empathy is enough, I might even agree that empathy is worse at achieving positive relations between cultures than it is generally made out to, but I also think that we know the answer to how to address this. We need to actively find ways to achieve transformation based on different cultures working together towards common ends as equals. This has been proven time and again to be the most effective way to end conflict and to encourage people to recognise their common humanity. If ‘reason’ leads us to Sam Harris and his 'Islam is evil' rubbish – we have no hope at all."

I actually find the title a bit of a sales pitch.'Against empathy'. Yes, but fom page one he defends himself against possible misunderstandings. He based this entire book on possible critique against his title, instead of just making his case.Here are some of his most remarkable quotes:""As this book comes to an end, I worry that I have given the impression that I’m against empathy. Well, I am—but only in the moral domain. And even here I don’t deny that empathy can sometimes have good results.""This is 6 pages from the end:""I’ve been playing defense up to now. I’ve been arguing that evidence and theory from neuroscience, social psychology, and cognitive psychology don’t prove our everyday irrationality. But I haven’t yet made a positive case for our everyday rationality, for the role of reasoning and intelligence in our lives. I’ll do this now.""""This distinction between empathy and compassion is critical for the argument I’ve been making throughout this book. And it is supported by neuroscience research.""

3,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,2,"I first stumbled on Yale developmental psychologist Paul Bloom reading a New Yorker editorial called 
The Baby In the Well: The case against empathy
. It was an interesting dissection of empathy. Not because it's bad, but because it forces people into crappy decisions. For instance, people across America felt the mourning Sandy Hook parents’ pain as they followed media coverage of the mass murder in horror. Understandable. Dead kids suck, and if you cannot feel a grieving parent's pain, you ain't worth the genetic information it took to birth you.  That’s good. It’s the sort of thing that bolsters my faith in humanity. And in the New Yorker article and his earlier books, Bloom provides ample experimental evidence proving humans have good hearts. We’re more prosocial than libertarians or economists would have you believe.  Thing is, thousands sent money to Sandy Hook, an upper-middle-class enclave. And yet in the same year as Sandy Hook, with little fanfare, Congress voted to lower Food Stamp benefits to poor parents, who were already struggling. Politicians and talking heads justified the change using rationalizations, most often victim blaming. Regardless, the result was to rob poor kids of food in order to give tax breaks to billionaires.  That’s bad. And the sort of thing that makes my heart fall, destroying my faith in humanity.  Bloom uses these events to illustrate a problem. We often make unwise choices BECAUSE we’ve got good hearts. So to be effective humans, we need to think AND feel. Neither head nor heart alone will do, but we need both. After all, feeding poor kids will improve the lives of the hundreds of thousands of America's neediest. And investing in those food stamp recipients and their children pays off, costing us as a society less to feed, house and clothe the poor now than to house them in jails later. There's data to prove it. While pouring money into the coffers of the well-heeled if devastated Sandy Hook parents will not improve their lives.  This thought-provoking article stayed with me. So when I heard Bloom expanded the editorial in the book Against Empathy, I purchased it. Sad to say, Bloom disappointed me.  He’d already covered the book’s best parts in the shorter editorial, but expands a little here, offering more evidence and a more nuanced exploration. And then Bloom expands into broader arguments of moral philosophy. Problem is, his thoughts seem only half-formed and often contradictory. Sad for such an accomplished expert with so firm a grasp on the facts.  The book’s biggest issue is that Bloom falls into the trap that snapped Malcolm Gladwell in Blink. Bloom starts with an interesting premise, but hems and haws.  I think Bloom is trying to say we need to think lest people manipulate our emotions. We all felt sad for Sandy Hook because of the media coverage. But the millions of starving kids Congress’ cuts hurt stayed hidden in thousands of ghettos, trailer parks, and homeless shelters. The millions are an abstraction while the shooting victims specific, making the pain their parents experienced palpable. Ergo, we send money to an affluent community, kicking sand into the face of poor families.  Bloom traces this failure to a well-documented psychological bias. Humans excel at emotional specifics, sucking with abstractions since thinking takes work. The powerful (and calculating sociopaths) often exploit to manipulate regular people. After this solid start, Bloom’s argument stumbles, growing incoherent. In one breath, he praises empathy. In the next, he trashes it by pointing to its failings. Worse, his alternatives are a disorganized mishmash. Bloom's most emphatic suggestion is stepping back to think about moral issues, applying a Utilitarian calculus to moral decisions — “good of the many exceeds the good of the one.” Thing is, he ignores cases where this utilitarian approach fails. For instance, there’s little doubt that many people are better off for purchasing cheap sneakers at Walmart. Until you learn that they’re often constructed with slave-like labor. No one likes slave labor, and if you're a relatively well-off Yale psychologist with an MD for a wife like Bloom, you can pay a premium, purchasing fair-trade shoes. But if you're a working poor or middle-class person, you often cannot afford to pay the premium. You may like ""fair-trade"" as a concept. but you end up with the cheaper Walmart shoes because you can afford them.Therein lies the rub with many Utilitarian solutions. They tilt towards the upper classes and seem ignorant of the struggles happening below them. Of course, once these are taken into account you can calculate a better Utilitarian response... but what unseen results are you missing? As the saying goes, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.  Bloom also flirts with Buddhistic-style active compassion instead of knee-jerk, maudlin empathy, but falters. Too bad, since the Buddhist prescription seems apt. It allows you to feel people’s pain, while “walking around” the compulsive action. So instead of knee-jerking into sending money to affluent Sandy Hook parents, you could feel their pain. But stand pat against yanking food from poor kids.  At least, I think these are Bloom's points. But his argument gets so muddled I’m not sure. Which is why Against Empathy is a book I should have liked, but didn’t. Ergo two-stars. "
4,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39898185-moshe-hoffman,4,"""Against Empathy"" does a nice job summarizing all the limitations of empathy, and our altruistic drives more generally, such as being nicer to our kin and neighbors, and being especially prone to newsworthy suffering and insensitive to numbers, scale, and efficacy. Paul rightly points out that our logical arguments and conscious deliberation often lead us toward more utilitarian considerations that are a better way to do good. In the process he reviews a ton of interesting experiments and anecdotes in the process, in a thoroughly readable book. However, Paul makes the same mistake many who have studied morality are prone to make: he assumes that the reason logic often leads us toward utilitarianism is because utilitarianism is actually dictated by logic—smart people just realize that every life counts equally, whether far or close, kin or stranger, and saving one life is exactly one tenth as good as saving ten lives. This argument seems right, and is commonly given, but it's wrong. It is not reason that dictates that all lives count equally. That is a value we have. Not something we are born having. Not something that is universal or biologically evolved. Not something that is inherently true about the universe. But something that is valued in our culture. Something that we look good saying. Something we get in trouble for by espousing. Given that this is something we are socialized, and incentivized, to say, we of course come to believe it. Believe in it whole-heartedly. Believe it is self evidently true despite no evidence in support (or in fact any ability to provide such evidence given that it is not even truth-functional statement). Which makes us all the more trustworthy to pursue and enforce this value. And of course, if we espouse this value, and want others to think we espouse it and treat it as sacred, we have all the incentive in the world to ensure that our behavior is consistent with this value ESPECIALLY when such inconsistency is made clear to our conscious minds, or is shoved in our face. As Peter Singer's drowning child example does. As Paul‘s book nicely does. As all the evidence Paul points out on how narrowly focused our altruism tends to be. Hence, when we think about morality, when we reason through moral dilemmas, when we are faced with such inconsistencies, we tend to become more utilitarian. But this doesn't imply that utilitarianism is DICTATES by reason, or that we are utilitarian BECAUSE we are smart. It implies we are utilitarian because we want people (and hence ourselves) to think of us as caring about others welfare, and caring about notions of equality, and don't want to look inconsistent when our hypocrisy is called out or made blatant. That's different.This difference sounds semantic. But it’s really not. Believing that utilitarianism comes from reason or intelligence is quite misleading, leading to many non-sequitors, and preventing us from noting some valuable insights about how human morality ACTUALLY works.In particular, if reason leads to utilitarianism (in the absence of the social/cultural incentive to espouse values of caring and equality) then Paul ought to have a rather hard time explaining the Nazis, and slave holders, not to mention Immanuel Kant. All of whom have quite thoroughly reasoned arguments, quite a lot of iq, and invested immense conscious deliberation, that lead them to conclude the exact opposite: that slavery was good, or Jews and Gypsy's and Slavs are not equal, or that omissions count quite a bit differently than commissions. And in fact, it is rather hard to point to a place in Nazi arguments, or the statements of slave holders, or Kant, where reason is any more or less flimsy than Peter Singer. And that’s because the difference doesn't lie in their logical abilities, but in the values they started with. Their axioms. Slaveholders didn't mind stating that they don't believe all humans are equal. Nor did the Nazis. They put extra weight (all?) on a particular race. Is this a LOGICAL error? No more so than our notion that all are equal. It might be abhorrent. But that’s not logic. That’s our values. Our axioms. Kant simply never accepted the axiom that consequences are all that matters. Where is the logical fallacy there? The problem isn't in reason, it's in the values.Likewise, if reason (alone) is what drives us to utilitarianism, we are left with quite a few paradoxes. Is it reasonable to ignore unborn people? To count unborn people? Does reason lead us to maximize average utility or total utility? What about utility monsters (those who get a bomb of pleasure for every dollar you give them, or for seeing another being suffer)? Should I go to jail for the $1,000 I wasted on a suit, causing a death in the developing world by omission? These sound like paradoxes because they pit various intuitions against each other. Various values we espouse and want to signal we have. Thereby forcing us to admit inconsistency with at least one (or come up with a convoluted argument that twists and turns reason in ways it isn't meant to be bent). Instead of just admitting, that there is nothing in logic that answers these questions. We just have various values and intuitions that evolved (or are learned, or socially reinforced) for various reasons. Each of which we have an incentive to espouse, and an incentive to show others we value as sacred and unbending. It just turns out that it's not logically possible to have all these values in an unbending way at once. But that doesn't stop us from wanting to argue that we can. Hence paradoxes. But such moral philosophizing isn't ""right"" or ""true"" it's just what we are left with when we pretend it's reason that drives these values, and not admitting what it is: values we want others to think we hold as sacred.As a consequence, Paul is left without wondering why empathy has all these quirks, instead of at once grasping all the perfect evidence that empathy and altruism, when not directed toward kin, is clearly designed, subconsciously at least, toward reputational gains. And at the same time, Paul is left missing the interesting question of why we came to espouse the value of equality, how moral reasoning often lead many toward other conclusions, what game people are playing when they make moral arguments, and how to optimally persuade someone to in fact be utilitarian. All insights and questions that would have been close at hand had he kept his objective psychology hat on, or his evolutionary perspective tuned. But unfortunately, he did what many do and accepted the moral arguments we tell and the intuitions we hold dear, as self-evident truths, and not psychological features to be understood and explained. "
5,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4763049-holly,4,"Bloom is not really against empathy as in kindness, compassion, other-regard. He's against a kind of empathy that is short-sighted, selfish (as in simple self-regard), that stops us from thinking and using our moral conscience. When he discusses compassion it's in the context of ""cognitive empathy"" and not ""affective empathy."" He quotes Adam Smith a lot. I wished for more emphasis on how empathy depends on a certain selfish or self-regarding feeling. I had this sense a lot while reading Leslie Jamison's Empathy Exams: that why do we have to rely on this emotion that ""I feel it inside myself - as if it's happening to me - and so that's why I have compassion for this person""? Doesn't this ""only if I pretend it's happening to me"" mindset seem a little meager? Maybe I can still feel compassion without understanding exactly what you are experiencing? Would I be more helpful if I put MY emotions aside and looked at the situation?Bloom is worried that empathy will limit us - make us identify only with certain people and not others. He finds empathy suspect. This is a challenge to argue, since it seems as if we're always talking about empathy in the culture these days. (And I know from personal experience that so much becomes clear when it finally occurs to one that the reason a close family-member is utterly thoughtless is that he is deficient in the ability to ""put himself in another's shoes."" - Empathy is invaluable as a starting point to human relations.)Bloom does go off on tangents that don't always seem exactly pertinent to his argument but he is responding to critics - it isn't a traditional scholarly book and more conversational. But not necessarily easy reading either.Is Paul Bloom a social conservative? I don't pick up on that myself and I think I would, but I may have read some critiques of his Just Babies that suggest that. I don't think he is a jerk anyway.I agree with him for the most part - but it feels as if the book is unfinished and he spends much time responding to his critics rather than advancing his actual position. I suppose it is a work in progress, which I understand. His subtitle - the case for rational compassion - isn't borne out. He talks very little about compassion itself, and what this rational compassion looks like in the world. He's very interested in rationality, which is of course suspect these days (neuroscience in the courtroom; claims to refute the existence of free will through brain imaging results).Fascinating reading. I expect to hear more about this subject - the value of empathy and whether we shouldn't put so much stake in it; alternatives to empathy that are as important and more so - from Bloom and other thinkers."
6,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76759105-khush,1,"I heard a lot about this book. In fact, a friend of mine suggested that I should read this book. The title itself is quite titillating.As I began to read this book, I found it quite irritating. Half through the book, the writer is still busy explaining what he means by empathy. It is not an easy case to make for 'against empathy,' he tried but I did not find him convincing. Very often, in the book, I felt that he was supporting, and very mildly suggesting, something dangerous that human beings should be more cold and rational to make better decisions and in order to be more effective.In order to support his thesis, he gives well-known examples from real life and tells us how individuals, masses, and even nation states sometimes make bad decisions guided by empathy, but I found that quite sweeping. For instance, I do not think that nation-states act out of empathy, their decisions are more often cold-blooded and rational in nature. First, they make a mess by exerting power over by intervening in other countries' internal affairs, by waging wars for resources and so forth. However, only when a situation goes out of hand, they have to act in the reverse direction, that is to soften or contain the mess. The particular incidents that he mentions from the contemporary American life and his claims that how people in the grip of empathy make false and dangerous decisions. This notion seems to be wrought with some sort inscrutable (bad) agenda.To help one person (spectacularly) while remaining oblivious to many others in a similar situation is a misplaced feature of empathy. Of course, this is so in certain contexts, but it is not something that happens very often. I also do not think that helping one community, people, a region that way (irrationally) is a bad practice and that all the larger issues of injustice and inequality in the world occur due to excessive (ab)use of empathy. In fact, I believe that we should be a bit less reason-oriented, reason has failed us many times. During world wars, nations were not dropping bombs on one another out of empathy, they were using extreme forms for reasons to destroy one another. As one reads this book, in some milder ways, he is suggesting his fellow Americans something else; that acting out of empathy and sending money to war-torn and conflicted zones and to far-flung areas is not required. It is false, misplaced and irrational, and therefore it should be discontinued. And then adds, we need to control our emotions and do it in a 'rational' way for better results. (One way of doing so, is not to be moved by emotions, I found this notion banal.)When one looks at the world, we see that we are already very reason-oriented. In a world that insists on 'wall buildings,' we need more empathy. Of course, those on the right side of the wall and those who seek to strengthen such borders already show that they have learned their lesson well. They are 'against empathy' anyways.On a very basic level, we know that if one is too empathetic, one might not be effective or able to function normally, and in this sense, empathy is useless and negative. But we know this. We do not need science, the so-called modern findings in different fields to tell us something as basic as that. Having said this, without empathy, how would we be? We would be 'less.' If empathy falters, and we have come to a point where we should discard it as something regressive or destructive. I wonder if, then, the sequel of this book could be 'against love.'"
7,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11046964-ceil,2,"Really wanted to like this book, having long suspected that ""I feel your pain"" is part of an anti-logic, anti-rational trend that glorifies individual feelings above all. Aside from setting up some useful distinctions (empathy v compassion, etc.), the author muses at length on examples of linguistic legerdemain around the concept. Nothing particularly useful here. "
8,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/272909-blair,3,"Hmm, I thought I would enjoy this more than I did – or at least that I would be more stimulated by it than I was. It takes balls to title your book Against Empathy, but that's somewhat undermined by the fact that the author spends so much time reiterating a) what he means by empathy and b) that he is in fact very much pro-kindness and compassion. Bloom's definition of 'empathy' is the practice of feeling for a person/group by trying to feel their pain, i.e. putting yourself 'in someone else's shoes'. This is absolutely fine, but it's repeated so often that it sometimes feels like it's being mentioned every three or four pages, especially in the first half of the book. It could have been defined in the introduction and left at that.Against Empathy is, imo, not so much an argument against empathy as it is a meticulous separation of the specific concept of empathy from the other values it is often conflated with, such as kindness, compassion, generosity, etc. Bloom believes that empathy can be a poor moral guide. This is most apparent in cases where too much empathy might hinder a person's judgement. For example, an extremely empathic doctor might not be best placed to help a patient; an extremely empathic parent would likely be overprotective to a suffocating degree; charitable acts that centre empathy often do more to assuage the giver's guilt than to help the greatest number of people in the most efficient way. Instead, a combination of rational decision-making and diffused compassion should replace empathy in our process of moral reasoning.There's a decent and persuasive argument at the heart of Against Empathy, but as a book it is repetitive and feels very padded out. Having read it, I feel like I have a much clearer idea of what Bloom thinks is good and useful about being rational, kind and compassionate than what he finds bad and harmful about empathy. I originally put the word 'ironically' at the beginning of that sentence, but I wonder if that was the point after all.TinyLetter | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"
9,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7133444-sandra,2,"Paul Bloom puts empathy in a jar and attempts to dissect it. It does not work, not outside the evolutionary context. We are in 2018, not 1958.This is a magazine article, fluffed up to a length of a book."
10,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"Absolutely BRILLIANT! This is a must read for anyone interested in things like:decision-makingempathyingroup/outgroup dynamicspolicy makingsocial constructsinequalitylogic v. emotional regulation on a grand scale Why out of 293 Goodreads reviews does this book only have a 3.75? I can't say for sure, especially since I have not taken the time to read all the negative reviews, but I suspect they come from people who pride themselves on being ""a good person"", because they identify as an empathetic person. They see that as a positive thing, no matter what the result of their emotional decisions. But, just as we came to understand that oxytocin is not just the ""love and trust drug"" and that it is also a key regulator of ingroup/ outgroup thinking (which results in poor treatment for the outgroup), humans are now beginning to understand the downside, and in fact often immoral side, of empathy. Empathy too often results in local empathy that is the equivalent of being on teams, which results in team-like dynamics. The reality is that often when you empathize with one person or one side of an argument, you close yourself off to the other side or the other person. I am not talking about giving 2 sides of an argument equal billing. For example, if one person is being racist, sexist, or otherwise oppressive, the logical course of action is not to give both sides equal empathy or equal consideration. That is not what this book is about. This book is about how to follow multiple lines of logic and not let knee-jerk local empathetic reactions to your favorite people or favorite causes blind you to the realities of decision-making. There are better ways, if you follow the logic all the way out *and* use your emotions, to come up with the best outcomes -- no matter if they are for your personal life, for the wellbeing of whole societies, or affect things on a global scale.Empathy can often lead to dynamics that involve impulsivity, manipulation, logical inconsistencies, and suboptimal outcomes. This is one of the most exciting books in the social sciences to come in a long time. A+** Note: Bloom also clarified what he has come to understand since writing Just Babies. As new evidence filtered in, he saw that he was mistaken about some things and updated his thinking and shared that with his reader. I love any author who updates based on new evidence and is willing to own up to it. (Are you taking notes Dawkins?) "
11,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1924321-jennifer,4,"I saw the title of this book and I had to read it. I mean, who could be opposed to empathy? Does he want us to stop being nice to each other?The subtitle of the book offers a clue: Bloom would prefer us to be compassionate in more rational ways. When we 'put ourselves in others' shoes,' which is what many mean by the term empathy, it can lead to some irrational, even horrifying results. Whether it's making feel-good donations rather than researching to see where our charitable contributions would do the most good, or torturing enemies in the hopes of helping the people we like, that particular type of empathy can be too insular.So in the end, Bloom doesn't want us to stop being kind, but rather to examine our motives and the results more deeply. "
12,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,5,"Reviewed for The Bibliophibian.“Against empathy? How could anyone be against empathy?”That was probably my first reaction too, because I and the people around me are all focused on being good to other people, and empathy seems to offer a way to do that. It seems to offer us insight, so we know the right things to say and do. But Paul Bloom’s contention is that empathy doesn’t always lead us in the right direction: he reminds the reader that empathy is what makes us focus on one sick child whose name and face we know, even if we don’t actually know the child is even real, over tens or hundreds of other sick children. Empathy can focus us powerfully on feeling how a single other person “must” be feeling — and therein lies the problem. It’s hard, if not impossible, to empathise with everyone in a whole crowd, and our instincts aren’t always accurate in guessing how other people feel. If they were, then we’d never say exactly the wrong thing when we want to comfort someone who is sad — we’d know what to say.What Bloom isn’t against is compassion: he speaks admiringly of the Buddhist ideal of compassion without attachment, for instance. Compassion linked with reason can indeed guide us to do good, to do the moral thing, to ensure he hurt the least number of people. But empathy — pure “I feel what you feel” emotional attachment leads us astray, and Bloom argues that point well.To empathise is a human emotion that many of us share, and Bloom isn’t claiming it’s inherently a bad thing. That would be to misread the book entirely. Honestly, despite often thinking that empathy is a virtue and people can do more of it, I find it difficult to disagree with Bloom’s conclusions. Part of that is that he writes really clearly, which makes it easy to knee-jerk believe that he’s right, but I think I’ll still be thinking about (and agreeing with) this in a few days, weeks, months.Time to look up Effective Altruism again, and do something with the information this time."
13,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16181797-wayland-smith,2,"The author makes some interesting arguments about how empathy can lead public policy, and personal decisions, astray. It's written a bit dryly, and he goes through a few contortions with some of his logic at times. The short version is he more or less seems to think people should be a bit more Vulcan, and he's really big into that ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one"" expression. It's an exercise in philosophy which made a few interesting points, but overall I had to push a bit to finish it. Also, on a somewhat personal note, if you're going to make comic book references, do your research. Superman's big enemy is Lex LUTHOR, not LUTHER. Minor point, but for someone who quotes so many sources, he really should pay better attention. Wasn't horrible, but wasn't that interesting in my humble opinion. The chapters were, at one point, individual essays. They might be better that way, spaced out a bit. "
14,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13162061-amirography,4,"This book offers a great argument against what we think of as empathy in psychology: the ability to feel what others feel.Though the book was written by a prominent child psychologist I failed to find anything about psychology that I did not know already. Also the author failed to offer any explanation about why empathy came to be from evolutionary perspective. So I can say that this book was mostly a philosophical, ethical arguement against the use of empathy as our moral compass.The writing style was in Steven Pinker called ""classic style"". And it was page turner."
15,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12222751-fromcouchtomoon,4,"Interesting argument, but misleading title, as it's not empathy he's railing against, but small-mindedness. Packaged to be provocative without being as provocative as claimed."

Try to combine these stories into a coherent message, and all you get is an ever shifting definition of empathy that amounts to “something that leads to bad choices”. So we make poor decisions when we rely only on emotion. Who knew?At best, we can treat this work like the I Ching to inspire conversation. As a whole, it is gibberish."
17,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"I once gave a presentation entitled something like ""Generating Empathetic Responses Through Cognitive Role Taking in Writing."" I asked my audience, all teachers like me, how many of us assumed developing empathy in others was a good thing. All hands rose.I agreed with my audience that empathy is pretty much a great thing.I still remember those times when I powerfully felt the wrongness of something by immersing myself in a situation through writing. Somehow, merely thinking abstractly and concluding that something was wrong did not carry as much power as feeling that something was wrong. At the time, my primary concerns about empathy were that 1) we probably overrate its efficacy in promoting action and 2) there's a danger that we overwrite the feelings of others. But, on the whole, it's pretty useful.Here, Bloom argues that we should hesitate to praise emotional empathy or to assign moral weight to conclusions drawn from it. Although he gives credit to the power and influence of intuition, he's largely a defender of rationality. I was particularly interested in Bloom's ability to reference past scholars, such as Adam Smith, contemporary scholars, such as Jonathan Haidt or Steven Pinker, and to finally contextualize his conclusions within everyday experiences.The book is easy to read and written transparently with clear distinctions and acknowledgements. In other words, it's less polemical than the title suggests. My favorite section documented a psychologist's interactions with a Buddhist monk who distinguished empathetic meditation from compassionate meditation.All in all, Against Empathy is easy to recommend. (The other text on this subject that I tend to recommend is Keen's Empathy and the Novel.) I do still recommend attempting to write from within the shoes of others, perhaps now more than ever actually, but I also recommend researching empathy's limitations before recommending it as a go-to or complete solution."
18,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/226133-bookworm,1,"Author has a case...unfortunately it's buried. I was perfectly open to reading Bloom's dissertation that there is *too much* empathy, rather than the need for more. This seemed highly relevant to recent events, plus as a general rule: why is it that certain events get far more attention and time when others don't? Does empathy affect our judgment too much?  Unfortunately, Bloom's message is completely muddled and buried in what seems like a word salad. He goes off too long and too many times on examples that are supposed to better enlighten the reader but instead messes his point. He does perhaps have a point, but it's difficult to sift through the rest of of it to actually find out what he's actually trying to say. I'm not saying the author should have held my hand, but after outlining what each chapter is supposed to convey I expected a book that had been mapped out much better. From what I understand this is an extension of various newspaper articles. Honestly, I would recommend reading those instead. This book really doesn't do what the author is trying to get across and therefore he fails to make his case.  There are points that are probably worth considering and Bloom's thesis was worth expanding upon. It's pity the book doesn't accomplish what it set out to do. Skip the book."

But I think it would have been effectively done as an essay. In many places it seemed to just be going around in circles.The key issue at hand is the role of empathy in moral judgments, not overall in relationships, storytelling, etc. As long as you keep that frame of reference very clearly in mind while you read, I think you can get something out of it."

I was left at the end of each chapter rather dissapointed that his arguments didn't have enough grit and bravado to both feel wholesome in its explaintory power and have that badass feel of being a contrarian."
21,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7619789-leo-robertson,5,I think this book changed my brain for the better.
22,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109743598-uhtred,3,"This book struck me for the title: for years we have been surrounded by messages that enhance empathy, which offer it as a solution to all social, corporate and condominium problems. So, a Yale scholar who analyzes empathy from a scientific-psychological and not simplistic-goodistic point of view, immediately attracted me. Bloom's thesis is rather counter-current, given that he tries to demonstrate that empathy, understood as ""putting yourself in the shoes of others"" is a bad adviser if you want to make right decisions. Quite the opposite of the answer you would get if you interview ordinary people, but also the many social media ""gurus"" who want to teach us how to be successful in business or politics.In fact, usually, empathy is always-and-only seen as a positive concept: it has good press, it is always present on the lips of politicians, it is the subject of study by great scholars but also the man in the street perceives that it is a good thing, that when it is absent there is indifference, cynicism, insensitivity. In general everyone thinks that if there was more empathy the world would be better.Well, the title of the book, so fiercely aggressive that it had attracted me, in the book is very diluted: the thesis that Bloom wants to demonstrate, is demonstrated very well and very clearly in the first 50 pages, the rest is just a repetition of the concepts, with various examples which, however interesting and shareable, add nothing to the thesis demonstrated. Bloom, in essence, differentiates empathy so well in its various aspects and conceptions, to isolate it in such a way that you can only say he is right: if empathy is understood as synonymous with morality, compassion, kindness, it is impossible to speak bad of it ; but if we understand it in its narrowest meaning, that is, as the ability to make the feelings of others our own, then things change a lot. Bloom says that empathy then becomes like a stage beacon, which illuminates only one thing very well, leaving the rest of the scene in the shadows. You can see very well who is in front of you, you ""feel"" all his problems and you want to do something for him, without wondering if this is right or if this can penalize others. Which others, since they are not in the eye of the stage lighthouse, disappear in our eyes.Bloom argues that an excess of empathy can suggest a choice of heart, even where a choice of brain is needed. The example he gives is that of people induced to advance a little girl on the waiting list for access to medical treatment if it is given the opportunity to know her story and identify with her point of view, even if this it means bypassing other subjects (who they don’t know anything about).Bloom then analyzes the exploitation of empathy by politicians and public administrators, who ride this sentimentality to direct the public's attention towards this or that group, emphasizing that too much empathy means manipulable voters, while it would be necessary for people to maintain a detached sense of compassion and attention to others, supported by reason, cost-benefit analysis and a longer-term vision than the immediate here and now.Bloom says that if one does not want to give alms to a beggar, it is not necessarily indifferent; it may be that he needs to help others by following the rules. He may not like to give money if he doesn't know where that money goes. A choice that has nothing to do with selfishness, but with being sure that altruism is effective.To substantiate even more the concept that sometimes we are in a hurry to emphasize the good of empathy but we are blind to its costs, Bloom recalls the case of a dog suffering from ebola which in Dallas aroused such compassion that were spent to treat it 27 thousand dollars of public money, an absurd figure that would have been good for many patients unable to pay for their medicines; but the dog had become a media phenomenon, while the poors were unknown and uninteresting to journalists.Bloom then tells us how declaring himself against empathy can be dangerous, as the supporters of empathy are very fierce. When Bloom dared to write against empathy on the New Yorker he was overwhelmed: the article was called an intellectual disgrace, the stupidest thing ever written, and the author was a moral monster.Obviously this is not the case, and Bloom in the book indicates scientific research which, while searching for it, has not found relationships between little empathy and aggression or cruelty. For my part, I confirm: I am not particularly empathetic yet I usually do not insult people and beat them.In essence, a book that promises too much in the title, but which is still a good read if we want to understand a little more about this world and also about ourselves."
23,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2703136,2,"This book is defeating a straw man.Author is presenting a couple of reasons to think that what he calls empathy - feeling exactly what another person feels - is not always leading us to perform the best action, is not always good for the empathiser, and is not at the core of morality. But no one of the thinkers who have argued for the benefits of empathy actually claim the views Bloom is against, and few if any thinkers out there would define empathy in his limited way. The rhetoric of this book is misleading, as author would make it sound as if he is presenting a drastic position, but he is either misrepresenting what other thinkers hold, or making a series of completely uninteresting and unsurprising claims in a bad style and cheating language. Or both.Despite defeating a straw man - what should be an easy target - the argument is incoherent at times as Bloom seems to be contradicting himself a couple of times without making a good enough effort to make his position clear. Also he is not presenting others' positions with sufficient accuracy or charity. The whole book feels like cheating, trying to make the reader believe that the author is right, sometimes resorting to emotional strategies like jokes and exclamation marks, without actually making the issues any much clearer in the reader's mind.There is a way to speak about complex issues in a simple manner, without cheating or otherwise suffocating the reader's intelligence. This book doesn't get close to it.The only reason I give it a second star is that I am writing a thesis on empathy, and a few of the references will be useful to me. But I won't be able, in my own writing, to engage with Bloom's argument, because it is a bad argument. If you are looking for a more thoughtful argument about the negatives of empathy, perhaps check the philosopher Jesse Prinz, it will be less a waste of time than reading this book.PS: What I really like about this book is the cover. The cover is great - just look at it. Best of minimalist design. 5 stars to the person who came up with it."
24,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4756170-daniel,5,"This is one of those rare books that challenge my assumption about morality and it is great. Empathy is the ability for us to feel what others feel. It has recently been touted as the most important attribute for successful and moral lives. It turns out that it is probably false. Empathy is:1. Narrow minded (we feel more for people who are like us, attractive etc)2. Innumerate (we don't feel more sad if 5000 people suffer vs 1 person. Indeed it may be that we feel more for one person who is spot lighted by the media, then the ignored millions)3. Able to lead us to make poor judgements (favouring the person who is spotlighted than the others equally deserving but unspotlighted ones.)4. Able to paralysed someone if they feel too much (Doctors and Lawyers)5. Not moral by itself and can lead equally to helping or avoiding 6. Not the best marker for benevolence. Rational thinking is. I was changed from being sceptical when I read the prologue to being convinced at the end. Good book. "
25,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7687872-mark-henderson,2,"Thesis is straightforward enough and the author himself suggests a better title in the first chapter: ""Potential misapplications of empathy"" (maybe an overzealous publisher is to blame here). He certainly didn't need 300 pages to make the point. Short read though it was, one can get his general point from one of many substantially smaller internet articles."
26,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83459546-f,4,The case against empathy and for compassion is well argued and engagingly told. Some sections feel a little unfinished and the thread lost. But overall a very good book. 
27,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33702933-britta,2,"I really wanted to like Against Empathy, because I have recently come to believe that we too often use empathy as a means to keep people from taking responsibility for unsavory actions, and I also believe that not taking responsibility for actions comes at a price. I've seen this working in schools--teachers and parents with too much empathy don't give children the opportunity to learn from their mistakes, which is a disservice to their development and growth. Bloom's argument against empathy is on more of a larger scale (even his Intimate Relationships chapter felt less about individuals and more about specific groups of individuals, e.g. therapists, doctors, and patients), but I still found his thoughts on the less than savory merits of empathy worth considering.Overall, I agreed with his argument that our in the moment, gut decisions often feel good in the moment, but lead to longer term consequences. However, his argument wavers. For one, he makes a semantic decision about the definition of empathy that his whole against empathy argument rests on. He does his best to back this decision up, but I think he largely fails in convincing the reader that his definition of empathy is the definition of empathy. Furthermore, when someone makes an executive decision about a word's definition for the sake of an argument, I automatically have a hard time taking them seriously. Who are you to say this is the right definition of empathy, sir? He acknowledges different types of empathy, and then goes on to say that what some call cognitive empathy is actually rational compassion (but then uses the term cognitive empathy throughout the book? MAKE UP YOUR MIND, MAN!). The book as a whole has a lack of cohesion. At times, I forgot I was supposed to be reading about empathy. Or rather, why empathy is bad. The last chapter is called ""The Age of Reason"", and Bloom spends a lot of time debating about whether or not humans are reasonable beings. Umm. Hello. I didn't come to this book for a philosophy discussion! Oh, and a lot of this book felt like a philosophy discussion over semantics and human abilities rather than a psychological text arguing against empathy. I was disappointed that the Buddhist discussion of the issues of empathy was only a couple of pages. This could have been elaborated on, and it also could have strengthened Bloom's argument. I also disagree with Bloom's belief that we live in world where violence is unavoidable and that going to war is sometimes justified. Violence is unavoidable in the current system we have set up, but that doesn't mean this system can't change. Do I believe world peace is attainable? I'm not sure, but I sure think we can have a world with less violence and less war. I disagree that humanity cares more about one little girl stuck in a well (Bloom's example) than hundreds of people dying in war or genocide. It's often easier for us to conceptualize one person suffering than a million people suffering, and it's also easier to give support to one person suffering than a million. I don't think this has anything to do with too much empathy towards individuals and not enough towards large groups, but more so the challenge humans have in envisioning large numbers of anything along with a lack of resources at the local level to help large groups of people in need. I don't think Paul Bloom is actually against empathy. This book title and his whole argument is clickbait. I think he wants people to consider if and when trusting our feeling-based gut decisions is appropriate and if it would be more reasonable to think our decisions through on a regular basis. Bloom should have written a book about the merits of rational decision making rather than a book that has a wavering argument against empathy."
28,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1139239-michael-austin,4,"Being against empathy, Paul Bloom acknowledge at the beginning of his book Against Empathy is roughly the same as being against kittens. This is because most people see empathy is an ultimate good, so, when you say you are against it, you end up sounding like you are against love and compassion and morality and everything else that separates us from Hannibal Lector (who makes an appearance in the book too). Empathy is hard to be against because most people have too broad a definition of it.He is right, I think, but he never entirely overcomes the definitional problem in his own analysis. He is not entirely consistent about what kind of empathy he is against. To be fair, he qualifies and hedges on almost every page, and he constantly draws attention to the problems with defining the term--making it very clear that he is not against empathy if it means ""every good thing."" But he does not narrow the term quite the same way in every chapter.But there is a default setting. Most of the time, he defines ""empathy"" very narrowly and in almost exactly the same terms that Adam Smith defines ""sympathy"" in his Theory of Moral Sentiments. Empathy/Sympathy in these terms is a physiological and sensory connection in which the empathizer experiences a scaled-down version of the same responses that the empathizee feels. This is neat and stuff, but (like many arguments of this sort) it sets up a weak version of the argument that is self-evidently true and hardly worth making, and a strong version that is ridiculous and overstated and impossible to maintain. The weak version of the argument constricts empathy so far that it really only applies to connections between people who are extremely close to each other and, in very real ways, ""feel each other's pain."" The strong version of the argument blurs empathy with compassion and really does start to sound like kitten-hating.But there is space between the weak and strong versions for Bloom to work in, and he spends a lot of the book there making important points like--Empathy is extremely susceptible to what he does not but might as well name as the availability heuristic. When we see a cute child on television who has fallen down a well, we become willing to expend gazillions of dollars to rescue the child--without really considering how many other people who aren't cute children in wells could be saved by the same amount. Empathy causes us to care too much about certain, high-profile situations at the expense of other situations. Rational compassion, as I understand it, can do math.--Our ability to empathize is extremely limited. We can only form empathetic connections with a few people at once. It does not, as the kids say today, scale. We can imagine one Syrian father holding his child in a boat bound for Greece. But we simply cannot imagine 8 million Syrian refugees. So we tend to do things that help the one or two people we can empathize with, even when doing so is directly at odds with working to solve the social and historical problems producing eight million refugees.--Our ability to empathize with others is subject to our biases. We empathize more easily with people who are most like us--people whose situations we can realistically imagine ourselves being in. This means that morality based on empathy will be subject to all of the prejudices that individual empathizers are subject to.--Empathy often makes us do the wrong things. If we see people suffering, and we imagine ourselves suffering in the same way, we immediately want to do something to stop the suffering, even when this ends up being the wrong thing. A classic example is food aid that is sent to pictures of starving children on TV that often ends up in the hands of the soldiers who are causing the children to starve--and allows them to make more children starve. Just because it makes us feel better doesn't mean it really solves the problem that is making us feel bad.--Finally, and most disturbingly, empathy doesn't necessarily make us good people, and, sometimes, it makes us better at being bad people. This is probably the most controversial argument that Bloom makes, but it is a necessary one that we have to consider. What if people are not violent and manipulative because they like the capacity to see themselves in somebody else's position? What if we are evil and awful for other reasons, and the ability to see ourselves through somebody else's eyes makes us better able to manipulate them? The example that Bloom gives is of O'Brien in 1984, who truly understands Winston and uses that understanding to trap and destroy him. But we don't have to be that drastic. Advertisers, politicians, seducers, con artists, and all sorts of other people use the connection that we normally call ""empathy"" to be more effective and getting people to do what they want them to do, which is, very often, not in the interests of the doers.So, there is a lot of there there. But about a third of the book doesn't really fit this template. The chapter I had the hardest time with is the one on personal intimacy. Bloom is at his best when he is talking about public morality and public policy. When he starts talking about the failures of empathy in personal relationships, he plays fast and loose with the definitions and ends up just refuting modern utilitarians like Peter Singer, who believe that an empathy-based moral code should apply universally, by saying that we have every right to feel more compassion towards people we love than perfect strangers on the other side of the world. Which I agree with, but it is not really the same argument that he makes in the rest of the book.So, I liked it. I got things out of it. But I suspect that I would have gotten about as much out of a 10 page article based on the same set of premises. But, really, that is true of about half of the non-fiction books that I have ever read."
29,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26178720-ataa,2,"If you're looking for a book that intrigues you at the beginning , confuses you in the middle , and disappoints you in the end , this is the book you're searching for!!First , the idea was interesting. It's as the author had said “being against empathy is like being against kittens, a view considered so outlandish that it can’t be serious”.A statement against empathy is something you don't see everyday , so I started the book having high expectations , awaiting the author to deliver a series of arguments to drive his point home.Which brings me to the first problem with the book ;in the beginning Bloom stated that he was not against empathy in the common sense of the word ,he's against the empathy that is :""The act of feeling what others are feeling"",and here ends the clarity of the book .because throughout the chapters , instead of actually trying to prove his point properly, he poorly presented multiple sides of the argument , which I'm sure he did in order to steer the wheel in his direction , but he failed miserably at it.He would leave the argument at that and then he came back to the point later as ""proven earlier"". which left me really confused every other page , not knowing what to think. It was as if he was following the saying: ""if you can't convince them , confuse them"".Then comes the second problem.In the Prologue , Bloom says : The idea I'll explore is that the act of feeling what you think others are feeling -whatever one chooses to call this- is different from being compassionate , from being kind , and most of all , from being good. From a moral standpoint , we're better off without it. When he said that we're better off without empathy , I expected him to offer an alternative , something else that has the same advantages without all the faults.But it doesn't work like that.So ""I feel your pain"" isn't just a gooey metaphor ; it can be made neurologically literal : other people's pain really does activate the same brain area as your own Then why bother ?? what's the point of an attack on something we feel when we can't change it?Towards the end I found myself just wanting to finish the book only for the sake of finishing it. And the end was a mess , more confusing than the whole book.Whatever points the book had to offer were blurred , it could have been a lot shorter and much better organized.I got away with only one impression , that maybe empathy is not as perfect as it sounds,meaning that it has disadvantages as well as benefits. An idea that doesn't first come to mind , but I don't know what to do about it.My actual rating is more of a 1.5 than 2 , because two stars mean ""it was okay"" , and it wasn't."
30,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/887347-uos-s,4,"So... I'm not sure the title was really the best. He doesn't really have anything good to say about empathy, but I can't quite say he's totally arguing for it to go away either (would that even be possible?).Basically, he's saying that empathy is a distraction to true compassion because it biases your focus towards the wrong number of people (only one at a time, usually), the wrong people (only those close to you, usually), potentially on the wrong actions (short term actions), is possibly based on faulty knowledge of the other person's needs (just because you feel *something* doesn't mean you actually feel their feelings), or even in contradiction of another person's needs (what a person feels like they need may not be the best for them), etc...Well, I'm inclined to agree with all of this. Actually, I don't think of myself as an incredibly empathetic person. Especially for a woman (I'm a Myer's Briggs INTJ). But, I still think I'm more empathetic than many men. Anyway, from a purely rational perspective, I see the wisdom of Orgel's rule ""Evolution is cleverer than you are."" I first heard that in the book Who's in Charge? Free Will and the Science of the Brain, where the author was talking about why we might want to be careful about trying to get rid of mankind's (seemingly useless) desire to punish wrongdoers, who may not actually be guilty of ""choosing"" to commit wrongdoing. I suppose the same could go for empathy - while I do see it's faults (and there are many), nevertheless, evolution thought it necessary for humans. The question of why it evolved, how it evolved, and if it could become vestigial seem like more interesting questions to me."
31,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23428788-john-kaufmann,3,"Solid. Well-written and interesting. 3.5 stars. The title overhypes the essence of the book a little - I almost decided not to read the book because it sounded too extreme, almost wacko. But I try to expose myself to new ideas and ideas I don't think I would agree with, especially if are from a credible source - and in this case I had read and liked Bloom's excellent Just Babies: The Origins of Good and Evil. As it turns out, the author is not totally against empathy - that is an extreme position which Bloom does not take. Nonetheless, he does shows that empathy is not all positive; empathy, Bloom shows, does have downsides. In particular, Bloom argues that empathy, in the narrow sense of ""I feel your pain,"" can lead to cruelty and other negative outcomes just as easily as it can to positive outcomes. He argues further that policy decisions should not be guided by empathy but by rational deliberation - which may (and probably should) include compassion, which is different than empathy. Getting to that conclusion was half the fun - whether or not you agree with all of it."
32,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24523194-nich,3,"Paul Bloom is certainly a talented writer. The book is a breezy and enjoyable read. On a modest reading, his argument is on solid ground. That is, as long as you relegate his argument to the domain of morality, then he is almost certainly correct. Empathy is a terrible guide for ethics. However, Bloom goes to great lengths to expand his argument to empathy full stop. He does a decent job being careful and providing qualifiers, but it almost seemed like his publishers wanted him to put out a more provocative book. It's when he enters into those truly provocative areas—like claiming that we'd likely be better without empathy, period—that his philosophy gets sloppy and his claims get murky. Still, his general point—that empathy fucks us up in all sorts of insidious and unacknowledged ways—is well taken. And Bloom's levity and self-effacing voice make his coverage of well-worn territory a bit more tolerable."
33,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2921860-m-nasiri,4,"""Against Empathy"" provides a wealth of scientific research to show empathy for what it really is: a flawed emotional reaction that has led countless people to make bad decisions. While many voices have called for others to have more empathy, Paul Bloom shows us that empathy can make things worse rather than better.Basing his argument on groundbreaking scientific findings, Bloom makes the case that some of the worst decisions made by individuals and nations—who to give money to, when to go to war, how to respond to climate change, and who to imprison—are too often motivated by honest, yet misplaced, emotions. With precision and wit, he demonstrates how empathy distorts our judgment in every aspect of our lives, from philanthropy and charity to the justice system; from medical care and education to parenting and marriage. Without empathy, Bloom insists, our decisions would be clearer, fairer, and—yes—ultimately more moral.*I managed to listen audio-book in blinkist.com"
34,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9557722-samuel,5,"Paul Bloom isn't against Empathy, despite the title his book, he is against empathy as a guide to morality. Empathy, defined as walking in someone else's shoes, or feeling what someone else feels, has it's uses, but when used to make decisions about right and wrong it will regularly lead you astray.There is little evidence that people strong in empathy tend to be more moral or people weak in empathy are less moral. For instance, to be good at manipulating people takes a person strong in empathy.Mr. Bloom isn't arguing you shouldn't feel empathy, or that people strong on empathy are likely to be more moral, only that feeling someone else's pain should not be your moral guide."

I recognize that empathy is pretty buggy in people and often leads us astray and rational compassion employing the best system two process is probably a better strategy quite often but I can't help feeling that empathy for all its troubles keeps many of us from going off the rails.
36,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2710225-tessy-consentino,4,Interesting topic. The author didn't sway me against empathy but he helped me think a bit differently about it. I still think the world could use a whole lot more empathy. But it does make sense that doctors and psychiatrists should be less empathetic and more clinical and kind in order to help people better. 
37,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11424703-chad,3,"I believe this book was another recommendation based on one of my Goodreads shelves. The title just sounds so, well, against everything I thought I knew? I use the word empathy all the time, I encourage more empathy, I thought I appreciated it when others attempted to empathize. When looking for something we both would find interesting, my wife selected this one for our nightly reading, probably for similar reasons.The author, Paul Bloom, is a Canadian American psychologist at Yale. He overlaps at least to some extent with some of the work done by Jonathan Haidt, but comes to some different conclusions regarding the rationality of man (more on that later). I hadn't heard of Bloom before, but he also appears to have a large Twitter following. Well, let's dig in to some of the meat of the book.First off, I must clarify: Bloom ISN'T arguing for cold-heartedness, unkindness, or a ""No one cares about your feelings"" approach. When he refers to empathy, he is referring to a very specific phenomenon that he defines as such:Empathy is the act of coming to experience the world as you think someone else does... the act of feeling what you think others are feeling—whatever one chooses to call this—is different from being compassionate, from being kind, and most of all, from being good.In this sense, perhaps you may feel that Bloom is mincing words. But I think this is a significant difference. Is it possible to really parse out empathy, to cut it from other feelings, like compassion and understanding? Bloom believes so. He argues that from a policy standpoint, empathy is a horrible gauge:Empathy is a spotlight focusing on certain people in the here and now. This makes us care more about them, but it leaves us insensitive to the long-term consequences of our acts and blind as well to the suffering of those we do not or cannot empathize with. Empathy is biased, pushing us in the direction of parochialism and racism. It is shortsighted, motivating actions that might make things better in the short term but lead to tragic results in the future. It is innumerate, favoring the one over the many. It can spark violence; our empathy for those close to us is a powerful force for war and atrocity toward others. It is corrosive in personal relationships; it exhausts the spirit and can diminish the force of kindness and love.What is Bloom's alternative? Compassion and understanding driven by rationality to make it happen. It doesn't have to be cold, but it does have to be motivated by facts. Now, I just got done reading Jonathan Haidt's The Righteous Mind, where he argues that such an approach is impossible: we aren't rational creatures. Logic wasn't invented for the discovery of truth, but for survival, to win over supporters and argue against enemies, and to justify your actions. Haidt embraces Hume's argument that reason is the slave of the passions. He doesn't view us as hopelessly lost though: society works when we can overcome our confirmation biases by arguing against each other; we're forced to re-craft our arguments so they can withstand arguments from opponents. Bloom laughs a little at the apparent contradiction in terms in arguing against reason with reason. And he addresses some of Haidt's arguments near the end of the book, arguing that many social psychology results are fragile and impossible to replicate, while others are interesting but not important. I thought that was a little hand-wavey, because I largely agree with Haidt. I think acknowledging our irrationality as a constraint is absolutely vital, especially in realms where the truth is more difficult to parse out: politics for example. Both sides are going to tell you that they are the rational ones.In the end, Bloom gives a very short nod to empathy: while it is bad for making decisions, it can be fun and enjoyable:Empathy can be an immense source of pleasure. Most obviously, we feel joy at the joy of others. I’ve noted elsewhere that here lies one of the joys of having children: You can have experiences that you’ve long become used to—eating ice cream, watching Hitchcock movies, riding a roller coaster—for the first time all over again. Empathy amplifies the pleasures of friendship and community, of sports and games, and of sex and romance. And it’s not just empathy for positive feelings that engages us. There is a fascination we have with seeing the world through the eyes of another, even when the other is suffering. Most of us are intensely curious about the lives of other people and find the act of trying to simulate these lives to be engaging and transformative.I was thinking how Latter-Day Saints have a doctrinal commitment to empathy: to some extent, the Book of Mormon argues that this is how the Atonement of Christ works:And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.I find Bloom's argument for reason to be very appealing, and I definitely agree with the spotlight effect of empathy that leads us to biased decisions. But I wouldn't say that I am ""against empathy."" I feel like empathy should be one of many tensions that guide our decisions.After reading the book, I feel committed to read up a little on Buddhist philosophy, as Bloom draws on it to demonstrate the difference between ""sentimental compassion"" (what we call empathy) and ""great compassion"" (what we call compassion). I also want to read up on Adam Smith, who was not only the great economist, but also a deep thinker on topics surrounding human nature. I added a few to my reading list already."
38,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88025174-annelisa-o-neal,2,"Let me briefly explain my low rating of this book. It isn’t at all that I disagree with Bloom’s central argument, it’s that I don’t feel he is presenting anything that is new or remotely objectionable. Bloom uses a trigger title, but by the end of the prologue, establishes such a narrow definition of empathy that any reasonable person would also be against it in the moral sphere. As a matter of personal preference, I was also hoping that this book would present more philosophical reasoning as to how we *should* make moral decisions; instead, Bloom focuses on summarizing phycological data to discuss how we *do* make these decisions. Overall, not evocative of many new thoughts for me. Philosophically shallow. "
39,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42147710-michael-shore,3,"I really wanted to like this book. I'd heard Bloom speaking on this fascinating issue, and was excited to delve deeper into his work. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.The premise is interesting, and it starts off strong. Bloom then ventures off into moral philosophy, and his treatment of the issues was incomplete and simplified. It's repetitive, scattered, and somewhat unstructured.It's way too long if the purpose is to support his primary thesis: that empathy is often a bad guide for ethical decision making.It's way too short and unfocused if the idea is to provide a proper analysis of the issues surrounding moral philosophy.So it fails either way.I'd say you're better off familiarizing yourself with his primary thesis elsewhere, and skipping this book."
40,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,0,"Empathy is an emotion and thus has biases. For example, we are empathetic to people in the ""us"" category and not in the ""them"" category; we are empathetic to a visible victim of, say, a vaccine, but forgot the invisible beneficiaries. So if we just rely on empathy, we might ignore people worthy of our help and even fight a vaccine that is on the balance good for humanity. The solution? Use clear-headed logic instead.(If we manage to always use clear-headed logic, a lot of problems would no longer be...)"
41,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4085404-phil-aud,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed Paul Bloom's book Against Empathy. Bloom set out to make his controversial claim that empathy leads to more harm than good. He’s against it. No really, he is. His words: “I am against empathy, and one of the goals of this book is to persuade you to be against empathy too” (p. 3). I don’t fully agree with his conclusion, but I do agree with a great deal of his argument. I’ve been doing some minor research on the topic of empathy which is what drove me to this book. It is en vogue these days to believe that empathy is key to all morality. Religious and philosophical ethics are commonly out the window; empathy is here to save the day. But is it? Is that claim truly justifiable? First of all it’s important to note that Bloom is not a cold hearted anti-moralist monster. While he states clearly that he is against empathy, it’s important to note what he is for: “rational compassion.” It’s also important to understand his definition of empathy. He writes “the notion of empathy that I’m most interested in is the act of feeling what you believe other people feel–experiencing what they experience. This is how most psychologists and philosophers use the terms” (pp. 3-4).I don’t want to write about his findings here but simply wish to note that he writes convincingly about the necessary narrow scope of empathy, it’s moral dilemmas, and biases. He also explores the frequent weaknesses of the test cases that apparently “prove” that empathy is our great moral compass. All of that to simply say, he makes a great case and writes a great book. I am going to write a few issues I take with the book, but mostly I thought it was great. My lopsided review is an attempt to leave the content for you and avoid spoilers.Ultimately I’m persuaded but not fully convinced by Bloom’s argument. I think his categories are a tad too narrow and don’t allow for the overlap which is the integrated human person. I’m sure he would disagree, but perhaps empathy, rationality, and compassion overlap more than the author allows for. I noticed this early in the book when he wrote that “Many of our moral heroes, real and fictional, are not rational maximizers or ethical eggheads; they are people of heart. From Huckleberry Fin to Pip to Jack Bauer, from Jesus to Gandi to Martin Luther King Jr., they are individuals of great feeling” (p. 6) Really? Gandi, MLK, and Jesus were very rational in their ethics. King’s decision not to return violence for violence is about a lot of things, feeling is not one of them. This is a rationally planned decision to override what feeling would tell you in the moment. These men were all men of “heart,” but they were deeply rational. They were integrated. Jesus is perhaps the most rational ethical figure in history (both King and Gandi followed his ethic). Jesus’ ethic cannot be reduced to his golden rule as the author seemed to hint at. (Important to note that this ethic is shared by all major religions.) Neither can it be ignored. Integration seems key. At one point Bloom writes “if a child is starving, it doesn’t really matter whether the food is delivered by a smiling aid worker who hands it over and then gives the kid a hug, or dropped from the sky by a buzzing drone. The niceties of personal contact are far less important than actually saving lives” (p. 106). Well, yes; mainly true. But again, integration is key. Human touch cannot be measured the same way calories can be counted, and while the immediate need is most certainly food that needn’t diminish the long term – though often immeasurable – impact of human touch. Alas, I’m being a bit “nitpicky.” But one more thing.Quoting James Rachels, “morality is, at the very least, the effort to guide one’s conduct by reason–that is, to do what there are the best reasons for doing–while giving equal weight to the interests of each individual affected by one’s decision” (p. 52) Here the question is which morality? What is the goal (telos) of morality? I certainly have a different telos than Bloom. This became really clear to me in the fifth chapter on “violence and cruelty.” Bloom writes, “unless we are transformed into angels, violence and the threat of violence are needed to rein in our worst instincts” (p. 179). It strikes me, therefore, that rational compassion is massively important, but the question remains: rational compassion towards what? Who’s version of morality? Who is right on their view of the role of violence, me or Bloom? Who decides. This is an important underlying moral question and I was unclear where he stood.While I may disagree with some of Bloom’s assessments, I believe empathy has been significantly overplayed. Morality is important for every culture to think through and Bloom confronts what many have taken granted in ours. Despite my disagreement on some points, I am grateful for this work and hope it is widely read.I frequently blog and review here: www.philaud.com"
42,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38201925-bartosz,4,"I must confess that I was instantly drawn to the book's title. There's something curious about an author going out of his way to attack something that most would consider a force of good. Not knowing the author, I was prepared for sociopathic ramblings but having checked a couple of reviews, the book started to present itself as so much more.The author defines empathy as cofeeling, or what Adam Smith would define as sympathy - not only putting oneself in another person's shoes but also feeling his pain, happiness, or other emotions. This definition distinguishes empathy from kindness, compassion or warmth.The author's case against empathy is multifaceted. On one hand, he says that empathy is overrated: it isn't a necessary as a basis of action nor morality. For example, seeing a child drowning in shallow water our natural reaction would be to help him without feeling his fear, and empathy alone doesn't force one to do good - a poignant example referenced a wife of a Nazi officer who seeing executions, requested that those atrocities be done far from her sight due to her sickly nerves. Empathy has spotlight tendencies - by empathizing with the suffering of one person we can ignore the suffering of someone more deserving. Sometimes this might be natural - caring more about your kith and kin than stranger, sometimes it might prejudice against other people without any good reason. The book showcases studies showing that given the choice people triaged sick children simply by how much they were predisposed to sympathize with them - even if the other children were more deserving or required more help.The book breaks down empathy further - into what the author calls cognitive empathy - understanding the feelings of others without feeling them. Such an ability is the domain of sociopaths (who need it to be such expert manipulators) but lacking of (true) empathy doesn't transfer to being immoral. People high on the autistic spectrum are commonly low on both empathy but aren't immoral themselves.Morality, doing good and tendencies of altruism aren't necessarily correlated with sympathy. In fact, the author points to several people such as Peter Singer or Zell Kravinsky who are very shrewd and calculating with their altruism. The book also quotes Elaine Scarry who argues that only by depersonalizing (e.g take ""Israel"" and ""Palestine"" and replace with ""Bolivia"" and ""Chile"") one can come to the best conclusions.Evil isn't necessarily correlated with lack of sympathy, either. Hitler famously loved dogs and children, as did Goebbels. Most people aren't sociopaths - they're normal people who think themselves as victims. Empathy can be a force for good but also a force for evil - sympathizing ""with our side"" can push one to commit acts of evil. Sometimes high empathy might be a deterrent to doing good. Faced with strong negative feelings born of sympathy people might freeze or avoid the situation. Altruism with detachment would serve better, and the book points out studies that doctors perform better when they're detached from the patient, and patients appreciate when the doctors' stoic feelings can be a line to hold on to instead of a drowning anchor feeding back their own anxiety.Even in personal relations sympathy isn't necessary, or as the author says ""does more harm than good"". Rephrasing the example for the book: if the author's niece wins a scholarship he would be happy for her not necessarily because he's mirroring her feelings (empathy) but because he wants to do well for her. He might even learn of the scholarship before her - making sympathy impossible. The author describes a woman who is a ""reverse psychopath"" - high with cognitive empathy but also not being able to stop cofeeling with others. Her predicament would make her perpetually unhappy, drained of being forced to relive other peoples feelings. If sympathy is so bad what are the alternatives? Bloom points to compassion without cofeeling. Neurologically they're different, activating different portions of the brain, and align philosophically with Buddhism: be compassionate but detached. The author argues that reason, intelligence and restraint (things servery lacking in the prison population) are better guides than empathy itself.Paul Bloom presents more arguments against empathy than I could possibly summarize in such a small review. The book is well worth the read, the language and examples are down to earth and compelling. I, personally, found the book fascinating after A Theory of Moral Sentiments, as it could be viewed as a riposte to Smith's book on ethics.Like anger, sympathy is a necessary adaptation but can lead astray - the position the author takes isn't against compassion, goodness or being nice - just reliving others' feelings as a basis for morality or policy."
43,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28777221-sharad-pandian,4,"Bloom argues that empathy is overrated and often brings worse consequences. If this sounds bizarre, it's because he uses a somewhat narrow definition of empathy as the feeling of another's pain. This is distinguished from kindness, compassion, cognitive empathy (being able to know why a person acts the way that they do, in something like a literary understanding), etc. Bloom isn't against any of these other motivations, so the argument against empathy is successful, if not as ambitious as it might have seemed from the title.He makes his case against empathy by pointing to how even though it does draw attention to a certain harm, it's biased to favor in-group members, exclusionary, and incapable of being objective. This is bad because it makes people privilege a few people who appeal to them in visceral ways, instead of the many more who could be helped who get buried in abstract statistics (there's a whiff of utilitarianism throughout). After all, you can't really extend empathy to more than a few people. So instead of trying to make other people matter as much as in-group members, it would be better to de-emphasise the importance of in-group members in the moral calculus. He admits that it is possible that people might need empathy when growing up to form a normal moral agent, but like milk he thinks adults might not need it anymore. As long as they know what different emotions and needs feel like, they can rely on the other moral motives- cognitive empathy, kindness, etc- to be as moral as required.He's probably most successful/interesting in arguing against those who make a case for empathy:First, he points out that although many culturally prominent cases might seem like they are caused by a straightforward lack of empathy, it is usually empathy causing the problem in the first place. For example, an anti-immigration stance usually isn't just a lack of empathy towards out-group members, but too much empathy directed at people perceived at in-group members (eg: illegal immigrants are criminals who are thought of as harming Americans). The instinctive response is to argue that this is just selective empathy, but Bloom points out that even if it were possible to extend empathy broadly, it is always going to hard to do so because of its intrinsically biased nature.Second, although it is widely believed that empathy can help shield against de-humanization, in truth many people who act cruelly are fully aware of the humanity of others, which is precisely what makes their actions so vile. If someone actually thought the other person was an animal, then they wouldn't feel the need to call them dogs or apes. It's the effacement of acknowledged humanity which makes their actions terrible.I don't know how much I buy this, especially because of the overly sharp distinctions he tries to draw. Moreover, his solution seems a little too neat- you get to not feel bad about other people's suffering and feel good about being moral. And there's no talk at all about how our identities might be sutured unto others', making fundamental questions about the ""I"" who feels empathy itself tricky. But it's still ambitious, well-argued, and faces up to a lot of obvious criticism head-on, so it's a pretty neat book overall."
44,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11772351-david-kent,3,"Yale Professor of Psychology Paul Bloom doesn't agree that our problem is we don't have enough empathy for others; he believes we have too much, and that it often leads us to make bad decisions that cause more grief rather than less. Overall he makes some good points against empathy, defending them with strong empirical and anecdotal support. He has a case. He does less well in promoting the second part of his title, the case for rational compassion. In fact, he spends the entirety of the book arguing against empathy and virtually none arguing for rational compassion. Effectively he argues (too much) empathy is a bad thing, then leaves as a default that rational compassion is a better thing.I don't disagree with him on most of his points. His case is rational and supported (which in itself is an argument for his default position). I do however think he is overstating both the amount of empathy present in today's society and the calls for increasing it. He gives examples of those, including President Obama, calling for more empathy, but I think those calls are really for more compassion than empathy, at least as Bloom defines it. In a way he sets up a straw man, although perhaps so do those calling for more empathy when that isn't really what they mean.In any case, I wish he had spent more time making a positive case for rational compassion, including how and he defines it and examples of it in real life. Maybe that will be in the next book but it should have been emphasized more here. He uses an Abraham Lincoln anecdote that I thought was silly; instead I wish he had quoted Lincoln's more relevant line: ""Reason, cold, calculating, unimpassioned reason, must furnish all the materials for our future support and defence."" While I think Bloom fails in supporting the second part of his thesis - rational compassion - he seems to accidentally provide its best support in a quote by Harvard psychology professor Steven Pinker. Paraphrased, what Pinker suggests is that rather than say ""love your neighbors and enemies; that way you won't kill them,"" simply ""don't kill your neighbors and enemies, even if you don't love them."" Put another way, and again to quote Lincoln when asked to choose between two options of marrying a slave or keeping her in slavery, ""I can just leave her alone."" These views seem to me to support the rational compassion idea. We don't have to feel others pain in order to help relieve their pain. All we have to do is the right thing. In the United States, that means we don't have to agree with someone - or even empathize with them - to support their constitutional rights. I do think the book provides valuable insights and Bloom generally makes a robust case for why empathy is overrated. So I do recommend it. You might not walk away with answers, but at least you'll have plenty of questions to think about it, and perhaps stimulating thoughtful reflection is the goal of the book."
45,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87082395-andrew-howdle,3," Against Empathy  is a perplexing read, brilliant in some parts and dull in others. Bloom's central thesis is well stated: empathy is taken to be a sign of our humanity, the more we step into another person's shoes and feel with them, the more we are humanised, when in fact, empathy is a terrible guide-- it is a ""spotlight"" emotion and as such it works well on a one-to-one (though not always) but is an unreliable light when it comes to dealing with mass involvement and complex situations. The book struggles for three main reasons. Bloom stands psychology alongside philosophy, usually in relation to the ethical philosophers of the Scottish Enlightenment. The two disciplines mix like oil and water. One minute a reader is in the laboratory with scientific fact. The next minute in the sitting room with Smith or Hulme trying to work through linguistic speculations. The style of  Against Empathy  is not up to this mix. The colloquial tone has a bathetic effect such that important points sound trivial. Also, Bloom has a tendency to insert irrelevancies. For example, Smith was not well disposed towards family relationships, but then he had no children and did not know much about sexual relationships as he was most likely a virgin. Constantly, Bloom swipes the carpet from under his feet and a reader is left bemused as to the reliability of the point being made. This even happens in relation to the book's title: Bloom is not against empathy: he is against some types of empathy. Technically, the title should be ""Against Some Types of Empathy"", though that is not a very catchy title and no doubt the reason why the publishers settled on the provocative  Against Empathy . Bloom has some interesting chapters on Politics and Intimacy. It is a pity, however, that the book was not more focused. It makes no mention of empathy and aesthetics. Why do we read? Why do people need stories? Why do we watch films or listen to music? What is the role of empathy here? Such is a debate that fits with Bloom's concerns. Just as a story can demand feeling, so it can direct that feeling into dark areas. Music can both humanise and dehumanise, draw people together into a single organism at a concert or direct them towards political hallucination as with the Nazis and Wagner. ""Rational compassion"" is an important idea, but one that gets lost amidst the meanderings in  Against Empathy "
46,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2579781-paul,4,"This book suffers a bit from the theme and Bloom's somewhat sensationalistic claim that he is ""Against Empathy"". I think Bloom makes a fairly compelling case for taking emotionalism in general out of rational decisionmaking, and makes a somewhat more specific case for why actual emotional empathy (the ability to feel what it feels like to be another person) might be better classified as a negative emotion like pain than a positive emotion like joy. That said, his argument is nearly tautological, in that he separates out emotional empathy from cognitive empathy (the ability to know how another person feels about something without feeling it yourself), and so to the extent that empathy is rational, that is classified as ""cognitive empathy"" - therefor emotional empathy is not rational, QED.Still, I think Bloom makes a very careful case for having deep suspicion of empathy-based narratives, and points out some of the many moral absurdities arising from using empathy when it is most definitely the wrong tool. I think the main problem with Bloom's argument is that he takes as given that some flavor of utilitarianism is the self-evidently correct basis for morality. This is asserted without proof, and nearly all of his other arguments are self-consistent but derived from this premise. I'm fairly certain there are stronger arguments to be made where emotional empathy as defined by Bloom can be shown to be negative-ish in many if not all moral systems not specifically chosen for empathy to play a role (e.g. ""the only moral imperative is that you must feel empathy""), but I am not particularly interested in moral philosophy as I am not convinced that morality is all that different from aesthetics, and it's a hard case to make that one's aesthetic preferences are ""right"" or ""wrong"".Either way, I'd say the book is worth reading. I really liked the intellectual humility that comes across in Bloom's writing. He seems to be going out of his way to emphasize that he has strong opinions weakly held - ""I'm laying out this case that I firmly believe to be true, but show me where I'm wrong and I'll change my mind."" Quite refreshing."
47,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9843284-sue-cartwright,5,"From the moment this book jumped out at me from its display at my local Waterstones to reading the last paragraph in just two days, Against Empathy, stirred my senses and provided an excellent opportunity to re-examine what empathy actually means, understand how it has become so misunderstood and learn why it's become a convenient yet poor morale guide for us to live our lives by. Paul's writing is brilliant and succinct, enabling you to keep up at every turn. He presents just the right information, in the right context, at the right time, so that you can absorb and process an entirely different way of looking at something (and why you should) as you go along. No stopping, checking, going back or puzzling over sense or meaning, it's an excellent and eloquent argument for 'conscious deliberate reasoning', against empathy in the sense of 'feeling what you believe others feel'. This actually provides a very narrow focus on any given situation, grounded in the here and now, often dangerously biased and shortsighted, and capable of causing great harm. This is set against the positive side to empathy which is identified (as such) and celebrated throughout with a round up at the end. This is a good thing as it helps to further put this new way of looking at empathy into context. It's also very clever to highlight empathy's goodness (in the context of helping us to understand and support each other, enjoy intimacy and pleasure, etc) but to also highlight empathy purely as a supportive role if this is required to temper rational decision-making.It's a tricky balance, and my initial fear that this work might try to throw the baby out with the bathwater was quickly dispelled. There are two sides to empathy, one we need to nurture and one we need to put in it's right place and take out of the moral decision-making equation. As such, this book helps to redefine and represent a deeply ingrained, and hitherto misunderstood human trait, to positive and great effect."
48,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86100831-msc,1,"I did not finish this book, but I think I got the gist. The more I read, the more frustrated I got. The argument hinges on a semantic distinction: by empathy, Bloom doesn't mean ""diffuse compassion,"" which he says is different from empathy but which the average person would say is the same. Instead, psychologists define empathy as literally ""feeling what others feel."" Idk about you, but I don't call this empathy; I call it weak emotional boundaries. I agree that that can be bad, particularly in intimate relationships (which Bloom spends a chapter discussing).But the broader argument that ""feeling what others feel"" generally causes bad results in the context of moral decisionmaking and public policy was a bit of a stretch. Is it really ""empathy"" that leads wealthy Western tourists to give money to child beggars in developing countries, when that money is being turned over to the criminal organizations that enslave them? (His example.) Or is it something else, like sanctimoniousness, guilt, etc.? Keep in mind that Bloom defines empathy very narrowly. Several times he gives the example of caring for a child who is afraid of a thunderstorm; you don't have to feel her fear (i.e., experience empathy) in order to help her. But is the Western tourist really feeling the child beggar's suffering when she decides to give him money? Bloom claims that one of empathy's main weaknesses is that it's vulnerable to bias. In other words, we're more likely to feel the feelings of somebody who is close to us or similar to us in some way, and that can lead us to focus our energy on issues that are relatively less important or impact fewer people (e.g., people flooded Newtown, CT, with gifts its residents didn't need after Sandy Hook -- his example). But I don't know why he chooses to pin the blame on empathy when it's bias itself that more directly causes the ""bad result."" I have a suspicion that our moral decisions will always be vulnerable to bias, even if we all relied on ""diffuse compassion"" to make them."
49,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"Often when you see a title like this you may think, ""ok well that was clearly just literary clickbait and he can't genuinely mean that."" Yale Professor Paul Bloom really does mean this when it comes to the formation of morality and in this brief introduction to the idea does a good job in explaining why deliberate and rational compassion is a more effective tool. However based on some of the reviews I have seen, it seems like several people have taken this notion way behind his scope, or in most cases, not actually read the book. First of all, as there are many notions as to what is meant by the term empathy, Bloom is taking it to mean: ""The act of coming to experience the world as you think someone else does."" Second, he is not arguing against it as a positive personality trait, rather, his discussion centers on its narrow focus and potentially misleading consequences when used for forming and taking moralistic action, ""A reasoned, even counterempathic analysis of moral obligation and likely consequences is a better guide to planning for the future than the gut wrench of empathy."" Lastly, I find it hard to believe that well-read individuals are genuinely shocked or dismayed by anything they read here. If you have read or listened to Peter Singer, Steven Pinker, Sam Harris, or even Adam Smith on these points you likely have heard much more provocative material. As an introduction to the idea of rational compassion replacing empathy in the narrow sense that Bloom presents, he succeeds quite well. However there is much more room for research, study, and development of several of these ideas for this to be another more than a mildly provocative introduction."
50,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1142366-hans,3,"Had to force myself to read this just to hear a contrary opinion. Everything I've believed up to this point has sung the praises of empathy to the point where I thought it was the one aspect of humanity that could redeem it. Alas I can see how I may have been short-sighted in that assumption for there are clear cases where empathy can actually cause more harm than good. Boiled down to it's essential elements the central problem with Empathy is that it causes one to focus on the Tree instead of the Forest. So while it is noble to save a tree, often it can come at a larger price of losing a forest. The author makes this case by using a very narrow definition of ""Empathy"" for meaning ""putting oneself in another's shoes"". When we use too much empathy it can actually be the very source of our biases, because we tend to put ourselves in the shoes primarily of those most like us because we can't possibly put ourselves in everyone's shoes all at the same time in every situation so we can only use it for a select few. Those select few who we do empathize with will be the beneficiaries of our good will but the large masses of the rest who might also be affected by our choices won't and may actually be hurt by it.I'm glad I read this book. I understand the author's points. I might not go as far as he did in attacking Empathy as much as he did, but I see his point. It isn't the cure all that many of us may have supposed. He contends instead that Cognitive Compassion, which still relies on the heart, but it is filtered through careful rationality so as to not miss the larger consequences of our potentially misguided Empathy."
51,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54518540-cam-lidstone,4,"In Against Empathy, Bloom argues for an unintuitive position but is always warm and lucid and comes across as immensely likeable.Bloom distinguishes cognitive empathy (understanding other people's perspectives) from emotional empathy (experiencing other people's experiences; the phenomenon that Adam Smith and David Hume called sympathy). He notes the former is necessary for morality. He's against the latter.He admits empathy can do good. However, it is not a necessary condition for moral action. He concedes that some emotional push is needed; as Hume said: ""reason is the slave of the passions"". However, Bloom is more in favour of compassion which he distinguishes from empathy based on cognitive science research by Singer and Ricard. The main issue with empathy is that it works like a spotlight directing attention and aid to where it's supposedly needed. This spotlight nature renders empathy innumerate, myopic and biased towards those who are close to us, similar to us, more attractive and non-scary.Bloom admits that compassion can be biased too. However, it doesn't fall into the same traps with innumeracy and doesn't cause burnout for the person showing concern. If you don't read the book, I'd recommend listening to Bloom discuss empathy on the Rationally Speaking, and Making Sense podcasts. He's also interviewed in Vox."
52,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47665820-robert-kortus,3,"First time i saw this book on the shelf at the library, I dismissed it because of the title. I'm a huge advocate of empathy and figured anyone that felt so strongly against it that he had to write a book, must be a real jackass. But, after about a year of seeing it every time I went to the library, my curiosity got the better of me and I finally read it.I have to admit that the book really made me think, which I appreciate. The books main argument is that we should be using rational thinking and compassion instead of empathy. Using more ""head"" and less heart. I agree with this premiss overall; rationality should always override emotions. But, I think that Bloom really overstates his case in this book. Maybe that's his intention - he's hoping to overshoot so that maybe people fall somewhere in the middle?He really plays semantics with words, with a habit of making a case for what most people would consider empathy, but then is quick to clarify, ""No, no, I'm talking about COMPASSION!"" or ""I'm talking about SYMPATHY, that's TOTALLY different then empathy!"" He also makes the same points multiple points throughout the book, just framed in a different way. He could have easily shaved 75-100 pages off this book.I would normally have given this book 2 starts, but I did that he challenged my beliefs and made me reconsider my position on empathy and morality. I'm still a big advocate for empathy, but this book has made me understand the importance of using rationality to direct empathy."
53,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58743626-camille,4,"Bloom’s series of six essays and two interludes are well-researched and thought-provoking. His central argument is that moral and beneficial policies are best created through reasoned and fair analysis, without empathetic engagement with victims which is biased and often irrational. Empathy (I feel your pain) is distinct from compassion (I feel for your pain), and that distinction is important, because we should be kind and compassionate to achieve beneficial policies for society. Also, his argument is in the context of moral reasoning and policy-making, and he points out that empathy in many domains of our lives gives it meaning and joy (i.e. children, community, sports). I disagree with some of his points, and I think it may be too much to expect rational compassion from most people in their decision-making. But his writing invites conversation, and that encourages progress. Overall, Bloom does an excellent job considering multiple perspectives and angles on this controversial argument. One criticism of mine is that because he continually shapes his perspective as he responds to commentaries, his language occasionally contradicts itself and I think he could have done more to ensure it is precise; however, I also do think that his colloquial and conversational tone makes for a more fun read. "
54,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69401-nasim,3,"In general, this is a good book in the sense that it broadens your perspective about empathy. Although I believe that Paul Bloom is a great writer, in this book he repeats his arguments many times. So I think the book could be shorten down. His arguments sound interesting but not all of them seem to be practical. For instance, he claims that the consequences of our (moral) actions should influence our decisions about whether or not we engage in those behaviours. If a boy is drowning and you save him and then 50 years later he becomes someone like Hitler, it is better not to save the boy. But, how could one forecast the long lasting consequences of her/his behaviour? People usually engage in altruistic behaviour with the intention of doing good. I agree that we should think about the consequences of our behaviours, but we are not able to forecast them. So I'd rather stick to do what I am thinking is right at the moment than not doing anything with the fear of the consequences of my actions in future. Worth reading it."
55,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27253012-patty,4,"Against Empathy argues that empathy is a terrible foundation in the moral domain specifically because the side effects outweigh its benefits. There are other more rational ways to grow our morality. Since empathy is an emotional response, sure, I can get behind that. It's just as bad as thinking disgust should guild your morality. There's definitely more to consider. Bloom highlights political agenda, charities, and marketing companies that take advantage of us through our allegiance to empathy. He also points out the bias and the boundaries-- for example, you can empathize more with your close friend than a stranger... Or the struggle to feel empathy (in the form of shared excitement or joy) for a close friend who receives something you envy. These are the kinds of discussions he has about his stance against empathy. In the end, I enjoyed it and am rather interested to read his other books too."

However, the belief I understand can blind us to greater concerns of people or situations we are less connected. Bloom argues well that empathy can be a forcefor good and kindness but quoting Adam Smith ""It is not the soft power of humanity, it is not that feeble spark of benevolence which Nature has lighted up in the human heart, that is thus capable of counteracting the strongest impluses of self-love. It is a stronger power, a more forcible motive, which exerts itself upon such occassions.

Objections to this view are dealt with (especially the ""you just need to expand the scope of empathy"" objection, which really just bastardizes the concept of empathy). I enjoyed this book and highly recommend it, but I didn't need any convincing of the book's thesis and wonder how much this would convince someone who held the view that what we need is more compassion."

Emotional empathy let us to feel what other people feels, mirror people's feeling, which could be so distraught to paralyze us to take effective action and narrow focus of bias could make us to make unwise actions. Cognitive empathy make us understand other people's feeling without experiencing it, lead us positive compassion, kindness , reasoning, more effective way to help people.Statistical data and reasoning seem always cold, hard to stir people to act, and ever worse when data and reasoning against our intuition and our bias, like ""identifiable victim effect"".

Author's own conclusion---1. Our moral decisions and actions are powerfully shaped by the force of empathy.---2. This often make the world worse.---3. We have the capacity to do better.2. Cognitive empathy is morally neutral. cognitive empathy: understand you feel, but do not feel it. It is positive compassion, kindness. The understanding and feeling are different neuron processing, you can understand it without feeling it, that is cognitive empathy. We are much better to use reasons, cost-benefit, compassion, kindness to make decisions, give intelligently, with eye towards consequence. Depersonalize the process and circumvent our natural preference and bias, with compassion for others, rational-making taking happiness and suffering into account. Reduce our candidates to X, Y, Z, designing procedure such as blind reviewing and blind auditions. Bring everyone down rather than bring everyone up. Don't try to make them (strangers) more weight. Rather, make yourself less weight. Bring everyone to the same level by diminish yourself. Put yourself, and those you love, on the level of strangers. p138 Buddhist texts distinguish ""sentimental compassion"", which corresponds to what we could call empathy and ""great compassion"", which is what we would simply called compassion. The first is to be avoid, as it exhausts the bodhisattva. It's the second that is worth pursing. Great compssion is more distanced and reserved, and can be sustained indefinitely.... In contrast to (emotional) empathy, compassion does not means sharing the suffering of others: rather, it is characterized by feeling of warmth, concern and care for other, as well as a strong motivation to improve the other's well-being. Compassion is feeling for and not feeling with the other. p139 There is a neural difference: Empathy training led to increased activation in the insula and anterior cingulate cortes. Compassion training led to activation in other parts of the brain, such as the medical orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum.p141 Mindful meditation reduces activation of the brain networks associated with simulating the feeling of people in distress, in favour of networks associated with feelings of social affiliation. Buddhist scholar Thupten Jinpa: ""Meditation-based training enables practitioners to move quickly from feeling the distress of others to acting with compassion to alleviated it.""... Not only can compassion and kindness exist independently of empathy, they are sometime opposed . Sometimes, we are better people if we suppress our empathic feeling. p145 My friend (psychologist) does get into her clients' heads, she would be useless if she couldn't - but she doesn't feel what they fee. She employs understanding and caring, not empathy.p149 There is a world difference, between understanding the misery of the person who is talking to you because you have felt misery in the past, even though now you are calm, and understanding the misery of the person who is talking to you because  you are mirroring them and feeling their misery right now. The first, which doesn't involve empathy in any sense, just understanding, has all advantages of the second and none of its cost.p154 My worst moments as a father aren't when I don't care, they're when I care too much, when I cannot disengage from my children's frustration and pain.  --my comment: so true for me.Against Fairness by Stephen T.

This is emotional empathy, feel what you feel.Emotional Empathy is biased and parochial; it is spotlight (metaphor, narrow focus, only light up the area you focus, ignore surrounding) , it focus on certain people at the expense of others; it is innumerate (we often pay too much attention to one person, ignore too many suffering), it is not in the direction of increase of justice, so it distort our moral and policy decision in ways cause suffering instead of relieving it.

72,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1216728-sophia,4,"In most respects, this is a really good book; it's the author defending a specific, at first glance controversial, idea and backing it up with science, history and reason. It’s very accessible, a decent length, including arguments and counter arguments and counter counter arguments. Anyone interested in morality should give it a read. Bloom essentially argues that the human tendency of literally feeling what someone else is feeling, “emotional empathy”, is detrimental to individuals and society as a whole, for 3 main reasons: it’s more often paralyzing than motivating, it’s unnecessarily painful, and it is inescapably limited in scope. Instead, all of what’s good about people can be attributed to compassion; caring without feeling the same thing.The idea I agreed with the most was that empathy is a problem because it is limited in scope, meaning the human mind can only handle feeling empathy for a limited number of individuals at a time, and invariably those individuals are “ranked” by closeness (family, friends, neighbours, other). This makes it a cousin of racism in a weird sense; by shining a spotlight on just your people, you can so ignore everyone else that you don’t notice the harm you cause. So in war, it’s not so much a lack of empathy for the enemy (which on it’s own would just lead to apathy) but an excess of empathy towards your own group, or any other group which moves you to do something, blind to anyone else. While it would be nice to extend empathy to the enemy, that’s just not how our brains were wired. Along the same lines, I personally appreciated the change in perspective from thinking of empathy as the source of morality to just a manifestation of it. A couple months ago, I went through a mini crisis where I had to stop reading the news, because I realized behind every death toll number were actual people, who were terrified for their lives, and then had that snuffed out; and there was just so much death and pain, but I didn’t want to stop feeling this connection, because I worried that would be callous, denying reality. The idea that empathy is just not the tool for the job helps a lot; instead it’s better that I feel compassion, a detached awareness of a problem, followed by an evaluation of whether I can do anything to help; not so I would feel better, but just to help. If empathy was causing me to turn off the news so that I would feel less pain, then clearly it was a problem not a solution.The idea that compassion not only can but should replace empathy was a little harder to swallow, but the more I think about it, the more I agree. I started trying to find an example to prove this wrong, and an easy one popped up on tv: spring breakers continuing to gather despite the coronavirus lockdown. At first glance, it seems that these millennials (eye roll) were not feeling any empathy for the elderly and the sick at risk, and if they had, they would have stayed home. While this is true, it would actually be enough for them just to feel compassion, and in hindsight, that’s what jumpstarted me into proper self-isolation; in the early days, I saw the numbers, and realized with the 14 day incubation period there was no other way to stop this, so I stayed home, before even the Italian death toll hit 1000. Only later did I come across the personal stories of some of the victims, making me want to curl up in a ball and cry; but while that technically would also keep me at home, compassion left me the presence of mind to plan how to avoid trips outside, contact my relatives to provide helpful information, and avoid hoarding toilet paper. In a similar vein, there’s currently the debate about whether the economy is “worth” the lives of the elderly and infirm. Anyone arguing using empathy would be horrified at the idea that the economy should factor into such a decision, but actually if the economy collapses, so too will future healthcare and medical research, leading possibly to even more deaths, not to mention suffering from just lower quality of life. Now, is the economy really going to collapse? Maybe not, but its not going to be empathy, but rational, albeit compassionate, analysis that will find the answer. Like with this, most other legal and political decisions would benefit from taking a step back from empathy, and just dealing with compassion; the alternative results in one-sided views that devolves into entrenched partisanship, as we currently see.On the topic of news, Bloom actually missed a golden opportunity to criticize the media for it’s practice of starting almost every article with some first-name basis narrative about some victim; as if the reader couldn’t be brought to care unless there was a soul behind each tragedy. It always really bothered me to read this; on the one hand because it gave me pain when all I wanted was information, on the other hand because it glaringly defied the objectivity I would hope for in the news. Bloom brings up the case of how you can just as easily empathize with poor young black Americans afraid for their lives, or with self-sacrificing police officers, trying to help their city but afraid for their lives; yet oh so rarely can people do both. But we shouldn’t try; and the news should stop trying to get that to happen. Instead, we should just be presented with cold hard facts that help with better decision making on how much power and trianing to give police and what kind of reform programs work.The main problem with this book is I think Bloom gives too much “credit” to empathy, and disregards other forms of “emotional decision making” behind many of the problems he attributes to empathy. War in particular he argues comes down to one side feeling empathy for some victim, and taking up arms to fight against the aggressor. But actually empathy, as he writes elsewhere, is often paralyzing, especially when the emotion involved is fear and trauma; instead seeing this in others often provokes anger instead, and it is this that leads people to war. So just like he claims mainstream definition of empathy is jut “everything good and nice about people”, he tends to attribute every non-selfish emotional action to empathy. If instead of being “against empathy” he had more accurately stated his position as “against emotional decision making” I think he would reveal himself as being far less controversial than his title suggests (nor as original).Also, an important omission from his thesis is whether it is even possible to have compassion without empathy; he argues for us to make decisions like this, which is fine, but can you as a human develop a sense of compassion, for anyone, without first feeling empathy? Bloom repeatedly hints that you can, but while he talks about individuals without both empathy and compassion (psychopaths), he doesn’t mention a class of people without empathy but with compassion. Well actually, he does mention Buddhist monks, but they learn this state of enlightenment, they're not naturally endowed with it. He also claims children have instincts of compassion without showing corresponding empathy, but the child’s version of compassion is not particularly useful. The story he gives is of a toddler, who has learned that showing off his belly makes adults smile. One day his older brother gets hurt, and in an attempt to make his brother feel better, he shows him his belly. While clearly the “theory of mind” that his brother was hurting was there, and the instinct to try and help as well, but the chosen solution was not particularly helpful. Instead, being able to feel empathy, as in imagine also being hurt, would allow for a more appropriate response. So ultimately, I still suspect Bloom is wrong about empathy, even by his narrow definition, being only an impediment. My intuitive theory would be that empathy is a necessary tool for learning not only what could hurt us, but also what could make us feel better and as a consequence could help others feel better. If you have a friend who just had a tough breakup, and you yourself have never even dated, compassion may not even be enough to realize why the situation is painful, and therefore what you as a friend could do to help. Yes, in the grand scheme of things, its better for the friend to have broken off from a bad relationship, but that is not the consolation that’s going to help right in that moment. If the situation were reversed, I think it would be nice to have a compassionate friend, but I would really want an empathic best friend. In conclusion, in the grand scheme of decision making, empathy can be as detrimental as racism, focusing a spotlight only on a small group for not objective reasons. But I don’t think deep interpersonal relationships would be possible without it. "
73,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2896545-meg,2,"The basic argument here is one that I can certainly get behind: We should strive for more cognitive empathy, but less emotional empathy. Our decisions and policies should be driven primarily by rational evaluation of how we can do the most good with our resources, rather than exhausting our resources through the avenues that tug most on our heartstrings.I had a few major problems, though, too. In the end, Paul Bloom and I fundamentally disagree in our worldviews. This manifested in three particular ways throughout the book:1) As a white, straight, male, affluent, American Yale professor, Bloom writes from a place of EXTREME privilege...and he makes virtually no effort to even acknowledge this, let alone compensate for it. Many of his points were weakened for me by the fact that they wouldn't hold up if the privilege was removed.2) Bloom is, by his own admission, not a sincere advocate of making personal sacrifices for the common good. He writes, ""I could never take seriously people who refuse to take long flights to see those they love because of worries about contributing to climate change. Or even those who put their children into a public school that they know to be terrible even though they can easily afford a private school, just out of a broader principle of common good. Even when it comes to charity, I am not a good utilitarian."" As a Gryffindor and a 1 on the Enneagram, this is not just foreign to me, it's repulsive.3) I couldn't get past the feeling that a lot of this book was written out of semantic quibbling between the scholarly elite. The sensationalist title soon gave way to a core position that, while it made sense, was less revolutionary than one might expect.All in all, I'm still grateful to this book. The fact that I disagreed with certain points and favored others was a helpful exercise in critical reading. I was motivated to think deeply while reading and came out with a much more nuanced understanding of empathy and my associated beliefs. I'm not at all suggesting that others shouldn't read this book -- but if you do read it, just make sure you do so through a critical lens."
74,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46716546-weronika,2,"It might be a three stars book, but I vowed to subtract a star for any book that quotes the marshmallow study results (the book quotes the marshmallow study results!!!). It is, in fact, a poorly organised sequence of paragraphs commenting on a variety of studies that could be loosely linked with or interpreted in the context of empathy. Mixed into that is some useful literature (Adam Smith, of all people!) and some colourful, though somewhat clichéd examples from history (Abe Lincoln saving piglets!). The argument is not without merit -- empathy, rather than a force for good, is a force for tribalism. We feel more for people like us. When a victim is like us, and the perpetrator is unlike us, we feel disproportionately more for the victim. If the victim is unlike us, but the perpetrator belongs to our tribe, we tend to dismiss the victim and feel for the perpetrator. Empathy is also number-blind; we care for one, but not for hundreds. Empathy stirs injustice -- in studies quoted in the book, people would move kids up the treatment lists disregarding other children, just because they knew that one kid and did not know the rest of them. And of course there are the Nazis, there is Hitler. The author is also right to add (after Smith) that empathy only makes us sympathize with those who feel bad. Empathetic people do not experience joy and happiness when others experience happiness or achieve success. They envy them. The capacity for ""positive"" empathy is limited to ""small joys"" in life. And so, Bloom claims, we should rather focus on compassion, sort of Buddhist-style. And the argument seems to be valid, it's just the book that is bad."
75,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14711872-jamie,3,"The attention grabbing title suggests a shocking case study, but Paul Bloom's subtitle is a much better metric for what this thoughtful book presents. Empathy is defined as ""the act of coming to experience the world as you think someone else does,"" and it does not refer to compassion or understanding but rather emotional assumptions which are devoid of reason. At first, the work felt like a reprimand over semantics since most of society would define empathy as an appeal to understanding through dialogue. But once Bloom distinguishes empathy from deliberative reasoning and cognitive empathy, his denigration of this practice unveils empathy's limitations and dangers. Logic and reason should be given precedence in order to capacitate self-control, intelligence, and balanced compassion for the future.Bloom's writing is unexpectedly humorous with tongue-in-cheek making this an entertaining read. Unfortunately, he frames every idea precisely with plenty of caveats that almost negate many of his statements. He seems to expect, and tries to prevent, critique of his findings which results in long-winded lines of dialogue that end up saying very little with each point. This round-about quantifying of ideas suggests that his thesis is not as shocking or profound as he may have wished it to be. However, the examples he offers illustrate his view and prove that empathy is not the cure all for humanities problems, and the perception that empathy is a superior trait is certainly called into question. Morality is motivating but ambiguous, and it is far more important to practice reason and emotional intelligence in the pursuit of a better future."

I think he makes some compelling arguments, the most convincing of which was that his narrowly-defined version of empathy serves as a tool to prioritize a single person over thousands or millions of people, which can be used for both good AND for bad - it's apolitical and amoral (i.e. how empathy for orphans in latin american countries causes more harm than good w/ white savior volunteering trips, unsustainable orphanage businesses, and fake orphans as a ""tourist trap""). he is a little insensitive about certain topics at times, and also denies his white privilege on one occasion, which was interesting. ultimately I think his final thesis is pretty reasonable, it is just not an amazingly well written book."

I estimate that, sure, we are heading to a more and more rational civilization, but 350,000 years is still too short for an advanced developed civilization. We are, after all, an average species on an average planet. But why against compassion. We are actually doing really great under this ""not-quite-rational-but-very-compassionate"" world.No matter how the society evolves, the compassionate ones always have comparative advantage in survival.

I think it is a great essay that was diluted into book. On several occasions I found myself skimming through some sections which instead of reinforcing (or repeating) an idea or argument were actually straying off the path. For this reason I even contemplated giving it 3 stars before settling to 4. In the end, I settled for 4 stars. I didn't do it out of empathy for the effort the author put in it, but for the great content.

80,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,2,"The death of one man is a tragedy, the death of millions is a statistic.-	Joseph StalinAgainst Empathy? Who could be against empathy? You might as well say you’re against puppies!Against Empathy: The Case for Rational Compassion has a provocative title (deliberately so, for $ales purposes no doubt), but the claim Paul Bloom (Professor of psychology and cognitive science at Yale University) is making is substantially more banal. Bloom claims that, while empathy can serve as a spotlight, focusing attention on issues of importance, it more often than not leads to morally incorrect conclusions. Instead, he argues that ‘rational compassion’ serves as a better guide for determining our correct moral course of action. Before getting into details we first need to define what Bloom means by ‘empathy’. Bloom considers empathy to be the ability to put oneself in another’s shoes and to feel the things that they are feeling. This is illustrated by Bill Clinton’s famous quip “I feel your pain” and differs from sympathy or compassion in important ways. Here’s an example to help illustrate the difference between these concepts. Say your friend’s beloved pet dies and they are heartbroken as a consequence. Feeling your friend’s sadness is an example of Bloom’s empathy. On the other hand, if you were to comfort a child who fears there are monsters in the closet, you would not be experiencing the fear the child is feeling (since you presumably know that monsters don’t exist). This is therefore an example of compassion, and not empathy. So, how does empathy steer us wrong? Here’s one way … let’s say you witness a child receiving vaccination shots. The child screams and cries and later develops redness and swelling around the injection site and experiences obvious discomfort. You empathize so much with the child’s plight you crusade against childhood vaccinations vowing to end the suffering brought about by the shots. Unfortunately, this leads to a resurgence of polio that kills thousands and paralyzes tens of thousands as well as measles which kills tens of thousands and sickens millions. This is a morally reprehensible outcome brought about by an excess of empathy. Another way in which empathy steers us wrong is that it makes us care about those with whom we are close, but does a poor job in getting us to respond to the tragedies of strangers. As Adam Smith famously wrote (comparing the loss of someone’s pinky finger to a hypothetical earthquake in China that kills millions):If he was to lose his little finger to-morrow, he would not sleep to-night; but, provided he never saw them, he will snore with the most profound security over the ruin of a hundred millions of his brethren, and the destruction of that immense multitude seems plainly an object less interesting to him, than this paltry misfortune of his own.Instead, Bloom argues that rational compassion (a mixture of caring coupled with a detached cost-benefit analysis) provides a better moral compass for guiding our behavior, especially as it takes the broader consequences of ones actions into consideration. We can choose to be kind and act to alleviate the suffering of others without experiencing the misery of their condition. To which I can only respond … Meh. Is this even an interesting question? Obviously, the consequences of moral actions are meaningful. If I help an old lady cross a street only to steer her into the path of an oncoming bus … I probably shouldn’t expect that boy scout merit badge. Outcomes matter, but who thinks otherwise?Also, Bloom is forced to pepper the pages of his book with innumerable caveats which dilute his argument. Empathy can often be good, Bloom concedes. It can bring attention to a social needs and aid in charitable giving. Empathy also has many different definitions, to some it can mean kindness, to others … sympathy, all of which Bloom supports. Thus in order to make his argument cohesive Bloom first has to reduce it to a watery gruel. If I were to define ‘puppies’ as those things that crap on the rug and chew my shoes to shreds, then I’m against puppies! Bloom is similarly forced into a narrow definition of ‘empathy’ and as such must concede so much ground from the get-go one wonders why he felt this was an argument worth having. In reality what he is arguing against are over-emotional decisions that one arrives at through a knee jerk reaction. Of course if he were to have titled the book Against Over-Emotional Decisions Based Upon Knee Jerk Reactions it would have been greeted with a collective yawn. Let’s imagine for a moment that Bloom is correct on every point and in every particular, then what? Would we then set about a program of changing human nature so as to eliminate empathy from the human psyche? Of course not. Could we convince humanity to suddenly begin debating moral issues only in rational terms? The idea is laughable … as evidence I point to every comments section of every web page on the entire internet. Not only is this an uninteresting question, the ideas Bloom puts forth could be fully explored in a magazine article length treatment. In fact, you’ll find my full rebuttal of this point in an upcoming book Against Text Padding: The Case for Making a Concise Point. I’m going to publish it on a postage stamp."

I wish I’d read it with a highlighter. It challenged my preconceptions (a wonderful trait in books). It was humorous and engrossing. The writer was engaging, logical, and thorough in his research.

85,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5863458-andrea-mcdowell,2,"Imagine an entire book written critiquing empathy--written by a psychologist, no less--that doesn't once mention attachment theory or the importance of that close atunement by a caregiver during a child's formative years for psychological development. This will give you an idea of the considerable gaps in reasoning in this book that purports to demonstrate how importance reasoning (paired with compassion rather than empathy) is to proper moral decision making. A selection of other, similar gaps:p. 106: argument that it doesn't matter to a starving child if they are given food by a smiling face or if the food is dropped by a drone. Of course it matters. Raise your hand if you see no difference between birthday presents dropped off by drone rather than delivered by the smiling faces of your friends and family. People, particularly children, need to know that they are important and that they matter to people *as people*, and this is hardly communicated by a drone drop. The entire bit just before that about the kid who got a job on wall street so he could make large donations to the poor. While this is obviously an improvement over getting a job on wall street so you can buy a yacht, it does--contrary to Bloom's conclusion-without-support--makes things worse for the global poor. The investment machine that Wall Street powers is directly, intimately and daily linked to the actions of global companies who deprive people of land, food, and their lives. He can't possibly be ignorant of this; it smacks of cherry-picking.p. 107: He dismisses the claim that literature increases empathy, completely ignoring the scientific research that demonstrate that it does. p. 126: He argues that working on climate changes has nothing to do with empathy, as there are no identifiable Others with which to empathize. This book was written in America in 2016. At that time, California was experiencing the worst drought of its history, fueled by climate change. The Syrian refugee crisis, spurred in large part by a climate-change drought in the north of the country, was raging at that time. Both crises dominated the news with pictures of drowned toddlers, boats full of desperate people with nowhere to go, etc. No identifiable others? What planet was Bloom living on? I work in climate change. This is not a ""pale statistical abstraction"" for me, but is daily fueled by the impacts I know this is having on people, animals and landscapes. p. 154: Parenting. Here is where you would think attachment theory would make an appearance. Nope! Instead he makes a curious argument (repeated throughout the book) that empathy uniquely enslaves people and makes it impossible to consider how to respond using reason. I'll come back to this.p. 183-185: Psychopaths! Here, Bloom argues by aphorism. That is, he includes quotes by famous people asserting that a thing must be so, without providing evidence, and then concludes that indeed it is so. Eg. a quote from Steven Pinker about how crimes and violence committed in the name of morality ""would surely outnumber the fatalities from amoral conquest and predation,"" and accepts this statement as fact. Oh? Give us a statistic, Bloom. Give us some numbers with a source. You might think he'd have something to say here about the legendary lack of empathy in psychopaths. Nope!p. 232: IQ tests! ""A long time ago people said things like 'IQ tests just measure how good you are at doing IQ tests,' but nobody takes this seriously anymore."" (This in an argument about how IQ tests measure the potential for life success, as some kind of corollary argument for reason or reasoning ability--he never clarifies the connection he tries to draw here.) So I typed that phrase--IQ tests just measure how good you are at taking IQ tests--into google, and found this article from 2017 https://theconversation.com/the-iq-te... and this from 2014 https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/... . Seems like the conversation over the utility of IQ tests continues to rage on, Paul.Not to mention that describing IQ tests as good arbiters of reasoning ability, and claiming that no one questions this anymore, without discussing the differing results between different demographic groups and how completely obvious it is that privilege and material well-being factor into higher IQ scores--is racist and sexist. p. 234: ""I said that if you were curious about what sort of person a child would grow up to be, an intelligence test would be a great measure."" Fun! So, I was in a gifted program from grade 4-grade 13/OAC, said program based on the results of universally administered aptitude/IQ tests within the schools. Everyone I went to school with did extremely well on IQ tests, within the top 1-2 percentile.Yes, there are neurosurgeons and professors and lawyers within that group of people.There are also highschool and university drop-outs who have spent their entire adult lives bewailing how unfairly life has treated them because they are GENIUSES goddammit and they DESERVE better.So.Later on he talks about the importance of self-control and how well this was demonstrated in the infamous Marshmallow Test. Which has now been debunked as a measure of affluence rather than willpower. https://www.theatlantic.com/family/ar...p. 238: Here he talks about how good people are at reasoning in every day matters such as whether to buy a house or local politics such as zoning regulations. ""My own experience is that the level of rational discourse here is high,"" he says.Dear Lord. Apparently Paul Bloom, alone among North American adults, has never heard of NIMBYism. As an environmental professional now for a few decades, let me state categorically that the level of rational discourse in local political and planning matter is abysmal, and emotion plays an enormous role in the conclusions people draw. I used to work in wind energy and read a study at that time showing that people who claimed negative health impacts from a local wind farm were almost certain to be able to see it from a window in their house; didn't matter how far away it was or whether they could hear it or not. And keep in mind that Mr. Bloom wrote the sentences defending the rationality of everyday Americans in whether or not to purchase a house in 2016, a mere 8 years after the mortgage crisis.So this is a small collection of my ""Oh my god you have got to be kidding me"" moments from reading this book, but you might be wondering about the overall argument.I picked up the book on the strength of Kate Manne's mentioning of it in her book Down Girl, where she writes of his claim that empathy is ""biased and innumerate"": that is, that the empathy we feel reflects our own biases, and favours the one over the many. Manne then expands on this to discuss how empathy flows up the social hierarchy, and our society's tendency to, for example, express empathy towards perpetrators (""this allegation will destroy his career!"") over victims. That was the best part of Against Empathy, and having read it, you can probably skip the rest of the book. On the strength of it, I gave it two stars rather than one.But its weaknesses are many. A short list:1. The definition of empathy changes on every page to be whatever Bloom needs it to be in order to dismiss it. At the beginning of the book, empathy can be directed towards groups at a distance: he uses the example of the Sandy Hook massacre. At the end of the book, empathy can only be triggered in direct proximity to one or a small group of people who are directly emoting in your presence. At the beginning, again as with the Sandy Hook example, the empathy inspired isn't directly feeling exactly what the other person is feeling--he wouldn't and doesn't claim he feels the same rage and grief as the children's parents do--but at the end it is direct and exact mirroring, and only this mirroring, that counts as empathy. I could go on.2. Of course, any emotion or capacity joined to Reason is going to be superior to any emotion or capacity specifically entirely unconnected to Reason, so saying Compassion + Reason is a better guide to moral decision making than Empathy Alone is ... obvious. Let's experiment: Anger + Reason is better than Love Alone (think: people stalking the object of their romantic obsession, people using anger plus critical reasoning to advance social causes). Shame + Reason is better than Happiness Alone (research showing that the single-minded pursuit of happiness is linked with selfishness and moral deterioration; the capacity of reasoning one's way out of shame to restore social bonds and inspire moral improvement). Hate + Reason is better than Joy Alone (I have to admit that this is a tricky one, but I think a person who can reason about their hate can identify bridges that needed burning and separate themselves from destructive people and relationships much better than people who think any sign of hate is a moral failing; and Joy, if it comes at another's expense and is expressed without consideration of that fact, could be hurtful). We should simply assume and act as if all of our capacities are better when we can reason them through.3. He never explains why empathy is so impossible to reason through; he simply states that he himself can't do it, and then seems to assume that no one else can either. But of course empathy can join with Reason; an effective parent will do so as a matter of daily course. He brings up an example of how empathy would make a parent unable to subject their child to vaccinations because of the pain from the needle, but this is nonsense. Empathy simply makes it easier for the parent to understand and respond to the child's pain and confusion afterwards. Compassion wouldn't cut it.My daughter has a genetic syndrome that was only diagnosed when she was nearly 14. She had many, many tests beginning in infancy to try to diagnose it. I will never forget the first, when she was a tiny baby, about 5 lbs at the time, and it took me and two nurses to pin her down while they drew blood from her little arms. And I wept while she screamed, in her confusion and pain and fear. It did not stop me from getting her tested. It did provide a break of balancing the pain of any given test from the benefit of whatever knowledge we expected to gain from it, which is what happens when empathy is joined with reason.4. All feelings have a purpose. We are creatures who evolved, and we share these feelings with many of our non-human relatives; they have adaptive and survival value or they wouldn't exist. Any argument that tries to do away with any particular feeling must, I believe, acknowledge and understand the value that exists before a coherent and convincing argument can be made against it. This goes for the Dalai Lama's incessant harping against anger, Brene Brown's wholly unconvincing dismissal of shame, and it goes here for Paul Bloom's devaluation of empathy. 5. He repeatedly insists that the idea that people are incapable of truly reasoning is baseless, without providing any convincing argument against the vast evidence--never mentioned--that human reasoning ability is inextricably connected with emotion. That neurologically people are incapable of reaching conclusions without emotions. His argument reflects an unearned faith in the existence of One True Reasonable Conclusion for any argument; of course, there isn't one. This isn't, as he claims, a dismissal of Reason; it's an admission of its limitations and its inherent dependency on our emotional responses. We reason using thoughts and feelings, and any reasoned conclusions is partially dependent on feelings which must be admitted to and explored as part of a reasoned exploration. There are plenty of people out there who claim that there beliefs that the earth is flat, that climate change is a hoax, that vaccines cause autism, etc. are reasoned arguments based on evidence, which they clearly are not. His own book would have been better if he himself had done so.On page 10, Bloom lists his main influences for his argument against empathy and for reason:Richard DavidsonSam Harris (article about his assertion that black americans score lower on IQ tests because they are less intelligent here: https://www.vox.com/2018/4/9/17210248...)Jesse PrinzPeter Singer (disabled humans not persons; adult gorillas are persons; apparently supports the rights of parents to kill their disabled children? http://web.archive.org/web/2017030700...)Michael LynchMichael Shermer (multiple accusations of sexual assault: https://www.buzzfeed.com/markoppenhei...)Hrm. What kinds of conclusions do you think a person is going to reach with influences like these?Let's ignore the fact that they are all white, able-bodied, male, and with the exception of one, straight.Let's consider that this list is 50% known unrepentant asshole.Essentially, Paul Bloom sets up a straw man of unconstrained empathy without the benefit of any reasoning counterbalance and spends about 240 pages pummeling it with half-facts and anecdotes.

 you agree that empathy is bad , you are left with nothing , just feeling bad about having a normal human emotion, and not knowing what to do about it.my second issue that I have with the book is the writing style. the book is written in a sort of a discussion like style , first arguing for one side then after that saying how one would counter that argument . And while acknowledging criticism and counter arguments is way better than stating your side of the argument as facts, it is done here in a really bad way that left me more often than not confused rather than informed. And if that was not enough already , the author tend to go off tracks A LOT either with unnecessary examples or with topics that seem unrelated to the main topic at hand. Here is an illustration how Paul Bloom presents his ideas I can't deny that he did have a point on the limitation of empathy , that it is like a spotlight , it is narrow and it can lead to hasty decisions that have unwanted consequences, and it may not be the emotion that can save humanity from evil( if you are someone who thinks this way than maybe this book has a lot to offer you). But that wasn't enough to convince me to have a similar opinion like the author and be ""Against empathy"". for me the only takeaway from this book was that we shouldn't act based strictly on emotions (empathy or other emotions like anger ) and that we should try to be as rational as possible before making any decisions."

It causes us to overvalue the proximate and undervalue the distant (he didn't bring this up, but that's also a reason people don't buy enough insurance, or eat healthy). Empathy screws up how we spend our ""charity dollars,"" how we react to wrongs, how we prioritize the use of scarce resources, and more. Bloom is not against compassion, mind you; he is against empathy as frequently defined as ""feeling yourself what you imagine others must be feeling."" Lots of studies have shown that when you get the studies' subjects to feel empathetically toward others, their rationality immediately goes down the tube. Heck, get them to feel empathy toward someone being mistreated, and then ask him how they would punish an unrelated wrong, and their proposed punishments get much harsher.This is Bloom's main argument. He makes it well near the beginning of the book, but kind of rambles and wanders the rest of the way. He talks about brain waves. He talks about how conservatives aren't actually less empathetic than liberals. He tries to talk about how empathy affects intimate relationships but never really gets there. He defends rationality when it comes to morality (I found this to be quite insightful, and important, but he doesn't connect it well to the rest of the book). And, though he is careful to define empathy precisely, he doesn't always hold himself to that definition when critiquing it.So I docked him a few stars. He also obviously doesn't know how to deal with religion. He mentions it in passing, although I would argue it affects profoundly the arguments he is trying to make. (It might even help his case. I would argue, for example, that the Biblical faith is all for rational morality. I would also argue that it would warn us against taking empathy too far, but it might not be as pessimistic as is Bloom.)So an interesting read, especially if you're trying to make better decisions (or feel better about yourself for not being very empathetic)."

I guess it's a good book if you're new to the notion of affective empathy not being that good. But we autistic activists have been familiar with the notion for decades. You'll find so many good blog posts and tumblr or twitter rants on the subject matter from people in the neurodivergent political sphere. It will be better than this book. You'll have more answers. You'll read them and hopefully you'll be better towards people who don't use their empathy.I thought the book would be autistic friendly. I thought it would also tackle the idea that cognitive empathy is mandatory to have a right to exist. I thought it would talk about how cognitive empathy is relative, how autistic and allistic people have trouble standing in each other's shoes, but how cognitive empathy is useless if you know how to LISTEN and if you're willing to be a kind, moral person once you've listened enough. It didn't. In fact, I had trouble going on once I read that you can't be a good person with a good moral compass if you don't ""have"" cognitive empathy.

I'm deeply disappointed by the book, and I won't read this author again.Now, it's probably a good introduction if you know nothing about empathy. It challenges your views and tackles several misconceptions. I'd recommend you read it if you think the problem with empathy is we don't have enough of it. Still, chapter one is basically a repeat of the prologue, and the ideas are repeated over and over, there is a Q/A section that I thought was very out of place... And once you've been convinced that you don't need to empathize to make good moral decisions and/or be a compassionate and kind person, it pretty much stops being interesting.

The author is against emotional empathy. Emotional empathy let us to feel what other people feels, mirror people's feeling, which could be so distraught to paralyze us to take effective action and narrow focus of bias could make us to make unwise actions. Cognitive empathy make us understand other people's feeling without experiencing it, lead us positive compassion, kindness , reasoning, more effective way to help people.Statistical data and reasoning seem always cold, hard to stir people to act, and ever worse when data and reasoning against our intuition and our bias, like ""identifiable victim effect"".

Author's own conclusion---1. Our moral decisions and actions are powerfully shaped by the force of empathy.---2. This often make the world worse.---3. We have the capacity to do better.2. Cognitive empathy is morally neutral. cognitive empathy: understand you feel, but do not feel it. It is positive compassion, kindness. The understanding and feeling are different neuron processing, you can understand it without feeling it, that is cognitive empathy. We are much better to use reasons, cost-benefit, compassion, kindness to make decisions, give intelligently, with eye towards consequence. Depersonalize the process and circumvent our natural preference and bias, with compassion for others, rational-making taking happiness and suffering into account. Reduce our candidates to X, Y, Z, designing procedure such as blind reviewing and blind auditions. Bring everyone down rather than bring everyone up. Don't try to make them (strangers) more weight. Rather, make yourself less weight. Bring everyone to the same level by diminish yourself. Put yourself, and those you love, on the level of strangers. p138 Buddhist texts distinguish ""sentimental compassion"", which corresponds to what we could call empathy and ""great compassion"", which is what we would simply called compassion. The first is to be avoid, as it exhausts the bodhisattva. It's the second that is worth pursing. Great compssion is more distanced and reserved, and can be sustained indefinitely.... In contrast to (emotional) empathy, compassion does not means sharing the suffering of others: rather, it is characterized by feeling of warmth, concern and care for other, as well as a strong motivation to improve the other's well-being. Compassion is feeling for and not feeling with the other. p139 There is a neural difference: Empathy training led to increased activation in the insula and anterior cingulate cortes. Compassion training led to activation in other parts of the brain, such as the medical orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum.p141 Mindful meditation reduces activation of the brain networks associated with simulating the feeling of people in distress, in favour of networks associated with feelings of social affiliation. Buddhist scholar Thupten Jinpa: ""Meditation-based training enables practitioners to move quickly from feeling the distress of others to acting with compassion to alleviated it.""... Not only can compassion and kindness exist independently of empathy, they are sometime opposed . Sometimes, we are better people if we suppress our empathic feeling. p145 My friend (psychologist) does get into her clients' heads, she would be useless if she couldn't - but she doesn't feel what they fee. She employs understanding and caring, not empathy.p149 There is a world difference, between understanding the misery of the person who is talking to you because you have felt misery in the past, even though now you are calm, and understanding the misery of the person who is talking to you because  you are mirroring them and feeling their misery right now. The first, which doesn't involve empathy in any sense, just understanding, has all advantages of the second and none of its cost.p154 My worst moments as a father aren't when I don't care, they're when I care too much, when I cannot disengage from my children's frustration and pain.  --my comment: so true for me.Against Fairness by Stephen T.

The act of feeling what you believe other people feel - experience what they experience. The act of coming to experience the world as you think someone else does, also called sympathy by philosophers Adam Smith and David Humep17 As Adam Smith put it, we have capacity to think about another person and ""place ourselves in his situation.... and become in some measure the same person with him, and thence form some idea of his sensations, and even feel something which, though weaker in degree, is not altogether unlike him."" This is emotional empathy, feel what you feel.Emotional Empathy is biased and parochial; it is spotlight (metaphor, narrow focus, only light up the area you focus, ignore surrounding) , it focus on certain people at the expense of others; it is innumerate (we often pay too much attention to one person, ignore too many suffering), it is not in the direction of increase of justice, so it distort our moral and policy decision in ways cause suffering instead of relieving it.

102,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1216728-sophia,4,"In most respects, this is a really good book; it's the author defending a specific, at first glance controversial, idea and backing it up with science, history and reason. It’s very accessible, a decent length, including arguments and counter arguments and counter counter arguments. Anyone interested in morality should give it a read. Bloom essentially argues that the human tendency of literally feeling what someone else is feeling, “emotional empathy”, is detrimental to individuals and society as a whole, for 3 main reasons: it’s more often paralyzing than motivating, it’s unnecessarily painful, and it is inescapably limited in scope. Instead, all of what’s good about people can be attributed to compassion; caring without feeling the same thing.The idea I agreed with the most was that empathy is a problem because it is limited in scope, meaning the human mind can only handle feeling empathy for a limited number of individuals at a time, and invariably those individuals are “ranked” by closeness (family, friends, neighbours, other). This makes it a cousin of racism in a weird sense; by shining a spotlight on just your people, you can so ignore everyone else that you don’t notice the harm you cause. So in war, it’s not so much a lack of empathy for the enemy (which on it’s own would just lead to apathy) but an excess of empathy towards your own group, or any other group which moves you to do something, blind to anyone else. While it would be nice to extend empathy to the enemy, that’s just not how our brains were wired. Along the same lines, I personally appreciated the change in perspective from thinking of empathy as the source of morality to just a manifestation of it. A couple months ago, I went through a mini crisis where I had to stop reading the news, because I realized behind every death toll number were actual people, who were terrified for their lives, and then had that snuffed out; and there was just so much death and pain, but I didn’t want to stop feeling this connection, because I worried that would be callous, denying reality. The idea that empathy is just not the tool for the job helps a lot; instead it’s better that I feel compassion, a detached awareness of a problem, followed by an evaluation of whether I can do anything to help; not so I would feel better, but just to help. If empathy was causing me to turn off the news so that I would feel less pain, then clearly it was a problem not a solution.The idea that compassion not only can but should replace empathy was a little harder to swallow, but the more I think about it, the more I agree. I started trying to find an example to prove this wrong, and an easy one popped up on tv: spring breakers continuing to gather despite the coronavirus lockdown. At first glance, it seems that these millennials (eye roll) were not feeling any empathy for the elderly and the sick at risk, and if they had, they would have stayed home. While this is true, it would actually be enough for them just to feel compassion, and in hindsight, that’s what jumpstarted me into proper self-isolation; in the early days, I saw the numbers, and realized with the 14 day incubation period there was no other way to stop this, so I stayed home, before even the Italian death toll hit 1000. Only later did I come across the personal stories of some of the victims, making me want to curl up in a ball and cry; but while that technically would also keep me at home, compassion left me the presence of mind to plan how to avoid trips outside, contact my relatives to provide helpful information, and avoid hoarding toilet paper. In a similar vein, there’s currently the debate about whether the economy is “worth” the lives of the elderly and infirm. Anyone arguing using empathy would be horrified at the idea that the economy should factor into such a decision, but actually if the economy collapses, so too will future healthcare and medical research, leading possibly to even more deaths, not to mention suffering from just lower quality of life. Now, is the economy really going to collapse? Maybe not, but its not going to be empathy, but rational, albeit compassionate, analysis that will find the answer. Like with this, most other legal and political decisions would benefit from taking a step back from empathy, and just dealing with compassion; the alternative results in one-sided views that devolves into entrenched partisanship, as we currently see.On the topic of news, Bloom actually missed a golden opportunity to criticize the media for it’s practice of starting almost every article with some first-name basis narrative about some victim; as if the reader couldn’t be brought to care unless there was a soul behind each tragedy. It always really bothered me to read this; on the one hand because it gave me pain when all I wanted was information, on the other hand because it glaringly defied the objectivity I would hope for in the news. Bloom brings up the case of how you can just as easily empathize with poor young black Americans afraid for their lives, or with self-sacrificing police officers, trying to help their city but afraid for their lives; yet oh so rarely can people do both. But we shouldn’t try; and the news should stop trying to get that to happen. Instead, we should just be presented with cold hard facts that help with better decision making on how much power and trianing to give police and what kind of reform programs work.The main problem with this book is I think Bloom gives too much “credit” to empathy, and disregards other forms of “emotional decision making” behind many of the problems he attributes to empathy. War in particular he argues comes down to one side feeling empathy for some victim, and taking up arms to fight against the aggressor. But actually empathy, as he writes elsewhere, is often paralyzing, especially when the emotion involved is fear and trauma; instead seeing this in others often provokes anger instead, and it is this that leads people to war. So just like he claims mainstream definition of empathy is jut “everything good and nice about people”, he tends to attribute every non-selfish emotional action to empathy. If instead of being “against empathy” he had more accurately stated his position as “against emotional decision making” I think he would reveal himself as being far less controversial than his title suggests (nor as original).Also, an important omission from his thesis is whether it is even possible to have compassion without empathy; he argues for us to make decisions like this, which is fine, but can you as a human develop a sense of compassion, for anyone, without first feeling empathy? Bloom repeatedly hints that you can, but while he talks about individuals without both empathy and compassion (psychopaths), he doesn’t mention a class of people without empathy but with compassion. Well actually, he does mention Buddhist monks, but they learn this state of enlightenment, they're not naturally endowed with it. He also claims children have instincts of compassion without showing corresponding empathy, but the child’s version of compassion is not particularly useful. The story he gives is of a toddler, who has learned that showing off his belly makes adults smile. One day his older brother gets hurt, and in an attempt to make his brother feel better, he shows him his belly. While clearly the “theory of mind” that his brother was hurting was there, and the instinct to try and help as well, but the chosen solution was not particularly helpful. Instead, being able to feel empathy, as in imagine also being hurt, would allow for a more appropriate response. So ultimately, I still suspect Bloom is wrong about empathy, even by his narrow definition, being only an impediment. My intuitive theory would be that empathy is a necessary tool for learning not only what could hurt us, but also what could make us feel better and as a consequence could help others feel better. If you have a friend who just had a tough breakup, and you yourself have never even dated, compassion may not even be enough to realize why the situation is painful, and therefore what you as a friend could do to help. Yes, in the grand scheme of things, its better for the friend to have broken off from a bad relationship, but that is not the consolation that’s going to help right in that moment. If the situation were reversed, I think it would be nice to have a compassionate friend, but I would really want an empathic best friend. In conclusion, in the grand scheme of decision making, empathy can be as detrimental as racism, focusing a spotlight only on a small group for not objective reasons. But I don’t think deep interpersonal relationships would be possible without it. "
103,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2896545-meg,2,"The basic argument here is one that I can certainly get behind: We should strive for more cognitive empathy, but less emotional empathy. Our decisions and policies should be driven primarily by rational evaluation of how we can do the most good with our resources, rather than exhausting our resources through the avenues that tug most on our heartstrings.I had a few major problems, though, too. In the end, Paul Bloom and I fundamentally disagree in our worldviews. This manifested in three particular ways throughout the book:1) As a white, straight, male, affluent, American Yale professor, Bloom writes from a place of EXTREME privilege...and he makes virtually no effort to even acknowledge this, let alone compensate for it. Many of his points were weakened for me by the fact that they wouldn't hold up if the privilege was removed.2) Bloom is, by his own admission, not a sincere advocate of making personal sacrifices for the common good. He writes, ""I could never take seriously people who refuse to take long flights to see those they love because of worries about contributing to climate change. Or even those who put their children into a public school that they know to be terrible even though they can easily afford a private school, just out of a broader principle of common good. Even when it comes to charity, I am not a good utilitarian."" As a Gryffindor and a 1 on the Enneagram, this is not just foreign to me, it's repulsive.3) I couldn't get past the feeling that a lot of this book was written out of semantic quibbling between the scholarly elite. The sensationalist title soon gave way to a core position that, while it made sense, was less revolutionary than one might expect.All in all, I'm still grateful to this book. The fact that I disagreed with certain points and favored others was a helpful exercise in critical reading. I was motivated to think deeply while reading and came out with a much more nuanced understanding of empathy and my associated beliefs. I'm not at all suggesting that others shouldn't read this book -- but if you do read it, just make sure you do so through a critical lens."
104,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46716546-weronika,2,"It might be a three stars book, but I vowed to subtract a star for any book that quotes the marshmallow study results (the book quotes the marshmallow study results!!!). It is, in fact, a poorly organised sequence of paragraphs commenting on a variety of studies that could be loosely linked with or interpreted in the context of empathy. Mixed into that is some useful literature (Adam Smith, of all people!) and some colourful, though somewhat clichéd examples from history (Abe Lincoln saving piglets!). The argument is not without merit -- empathy, rather than a force for good, is a force for tribalism. We feel more for people like us. When a victim is like us, and the perpetrator is unlike us, we feel disproportionately more for the victim. If the victim is unlike us, but the perpetrator belongs to our tribe, we tend to dismiss the victim and feel for the perpetrator. Empathy is also number-blind; we care for one, but not for hundreds. Empathy stirs injustice -- in studies quoted in the book, people would move kids up the treatment lists disregarding other children, just because they knew that one kid and did not know the rest of them. And of course there are the Nazis, there is Hitler. The author is also right to add (after Smith) that empathy only makes us sympathize with those who feel bad. Empathetic people do not experience joy and happiness when others experience happiness or achieve success. They envy them. The capacity for ""positive"" empathy is limited to ""small joys"" in life. And so, Bloom claims, we should rather focus on compassion, sort of Buddhist-style. And the argument seems to be valid, it's just the book that is bad."

Empathy is defined as ""the act of coming to experience the world as you think someone else does,"" and it does not refer to compassion or understanding but rather emotional assumptions which are devoid of reason. At first, the work felt like a reprimand over semantics since most of society would define empathy as an appeal to understanding through dialogue. But once Bloom distinguishes empathy from deliberative reasoning and cognitive empathy, his denigration of this practice unveils empathy's limitations and dangers. Logic and reason should be given precedence in order to capacitate self-control, intelligence, and balanced compassion for the future.Bloom's writing is unexpectedly humorous with tongue-in-cheek making this an entertaining read. Unfortunately, he frames every idea precisely with plenty of caveats that almost negate many of his statements. He seems to expect, and tries to prevent, critique of his findings which results in long-winded lines of dialogue that end up saying very little with each point. This round-about quantifying of ideas suggests that his thesis is not as shocking or profound as he may have wished it to be. However, the examples he offers illustrate his view and prove that empathy is not the cure all for humanities problems, and the perception that empathy is a superior trait is certainly called into question. Morality is motivating but ambiguous, and it is far more important to practice reason and emotional intelligence in the pursuit of a better future."

I think he makes some compelling arguments, the most convincing of which was that his narrowly-defined version of empathy serves as a tool to prioritize a single person over thousands or millions of people, which can be used for both good AND for bad - it's apolitical and amoral (i.e. how empathy for orphans in latin american countries causes more harm than good w/ white savior volunteering trips, unsustainable orphanage businesses, and fake orphans as a ""tourist trap""). he is a little insensitive about certain topics at times, and also denies his white privilege on one occasion, which was interesting. ultimately I think his final thesis is pretty reasonable, it is just not an amazingly well written book."

I believe the landscape that the author described in the book about the rational society is a myth. We Homo sapiens are not rational civil intellectuals, rather empathetic animals. And we currently have been evolving for 350,000 years. I estimate that, sure, we are heading to a more and more rational civilization, but 350,000 years is still too short for an advanced developed civilization. We are, after all, an average species on an average planet. But why against compassion. We are actually doing really great under this ""not-quite-rational-but-very-compassionate"" world.No matter how the society evolves, the compassionate ones always have comparative advantage in survival.

I think it is a great essay that was diluted into book. On several occasions I found myself skimming through some sections which instead of reinforcing (or repeating) an idea or argument were actually straying off the path. For this reason I even contemplated giving it 3 stars before settling to 4. In the end, I settled for 4 stars. I didn't do it out of empathy for the effort the author put in it, but for the great content.

110,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,2,"The death of one man is a tragedy, the death of millions is a statistic.-	Joseph StalinAgainst Empathy? Who could be against empathy? You might as well say you’re against puppies!Against Empathy: The Case for Rational Compassion has a provocative title (deliberately so, for $ales purposes no doubt), but the claim Paul Bloom (Professor of psychology and cognitive science at Yale University) is making is substantially more banal. Bloom claims that, while empathy can serve as a spotlight, focusing attention on issues of importance, it more often than not leads to morally incorrect conclusions. Instead, he argues that ‘rational compassion’ serves as a better guide for determining our correct moral course of action. Before getting into details we first need to define what Bloom means by ‘empathy’. Bloom considers empathy to be the ability to put oneself in another’s shoes and to feel the things that they are feeling. This is illustrated by Bill Clinton’s famous quip “I feel your pain” and differs from sympathy or compassion in important ways. Here’s an example to help illustrate the difference between these concepts. Say your friend’s beloved pet dies and they are heartbroken as a consequence. Feeling your friend’s sadness is an example of Bloom’s empathy. On the other hand, if you were to comfort a child who fears there are monsters in the closet, you would not be experiencing the fear the child is feeling (since you presumably know that monsters don’t exist). This is therefore an example of compassion, and not empathy. So, how does empathy steer us wrong? Here’s one way … let’s say you witness a child receiving vaccination shots. The child screams and cries and later develops redness and swelling around the injection site and experiences obvious discomfort. You empathize so much with the child’s plight you crusade against childhood vaccinations vowing to end the suffering brought about by the shots. Unfortunately, this leads to a resurgence of polio that kills thousands and paralyzes tens of thousands as well as measles which kills tens of thousands and sickens millions. This is a morally reprehensible outcome brought about by an excess of empathy. Another way in which empathy steers us wrong is that it makes us care about those with whom we are close, but does a poor job in getting us to respond to the tragedies of strangers. As Adam Smith famously wrote (comparing the loss of someone’s pinky finger to a hypothetical earthquake in China that kills millions):If he was to lose his little finger to-morrow, he would not sleep to-night; but, provided he never saw them, he will snore with the most profound security over the ruin of a hundred millions of his brethren, and the destruction of that immense multitude seems plainly an object less interesting to him, than this paltry misfortune of his own.Instead, Bloom argues that rational compassion (a mixture of caring coupled with a detached cost-benefit analysis) provides a better moral compass for guiding our behavior, especially as it takes the broader consequences of ones actions into consideration. We can choose to be kind and act to alleviate the suffering of others without experiencing the misery of their condition. To which I can only respond … Meh. Is this even an interesting question? Obviously, the consequences of moral actions are meaningful. If I help an old lady cross a street only to steer her into the path of an oncoming bus … I probably shouldn’t expect that boy scout merit badge. Outcomes matter, but who thinks otherwise?Also, Bloom is forced to pepper the pages of his book with innumerable caveats which dilute his argument. Empathy can often be good, Bloom concedes. It can bring attention to a social needs and aid in charitable giving. Empathy also has many different definitions, to some it can mean kindness, to others … sympathy, all of which Bloom supports. Thus in order to make his argument cohesive Bloom first has to reduce it to a watery gruel. If I were to define ‘puppies’ as those things that crap on the rug and chew my shoes to shreds, then I’m against puppies! Bloom is similarly forced into a narrow definition of ‘empathy’ and as such must concede so much ground from the get-go one wonders why he felt this was an argument worth having. In reality what he is arguing against are over-emotional decisions that one arrives at through a knee jerk reaction. Of course if he were to have titled the book Against Over-Emotional Decisions Based Upon Knee Jerk Reactions it would have been greeted with a collective yawn. Let’s imagine for a moment that Bloom is correct on every point and in every particular, then what? Would we then set about a program of changing human nature so as to eliminate empathy from the human psyche? Of course not. Could we convince humanity to suddenly begin debating moral issues only in rational terms? The idea is laughable … as evidence I point to every comments section of every web page on the entire internet. Not only is this an uninteresting question, the ideas Bloom puts forth could be fully explored in a magazine article length treatment. In fact, you’ll find my full rebuttal of this point in an upcoming book Against Text Padding: The Case for Making a Concise Point. I’m going to publish it on a postage stamp."

I wish I’d read it with a highlighter. It challenged my preconceptions (a wonderful trait in books). It was humorous and engrossing. The writer was engaging, logical, and thorough in his research. He quoted philosophers who agreed with him and those who didn’t, always explaining why he believes as he does.WHAT I DIDN’T LIKE: I wish the book had been longer and even more in depth."
115,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5863458-andrea-mcdowell,2,"Imagine an entire book written critiquing empathy--written by a psychologist, no less--that doesn't once mention attachment theory or the importance of that close atunement by a caregiver during a child's formative years for psychological development. This will give you an idea of the considerable gaps in reasoning in this book that purports to demonstrate how importance reasoning (paired with compassion rather than empathy) is to proper moral decision making. A selection of other, similar gaps:p. 106: argument that it doesn't matter to a starving child if they are given food by a smiling face or if the food is dropped by a drone. Of course it matters. Raise your hand if you see no difference between birthday presents dropped off by drone rather than delivered by the smiling faces of your friends and family. People, particularly children, need to know that they are important and that they matter to people *as people*, and this is hardly communicated by a drone drop. The entire bit just before that about the kid who got a job on wall street so he could make large donations to the poor. While this is obviously an improvement over getting a job on wall street so you can buy a yacht, it does--contrary to Bloom's conclusion-without-support--makes things worse for the global poor. The investment machine that Wall Street powers is directly, intimately and daily linked to the actions of global companies who deprive people of land, food, and their lives. He can't possibly be ignorant of this; it smacks of cherry-picking.p. 107: He dismisses the claim that literature increases empathy, completely ignoring the scientific research that demonstrate that it does. p. 126: He argues that working on climate changes has nothing to do with empathy, as there are no identifiable Others with which to empathize. This book was written in America in 2016. At that time, California was experiencing the worst drought of its history, fueled by climate change. The Syrian refugee crisis, spurred in large part by a climate-change drought in the north of the country, was raging at that time. Both crises dominated the news with pictures of drowned toddlers, boats full of desperate people with nowhere to go, etc. No identifiable others? What planet was Bloom living on? I work in climate change. This is not a ""pale statistical abstraction"" for me, but is daily fueled by the impacts I know this is having on people, animals and landscapes. p. 154: Parenting. Here is where you would think attachment theory would make an appearance. Nope! Instead he makes a curious argument (repeated throughout the book) that empathy uniquely enslaves people and makes it impossible to consider how to respond using reason. I'll come back to this.p. 183-185: Psychopaths! Here, Bloom argues by aphorism. That is, he includes quotes by famous people asserting that a thing must be so, without providing evidence, and then concludes that indeed it is so. Eg. a quote from Steven Pinker about how crimes and violence committed in the name of morality ""would surely outnumber the fatalities from amoral conquest and predation,"" and accepts this statement as fact. Oh? Give us a statistic, Bloom. Give us some numbers with a source. You might think he'd have something to say here about the legendary lack of empathy in psychopaths. Nope!p. 232: IQ tests! ""A long time ago people said things like 'IQ tests just measure how good you are at doing IQ tests,' but nobody takes this seriously anymore."" (This in an argument about how IQ tests measure the potential for life success, as some kind of corollary argument for reason or reasoning ability--he never clarifies the connection he tries to draw here.) So I typed that phrase--IQ tests just measure how good you are at taking IQ tests--into google, and found this article from 2017 https://theconversation.com/the-iq-te... and this from 2014 https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/... . Seems like the conversation over the utility of IQ tests continues to rage on, Paul.Not to mention that describing IQ tests as good arbiters of reasoning ability, and claiming that no one questions this anymore, without discussing the differing results between different demographic groups and how completely obvious it is that privilege and material well-being factor into higher IQ scores--is racist and sexist. p. 234: ""I said that if you were curious about what sort of person a child would grow up to be, an intelligence test would be a great measure."" Fun! So, I was in a gifted program from grade 4-grade 13/OAC, said program based on the results of universally administered aptitude/IQ tests within the schools. Everyone I went to school with did extremely well on IQ tests, within the top 1-2 percentile.Yes, there are neurosurgeons and professors and lawyers within that group of people.There are also highschool and university drop-outs who have spent their entire adult lives bewailing how unfairly life has treated them because they are GENIUSES goddammit and they DESERVE better.So.Later on he talks about the importance of self-control and how well this was demonstrated in the infamous Marshmallow Test. Which has now been debunked as a measure of affluence rather than willpower. https://www.theatlantic.com/family/ar...p. 238: Here he talks about how good people are at reasoning in every day matters such as whether to buy a house or local politics such as zoning regulations. ""My own experience is that the level of rational discourse here is high,"" he says.Dear Lord. Apparently Paul Bloom, alone among North American adults, has never heard of NIMBYism. As an environmental professional now for a few decades, let me state categorically that the level of rational discourse in local political and planning matter is abysmal, and emotion plays an enormous role in the conclusions people draw. I used to work in wind energy and read a study at that time showing that people who claimed negative health impacts from a local wind farm were almost certain to be able to see it from a window in their house; didn't matter how far away it was or whether they could hear it or not. And keep in mind that Mr. Bloom wrote the sentences defending the rationality of everyday Americans in whether or not to purchase a house in 2016, a mere 8 years after the mortgage crisis.So this is a small collection of my ""Oh my god you have got to be kidding me"" moments from reading this book, but you might be wondering about the overall argument.I picked up the book on the strength of Kate Manne's mentioning of it in her book Down Girl, where she writes of his claim that empathy is ""biased and innumerate"": that is, that the empathy we feel reflects our own biases, and favours the one over the many. Manne then expands on this to discuss how empathy flows up the social hierarchy, and our society's tendency to, for example, express empathy towards perpetrators (""this allegation will destroy his career!"") over victims. That was the best part of Against Empathy, and having read it, you can probably skip the rest of the book. On the strength of it, I gave it two stars rather than one.But its weaknesses are many. A short list:1. The definition of empathy changes on every page to be whatever Bloom needs it to be in order to dismiss it. At the beginning of the book, empathy can be directed towards groups at a distance: he uses the example of the Sandy Hook massacre. At the end of the book, empathy can only be triggered in direct proximity to one or a small group of people who are directly emoting in your presence. At the beginning, again as with the Sandy Hook example, the empathy inspired isn't directly feeling exactly what the other person is feeling--he wouldn't and doesn't claim he feels the same rage and grief as the children's parents do--but at the end it is direct and exact mirroring, and only this mirroring, that counts as empathy. I could go on.2. Of course, any emotion or capacity joined to Reason is going to be superior to any emotion or capacity specifically entirely unconnected to Reason, so saying Compassion + Reason is a better guide to moral decision making than Empathy Alone is ... obvious. Let's experiment: Anger + Reason is better than Love Alone (think: people stalking the object of their romantic obsession, people using anger plus critical reasoning to advance social causes). Shame + Reason is better than Happiness Alone (research showing that the single-minded pursuit of happiness is linked with selfishness and moral deterioration; the capacity of reasoning one's way out of shame to restore social bonds and inspire moral improvement). Hate + Reason is better than Joy Alone (I have to admit that this is a tricky one, but I think a person who can reason about their hate can identify bridges that needed burning and separate themselves from destructive people and relationships much better than people who think any sign of hate is a moral failing; and Joy, if it comes at another's expense and is expressed without consideration of that fact, could be hurtful). We should simply assume and act as if all of our capacities are better when we can reason them through.3. He never explains why empathy is so impossible to reason through; he simply states that he himself can't do it, and then seems to assume that no one else can either. But of course empathy can join with Reason; an effective parent will do so as a matter of daily course. He brings up an example of how empathy would make a parent unable to subject their child to vaccinations because of the pain from the needle, but this is nonsense. Empathy simply makes it easier for the parent to understand and respond to the child's pain and confusion afterwards. Compassion wouldn't cut it.My daughter has a genetic syndrome that was only diagnosed when she was nearly 14. She had many, many tests beginning in infancy to try to diagnose it. I will never forget the first, when she was a tiny baby, about 5 lbs at the time, and it took me and two nurses to pin her down while they drew blood from her little arms. And I wept while she screamed, in her confusion and pain and fear. It did not stop me from getting her tested. It did provide a break of balancing the pain of any given test from the benefit of whatever knowledge we expected to gain from it, which is what happens when empathy is joined with reason.4. All feelings have a purpose. We are creatures who evolved, and we share these feelings with many of our non-human relatives; they have adaptive and survival value or they wouldn't exist. Any argument that tries to do away with any particular feeling must, I believe, acknowledge and understand the value that exists before a coherent and convincing argument can be made against it. This goes for the Dalai Lama's incessant harping against anger, Brene Brown's wholly unconvincing dismissal of shame, and it goes here for Paul Bloom's devaluation of empathy. 5. He repeatedly insists that the idea that people are incapable of truly reasoning is baseless, without providing any convincing argument against the vast evidence--never mentioned--that human reasoning ability is inextricably connected with emotion. That neurologically people are incapable of reaching conclusions without emotions. His argument reflects an unearned faith in the existence of One True Reasonable Conclusion for any argument; of course, there isn't one. This isn't, as he claims, a dismissal of Reason; it's an admission of its limitations and its inherent dependency on our emotional responses. We reason using thoughts and feelings, and any reasoned conclusions is partially dependent on feelings which must be admitted to and explored as part of a reasoned exploration. There are plenty of people out there who claim that there beliefs that the earth is flat, that climate change is a hoax, that vaccines cause autism, etc. are reasoned arguments based on evidence, which they clearly are not. His own book would have been better if he himself had done so.On page 10, Bloom lists his main influences for his argument against empathy and for reason:Richard DavidsonSam Harris (article about his assertion that black americans score lower on IQ tests because they are less intelligent here: https://www.vox.com/2018/4/9/17210248...)Jesse PrinzPeter Singer (disabled humans not persons; adult gorillas are persons; apparently supports the rights of parents to kill their disabled children? http://web.archive.org/web/2017030700...)Michael LynchMichael Shermer (multiple accusations of sexual assault: https://www.buzzfeed.com/markoppenhei...)Hrm. What kinds of conclusions do you think a person is going to reach with influences like these?Let's ignore the fact that they are all white, able-bodied, male, and with the exception of one, straight.Let's consider that this list is 50% known unrepentant asshole.Essentially, Paul Bloom sets up a straw man of unconstrained empathy without the benefit of any reasoning counterbalance and spends about 240 pages pummeling it with half-facts and anecdotes.

The title of this book consists of two parts, the ""against empathy"" part and the ""rational compassion"" part. I expected the author to go into each aspect in depth , arguing at first why empathy is a bad thing, then proposing the replacement and explaining how we can use the replacement to avoid the negative consequences of empathy.And here lies my main issue with this book, the author dedicates 5 chapters out of 6 to the arguments against empathy. and while that is already an unbalanced ratio for both arguments, I felt the last chapter was wasted on arguing if human beings are actually rational or not rather than explaining how being rational is the solution to the problems of empathy. so after finishing the book even 
if
 you agree that empathy is bad , you are left with nothing , just feeling bad about having a normal human emotion, and not knowing what to do about it.my second issue that I have with the book is the writing style. the book is written in a sort of a discussion like style , first arguing for one side then after that saying how one would counter that argument . And while acknowledging criticism and counter arguments is way better than stating your side of the argument as facts, it is done here in a really bad way that left me more often than not confused rather than informed. And if that was not enough already , the author tend to go off tracks A LOT either with unnecessary examples or with topics that seem unrelated to the main topic at hand. Here is an illustration how Paul Bloom presents his ideas I can't deny that he did have a point on the limitation of empathy , that it is like a spotlight , it is narrow and it can lead to hasty decisions that have unwanted consequences, and it may not be the emotion that can save humanity from evil( if you are someone who thinks this way than maybe this book has a lot to offer you). But that wasn't enough to convince me to have a similar opinion like the author and be ""Against empathy"". for me the only takeaway from this book was that we shouldn't act based strictly on emotions (empathy or other emotions like anger ) and that we should try to be as rational as possible before making any decisions."
118,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28727983-e,3,"Empathy is a poor way to make decisions, mostly because it inhibits rationality. It causes us to overvalue the proximate and undervalue the distant (he didn't bring this up, but that's also a reason people don't buy enough insurance, or eat healthy). Empathy screws up how we spend our ""charity dollars,"" how we react to wrongs, how we prioritize the use of scarce resources, and more. Bloom is not against compassion, mind you; he is against empathy as frequently defined as ""feeling yourself what you imagine others must be feeling."" Lots of studies have shown that when you get the studies' subjects to feel empathetically toward others, their rationality immediately goes down the tube. Heck, get them to feel empathy toward someone being mistreated, and then ask him how they would punish an unrelated wrong, and their proposed punishments get much harsher.This is Bloom's main argument. He makes it well near the beginning of the book, but kind of rambles and wanders the rest of the way. He talks about brain waves. He talks about how conservatives aren't actually less empathetic than liberals. He tries to talk about how empathy affects intimate relationships but never really gets there. He defends rationality when it comes to morality (I found this to be quite insightful, and important, but he doesn't connect it well to the rest of the book). And, though he is careful to define empathy precisely, he doesn't always hold himself to that definition when critiquing it.So I docked him a few stars. He also obviously doesn't know how to deal with religion. He mentions it in passing, although I would argue it affects profoundly the arguments he is trying to make. (It might even help his case. I would argue, for example, that the Biblical faith is all for rational morality. I would also argue that it would warn us against taking empathy too far, but it might not be as pessimistic as is Bloom.)So an interesting read, especially if you're trying to make better decisions (or feel better about yourself for not being very empathetic)."

I guess it's a good book if you're new to the notion of affective empathy not being that good. But we autistic activists have been familiar with the notion for decades. You'll find so many good blog posts and tumblr or twitter rants on the subject matter from people in the neurodivergent political sphere. It will be better than this book. You'll have more answers. You'll read them and hopefully you'll be better towards people who don't use their empathy.I thought the book would be autistic friendly. I thought it would also tackle the idea that cognitive empathy is mandatory to have a right to exist. I thought it would talk about how cognitive empathy is relative, how autistic and allistic people have trouble standing in each other's shoes, but how cognitive empathy is useless if you know how to LISTEN and if you're willing to be a kind, moral person once you've listened enough. It didn't. In fact, I had trouble going on once I read that you can't be a good person with a good moral compass if you don't ""have"" cognitive empathy. Showing how the author doesn't know shit about cognitive empathy. He based his book on his neurotypical views of empathy, and I couldn't relate. And I actually knew more, and better than him. I'm deeply disappointed by the book, and I won't read this author again.Now, it's probably a good introduction if you know nothing about empathy. It challenges your views and tackles several misconceptions. I'd recommend you read it if you think the problem with empathy is we don't have enough of it. Still, chapter one is basically a repeat of the prologue, and the ideas are repeated over and over, there is a Q/A section that I thought was very out of place... And once you've been convinced that you don't need to empathize to make good moral decisions and/or be a compassionate and kind person, it pretty much stops being interesting.

The author is against emotional empathy. Emotional empathy let us to feel what other people feels, mirror people's feeling, which could be so distraught to paralyze us to take effective action and narrow focus of bias could make us to make unwise actions. Cognitive empathy make us understand other people's feeling without experiencing it, lead us positive compassion, kindness , reasoning, more effective way to help people.Statistical data and reasoning seem always cold, hard to stir people to act, and ever worse when data and reasoning against our intuition and our bias, like ""identifiable victim effect"".

Author's own conclusion---1. Our moral decisions and actions are powerfully shaped by the force of empathy.---2. This often make the world worse.---3. We have the capacity to do better.2. Cognitive empathy is morally neutral. cognitive empathy: understand you feel, but do not feel it. It is positive compassion, kindness. The understanding and feeling are different neuron processing, you can understand it without feeling it, that is cognitive empathy. We are much better to use reasons, cost-benefit, compassion, kindness to make decisions, give intelligently, with eye towards consequence. Depersonalize the process and circumvent our natural preference and bias, with compassion for others, rational-making taking happiness and suffering into account. Reduce our candidates to X, Y, Z, designing procedure such as blind reviewing and blind auditions. Bring everyone down rather than bring everyone up. Don't try to make them (strangers) more weight. Rather, make yourself less weight. Bring everyone to the same level by diminish yourself. Put yourself, and those you love, on the level of strangers. p138 Buddhist texts distinguish ""sentimental compassion"", which corresponds to what we could call empathy and ""great compassion"", which is what we would simply called compassion. The first is to be avoid, as it exhausts the bodhisattva. It's the second that is worth pursing. Great compssion is more distanced and reserved, and can be sustained indefinitely.... In contrast to (emotional) empathy, compassion does not means sharing the suffering of others: rather, it is characterized by feeling of warmth, concern and care for other, as well as a strong motivation to improve the other's well-being. Compassion is feeling for and not feeling with the other. p139 There is a neural difference: Empathy training led to increased activation in the insula and anterior cingulate cortes. Compassion training led to activation in other parts of the brain, such as the medical orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum.p141 Mindful meditation reduces activation of the brain networks associated with simulating the feeling of people in distress, in favour of networks associated with feelings of social affiliation. Buddhist scholar Thupten Jinpa: ""Meditation-based training enables practitioners to move quickly from feeling the distress of others to acting with compassion to alleviated it.""... Not only can compassion and kindness exist independently of empathy, they are sometime opposed . Sometimes, we are better people if we suppress our empathic feeling. p145 My friend (psychologist) does get into her clients' heads, she would be useless if she couldn't - but she doesn't feel what they fee. She employs understanding and caring, not empathy.p149 There is a world difference, between understanding the misery of the person who is talking to you because you have felt misery in the past, even though now you are calm, and understanding the misery of the person who is talking to you because  you are mirroring them and feeling their misery right now. The first, which doesn't involve empathy in any sense, just understanding, has all advantages of the second and none of its cost.p154 My worst moments as a father aren't when I don't care, they're when I care too much, when I cannot disengage from my children's frustration and pain.  --my comment: so true for me.Against Fairness by Stephen T.

The act of feeling what you believe other people feel - experience what they experience. The act of coming to experience the world as you think someone else does, also called sympathy by philosophers Adam Smith and David Humep17 As Adam Smith put it, we have capacity to think about another person and ""place ourselves in his situation.... and become in some measure the same person with him, and thence form some idea of his sensations, and even feel something which, though weaker in degree, is not altogether unlike him."" This is emotional empathy, feel what you feel.Emotional Empathy is biased and parochial; it is spotlight (metaphor, narrow focus, only light up the area you focus, ignore surrounding) , it focus on certain people at the expense of others; it is innumerate (we often pay too much attention to one person, ignore too many suffering), it is not in the direction of increase of justice, so it distort our moral and policy decision in ways cause suffering instead of relieving it.

132,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1216728-sophia,4,"In most respects, this is a really good book; it's the author defending a specific, at first glance controversial, idea and backing it up with science, history and reason. It’s very accessible, a decent length, including arguments and counter arguments and counter counter arguments. Anyone interested in morality should give it a read. Bloom essentially argues that the human tendency of literally feeling what someone else is feeling, “emotional empathy”, is detrimental to individuals and society as a whole, for 3 main reasons: it’s more often paralyzing than motivating, it’s unnecessarily painful, and it is inescapably limited in scope. Instead, all of what’s good about people can be attributed to compassion; caring without feeling the same thing.The idea I agreed with the most was that empathy is a problem because it is limited in scope, meaning the human mind can only handle feeling empathy for a limited number of individuals at a time, and invariably those individuals are “ranked” by closeness (family, friends, neighbours, other). This makes it a cousin of racism in a weird sense; by shining a spotlight on just your people, you can so ignore everyone else that you don’t notice the harm you cause. So in war, it’s not so much a lack of empathy for the enemy (which on it’s own would just lead to apathy) but an excess of empathy towards your own group, or any other group which moves you to do something, blind to anyone else. While it would be nice to extend empathy to the enemy, that’s just not how our brains were wired. Along the same lines, I personally appreciated the change in perspective from thinking of empathy as the source of morality to just a manifestation of it. A couple months ago, I went through a mini crisis where I had to stop reading the news, because I realized behind every death toll number were actual people, who were terrified for their lives, and then had that snuffed out; and there was just so much death and pain, but I didn’t want to stop feeling this connection, because I worried that would be callous, denying reality. The idea that empathy is just not the tool for the job helps a lot; instead it’s better that I feel compassion, a detached awareness of a problem, followed by an evaluation of whether I can do anything to help; not so I would feel better, but just to help. If empathy was causing me to turn off the news so that I would feel less pain, then clearly it was a problem not a solution.The idea that compassion not only can but should replace empathy was a little harder to swallow, but the more I think about it, the more I agree. I started trying to find an example to prove this wrong, and an easy one popped up on tv: spring breakers continuing to gather despite the coronavirus lockdown. At first glance, it seems that these millennials (eye roll) were not feeling any empathy for the elderly and the sick at risk, and if they had, they would have stayed home. While this is true, it would actually be enough for them just to feel compassion, and in hindsight, that’s what jumpstarted me into proper self-isolation; in the early days, I saw the numbers, and realized with the 14 day incubation period there was no other way to stop this, so I stayed home, before even the Italian death toll hit 1000. Only later did I come across the personal stories of some of the victims, making me want to curl up in a ball and cry; but while that technically would also keep me at home, compassion left me the presence of mind to plan how to avoid trips outside, contact my relatives to provide helpful information, and avoid hoarding toilet paper. In a similar vein, there’s currently the debate about whether the economy is “worth” the lives of the elderly and infirm. Anyone arguing using empathy would be horrified at the idea that the economy should factor into such a decision, but actually if the economy collapses, so too will future healthcare and medical research, leading possibly to even more deaths, not to mention suffering from just lower quality of life. Now, is the economy really going to collapse? Maybe not, but its not going to be empathy, but rational, albeit compassionate, analysis that will find the answer. Like with this, most other legal and political decisions would benefit from taking a step back from empathy, and just dealing with compassion; the alternative results in one-sided views that devolves into entrenched partisanship, as we currently see.On the topic of news, Bloom actually missed a golden opportunity to criticize the media for it’s practice of starting almost every article with some first-name basis narrative about some victim; as if the reader couldn’t be brought to care unless there was a soul behind each tragedy. It always really bothered me to read this; on the one hand because it gave me pain when all I wanted was information, on the other hand because it glaringly defied the objectivity I would hope for in the news. Bloom brings up the case of how you can just as easily empathize with poor young black Americans afraid for their lives, or with self-sacrificing police officers, trying to help their city but afraid for their lives; yet oh so rarely can people do both. But we shouldn’t try; and the news should stop trying to get that to happen. Instead, we should just be presented with cold hard facts that help with better decision making on how much power and trianing to give police and what kind of reform programs work.The main problem with this book is I think Bloom gives too much “credit” to empathy, and disregards other forms of “emotional decision making” behind many of the problems he attributes to empathy. War in particular he argues comes down to one side feeling empathy for some victim, and taking up arms to fight against the aggressor. But actually empathy, as he writes elsewhere, is often paralyzing, especially when the emotion involved is fear and trauma; instead seeing this in others often provokes anger instead, and it is this that leads people to war. So just like he claims mainstream definition of empathy is jut “everything good and nice about people”, he tends to attribute every non-selfish emotional action to empathy. If instead of being “against empathy” he had more accurately stated his position as “against emotional decision making” I think he would reveal himself as being far less controversial than his title suggests (nor as original).Also, an important omission from his thesis is whether it is even possible to have compassion without empathy; he argues for us to make decisions like this, which is fine, but can you as a human develop a sense of compassion, for anyone, without first feeling empathy? Bloom repeatedly hints that you can, but while he talks about individuals without both empathy and compassion (psychopaths), he doesn’t mention a class of people without empathy but with compassion. Well actually, he does mention Buddhist monks, but they learn this state of enlightenment, they're not naturally endowed with it. He also claims children have instincts of compassion without showing corresponding empathy, but the child’s version of compassion is not particularly useful. The story he gives is of a toddler, who has learned that showing off his belly makes adults smile. One day his older brother gets hurt, and in an attempt to make his brother feel better, he shows him his belly. While clearly the “theory of mind” that his brother was hurting was there, and the instinct to try and help as well, but the chosen solution was not particularly helpful. Instead, being able to feel empathy, as in imagine also being hurt, would allow for a more appropriate response. So ultimately, I still suspect Bloom is wrong about empathy, even by his narrow definition, being only an impediment. My intuitive theory would be that empathy is a necessary tool for learning not only what could hurt us, but also what could make us feel better and as a consequence could help others feel better. If you have a friend who just had a tough breakup, and you yourself have never even dated, compassion may not even be enough to realize why the situation is painful, and therefore what you as a friend could do to help. Yes, in the grand scheme of things, its better for the friend to have broken off from a bad relationship, but that is not the consolation that’s going to help right in that moment. If the situation were reversed, I think it would be nice to have a compassionate friend, but I would really want an empathic best friend. In conclusion, in the grand scheme of decision making, empathy can be as detrimental as racism, focusing a spotlight only on a small group for not objective reasons. But I don’t think deep interpersonal relationships would be possible without it. "
133,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2896545-meg,2,"The basic argument here is one that I can certainly get behind: We should strive for more cognitive empathy, but less emotional empathy. Our decisions and policies should be driven primarily by rational evaluation of how we can do the most good with our resources, rather than exhausting our resources through the avenues that tug most on our heartstrings.I had a few major problems, though, too. In the end, Paul Bloom and I fundamentally disagree in our worldviews. This manifested in three particular ways throughout the book:1) As a white, straight, male, affluent, American Yale professor, Bloom writes from a place of EXTREME privilege...and he makes virtually no effort to even acknowledge this, let alone compensate for it. Many of his points were weakened for me by the fact that they wouldn't hold up if the privilege was removed.2) Bloom is, by his own admission, not a sincere advocate of making personal sacrifices for the common good. He writes, ""I could never take seriously people who refuse to take long flights to see those they love because of worries about contributing to climate change. Or even those who put their children into a public school that they know to be terrible even though they can easily afford a private school, just out of a broader principle of common good. Even when it comes to charity, I am not a good utilitarian."" As a Gryffindor and a 1 on the Enneagram, this is not just foreign to me, it's repulsive.3) I couldn't get past the feeling that a lot of this book was written out of semantic quibbling between the scholarly elite. The sensationalist title soon gave way to a core position that, while it made sense, was less revolutionary than one might expect.All in all, I'm still grateful to this book. The fact that I disagreed with certain points and favored others was a helpful exercise in critical reading. I was motivated to think deeply while reading and came out with a much more nuanced understanding of empathy and my associated beliefs. I'm not at all suggesting that others shouldn't read this book -- but if you do read it, just make sure you do so through a critical lens."
134,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46716546-weronika,2,"It might be a three stars book, but I vowed to subtract a star for any book that quotes the marshmallow study results (the book quotes the marshmallow study results!!!). It is, in fact, a poorly organised sequence of paragraphs commenting on a variety of studies that could be loosely linked with or interpreted in the context of empathy. Mixed into that is some useful literature (Adam Smith, of all people!) and some colourful, though somewhat clichéd examples from history (Abe Lincoln saving piglets!). The argument is not without merit -- empathy, rather than a force for good, is a force for tribalism. We feel more for people like us. When a victim is like us, and the perpetrator is unlike us, we feel disproportionately more for the victim. If the victim is unlike us, but the perpetrator belongs to our tribe, we tend to dismiss the victim and feel for the perpetrator. Empathy is also number-blind; we care for one, but not for hundreds. Empathy stirs injustice -- in studies quoted in the book, people would move kids up the treatment lists disregarding other children, just because they knew that one kid and did not know the rest of them. And of course there are the Nazis, there is Hitler. The author is also right to add (after Smith) that empathy only makes us sympathize with those who feel bad. Empathetic people do not experience joy and happiness when others experience happiness or achieve success. They envy them. The capacity for ""positive"" empathy is limited to ""small joys"" in life. And so, Bloom claims, we should rather focus on compassion, sort of Buddhist-style. And the argument seems to be valid, it's just the book that is bad."
135,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14711872-jamie,3,"The attention grabbing title suggests a shocking case study, but Paul Bloom's subtitle is a much better metric for what this thoughtful book presents. Empathy is defined as ""the act of coming to experience the world as you think someone else does,"" and it does not refer to compassion or understanding but rather emotional assumptions which are devoid of reason. At first, the work felt like a reprimand over semantics since most of society would define empathy as an appeal to understanding through dialogue. But once Bloom distinguishes empathy from deliberative reasoning and cognitive empathy, his denigration of this practice unveils empathy's limitations and dangers. Logic and reason should be given precedence in order to capacitate self-control, intelligence, and balanced compassion for the future.Bloom's writing is unexpectedly humorous with tongue-in-cheek making this an entertaining read. Unfortunately, he frames every idea precisely with plenty of caveats that almost negate many of his statements. He seems to expect, and tries to prevent, critique of his findings which results in long-winded lines of dialogue that end up saying very little with each point. This round-about quantifying of ideas suggests that his thesis is not as shocking or profound as he may have wished it to be. However, the examples he offers illustrate his view and prove that empathy is not the cure all for humanities problems, and the perception that empathy is a superior trait is certainly called into question. Morality is motivating but ambiguous, and it is far more important to practice reason and emotional intelligence in the pursuit of a better future."

I think he makes some compelling arguments, the most convincing of which was that his narrowly-defined version of empathy serves as a tool to prioritize a single person over thousands or millions of people, which can be used for both good AND for bad - it's apolitical and amoral (i.e. how empathy for orphans in latin american countries causes more harm than good w/ white savior volunteering trips, unsustainable orphanage businesses, and fake orphans as a ""tourist trap""). he is a little insensitive about certain topics at times, and also denies his white privilege on one occasion, which was interesting. ultimately I think his final thesis is pretty reasonable, it is just not an amazingly well written book."

Who could be against empathy? You might as well say you’re against puppies!Against Empathy: The Case for Rational Compassion has a provocative title (deliberately so, for $ales purposes no doubt), but the claim Paul Bloom (Professor of psychology and cognitive science at Yale University) is making is substantially more banal. Bloom claims that, while empathy can serve as a spotlight, focusing attention on issues of importance, it more often than not leads to morally incorrect conclusions. Instead, he argues that ‘rational compassion’ serves as a better guide for determining our correct moral course of action. Before getting into details we first need to define what Bloom means by ‘empathy’. Bloom considers empathy to be the ability to put oneself in another’s shoes and to feel the things that they are feeling. This is illustrated by Bill Clinton’s famous quip “I feel your pain” and differs from sympathy or compassion in important ways. Here’s an example to help illustrate the difference between these concepts. Say your friend’s beloved pet dies and they are heartbroken as a consequence. Feeling your friend’s sadness is an example of Bloom’s empathy. On the other hand, if you were to comfort a child who fears there are monsters in the closet, you would not be experiencing the fear the child is feeling (since you presumably know that monsters don’t exist). This is therefore an example of compassion, and not empathy. So, how does empathy steer us wrong? Here’s one way … let’s say you witness a child receiving vaccination shots. The child screams and cries and later develops redness and swelling around the injection site and experiences obvious discomfort. You empathize so much with the child’s plight you crusade against childhood vaccinations vowing to end the suffering brought about by the shots. Unfortunately, this leads to a resurgence of polio that kills thousands and paralyzes tens of thousands as well as measles which kills tens of thousands and sickens millions. This is a morally reprehensible outcome brought about by an excess of empathy. Another way in which empathy steers us wrong is that it makes us care about those with whom we are close, but does a poor job in getting us to respond to the tragedies of strangers. As Adam Smith famously wrote (comparing the loss of someone’s pinky finger to a hypothetical earthquake in China that kills millions):If he was to lose his little finger to-morrow, he would not sleep to-night; but, provided he never saw them, he will snore with the most profound security over the ruin of a hundred millions of his brethren, and the destruction of that immense multitude seems plainly an object less interesting to him, than this paltry misfortune of his own.Instead, Bloom argues that rational compassion (a mixture of caring coupled with a detached cost-benefit analysis) provides a better moral compass for guiding our behavior, especially as it takes the broader consequences of ones actions into consideration. We can choose to be kind and act to alleviate the suffering of others without experiencing the misery of their condition. To which I can only respond … Meh. Is this even an interesting question? Obviously, the consequences of moral actions are meaningful. If I help an old lady cross a street only to steer her into the path of an oncoming bus … I probably shouldn’t expect that boy scout merit badge. Outcomes matter, but who thinks otherwise?Also, Bloom is forced to pepper the pages of his book with innumerable caveats which dilute his argument. Empathy can often be good, Bloom concedes. It can bring attention to a social needs and aid in charitable giving. Empathy also has many different definitions, to some it can mean kindness, to others … sympathy, all of which Bloom supports. Thus in order to make his argument cohesive Bloom first has to reduce it to a watery gruel. If I were to define ‘puppies’ as those things that crap on the rug and chew my shoes to shreds, then I’m against puppies! Bloom is similarly forced into a narrow definition of ‘empathy’ and as such must concede so much ground from the get-go one wonders why he felt this was an argument worth having. In reality what he is arguing against are over-emotional decisions that one arrives at through a knee jerk reaction. Of course if he were to have titled the book Against Over-Emotional Decisions Based Upon Knee Jerk Reactions it would have been greeted with a collective yawn. Let’s imagine for a moment that Bloom is correct on every point and in every particular, then what? Would we then set about a program of changing human nature so as to eliminate empathy from the human psyche? Of course not. Could we convince humanity to suddenly begin debating moral issues only in rational terms? The idea is laughable … as evidence I point to every comments section of every web page on the entire internet. Not only is this an uninteresting question, the ideas Bloom puts forth could be fully explored in a magazine article length treatment. In fact, you’ll find my full rebuttal of this point in an upcoming book Against Text Padding: The Case for Making a Concise Point. I’m going to publish it on a postage stamp."

His definition of ""empathy"" seems to be changing and he often makes straw man arguments. I really wanted to like this, but found myself rather disappointed with it."

143,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11570392-alice,3,The central argument is provocative if not a bit subtle but much of the book seems repetitive and doesn't seem to delve into this argument in much depth. Basically all you need is to read the first chapter to grasp the point.
144,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11138286-kari,5,"Against Empathy puts forth the position that empathy is not only largely impotent as a force for good, but can actually be a force for harm, bigotry, violence, etc. The author argues that reason and a distanced compassion is far superior to empathy as a benefit to society.WHAT I LIKED: I loved this book! I wish I’d read it with a highlighter. It challenged my preconceptions (a wonderful trait in books). It was humorous and engrossing. The writer was engaging, logical, and thorough in his research. He quoted philosophers who agreed with him and those who didn’t, always explaining why he believes as he does.WHAT I DIDN’T LIKE: I wish the book had been longer and even more in depth."
145,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5863458-andrea-mcdowell,2,"Imagine an entire book written critiquing empathy--written by a psychologist, no less--that doesn't once mention attachment theory or the importance of that close atunement by a caregiver during a child's formative years for psychological development. This will give you an idea of the considerable gaps in reasoning in this book that purports to demonstrate how importance reasoning (paired with compassion rather than empathy) is to proper moral decision making. A selection of other, similar gaps:p. 106: argument that it doesn't matter to a starving child if they are given food by a smiling face or if the food is dropped by a drone. Of course it matters. Raise your hand if you see no difference between birthday presents dropped off by drone rather than delivered by the smiling faces of your friends and family. People, particularly children, need to know that they are important and that they matter to people *as people*, and this is hardly communicated by a drone drop. The entire bit just before that about the kid who got a job on wall street so he could make large donations to the poor. While this is obviously an improvement over getting a job on wall street so you can buy a yacht, it does--contrary to Bloom's conclusion-without-support--makes things worse for the global poor. The investment machine that Wall Street powers is directly, intimately and daily linked to the actions of global companies who deprive people of land, food, and their lives. He can't possibly be ignorant of this; it smacks of cherry-picking.p. 107: He dismisses the claim that literature increases empathy, completely ignoring the scientific research that demonstrate that it does. p. 126: He argues that working on climate changes has nothing to do with empathy, as there are no identifiable Others with which to empathize. This book was written in America in 2016. At that time, California was experiencing the worst drought of its history, fueled by climate change. The Syrian refugee crisis, spurred in large part by a climate-change drought in the north of the country, was raging at that time. Both crises dominated the news with pictures of drowned toddlers, boats full of desperate people with nowhere to go, etc. No identifiable others? What planet was Bloom living on? I work in climate change. This is not a ""pale statistical abstraction"" for me, but is daily fueled by the impacts I know this is having on people, animals and landscapes. p. 154: Parenting. Here is where you would think attachment theory would make an appearance. Nope! Instead he makes a curious argument (repeated throughout the book) that empathy uniquely enslaves people and makes it impossible to consider how to respond using reason. I'll come back to this.p. 183-185: Psychopaths! Here, Bloom argues by aphorism. That is, he includes quotes by famous people asserting that a thing must be so, without providing evidence, and then concludes that indeed it is so. Eg. a quote from Steven Pinker about how crimes and violence committed in the name of morality ""would surely outnumber the fatalities from amoral conquest and predation,"" and accepts this statement as fact. Oh? Give us a statistic, Bloom. Give us some numbers with a source. You might think he'd have something to say here about the legendary lack of empathy in psychopaths. Nope!p. 232: IQ tests! ""A long time ago people said things like 'IQ tests just measure how good you are at doing IQ tests,' but nobody takes this seriously anymore."" (This in an argument about how IQ tests measure the potential for life success, as some kind of corollary argument for reason or reasoning ability--he never clarifies the connection he tries to draw here.) So I typed that phrase--IQ tests just measure how good you are at taking IQ tests--into google, and found this article from 2017 https://theconversation.com/the-iq-te... and this from 2014 https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/... . Seems like the conversation over the utility of IQ tests continues to rage on, Paul.Not to mention that describing IQ tests as good arbiters of reasoning ability, and claiming that no one questions this anymore, without discussing the differing results between different demographic groups and how completely obvious it is that privilege and material well-being factor into higher IQ scores--is racist and sexist. p. 234: ""I said that if you were curious about what sort of person a child would grow up to be, an intelligence test would be a great measure."" Fun! So, I was in a gifted program from grade 4-grade 13/OAC, said program based on the results of universally administered aptitude/IQ tests within the schools. Everyone I went to school with did extremely well on IQ tests, within the top 1-2 percentile.Yes, there are neurosurgeons and professors and lawyers within that group of people.There are also highschool and university drop-outs who have spent their entire adult lives bewailing how unfairly life has treated them because they are GENIUSES goddammit and they DESERVE better.So.Later on he talks about the importance of self-control and how well this was demonstrated in the infamous Marshmallow Test. Which has now been debunked as a measure of affluence rather than willpower. https://www.theatlantic.com/family/ar...p. 238: Here he talks about how good people are at reasoning in every day matters such as whether to buy a house or local politics such as zoning regulations. ""My own experience is that the level of rational discourse here is high,"" he says.Dear Lord. Apparently Paul Bloom, alone among North American adults, has never heard of NIMBYism. As an environmental professional now for a few decades, let me state categorically that the level of rational discourse in local political and planning matter is abysmal, and emotion plays an enormous role in the conclusions people draw. I used to work in wind energy and read a study at that time showing that people who claimed negative health impacts from a local wind farm were almost certain to be able to see it from a window in their house; didn't matter how far away it was or whether they could hear it or not. And keep in mind that Mr. Bloom wrote the sentences defending the rationality of everyday Americans in whether or not to purchase a house in 2016, a mere 8 years after the mortgage crisis.So this is a small collection of my ""Oh my god you have got to be kidding me"" moments from reading this book, but you might be wondering about the overall argument.I picked up the book on the strength of Kate Manne's mentioning of it in her book Down Girl, where she writes of his claim that empathy is ""biased and innumerate"": that is, that the empathy we feel reflects our own biases, and favours the one over the many. Manne then expands on this to discuss how empathy flows up the social hierarchy, and our society's tendency to, for example, express empathy towards perpetrators (""this allegation will destroy his career!"") over victims. That was the best part of Against Empathy, and having read it, you can probably skip the rest of the book. On the strength of it, I gave it two stars rather than one.But its weaknesses are many. A short list:1. The definition of empathy changes on every page to be whatever Bloom needs it to be in order to dismiss it. At the beginning of the book, empathy can be directed towards groups at a distance: he uses the example of the Sandy Hook massacre. At the end of the book, empathy can only be triggered in direct proximity to one or a small group of people who are directly emoting in your presence. At the beginning, again as with the Sandy Hook example, the empathy inspired isn't directly feeling exactly what the other person is feeling--he wouldn't and doesn't claim he feels the same rage and grief as the children's parents do--but at the end it is direct and exact mirroring, and only this mirroring, that counts as empathy. I could go on.2. Of course, any emotion or capacity joined to Reason is going to be superior to any emotion or capacity specifically entirely unconnected to Reason, so saying Compassion + Reason is a better guide to moral decision making than Empathy Alone is ... obvious. Let's experiment: Anger + Reason is better than Love Alone (think: people stalking the object of their romantic obsession, people using anger plus critical reasoning to advance social causes). Shame + Reason is better than Happiness Alone (research showing that the single-minded pursuit of happiness is linked with selfishness and moral deterioration; the capacity of reasoning one's way out of shame to restore social bonds and inspire moral improvement). Hate + Reason is better than Joy Alone (I have to admit that this is a tricky one, but I think a person who can reason about their hate can identify bridges that needed burning and separate themselves from destructive people and relationships much better than people who think any sign of hate is a moral failing; and Joy, if it comes at another's expense and is expressed without consideration of that fact, could be hurtful). We should simply assume and act as if all of our capacities are better when we can reason them through.3. He never explains why empathy is so impossible to reason through; he simply states that he himself can't do it, and then seems to assume that no one else can either. But of course empathy can join with Reason; an effective parent will do so as a matter of daily course. He brings up an example of how empathy would make a parent unable to subject their child to vaccinations because of the pain from the needle, but this is nonsense. Empathy simply makes it easier for the parent to understand and respond to the child's pain and confusion afterwards. Compassion wouldn't cut it.My daughter has a genetic syndrome that was only diagnosed when she was nearly 14. She had many, many tests beginning in infancy to try to diagnose it. I will never forget the first, when she was a tiny baby, about 5 lbs at the time, and it took me and two nurses to pin her down while they drew blood from her little arms. And I wept while she screamed, in her confusion and pain and fear. It did not stop me from getting her tested. It did provide a break of balancing the pain of any given test from the benefit of whatever knowledge we expected to gain from it, which is what happens when empathy is joined with reason.4. All feelings have a purpose. We are creatures who evolved, and we share these feelings with many of our non-human relatives; they have adaptive and survival value or they wouldn't exist. Any argument that tries to do away with any particular feeling must, I believe, acknowledge and understand the value that exists before a coherent and convincing argument can be made against it. This goes for the Dalai Lama's incessant harping against anger, Brene Brown's wholly unconvincing dismissal of shame, and it goes here for Paul Bloom's devaluation of empathy. 5. He repeatedly insists that the idea that people are incapable of truly reasoning is baseless, without providing any convincing argument against the vast evidence--never mentioned--that human reasoning ability is inextricably connected with emotion. That neurologically people are incapable of reaching conclusions without emotions. His argument reflects an unearned faith in the existence of One True Reasonable Conclusion for any argument; of course, there isn't one. This isn't, as he claims, a dismissal of Reason; it's an admission of its limitations and its inherent dependency on our emotional responses. We reason using thoughts and feelings, and any reasoned conclusions is partially dependent on feelings which must be admitted to and explored as part of a reasoned exploration. There are plenty of people out there who claim that there beliefs that the earth is flat, that climate change is a hoax, that vaccines cause autism, etc. are reasoned arguments based on evidence, which they clearly are not. His own book would have been better if he himself had done so.On page 10, Bloom lists his main influences for his argument against empathy and for reason:Richard DavidsonSam Harris (article about his assertion that black americans score lower on IQ tests because they are less intelligent here: https://www.vox.com/2018/4/9/17210248...)Jesse PrinzPeter Singer (disabled humans not persons; adult gorillas are persons; apparently supports the rights of parents to kill their disabled children? http://web.archive.org/web/2017030700...)Michael LynchMichael Shermer (multiple accusations of sexual assault: https://www.buzzfeed.com/markoppenhei...)Hrm. What kinds of conclusions do you think a person is going to reach with influences like these?Let's ignore the fact that they are all white, able-bodied, male, and with the exception of one, straight.Let's consider that this list is 50% known unrepentant asshole.Essentially, Paul Bloom sets up a straw man of unconstrained empathy without the benefit of any reasoning counterbalance and spends about 240 pages pummeling it with half-facts and anecdotes.

The title of this book consists of two parts, the ""against empathy"" part and the ""rational compassion"" part. I expected the author to go into each aspect in depth , arguing at first why empathy is a bad thing, then proposing the replacement and explaining how we can use the replacement to avoid the negative consequences of empathy.And here lies my main issue with this book, the author dedicates 5 chapters out of 6 to the arguments against empathy. and while that is already an unbalanced ratio for both arguments, I felt the last chapter was wasted on arguing if human beings are actually rational or not rather than explaining how being rational is the solution to the problems of empathy. so after finishing the book even 
if
 you agree that empathy is bad , you are left with nothing , just feeling bad about having a normal human emotion, and not knowing what to do about it.my second issue that I have with the book is the writing style. the book is written in a sort of a discussion like style , first arguing for one side then after that saying how one would counter that argument . And while acknowledging criticism and counter arguments is way better than stating your side of the argument as facts, it is done here in a really bad way that left me more often than not confused rather than informed. And if that was not enough already , the author tend to go off tracks A LOT either with unnecessary examples or with topics that seem unrelated to the main topic at hand. Here is an illustration how Paul Bloom presents his ideas I can't deny that he did have a point on the limitation of empathy , that it is like a spotlight , it is narrow and it can lead to hasty decisions that have unwanted consequences, and it may not be the emotion that can save humanity from evil( if you are someone who thinks this way than maybe this book has a lot to offer you). But that wasn't enough to convince me to have a similar opinion like the author and be ""Against empathy"". for me the only takeaway from this book was that we shouldn't act based strictly on emotions (empathy or other emotions like anger ) and that we should try to be as rational as possible before making any decisions."
148,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28727983-e,3,"Empathy is a poor way to make decisions, mostly because it inhibits rationality. It causes us to overvalue the proximate and undervalue the distant (he didn't bring this up, but that's also a reason people don't buy enough insurance, or eat healthy). Empathy screws up how we spend our ""charity dollars,"" how we react to wrongs, how we prioritize the use of scarce resources, and more. Bloom is not against compassion, mind you; he is against empathy as frequently defined as ""feeling yourself what you imagine others must be feeling."" Lots of studies have shown that when you get the studies' subjects to feel empathetically toward others, their rationality immediately goes down the tube. Heck, get them to feel empathy toward someone being mistreated, and then ask him how they would punish an unrelated wrong, and their proposed punishments get much harsher.This is Bloom's main argument. He makes it well near the beginning of the book, but kind of rambles and wanders the rest of the way. He talks about brain waves. He talks about how conservatives aren't actually less empathetic than liberals. He tries to talk about how empathy affects intimate relationships but never really gets there. He defends rationality when it comes to morality (I found this to be quite insightful, and important, but he doesn't connect it well to the rest of the book). And, though he is careful to define empathy precisely, he doesn't always hold himself to that definition when critiquing it.So I docked him a few stars. He also obviously doesn't know how to deal with religion. He mentions it in passing, although I would argue it affects profoundly the arguments he is trying to make. (It might even help his case. I would argue, for example, that the Biblical faith is all for rational morality. I would also argue that it would warn us against taking empathy too far, but it might not be as pessimistic as is Bloom.)So an interesting read, especially if you're trying to make better decisions (or feel better about yourself for not being very empathetic)."

I guess it's a good book if you're new to the notion of affective empathy not being that good. But we autistic activists have been familiar with the notion for decades. You'll find so many good blog posts and tumblr or twitter rants on the subject matter from people in the neurodivergent political sphere. It will be better than this book. You'll have more answers. You'll read them and hopefully you'll be better towards people who don't use their empathy.I thought the book would be autistic friendly. I thought it would also tackle the idea that cognitive empathy is mandatory to have a right to exist. I thought it would talk about how cognitive empathy is relative, how autistic and allistic people have trouble standing in each other's shoes, but how cognitive empathy is useless if you know how to LISTEN and if you're willing to be a kind, moral person once you've listened enough. It didn't. In fact, I had trouble going on once I read that you can't be a good person with a good moral compass if you don't ""have"" cognitive empathy. Showing how the author doesn't know shit about cognitive empathy. He based his book on his neurotypical views of empathy, and I couldn't relate. And I actually knew more, and better than him. I'm deeply disappointed by the book, and I won't read this author again.Now, it's probably a good introduction if you know nothing about empathy. It challenges your views and tackles several misconceptions. I'd recommend you read it if you think the problem with empathy is we don't have enough of it. Still, chapter one is basically a repeat of the prologue, and the ideas are repeated over and over, there is a Q/A section that I thought was very out of place... And once you've been convinced that you don't need to empathize to make good moral decisions and/or be a compassionate and kind person, it pretty much stops being interesting. I thought it would go a lot further."

He argues that empathy is not always a force for good; that we can act on empathy and in so doing do an unethical thing, or we can feel empathy for bad people doing bad things. It's fascinating. He also argues rather convincingly that empathy is not the province of liberalism, just that conservatives have empathy for different types of people/situations. Still thinking about all this."

The author is against emotional empathy. Emotional empathy let us to feel what other people feels, mirror people's feeling, which could be so distraught to paralyze us to take effective action and narrow focus of bias could make us to make unwise actions. Cognitive empathy make us understand other people's feeling without experiencing it, lead us positive compassion, kindness , reasoning, more effective way to help people.Statistical data and reasoning seem always cold, hard to stir people to act, and ever worse when data and reasoning against our intuition and our bias, like ""identifiable victim effect"". But we should fight our emotion and sensation, use our brain and heart to make wise choices. Doing more mindful meditation, acting with compassion and reason, don't be burden with too much emotional empathy weighing yourself down to become the useless bleeding-heart.Chapter 4: intimacyaddress more detrimental of emotional empathy and more positive cognitive empathy: called by compassion.

Author's own conclusion---1. Our moral decisions and actions are powerfully shaped by the force of empathy.---2. This often make the world worse.---3. We have the capacity to do better.2. Cognitive empathy is morally neutral. cognitive empathy: understand you feel, but do not feel it. It is positive compassion, kindness. The understanding and feeling are different neuron processing, you can understand it without feeling it, that is cognitive empathy. We are much better to use reasons, cost-benefit, compassion, kindness to make decisions, give intelligently, with eye towards consequence. Depersonalize the process and circumvent our natural preference and bias, with compassion for others, rational-making taking happiness and suffering into account. Reduce our candidates to X, Y, Z, designing procedure such as blind reviewing and blind auditions. Bring everyone down rather than bring everyone up. Don't try to make them (strangers) more weight. Rather, make yourself less weight. Bring everyone to the same level by diminish yourself. Put yourself, and those you love, on the level of strangers. p138 Buddhist texts distinguish ""sentimental compassion"", which corresponds to what we could call empathy and ""great compassion"", which is what we would simply called compassion. The first is to be avoid, as it exhausts the bodhisattva. It's the second that is worth pursing. Great compssion is more distanced and reserved, and can be sustained indefinitely.... In contrast to (emotional) empathy, compassion does not means sharing the suffering of others: rather, it is characterized by feeling of warmth, concern and care for other, as well as a strong motivation to improve the other's well-being. Compassion is feeling for and not feeling with the other. p139 There is a neural difference: Empathy training led to increased activation in the insula and anterior cingulate cortes. Compassion training led to activation in other parts of the brain, such as the medical orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum.p141 Mindful meditation reduces activation of the brain networks associated with simulating the feeling of people in distress, in favour of networks associated with feelings of social affiliation. Buddhist scholar Thupten Jinpa: ""Meditation-based training enables practitioners to move quickly from feeling the distress of others to acting with compassion to alleviated it.""... Not only can compassion and kindness exist independently of empathy, they are sometime opposed . Sometimes, we are better people if we suppress our empathic feeling. p145 My friend (psychologist) does get into her clients' heads, she would be useless if she couldn't - but she doesn't feel what they fee. She employs understanding and caring, not empathy.p149 There is a world difference, between understanding the misery of the person who is talking to you because you have felt misery in the past, even though now you are calm, and understanding the misery of the person who is talking to you because  you are mirroring them and feeling their misery right now. The first, which doesn't involve empathy in any sense, just understanding, has all advantages of the second and none of its cost.p154 My worst moments as a father aren't when I don't care, they're when I care too much, when I cannot disengage from my children's frustration and pain.  --my comment: so true for me.Against Fairness by Stephen T. AsmaThe Empathy Exams: Essays by Leslie Jamison3. Emotional Empathy is morally corrosive Empathy more precisely emotional empathy: the capacity feel what other people feels. The main focus of this book, this kind of empathy is what the author against.Simply mirror other people's feeling. The act of feeling what you believe other people feel - experience what they experience. The act of coming to experience the world as you think someone else does, also called sympathy by philosophers Adam Smith and David Humep17 As Adam Smith put it, we have capacity to think about another person and ""place ourselves in his situation.... and become in some measure the same person with him, and thence form some idea of his sensations, and even feel something which, though weaker in degree, is not altogether unlike him.""

It’s very accessible, a decent length, including arguments and counter arguments and counter counter arguments. Anyone interested in morality should give it a read. Bloom essentially argues that the human tendency of literally feeling what someone else is feeling, “emotional empathy”, is detrimental to individuals and society as a whole, for 3 main reasons: it’s more often paralyzing than motivating, it’s unnecessarily painful, and it is inescapably limited in scope. Instead, all of what’s good about people can be attributed to compassion; caring without feeling the same thing.The idea I agreed with the most was that empathy is a problem because it is limited in scope, meaning the human mind can only handle feeling empathy for a limited number of individuals at a time, and invariably those individuals are “ranked” by closeness (family, friends, neighbours, other). This makes it a cousin of racism in a weird sense; by shining a spotlight on just your people, you can so ignore everyone else that you don’t notice the harm you cause. So in war, it’s not so much a lack of empathy for the enemy (which on it’s own would just lead to apathy) but an excess of empathy towards your own group, or any other group which moves you to do something, blind to anyone else. While it would be nice to extend empathy to the enemy, that’s just not how our brains were wired. Along the same lines, I personally appreciated the change in perspective from thinking of empathy as the source of morality to just a manifestation of it. A couple months ago, I went through a mini crisis where I had to stop reading the news, because I realized behind every death toll number were actual people, who were terrified for their lives, and then had that snuffed out; and there was just so much death and pain, but I didn’t want to stop feeling this connection, because I worried that would be callous, denying reality. The idea that empathy is just not the tool for the job helps a lot; instead it’s better that I feel compassion, a detached awareness of a problem, followed by an evaluation of whether I can do anything to help; not so I would feel better, but just to help. If empathy was causing me to turn off the news so that I would feel less pain, then clearly it was a problem not a solution.The idea that compassion not only can but should replace empathy was a little harder to swallow, but the more I think about it, the more I agree. I started trying to find an example to prove this wrong, and an easy one popped up on tv: spring breakers continuing to gather despite the coronavirus lockdown. At first glance, it seems that these millennials (eye roll) were not feeling any empathy for the elderly and the sick at risk, and if they had, they would have stayed home. While this is true, it would actually be enough for them just to feel compassion, and in hindsight, that’s what jumpstarted me into proper self-isolation; in the early days, I saw the numbers, and realized with the 14 day incubation period there was no other way to stop this, so I stayed home, before even the Italian death toll hit 1000. Only later did I come across the personal stories of some of the victims, making me want to curl up in a ball and cry; but while that technically would also keep me at home, compassion left me the presence of mind to plan how to avoid trips outside, contact my relatives to provide helpful information, and avoid hoarding toilet paper. In a similar vein, there’s currently the debate about whether the economy is “worth” the lives of the elderly and infirm. Anyone arguing using empathy would be horrified at the idea that the economy should factor into such a decision, but actually if the economy collapses, so too will future healthcare and medical research, leading possibly to even more deaths, not to mention suffering from just lower quality of life. Now, is the economy really going to collapse? Maybe not, but its not going to be empathy, but rational, albeit compassionate, analysis that will find the answer. Like with this, most other legal and political decisions would benefit from taking a step back from empathy, and just dealing with compassion; the alternative results in one-sided views that devolves into entrenched partisanship, as we currently see.On the topic of news, Bloom actually missed a golden opportunity to criticize the media for it’s practice of starting almost every article with some first-name basis narrative about some victim; as if the reader couldn’t be brought to care unless there was a soul behind each tragedy. It always really bothered me to read this; on the one hand because it gave me pain when all I wanted was information, on the other hand because it glaringly defied the objectivity I would hope for in the news. Bloom brings up the case of how you can just as easily empathize with poor young black Americans afraid for their lives, or with self-sacrificing police officers, trying to help their city but afraid for their lives; yet oh so rarely can people do both. But we shouldn’t try; and the news should stop trying to get that to happen. Instead, we should just be presented with cold hard facts that help with better decision making on how much power and trianing to give police and what kind of reform programs work.The main problem with this book is I think Bloom gives too much “credit” to empathy, and disregards other forms of “emotional decision making” behind many of the problems he attributes to empathy. War in particular he argues comes down to one side feeling empathy for some victim, and taking up arms to fight against the aggressor. But actually empathy, as he writes elsewhere, is often paralyzing, especially when the emotion involved is fear and trauma; instead seeing this in others often provokes anger instead, and it is this that leads people to war. So just like he claims mainstream definition of empathy is jut “everything good and nice about people”, he tends to attribute every non-selfish emotional action to empathy. If instead of being “against empathy” he had more accurately stated his position as “against emotional decision making” I think he would reveal himself as being far less controversial than his title suggests (nor as original).Also, an important omission from his thesis is whether it is even possible to have compassion without empathy; he argues for us to make decisions like this, which is fine, but can you as a human develop a sense of compassion, for anyone, without first feeling empathy? Bloom repeatedly hints that you can, but while he talks about individuals without both empathy and compassion (psychopaths), he doesn’t mention a class of people without empathy but with compassion. Well actually, he does mention Buddhist monks, but they learn this state of enlightenment, they're not naturally endowed with it. He also claims children have instincts of compassion without showing corresponding empathy, but the child’s version of compassion is not particularly useful. The story he gives is of a toddler, who has learned that showing off his belly makes adults smile. One day his older brother gets hurt, and in an attempt to make his brother feel better, he shows him his belly. While clearly the “theory of mind” that his brother was hurting was there, and the instinct to try and help as well, but the chosen solution was not particularly helpful. Instead, being able to feel empathy, as in imagine also being hurt, would allow for a more appropriate response. So ultimately, I still suspect Bloom is wrong about empathy, even by his narrow definition, being only an impediment. My intuitive theory would be that empathy is a necessary tool for learning not only what could hurt us, but also what could make us feel better and as a consequence could help others feel better. If you have a friend who just had a tough breakup, and you yourself have never even dated, compassion may not even be enough to realize why the situation is painful, and therefore what you as a friend could do to help. Yes, in the grand scheme of things, its better for the friend to have broken off from a bad relationship, but that is not the consolation that’s going to help right in that moment. If the situation were reversed, I think it would be nice to have a compassionate friend, but I would really want an empathic best friend. In conclusion, in the grand scheme of decision making, empathy can be as detrimental as racism, focusing a spotlight only on a small group for not objective reasons. But I don’t think deep interpersonal relationships would be possible without it. "
163,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2896545-meg,2,"The basic argument here is one that I can certainly get behind: We should strive for more cognitive empathy, but less emotional empathy. Our decisions and policies should be driven primarily by rational evaluation of how we can do the most good with our resources, rather than exhausting our resources through the avenues that tug most on our heartstrings.I had a few major problems, though, too. In the end, Paul Bloom and I fundamentally disagree in our worldviews. This manifested in three particular ways throughout the book:1) As a white, straight, male, affluent, American Yale professor, Bloom writes from a place of EXTREME privilege...and he makes virtually no effort to even acknowledge this, let alone compensate for it. Many of his points were weakened for me by the fact that they wouldn't hold up if the privilege was removed.2) Bloom is, by his own admission, not a sincere advocate of making personal sacrifices for the common good. He writes, ""I could never take seriously people who refuse to take long flights to see those they love because of worries about contributing to climate change. Or even those who put their children into a public school that they know to be terrible even though they can easily afford a private school, just out of a broader principle of common good. Even when it comes to charity, I am not a good utilitarian."" As a Gryffindor and a 1 on the Enneagram, this is not just foreign to me, it's repulsive.3) I couldn't get past the feeling that a lot of this book was written out of semantic quibbling between the scholarly elite. The sensationalist title soon gave way to a core position that, while it made sense, was less revolutionary than one might expect.All in all, I'm still grateful to this book. The fact that I disagreed with certain points and favored others was a helpful exercise in critical reading. I was motivated to think deeply while reading and came out with a much more nuanced understanding of empathy and my associated beliefs. I'm not at all suggesting that others shouldn't read this book -- but if you do read it, just make sure you do so through a critical lens."
164,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46716546-weronika,2,"It might be a three stars book, but I vowed to subtract a star for any book that quotes the marshmallow study results (the book quotes the marshmallow study results!!!). It is, in fact, a poorly organised sequence of paragraphs commenting on a variety of studies that could be loosely linked with or interpreted in the context of empathy. Mixed into that is some useful literature (Adam Smith, of all people!) and some colourful, though somewhat clichéd examples from history (Abe Lincoln saving piglets!). The argument is not without merit -- empathy, rather than a force for good, is a force for tribalism. We feel more for people like us. When a victim is like us, and the perpetrator is unlike us, we feel disproportionately more for the victim. If the victim is unlike us, but the perpetrator belongs to our tribe, we tend to dismiss the victim and feel for the perpetrator. Empathy is also number-blind; we care for one, but not for hundreds. Empathy stirs injustice -- in studies quoted in the book, people would move kids up the treatment lists disregarding other children, just because they knew that one kid and did not know the rest of them. And of course there are the Nazis, there is Hitler. The author is also right to add (after Smith) that empathy only makes us sympathize with those who feel bad. Empathetic people do not experience joy and happiness when others experience happiness or achieve success. They envy them. The capacity for ""positive"" empathy is limited to ""small joys"" in life. And so, Bloom claims, we should rather focus on compassion, sort of Buddhist-style. And the argument seems to be valid, it's just the book that is bad."
165,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14711872-jamie,3,"The attention grabbing title suggests a shocking case study, but Paul Bloom's subtitle is a much better metric for what this thoughtful book presents. Empathy is defined as ""the act of coming to experience the world as you think someone else does,"" and it does not refer to compassion or understanding but rather emotional assumptions which are devoid of reason. At first, the work felt like a reprimand over semantics since most of society would define empathy as an appeal to understanding through dialogue. But once Bloom distinguishes empathy from deliberative reasoning and cognitive empathy, his denigration of this practice unveils empathy's limitations and dangers. Logic and reason should be given precedence in order to capacitate self-control, intelligence, and balanced compassion for the future.Bloom's writing is unexpectedly humorous with tongue-in-cheek making this an entertaining read. Unfortunately, he frames every idea precisely with plenty of caveats that almost negate many of his statements. He seems to expect, and tries to prevent, critique of his findings which results in long-winded lines of dialogue that end up saying very little with each point. This round-about quantifying of ideas suggests that his thesis is not as shocking or profound as he may have wished it to be. However, the examples he offers illustrate his view and prove that empathy is not the cure all for humanities problems, and the perception that empathy is a superior trait is certainly called into question. Morality is motivating but ambiguous, and it is far more important to practice reason and emotional intelligence in the pursuit of a better future."

I think he makes some compelling arguments, the most convincing of which was that his narrowly-defined version of empathy serves as a tool to prioritize a single person over thousands or millions of people, which can be used for both good AND for bad - it's apolitical and amoral (i.e. how empathy for orphans in latin american countries causes more harm than good w/ white savior volunteering trips, unsustainable orphanage businesses, and fake orphans as a ""tourist trap""). he is a little insensitive about certain topics at times, and also denies his white privilege on one occasion, which was interesting. ultimately I think his final thesis is pretty reasonable, it is just not an amazingly well written book."

I estimate that, sure, we are heading to a more and more rational civilization, but 350,000 years is still too short for an advanced developed civilization. We are, after all, an average species on an average planet. But why against compassion. We are actually doing really great under this ""not-quite-rational-but-very-compassionate"" world.No matter how the society evolves, the compassionate ones always have comparative advantage in survival.

I think it is a great essay that was diluted into book. On several occasions I found myself skimming through some sections which instead of reinforcing (or repeating) an idea or argument were actually straying off the path. For this reason I even contemplated giving it 3 stars before settling to 4. In the end, I settled for 4 stars. I didn't do it out of empathy for the effort the author put in it, but for the great content.

170,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,2,"The death of one man is a tragedy, the death of millions is a statistic.-	Joseph StalinAgainst Empathy? Who could be against empathy? You might as well say you’re against puppies!Against Empathy: The Case for Rational Compassion has a provocative title (deliberately so, for $ales purposes no doubt), but the claim Paul Bloom (Professor of psychology and cognitive science at Yale University) is making is substantially more banal. Bloom claims that, while empathy can serve as a spotlight, focusing attention on issues of importance, it more often than not leads to morally incorrect conclusions. Instead, he argues that ‘rational compassion’ serves as a better guide for determining our correct moral course of action. Before getting into details we first need to define what Bloom means by ‘empathy’. Bloom considers empathy to be the ability to put oneself in another’s shoes and to feel the things that they are feeling. This is illustrated by Bill Clinton’s famous quip “I feel your pain” and differs from sympathy or compassion in important ways. Here’s an example to help illustrate the difference between these concepts. Say your friend’s beloved pet dies and they are heartbroken as a consequence. Feeling your friend’s sadness is an example of Bloom’s empathy. On the other hand, if you were to comfort a child who fears there are monsters in the closet, you would not be experiencing the fear the child is feeling (since you presumably know that monsters don’t exist). This is therefore an example of compassion, and not empathy. So, how does empathy steer us wrong? Here’s one way … let’s say you witness a child receiving vaccination shots. The child screams and cries and later develops redness and swelling around the injection site and experiences obvious discomfort. You empathize so much with the child’s plight you crusade against childhood vaccinations vowing to end the suffering brought about by the shots. Unfortunately, this leads to a resurgence of polio that kills thousands and paralyzes tens of thousands as well as measles which kills tens of thousands and sickens millions. This is a morally reprehensible outcome brought about by an excess of empathy. Another way in which empathy steers us wrong is that it makes us care about those with whom we are close, but does a poor job in getting us to respond to the tragedies of strangers. As Adam Smith famously wrote (comparing the loss of someone’s pinky finger to a hypothetical earthquake in China that kills millions):If he was to lose his little finger to-morrow, he would not sleep to-night; but, provided he never saw them, he will snore with the most profound security over the ruin of a hundred millions of his brethren, and the destruction of that immense multitude seems plainly an object less interesting to him, than this paltry misfortune of his own.Instead, Bloom argues that rational compassion (a mixture of caring coupled with a detached cost-benefit analysis) provides a better moral compass for guiding our behavior, especially as it takes the broader consequences of ones actions into consideration. We can choose to be kind and act to alleviate the suffering of others without experiencing the misery of their condition. To which I can only respond … Meh. Is this even an interesting question? Obviously, the consequences of moral actions are meaningful. If I help an old lady cross a street only to steer her into the path of an oncoming bus … I probably shouldn’t expect that boy scout merit badge. Outcomes matter, but who thinks otherwise?Also, Bloom is forced to pepper the pages of his book with innumerable caveats which dilute his argument. Empathy can often be good, Bloom concedes. It can bring attention to a social needs and aid in charitable giving. Empathy also has many different definitions, to some it can mean kindness, to others … sympathy, all of which Bloom supports. Thus in order to make his argument cohesive Bloom first has to reduce it to a watery gruel. If I were to define ‘puppies’ as those things that crap on the rug and chew my shoes to shreds, then I’m against puppies! Bloom is similarly forced into a narrow definition of ‘empathy’ and as such must concede so much ground from the get-go one wonders why he felt this was an argument worth having. In reality what he is arguing against are over-emotional decisions that one arrives at through a knee jerk reaction. Of course if he were to have titled the book Against Over-Emotional Decisions Based Upon Knee Jerk Reactions it would have been greeted with a collective yawn. Let’s imagine for a moment that Bloom is correct on every point and in every particular, then what? Would we then set about a program of changing human nature so as to eliminate empathy from the human psyche? Of course not. Could we convince humanity to suddenly begin debating moral issues only in rational terms? The idea is laughable … as evidence I point to every comments section of every web page on the entire internet. Not only is this an uninteresting question, the ideas Bloom puts forth could be fully explored in a magazine article length treatment. In fact, you’ll find my full rebuttal of this point in an upcoming book Against Text Padding: The Case for Making a Concise Point. I’m going to publish it on a postage stamp."

This will give you an idea of the considerable gaps in reasoning in this book that purports to demonstrate how importance reasoning (paired with compassion rather than empathy) is to proper moral decision making. A selection of other, similar gaps:p. 106: argument that it doesn't matter to a starving child if they are given food by a smiling face or if the food is dropped by a drone. Of course it matters. Raise your hand if you see no difference between birthday presents dropped off by drone rather than delivered by the smiling faces of your friends and family. People, particularly children, need to know that they are important and that they matter to people *as people*, and this is hardly communicated by a drone drop. The entire bit just before that about the kid who got a job on wall street so he could make large donations to the poor. While this is obviously an improvement over getting a job on wall street so you can buy a yacht, it does--contrary to Bloom's conclusion-without-support--makes things worse for the global poor. The investment machine that Wall Street powers is directly, intimately and daily linked to the actions of global companies who deprive people of land, food, and their lives. He can't possibly be ignorant of this; it smacks of cherry-picking.p. 107: He dismisses the claim that literature increases empathy, completely ignoring the scientific research that demonstrate that it does. p. 126: He argues that working on climate changes has nothing to do with empathy, as there are no identifiable Others with which to empathize. This book was written in America in 2016. At that time, California was experiencing the worst drought of its history, fueled by climate change. The Syrian refugee crisis, spurred in large part by a climate-change drought in the north of the country, was raging at that time. Both crises dominated the news with pictures of drowned toddlers, boats full of desperate people with nowhere to go, etc. No identifiable others? What planet was Bloom living on? I work in climate change. This is not a ""pale statistical abstraction"" for me, but is daily fueled by the impacts I know this is having on people, animals and landscapes. p. 154: Parenting. Here is where you would think attachment theory would make an appearance. Nope! Instead he makes a curious argument (repeated throughout the book) that empathy uniquely enslaves people and makes it impossible to consider how to respond using reason. I'll come back to this.p. 183-185: Psychopaths! Here, Bloom argues by aphorism. That is, he includes quotes by famous people asserting that a thing must be so, without providing evidence, and then concludes that indeed it is so. Eg. a quote from Steven Pinker about how crimes and violence committed in the name of morality ""would surely outnumber the fatalities from amoral conquest and predation,"" and accepts this statement as fact. Oh? Give us a statistic, Bloom. Give us some numbers with a source. You might think he'd have something to say here about the legendary lack of empathy in psychopaths. Nope!p. 232: IQ tests! ""A long time ago people said things like 'IQ tests just measure how good you are at doing IQ tests,' but nobody takes this seriously anymore."" (This in an argument about how IQ tests measure the potential for life success, as some kind of corollary argument for reason or reasoning ability--he never clarifies the connection he tries to draw here.) So I typed that phrase--IQ tests just measure how good you are at taking IQ tests--into google, and found this article from 2017 https://theconversation.com/the-iq-te... and this from 2014 https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/... . Seems like the conversation over the utility of IQ tests continues to rage on, Paul.Not to mention that describing IQ tests as good arbiters of reasoning ability, and claiming that no one questions this anymore, without discussing the differing results between different demographic groups and how completely obvious it is that privilege and material well-being factor into higher IQ scores--is racist and sexist. p. 234: ""I said that if you were curious about what sort of person a child would grow up to be, an intelligence test would be a great measure."" Fun! So, I was in a gifted program from grade 4-grade 13/OAC, said program based on the results of universally administered aptitude/IQ tests within the schools. Everyone I went to school with did extremely well on IQ tests, within the top 1-2 percentile.Yes, there are neurosurgeons and professors and lawyers within that group of people.There are also highschool and university drop-outs who have spent their entire adult lives bewailing how unfairly life has treated them because they are GENIUSES goddammit and they DESERVE better.So.Later on he talks about the importance of self-control and how well this was demonstrated in the infamous Marshmallow Test. Which has now been debunked as a measure of affluence rather than willpower. https://www.theatlantic.com/family/ar...p. 238: Here he talks about how good people are at reasoning in every day matters such as whether to buy a house or local politics such as zoning regulations. ""My own experience is that the level of rational discourse here is high,"" he says.Dear Lord. Apparently Paul Bloom, alone among North American adults, has never heard of NIMBYism. As an environmental professional now for a few decades, let me state categorically that the level of rational discourse in local political and planning matter is abysmal, and emotion plays an enormous role in the conclusions people draw. I used to work in wind energy and read a study at that time showing that people who claimed negative health impacts from a local wind farm were almost certain to be able to see it from a window in their house; didn't matter how far away it was or whether they could hear it or not. And keep in mind that Mr. Bloom wrote the sentences defending the rationality of everyday Americans in whether or not to purchase a house in 2016, a mere 8 years after the mortgage crisis.So this is a small collection of my ""Oh my god you have got to be kidding me"" moments from reading this book, but you might be wondering about the overall argument.I picked up the book on the strength of Kate Manne's mentioning of it in her book Down Girl, where she writes of his claim that empathy is ""biased and innumerate"": that is, that the empathy we feel reflects our own biases, and favours the one over the many. Manne then expands on this to discuss how empathy flows up the social hierarchy, and our society's tendency to, for example, express empathy towards perpetrators (""this allegation will destroy his career!"") over victims. That was the best part of Against Empathy, and having read it, you can probably skip the rest of the book. On the strength of it, I gave it two stars rather than one.But its weaknesses are many. A short list:1. The definition of empathy changes on every page to be whatever Bloom needs it to be in order to dismiss it. At the beginning of the book, empathy can be directed towards groups at a distance: he uses the example of the Sandy Hook massacre. At the end of the book, empathy can only be triggered in direct proximity to one or a small group of people who are directly emoting in your presence. At the beginning, again as with the Sandy Hook example, the empathy inspired isn't directly feeling exactly what the other person is feeling--he wouldn't and doesn't claim he feels the same rage and grief as the children's parents do--but at the end it is direct and exact mirroring, and only this mirroring, that counts as empathy. I could go on.2. Of course, any emotion or capacity joined to Reason is going to be superior to any emotion or capacity specifically entirely unconnected to Reason, so saying Compassion + Reason is a better guide to moral decision making than Empathy Alone is ... obvious. Let's experiment: Anger + Reason is better than Love Alone (think: people stalking the object of their romantic obsession, people using anger plus critical reasoning to advance social causes). Shame + Reason is better than Happiness Alone (research showing that the single-minded pursuit of happiness is linked with selfishness and moral deterioration; the capacity of reasoning one's way out of shame to restore social bonds and inspire moral improvement). Hate + Reason is better than Joy Alone (I have to admit that this is a tricky one, but I think a person who can reason about their hate can identify bridges that needed burning and separate themselves from destructive people and relationships much better than people who think any sign of hate is a moral failing; and Joy, if it comes at another's expense and is expressed without consideration of that fact, could be hurtful). We should simply assume and act as if all of our capacities are better when we can reason them through.3. He never explains why empathy is so impossible to reason through; he simply states that he himself can't do it, and then seems to assume that no one else can either. But of course empathy can join with Reason; an effective parent will do so as a matter of daily course. He brings up an example of how empathy would make a parent unable to subject their child to vaccinations because of the pain from the needle, but this is nonsense. Empathy simply makes it easier for the parent to understand and respond to the child's pain and confusion afterwards. Compassion wouldn't cut it.My daughter has a genetic syndrome that was only diagnosed when she was nearly 14. She had many, many tests beginning in infancy to try to diagnose it. I will never forget the first, when she was a tiny baby, about 5 lbs at the time, and it took me and two nurses to pin her down while they drew blood from her little arms. And I wept while she screamed, in her confusion and pain and fear. It did not stop me from getting her tested. It did provide a break of balancing the pain of any given test from the benefit of whatever knowledge we expected to gain from it, which is what happens when empathy is joined with reason.4. All feelings have a purpose. We are creatures who evolved, and we share these feelings with many of our non-human relatives; they have adaptive and survival value or they wouldn't exist. Any argument that tries to do away with any particular feeling must, I believe, acknowledge and understand the value that exists before a coherent and convincing argument can be made against it. This goes for the Dalai Lama's incessant harping against anger, Brene Brown's wholly unconvincing dismissal of shame, and it goes here for Paul Bloom's devaluation of empathy. 5. He repeatedly insists that the idea that people are incapable of truly reasoning is baseless, without providing any convincing argument against the vast evidence--never mentioned--that human reasoning ability is inextricably connected with emotion. That neurologically people are incapable of reaching conclusions without emotions. His argument reflects an unearned faith in the existence of One True Reasonable Conclusion for any argument; of course, there isn't one. This isn't, as he claims, a dismissal of Reason; it's an admission of its limitations and its inherent dependency on our emotional responses. We reason using thoughts and feelings, and any reasoned conclusions is partially dependent on feelings which must be admitted to and explored as part of a reasoned exploration. There are plenty of people out there who claim that there beliefs that the earth is flat, that climate change is a hoax, that vaccines cause autism, etc. are reasoned arguments based on evidence, which they clearly are not. His own book would have been better if he himself had done so.On page 10, Bloom lists his main influences for his argument against empathy and for reason:Richard DavidsonSam Harris (article about his assertion that black americans score lower on IQ tests because they are less intelligent here: https://www.vox.com/2018/4/9/17210248...)Jesse PrinzPeter Singer (disabled humans not persons; adult gorillas are persons; apparently supports the rights of parents to kill their disabled children? http://web.archive.org/web/2017030700...)Michael LynchMichael Shermer (multiple accusations of sexual assault: https://www.buzzfeed.com/markoppenhei...)Hrm. What kinds of conclusions do you think a person is going to reach with influences like these?Let's ignore the fact that they are all white, able-bodied, male, and with the exception of one, straight.Let's consider that this list is 50% known unrepentant asshole.Essentially, Paul Bloom sets up a straw man of unconstrained empathy without the benefit of any reasoning counterbalance and spends about 240 pages pummeling it with half-facts and anecdotes.

The title of this book consists of two parts, the ""against empathy"" part and the ""rational compassion"" part. I expected the author to go into each aspect in depth , arguing at first why empathy is a bad thing, then proposing the replacement and explaining how we can use the replacement to avoid the negative consequences of empathy.And here lies my main issue with this book, the author dedicates 5 chapters out of 6 to the arguments against empathy. and while that is already an unbalanced ratio for both arguments, I felt the last chapter was wasted on arguing if human beings are actually rational or not rather than explaining how being rational is the solution to the problems of empathy. so after finishing the book even 
if
 you agree that empathy is bad , you are left with nothing , just feeling bad about having a normal human emotion, and not knowing what to do about it.my second issue that I have with the book is the writing style. the book is written in a sort of a discussion like style , first arguing for one side then after that saying how one would counter that argument . And while acknowledging criticism and counter arguments is way better than stating your side of the argument as facts, it is done here in a really bad way that left me more often than not confused rather than informed. And if that was not enough already , the author tend to go off tracks A LOT either with unnecessary examples or with topics that seem unrelated to the main topic at hand. Here is an illustration how Paul Bloom presents his ideas I can't deny that he did have a point on the limitation of empathy , that it is like a spotlight , it is narrow and it can lead to hasty decisions that have unwanted consequences, and it may not be the emotion that can save humanity from evil( if you are someone who thinks this way than maybe this book has a lot to offer you). But that wasn't enough to convince me to have a similar opinion like the author and be ""Against empathy"". for me the only takeaway from this book was that we shouldn't act based strictly on emotions (empathy or other emotions like anger ) and that we should try to be as rational as possible before making any decisions."
178,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28727983-e,3,"Empathy is a poor way to make decisions, mostly because it inhibits rationality. It causes us to overvalue the proximate and undervalue the distant (he didn't bring this up, but that's also a reason people don't buy enough insurance, or eat healthy). Empathy screws up how we spend our ""charity dollars,"" how we react to wrongs, how we prioritize the use of scarce resources, and more. Bloom is not against compassion, mind you; he is against empathy as frequently defined as ""feeling yourself what you imagine others must be feeling."" Lots of studies have shown that when you get the studies' subjects to feel empathetically toward others, their rationality immediately goes down the tube. Heck, get them to feel empathy toward someone being mistreated, and then ask him how they would punish an unrelated wrong, and their proposed punishments get much harsher.This is Bloom's main argument. He makes it well near the beginning of the book, but kind of rambles and wanders the rest of the way. He talks about brain waves. He talks about how conservatives aren't actually less empathetic than liberals. He tries to talk about how empathy affects intimate relationships but never really gets there. He defends rationality when it comes to morality (I found this to be quite insightful, and important, but he doesn't connect it well to the rest of the book). And, though he is careful to define empathy precisely, he doesn't always hold himself to that definition when critiquing it.So I docked him a few stars. He also obviously doesn't know how to deal with religion. He mentions it in passing, although I would argue it affects profoundly the arguments he is trying to make. (It might even help his case. I would argue, for example, that the Biblical faith is all for rational morality. I would also argue that it would warn us against taking empathy too far, but it might not be as pessimistic as is Bloom.)So an interesting read, especially if you're trying to make better decisions (or feel better about yourself for not being very empathetic)."

I guess it's a good book if you're new to the notion of affective empathy not being that good. But we autistic activists have been familiar with the notion for decades. You'll find so many good blog posts and tumblr or twitter rants on the subject matter from people in the neurodivergent political sphere. It will be better than this book. You'll have more answers. You'll read them and hopefully you'll be better towards people who don't use their empathy.I thought the book would be autistic friendly. I thought it would also tackle the idea that cognitive empathy is mandatory to have a right to exist. I thought it would talk about how cognitive empathy is relative, how autistic and allistic people have trouble standing in each other's shoes, but how cognitive empathy is useless if you know how to LISTEN and if you're willing to be a kind, moral person once you've listened enough. It didn't. In fact, I had trouble going on once I read that you can't be a good person with a good moral compass if you don't ""have"" cognitive empathy. Showing how the author doesn't know shit about cognitive empathy. He based his book on his neurotypical views of empathy, and I couldn't relate. And I actually knew more, and better than him. I'm deeply disappointed by the book, and I won't read this author again.Now, it's probably a good introduction if you know nothing about empathy. It challenges your views and tackles several misconceptions. I'd recommend you read it if you think the problem with empathy is we don't have enough of it. Still, chapter one is basically a repeat of the prologue, and the ideas are repeated over and over, there is a Q/A section that I thought was very out of place... And once you've been convinced that you don't need to empathize to make good moral decisions and/or be a compassionate and kind person, it pretty much stops being interesting. I thought it would go a lot further."

He argues that empathy is not always a force for good; that we can act on empathy and in so doing do an unethical thing, or we can feel empathy for bad people doing bad things. It's fascinating. He also argues rather convincingly that empathy is not the province of liberalism, just that conservatives have empathy for different types of people/situations. Still thinking about all this."

The author is against emotional empathy. Emotional empathy let us to feel what other people feels, mirror people's feeling, which could be so distraught to paralyze us to take effective action and narrow focus of bias could make us to make unwise actions. Cognitive empathy make us understand other people's feeling without experiencing it, lead us positive compassion, kindness , reasoning, more effective way to help people.Statistical data and reasoning seem always cold, hard to stir people to act, and ever worse when data and reasoning against our intuition and our bias, like ""identifiable victim effect"".

Author's own conclusion---1. Our moral decisions and actions are powerfully shaped by the force of empathy.---2. This often make the world worse.---3. We have the capacity to do better.2. Cognitive empathy is morally neutral. cognitive empathy: understand you feel, but do not feel it. It is positive compassion, kindness. The understanding and feeling are different neuron processing, you can understand it without feeling it, that is cognitive empathy. We are much better to use reasons, cost-benefit, compassion, kindness to make decisions, give intelligently, with eye towards consequence. Depersonalize the process and circumvent our natural preference and bias, with compassion for others, rational-making taking happiness and suffering into account. Reduce our candidates to X, Y, Z, designing procedure such as blind reviewing and blind auditions. Bring everyone down rather than bring everyone up. Don't try to make them (strangers) more weight. Rather, make yourself less weight. Bring everyone to the same level by diminish yourself. Put yourself, and those you love, on the level of strangers. p138 Buddhist texts distinguish ""sentimental compassion"", which corresponds to what we could call empathy and ""great compassion"", which is what we would simply called compassion. The first is to be avoid, as it exhausts the bodhisattva. It's the second that is worth pursing. Great compssion is more distanced and reserved, and can be sustained indefinitely.... In contrast to (emotional) empathy, compassion does not means sharing the suffering of others: rather, it is characterized by feeling of warmth, concern and care for other, as well as a strong motivation to improve the other's well-being. Compassion is feeling for and not feeling with the other. p139 There is a neural difference: Empathy training led to increased activation in the insula and anterior cingulate cortes. Compassion training led to activation in other parts of the brain, such as the medical orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum.p141 Mindful meditation reduces activation of the brain networks associated with simulating the feeling of people in distress, in favour of networks associated with feelings of social affiliation. Buddhist scholar Thupten Jinpa: ""Meditation-based training enables practitioners to move quickly from feeling the distress of others to acting with compassion to alleviated it.""... Not only can compassion and kindness exist independently of empathy, they are sometime opposed . Sometimes, we are better people if we suppress our empathic feeling. p145 My friend (psychologist) does get into her clients' heads, she would be useless if she couldn't - but she doesn't feel what they fee. She employs understanding and caring, not empathy.p149 There is a world difference, between understanding the misery of the person who is talking to you because you have felt misery in the past, even though now you are calm, and understanding the misery of the person who is talking to you because  you are mirroring them and feeling their misery right now. The first, which doesn't involve empathy in any sense, just understanding, has all advantages of the second and none of its cost.p154 My worst moments as a father aren't when I don't care, they're when I care too much, when I cannot disengage from my children's frustration and pain.  --my comment: so true for me.Against Fairness by Stephen T. AsmaThe Empathy Exams: Essays by Leslie Jamison3. Emotional Empathy is morally corrosive Empathy more precisely emotional empathy: the capacity feel what other people feels. The main focus of this book, this kind of empathy is what the author against.Simply mirror other people's feeling. The act of feeling what you believe other people feel - experience what they experience. The act of coming to experience the world as you think someone else does, also called sympathy by philosophers Adam Smith and David Humep17 As Adam Smith put it, we have capacity to think about another person and ""place ourselves in his situation.... and become in some measure the same person with him, and thence form some idea of his sensations, and even feel something which, though weaker in degree, is not altogether unlike him."" This is emotional empathy, feel what you feel.Emotional Empathy is biased and parochial; it is spotlight (metaphor, narrow focus, only light up the area you focus, ignore surrounding) , it focus on certain people at the expense of others; it is innumerate (we often pay too much attention to one person, ignore too many suffering), it is not in the direction of increase of justice, so it distort our moral and policy decision in ways cause suffering instead of relieving it.

192,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1216728-sophia,4,"In most respects, this is a really good book; it's the author defending a specific, at first glance controversial, idea and backing it up with science, history and reason. It’s very accessible, a decent length, including arguments and counter arguments and counter counter arguments. Anyone interested in morality should give it a read. Bloom essentially argues that the human tendency of literally feeling what someone else is feeling, “emotional empathy”, is detrimental to individuals and society as a whole, for 3 main reasons: it’s more often paralyzing than motivating, it’s unnecessarily painful, and it is inescapably limited in scope. Instead, all of what’s good about people can be attributed to compassion; caring without feeling the same thing.The idea I agreed with the most was that empathy is a problem because it is limited in scope, meaning the human mind can only handle feeling empathy for a limited number of individuals at a time, and invariably those individuals are “ranked” by closeness (family, friends, neighbours, other). This makes it a cousin of racism in a weird sense; by shining a spotlight on just your people, you can so ignore everyone else that you don’t notice the harm you cause. So in war, it’s not so much a lack of empathy for the enemy (which on it’s own would just lead to apathy) but an excess of empathy towards your own group, or any other group which moves you to do something, blind to anyone else. While it would be nice to extend empathy to the enemy, that’s just not how our brains were wired. Along the same lines, I personally appreciated the change in perspective from thinking of empathy as the source of morality to just a manifestation of it. A couple months ago, I went through a mini crisis where I had to stop reading the news, because I realized behind every death toll number were actual people, who were terrified for their lives, and then had that snuffed out; and there was just so much death and pain, but I didn’t want to stop feeling this connection, because I worried that would be callous, denying reality. The idea that empathy is just not the tool for the job helps a lot; instead it’s better that I feel compassion, a detached awareness of a problem, followed by an evaluation of whether I can do anything to help; not so I would feel better, but just to help. If empathy was causing me to turn off the news so that I would feel less pain, then clearly it was a problem not a solution.The idea that compassion not only can but should replace empathy was a little harder to swallow, but the more I think about it, the more I agree. I started trying to find an example to prove this wrong, and an easy one popped up on tv: spring breakers continuing to gather despite the coronavirus lockdown. At first glance, it seems that these millennials (eye roll) were not feeling any empathy for the elderly and the sick at risk, and if they had, they would have stayed home. While this is true, it would actually be enough for them just to feel compassion, and in hindsight, that’s what jumpstarted me into proper self-isolation; in the early days, I saw the numbers, and realized with the 14 day incubation period there was no other way to stop this, so I stayed home, before even the Italian death toll hit 1000. Only later did I come across the personal stories of some of the victims, making me want to curl up in a ball and cry; but while that technically would also keep me at home, compassion left me the presence of mind to plan how to avoid trips outside, contact my relatives to provide helpful information, and avoid hoarding toilet paper. In a similar vein, there’s currently the debate about whether the economy is “worth” the lives of the elderly and infirm. Anyone arguing using empathy would be horrified at the idea that the economy should factor into such a decision, but actually if the economy collapses, so too will future healthcare and medical research, leading possibly to even more deaths, not to mention suffering from just lower quality of life. Now, is the economy really going to collapse? Maybe not, but its not going to be empathy, but rational, albeit compassionate, analysis that will find the answer. Like with this, most other legal and political decisions would benefit from taking a step back from empathy, and just dealing with compassion; the alternative results in one-sided views that devolves into entrenched partisanship, as we currently see.On the topic of news, Bloom actually missed a golden opportunity to criticize the media for it’s practice of starting almost every article with some first-name basis narrative about some victim; as if the reader couldn’t be brought to care unless there was a soul behind each tragedy. It always really bothered me to read this; on the one hand because it gave me pain when all I wanted was information, on the other hand because it glaringly defied the objectivity I would hope for in the news. Bloom brings up the case of how you can just as easily empathize with poor young black Americans afraid for their lives, or with self-sacrificing police officers, trying to help their city but afraid for their lives; yet oh so rarely can people do both. But we shouldn’t try; and the news should stop trying to get that to happen. Instead, we should just be presented with cold hard facts that help with better decision making on how much power and trianing to give police and what kind of reform programs work.The main problem with this book is I think Bloom gives too much “credit” to empathy, and disregards other forms of “emotional decision making” behind many of the problems he attributes to empathy. War in particular he argues comes down to one side feeling empathy for some victim, and taking up arms to fight against the aggressor. But actually empathy, as he writes elsewhere, is often paralyzing, especially when the emotion involved is fear and trauma; instead seeing this in others often provokes anger instead, and it is this that leads people to war. So just like he claims mainstream definition of empathy is jut “everything good and nice about people”, he tends to attribute every non-selfish emotional action to empathy. If instead of being “against empathy” he had more accurately stated his position as “against emotional decision making” I think he would reveal himself as being far less controversial than his title suggests (nor as original).Also, an important omission from his thesis is whether it is even possible to have compassion without empathy; he argues for us to make decisions like this, which is fine, but can you as a human develop a sense of compassion, for anyone, without first feeling empathy? Bloom repeatedly hints that you can, but while he talks about individuals without both empathy and compassion (psychopaths), he doesn’t mention a class of people without empathy but with compassion. Well actually, he does mention Buddhist monks, but they learn this state of enlightenment, they're not naturally endowed with it. He also claims children have instincts of compassion without showing corresponding empathy, but the child’s version of compassion is not particularly useful. The story he gives is of a toddler, who has learned that showing off his belly makes adults smile. One day his older brother gets hurt, and in an attempt to make his brother feel better, he shows him his belly. While clearly the “theory of mind” that his brother was hurting was there, and the instinct to try and help as well, but the chosen solution was not particularly helpful. Instead, being able to feel empathy, as in imagine also being hurt, would allow for a more appropriate response. So ultimately, I still suspect Bloom is wrong about empathy, even by his narrow definition, being only an impediment. My intuitive theory would be that empathy is a necessary tool for learning not only what could hurt us, but also what could make us feel better and as a consequence could help others feel better. If you have a friend who just had a tough breakup, and you yourself have never even dated, compassion may not even be enough to realize why the situation is painful, and therefore what you as a friend could do to help. Yes, in the grand scheme of things, its better for the friend to have broken off from a bad relationship, but that is not the consolation that’s going to help right in that moment. If the situation were reversed, I think it would be nice to have a compassionate friend, but I would really want an empathic best friend. In conclusion, in the grand scheme of decision making, empathy can be as detrimental as racism, focusing a spotlight only on a small group for not objective reasons. But I don’t think deep interpersonal relationships would be possible without it. "
193,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2896545-meg,2,"The basic argument here is one that I can certainly get behind: We should strive for more cognitive empathy, but less emotional empathy. Our decisions and policies should be driven primarily by rational evaluation of how we can do the most good with our resources, rather than exhausting our resources through the avenues that tug most on our heartstrings.I had a few major problems, though, too. In the end, Paul Bloom and I fundamentally disagree in our worldviews. This manifested in three particular ways throughout the book:1) As a white, straight, male, affluent, American Yale professor, Bloom writes from a place of EXTREME privilege...and he makes virtually no effort to even acknowledge this, let alone compensate for it. Many of his points were weakened for me by the fact that they wouldn't hold up if the privilege was removed.2) Bloom is, by his own admission, not a sincere advocate of making personal sacrifices for the common good. He writes, ""I could never take seriously people who refuse to take long flights to see those they love because of worries about contributing to climate change. Or even those who put their children into a public school that they know to be terrible even though they can easily afford a private school, just out of a broader principle of common good. Even when it comes to charity, I am not a good utilitarian."" As a Gryffindor and a 1 on the Enneagram, this is not just foreign to me, it's repulsive.3) I couldn't get past the feeling that a lot of this book was written out of semantic quibbling between the scholarly elite. The sensationalist title soon gave way to a core position that, while it made sense, was less revolutionary than one might expect.All in all, I'm still grateful to this book. The fact that I disagreed with certain points and favored others was a helpful exercise in critical reading. I was motivated to think deeply while reading and came out with a much more nuanced understanding of empathy and my associated beliefs. I'm not at all suggesting that others shouldn't read this book -- but if you do read it, just make sure you do so through a critical lens."
194,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46716546-weronika,2,"It might be a three stars book, but I vowed to subtract a star for any book that quotes the marshmallow study results (the book quotes the marshmallow study results!!!). It is, in fact, a poorly organised sequence of paragraphs commenting on a variety of studies that could be loosely linked with or interpreted in the context of empathy. Mixed into that is some useful literature (Adam Smith, of all people!) and some colourful, though somewhat clichéd examples from history (Abe Lincoln saving piglets!). The argument is not without merit -- empathy, rather than a force for good, is a force for tribalism. We feel more for people like us. When a victim is like us, and the perpetrator is unlike us, we feel disproportionately more for the victim. If the victim is unlike us, but the perpetrator belongs to our tribe, we tend to dismiss the victim and feel for the perpetrator. Empathy is also number-blind; we care for one, but not for hundreds. Empathy stirs injustice -- in studies quoted in the book, people would move kids up the treatment lists disregarding other children, just because they knew that one kid and did not know the rest of them. And of course there are the Nazis, there is Hitler. The author is also right to add (after Smith) that empathy only makes us sympathize with those who feel bad. Empathetic people do not experience joy and happiness when others experience happiness or achieve success. They envy them. The capacity for ""positive"" empathy is limited to ""small joys"" in life. And so, Bloom claims, we should rather focus on compassion, sort of Buddhist-style. And the argument seems to be valid, it's just the book that is bad."
195,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14711872-jamie,3,"The attention grabbing title suggests a shocking case study, but Paul Bloom's subtitle is a much better metric for what this thoughtful book presents. Empathy is defined as ""the act of coming to experience the world as you think someone else does,"" and it does not refer to compassion or understanding but rather emotional assumptions which are devoid of reason. At first, the work felt like a reprimand over semantics since most of society would define empathy as an appeal to understanding through dialogue. But once Bloom distinguishes empathy from deliberative reasoning and cognitive empathy, his denigration of this practice unveils empathy's limitations and dangers. Logic and reason should be given precedence in order to capacitate self-control, intelligence, and balanced compassion for the future.Bloom's writing is unexpectedly humorous with tongue-in-cheek making this an entertaining read. Unfortunately, he frames every idea precisely with plenty of caveats that almost negate many of his statements. He seems to expect, and tries to prevent, critique of his findings which results in long-winded lines of dialogue that end up saying very little with each point. This round-about quantifying of ideas suggests that his thesis is not as shocking or profound as he may have wished it to be. However, the examples he offers illustrate his view and prove that empathy is not the cure all for humanities problems, and the perception that empathy is a superior trait is certainly called into question. Morality is motivating but ambiguous, and it is far more important to practice reason and emotional intelligence in the pursuit of a better future."

I think he makes some compelling arguments, the most convincing of which was that his narrowly-defined version of empathy serves as a tool to prioritize a single person over thousands or millions of people, which can be used for both good AND for bad - it's apolitical and amoral (i.e. how empathy for orphans in latin american countries causes more harm than good w/ white savior volunteering trips, unsustainable orphanage businesses, and fake orphans as a ""tourist trap""). he is a little insensitive about certain topics at times, and also denies his white privilege on one occasion, which was interesting. ultimately I think his final thesis is pretty reasonable, it is just not an amazingly well written book."

I estimate that, sure, we are heading to a more and more rational civilization, but 350,000 years is still too short for an advanced developed civilization. We are, after all, an average species on an average planet. But why against compassion. We are actually doing really great under this ""not-quite-rational-but-very-compassionate"" world.No matter how the society evolves, the compassionate ones always have comparative advantage in survival.

I think it is a great essay that was diluted into book. On several occasions I found myself skimming through some sections which instead of reinforcing (or repeating) an idea or argument were actually straying off the path. For this reason I even contemplated giving it 3 stars before settling to 4. In the end, I settled for 4 stars. I didn't do it out of empathy for the effort the author put in it, but for the great content.

200,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,2,"The death of one man is a tragedy, the death of millions is a statistic.-	Joseph StalinAgainst Empathy? Who could be against empathy? You might as well say you’re against puppies!Against Empathy: The Case for Rational Compassion has a provocative title (deliberately so, for $ales purposes no doubt), but the claim Paul Bloom (Professor of psychology and cognitive science at Yale University) is making is substantially more banal. Bloom claims that, while empathy can serve as a spotlight, focusing attention on issues of importance, it more often than not leads to morally incorrect conclusions. Instead, he argues that ‘rational compassion’ serves as a better guide for determining our correct moral course of action. Before getting into details we first need to define what Bloom means by ‘empathy’. Bloom considers empathy to be the ability to put oneself in another’s shoes and to feel the things that they are feeling. This is illustrated by Bill Clinton’s famous quip “I feel your pain” and differs from sympathy or compassion in important ways. Here’s an example to help illustrate the difference between these concepts. Say your friend’s beloved pet dies and they are heartbroken as a consequence. Feeling your friend’s sadness is an example of Bloom’s empathy. On the other hand, if you were to comfort a child who fears there are monsters in the closet, you would not be experiencing the fear the child is feeling (since you presumably know that monsters don’t exist). This is therefore an example of compassion, and not empathy. So, how does empathy steer us wrong? Here’s one way … let’s say you witness a child receiving vaccination shots. The child screams and cries and later develops redness and swelling around the injection site and experiences obvious discomfort. You empathize so much with the child’s plight you crusade against childhood vaccinations vowing to end the suffering brought about by the shots. Unfortunately, this leads to a resurgence of polio that kills thousands and paralyzes tens of thousands as well as measles which kills tens of thousands and sickens millions. This is a morally reprehensible outcome brought about by an excess of empathy. Another way in which empathy steers us wrong is that it makes us care about those with whom we are close, but does a poor job in getting us to respond to the tragedies of strangers. As Adam Smith famously wrote (comparing the loss of someone’s pinky finger to a hypothetical earthquake in China that kills millions):If he was to lose his little finger to-morrow, he would not sleep to-night; but, provided he never saw them, he will snore with the most profound security over the ruin of a hundred millions of his brethren, and the destruction of that immense multitude seems plainly an object less interesting to him, than this paltry misfortune of his own.Instead, Bloom argues that rational compassion (a mixture of caring coupled with a detached cost-benefit analysis) provides a better moral compass for guiding our behavior, especially as it takes the broader consequences of ones actions into consideration. We can choose to be kind and act to alleviate the suffering of others without experiencing the misery of their condition. To which I can only respond … Meh. Is this even an interesting question? Obviously, the consequences of moral actions are meaningful. If I help an old lady cross a street only to steer her into the path of an oncoming bus … I probably shouldn’t expect that boy scout merit badge. Outcomes matter, but who thinks otherwise?Also, Bloom is forced to pepper the pages of his book with innumerable caveats which dilute his argument. Empathy can often be good, Bloom concedes. It can bring attention to a social needs and aid in charitable giving. Empathy also has many different definitions, to some it can mean kindness, to others … sympathy, all of which Bloom supports. Thus in order to make his argument cohesive Bloom first has to reduce it to a watery gruel. If I were to define ‘puppies’ as those things that crap on the rug and chew my shoes to shreds, then I’m against puppies! Bloom is similarly forced into a narrow definition of ‘empathy’ and as such must concede so much ground from the get-go one wonders why he felt this was an argument worth having. In reality what he is arguing against are over-emotional decisions that one arrives at through a knee jerk reaction. Of course if he were to have titled the book Against Over-Emotional Decisions Based Upon Knee Jerk Reactions it would have been greeted with a collective yawn. Let’s imagine for a moment that Bloom is correct on every point and in every particular, then what? Would we then set about a program of changing human nature so as to eliminate empathy from the human psyche? Of course not. Could we convince humanity to suddenly begin debating moral issues only in rational terms? The idea is laughable … as evidence I point to every comments section of every web page on the entire internet. Not only is this an uninteresting question, the ideas Bloom puts forth could be fully explored in a magazine article length treatment. In fact, you’ll find my full rebuttal of this point in an upcoming book Against Text Padding: The Case for Making a Concise Point. I’m going to publish it on a postage stamp."

I wish I’d read it with a highlighter. It challenged my preconceptions (a wonderful trait in books). It was humorous and engrossing. The writer was engaging, logical, and thorough in his research. He quoted philosophers who agreed with him and those who didn’t, always explaining why he believes as he does.WHAT I DIDN’T LIKE: I wish the book had been longer and even more in depth."
205,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5863458-andrea-mcdowell,2,"Imagine an entire book written critiquing empathy--written by a psychologist, no less--that doesn't once mention attachment theory or the importance of that close atunement by a caregiver during a child's formative years for psychological development. This will give you an idea of the considerable gaps in reasoning in this book that purports to demonstrate how importance reasoning (paired with compassion rather than empathy) is to proper moral decision making. A selection of other, similar gaps:p. 106: argument that it doesn't matter to a starving child if they are given food by a smiling face or if the food is dropped by a drone. Of course it matters. Raise your hand if you see no difference between birthday presents dropped off by drone rather than delivered by the smiling faces of your friends and family. People, particularly children, need to know that they are important and that they matter to people *as people*, and this is hardly communicated by a drone drop. The entire bit just before that about the kid who got a job on wall street so he could make large donations to the poor. While this is obviously an improvement over getting a job on wall street so you can buy a yacht, it does--contrary to Bloom's conclusion-without-support--makes things worse for the global poor. The investment machine that Wall Street powers is directly, intimately and daily linked to the actions of global companies who deprive people of land, food, and their lives. He can't possibly be ignorant of this; it smacks of cherry-picking.p. 107: He dismisses the claim that literature increases empathy, completely ignoring the scientific research that demonstrate that it does. p. 126: He argues that working on climate changes has nothing to do with empathy, as there are no identifiable Others with which to empathize. This book was written in America in 2016. At that time, California was experiencing the worst drought of its history, fueled by climate change. The Syrian refugee crisis, spurred in large part by a climate-change drought in the north of the country, was raging at that time. Both crises dominated the news with pictures of drowned toddlers, boats full of desperate people with nowhere to go, etc. No identifiable others? What planet was Bloom living on? I work in climate change. This is not a ""pale statistical abstraction"" for me, but is daily fueled by the impacts I know this is having on people, animals and landscapes. p. 154: Parenting. Here is where you would think attachment theory would make an appearance. Nope! Instead he makes a curious argument (repeated throughout the book) that empathy uniquely enslaves people and makes it impossible to consider how to respond using reason. I'll come back to this.p. 183-185: Psychopaths! Here, Bloom argues by aphorism. That is, he includes quotes by famous people asserting that a thing must be so, without providing evidence, and then concludes that indeed it is so. Eg. a quote from Steven Pinker about how crimes and violence committed in the name of morality ""would surely outnumber the fatalities from amoral conquest and predation,"" and accepts this statement as fact. Oh? Give us a statistic, Bloom. Give us some numbers with a source. You might think he'd have something to say here about the legendary lack of empathy in psychopaths. Nope!p. 232: IQ tests! ""A long time ago people said things like 'IQ tests just measure how good you are at doing IQ tests,' but nobody takes this seriously anymore."" (This in an argument about how IQ tests measure the potential for life success, as some kind of corollary argument for reason or reasoning ability--he never clarifies the connection he tries to draw here.) So I typed that phrase--IQ tests just measure how good you are at taking IQ tests--into google, and found this article from 2017 https://theconversation.com/the-iq-te... and this from 2014 https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/... . Seems like the conversation over the utility of IQ tests continues to rage on, Paul.Not to mention that describing IQ tests as good arbiters of reasoning ability, and claiming that no one questions this anymore, without discussing the differing results between different demographic groups and how completely obvious it is that privilege and material well-being factor into higher IQ scores--is racist and sexist. p. 234: ""I said that if you were curious about what sort of person a child would grow up to be, an intelligence test would be a great measure."" Fun! So, I was in a gifted program from grade 4-grade 13/OAC, said program based on the results of universally administered aptitude/IQ tests within the schools. Everyone I went to school with did extremely well on IQ tests, within the top 1-2 percentile.Yes, there are neurosurgeons and professors and lawyers within that group of people.There are also highschool and university drop-outs who have spent their entire adult lives bewailing how unfairly life has treated them because they are GENIUSES goddammit and they DESERVE better.So.Later on he talks about the importance of self-control and how well this was demonstrated in the infamous Marshmallow Test. Which has now been debunked as a measure of affluence rather than willpower. https://www.theatlantic.com/family/ar...p. 238: Here he talks about how good people are at reasoning in every day matters such as whether to buy a house or local politics such as zoning regulations. ""My own experience is that the level of rational discourse here is high,"" he says.Dear Lord. Apparently Paul Bloom, alone among North American adults, has never heard of NIMBYism. As an environmental professional now for a few decades, let me state categorically that the level of rational discourse in local political and planning matter is abysmal, and emotion plays an enormous role in the conclusions people draw. I used to work in wind energy and read a study at that time showing that people who claimed negative health impacts from a local wind farm were almost certain to be able to see it from a window in their house; didn't matter how far away it was or whether they could hear it or not. And keep in mind that Mr. Bloom wrote the sentences defending the rationality of everyday Americans in whether or not to purchase a house in 2016, a mere 8 years after the mortgage crisis.So this is a small collection of my ""Oh my god you have got to be kidding me"" moments from reading this book, but you might be wondering about the overall argument.I picked up the book on the strength of Kate Manne's mentioning of it in her book Down Girl, where she writes of his claim that empathy is ""biased and innumerate"": that is, that the empathy we feel reflects our own biases, and favours the one over the many. Manne then expands on this to discuss how empathy flows up the social hierarchy, and our society's tendency to, for example, express empathy towards perpetrators (""this allegation will destroy his career!"") over victims. That was the best part of Against Empathy, and having read it, you can probably skip the rest of the book. On the strength of it, I gave it two stars rather than one.But its weaknesses are many. A short list:1. The definition of empathy changes on every page to be whatever Bloom needs it to be in order to dismiss it. At the beginning of the book, empathy can be directed towards groups at a distance: he uses the example of the Sandy Hook massacre. At the end of the book, empathy can only be triggered in direct proximity to one or a small group of people who are directly emoting in your presence. At the beginning, again as with the Sandy Hook example, the empathy inspired isn't directly feeling exactly what the other person is feeling--he wouldn't and doesn't claim he feels the same rage and grief as the children's parents do--but at the end it is direct and exact mirroring, and only this mirroring, that counts as empathy. I could go on.2. Of course, any emotion or capacity joined to Reason is going to be superior to any emotion or capacity specifically entirely unconnected to Reason, so saying Compassion + Reason is a better guide to moral decision making than Empathy Alone is ... obvious. Let's experiment: Anger + Reason is better than Love Alone (think: people stalking the object of their romantic obsession, people using anger plus critical reasoning to advance social causes). Shame + Reason is better than Happiness Alone (research showing that the single-minded pursuit of happiness is linked with selfishness and moral deterioration; the capacity of reasoning one's way out of shame to restore social bonds and inspire moral improvement). Hate + Reason is better than Joy Alone (I have to admit that this is a tricky one, but I think a person who can reason about their hate can identify bridges that needed burning and separate themselves from destructive people and relationships much better than people who think any sign of hate is a moral failing; and Joy, if it comes at another's expense and is expressed without consideration of that fact, could be hurtful). We should simply assume and act as if all of our capacities are better when we can reason them through.3. He never explains why empathy is so impossible to reason through; he simply states that he himself can't do it, and then seems to assume that no one else can either. But of course empathy can join with Reason; an effective parent will do so as a matter of daily course. He brings up an example of how empathy would make a parent unable to subject their child to vaccinations because of the pain from the needle, but this is nonsense. Empathy simply makes it easier for the parent to understand and respond to the child's pain and confusion afterwards. Compassion wouldn't cut it.My daughter has a genetic syndrome that was only diagnosed when she was nearly 14. She had many, many tests beginning in infancy to try to diagnose it. I will never forget the first, when she was a tiny baby, about 5 lbs at the time, and it took me and two nurses to pin her down while they drew blood from her little arms. And I wept while she screamed, in her confusion and pain and fear. It did not stop me from getting her tested. It did provide a break of balancing the pain of any given test from the benefit of whatever knowledge we expected to gain from it, which is what happens when empathy is joined with reason.4. All feelings have a purpose. We are creatures who evolved, and we share these feelings with many of our non-human relatives; they have adaptive and survival value or they wouldn't exist. Any argument that tries to do away with any particular feeling must, I believe, acknowledge and understand the value that exists before a coherent and convincing argument can be made against it. This goes for the Dalai Lama's incessant harping against anger, Brene Brown's wholly unconvincing dismissal of shame, and it goes here for Paul Bloom's devaluation of empathy. 5. He repeatedly insists that the idea that people are incapable of truly reasoning is baseless, without providing any convincing argument against the vast evidence--never mentioned--that human reasoning ability is inextricably connected with emotion. That neurologically people are incapable of reaching conclusions without emotions. His argument reflects an unearned faith in the existence of One True Reasonable Conclusion for any argument; of course, there isn't one. This isn't, as he claims, a dismissal of Reason; it's an admission of its limitations and its inherent dependency on our emotional responses. We reason using thoughts and feelings, and any reasoned conclusions is partially dependent on feelings which must be admitted to and explored as part of a reasoned exploration. There are plenty of people out there who claim that there beliefs that the earth is flat, that climate change is a hoax, that vaccines cause autism, etc. are reasoned arguments based on evidence, which they clearly are not. His own book would have been better if he himself had done so.On page 10, Bloom lists his main influences for his argument against empathy and for reason:Richard DavidsonSam Harris (article about his assertion that black americans score lower on IQ tests because they are less intelligent here: https://www.vox.com/2018/4/9/17210248...)Jesse PrinzPeter Singer (disabled humans not persons; adult gorillas are persons; apparently supports the rights of parents to kill their disabled children? http://web.archive.org/web/2017030700...)Michael LynchMichael Shermer (multiple accusations of sexual assault: https://www.buzzfeed.com/markoppenhei...)Hrm.

The title of this book consists of two parts, the ""against empathy"" part and the ""rational compassion"" part. I expected the author to go into each aspect in depth , arguing at first why empathy is a bad thing, then proposing the replacement and explaining how we can use the replacement to avoid the negative consequences of empathy.And here lies my main issue with this book, the author dedicates 5 chapters out of 6 to the arguments against empathy. and while that is already an unbalanced ratio for both arguments, I felt the last chapter was wasted on arguing if human beings are actually rational or not rather than explaining how being rational is the solution to the problems of empathy. so after finishing the book even 
if
 you agree that empathy is bad , you are left with nothing , just feeling bad about having a normal human emotion, and not knowing what to do about it.my second issue that I have with the book is the writing style. the book is written in a sort of a discussion like style , first arguing for one side then after that saying how one would counter that argument . And while acknowledging criticism and counter arguments is way better than stating your side of the argument as facts, it is done here in a really bad way that left me more often than not confused rather than informed. And if that was not enough already , the author tend to go off tracks A LOT either with unnecessary examples or with topics that seem unrelated to the main topic at hand. Here is an illustration how Paul Bloom presents his ideas I can't deny that he did have a point on the limitation of empathy , that it is like a spotlight , it is narrow and it can lead to hasty decisions that have unwanted consequences, and it may not be the emotion that can save humanity from evil( if you are someone who thinks this way than maybe this book has a lot to offer you). But that wasn't enough to convince me to have a similar opinion like the author and be ""Against empathy"". for me the only takeaway from this book was that we shouldn't act based strictly on emotions (empathy or other emotions like anger ) and that we should try to be as rational as possible before making any decisions."
208,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28727983-e,3,"Empathy is a poor way to make decisions, mostly because it inhibits rationality. It causes us to overvalue the proximate and undervalue the distant (he didn't bring this up, but that's also a reason people don't buy enough insurance, or eat healthy). Empathy screws up how we spend our ""charity dollars,"" how we react to wrongs, how we prioritize the use of scarce resources, and more. Bloom is not against compassion, mind you; he is against empathy as frequently defined as ""feeling yourself what you imagine others must be feeling."" Lots of studies have shown that when you get the studies' subjects to feel empathetically toward others, their rationality immediately goes down the tube. Heck, get them to feel empathy toward someone being mistreated, and then ask him how they would punish an unrelated wrong, and their proposed punishments get much harsher.This is Bloom's main argument. He makes it well near the beginning of the book, but kind of rambles and wanders the rest of the way. He talks about brain waves. He talks about how conservatives aren't actually less empathetic than liberals. He tries to talk about how empathy affects intimate relationships but never really gets there. He defends rationality when it comes to morality (I found this to be quite insightful, and important, but he doesn't connect it well to the rest of the book). And, though he is careful to define empathy precisely, he doesn't always hold himself to that definition when critiquing it.So I docked him a few stars. He also obviously doesn't know how to deal with religion. He mentions it in passing, although I would argue it affects profoundly the arguments he is trying to make. (It might even help his case. I would argue, for example, that the Biblical faith is all for rational morality. I would also argue that it would warn us against taking empathy too far, but it might not be as pessimistic as is Bloom.)So an interesting read, especially if you're trying to make better decisions (or feel better about yourself for not being very empathetic)."

I guess it's a good book if you're new to the notion of affective empathy not being that good. But we autistic activists have been familiar with the notion for decades.

You'll read them and hopefully you'll be better towards people who don't use their empathy.I thought the book would be autistic friendly. I thought it would also tackle the idea that cognitive empathy is mandatory to have a right to exist. I thought it would talk about how cognitive empathy is relative, how autistic and allistic people have trouble standing in each other's shoes, but how cognitive empathy is useless if you know how to LISTEN and if you're willing to be a kind, moral person once you've listened enough. It didn't. In fact, I had trouble going on once I read that you can't be a good person with a good moral compass if you don't ""have"" cognitive empathy. Showing how the author doesn't know shit about cognitive empathy. He based his book on his neurotypical views of empathy, and I couldn't relate. And I actually knew more, and better than him. I'm deeply disappointed by the book, and I won't read this author again.Now, it's probably a good introduction if you know nothing about empathy. It challenges your views and tackles several misconceptions. I'd recommend you read it if you think the problem with empathy is we don't have enough of it. Still, chapter one is basically a repeat of the prologue, and the ideas are repeated over and over, there is a Q/A section that I thought was very out of place... And once you've been convinced that you don't need to empathize to make good moral decisions and/or be a compassionate and kind person, it pretty much stops being interesting.

The author is against emotional empathy. Emotional empathy let us to feel what other people feels, mirror people's feeling, which could be so distraught to paralyze us to take effective action and narrow focus of bias could make us to make unwise actions. Cognitive empathy make us understand other people's feeling without experiencing it, lead us positive compassion, kindness , reasoning, more effective way to help people.Statistical data and reasoning seem always cold, hard to stir people to act, and ever worse when data and reasoning against our intuition and our bias, like ""identifiable victim effect"".

Author's own conclusion---1. Our moral decisions and actions are powerfully shaped by the force of empathy.---2. This often make the world worse.---3. We have the capacity to do better.2. Cognitive empathy is morally neutral. cognitive empathy: understand you feel, but do not feel it. It is positive compassion, kindness. The understanding and feeling are different neuron processing, you can understand it without feeling it, that is cognitive empathy. We are much better to use reasons, cost-benefit, compassion, kindness to make decisions, give intelligently, with eye towards consequence. Depersonalize the process and circumvent our natural preference and bias, with compassion for others, rational-making taking happiness and suffering into account. Reduce our candidates to X, Y, Z, designing procedure such as blind reviewing and blind auditions. Bring everyone down rather than bring everyone up. Don't try to make them (strangers) more weight. Rather, make yourself less weight. Bring everyone to the same level by diminish yourself. Put yourself, and those you love, on the level of strangers. p138 Buddhist texts distinguish ""sentimental compassion"", which corresponds to what we could call empathy and ""great compassion"", which is what we would simply called compassion. The first is to be avoid, as it exhausts the bodhisattva. It's the second that is worth pursing. Great compssion is more distanced and reserved, and can be sustained indefinitely.... In contrast to (emotional) empathy, compassion does not means sharing the suffering of others: rather, it is characterized by feeling of warmth, concern and care for other, as well as a strong motivation to improve the other's well-being. Compassion is feeling for and not feeling with the other. p139 There is a neural difference: Empathy training led to increased activation in the insula and anterior cingulate cortes. Compassion training led to activation in other parts of the brain, such as the medical orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum.p141 Mindful meditation reduces activation of the brain networks associated with simulating the feeling of people in distress, in favour of networks associated with feelings of social affiliation. Buddhist scholar Thupten Jinpa: ""Meditation-based training enables practitioners to move quickly from feeling the distress of others to acting with compassion to alleviated it.""... Not only can compassion and kindness exist independently of empathy, they are sometime opposed . Sometimes, we are better people if we suppress our empathic feeling. p145 My friend (psychologist) does get into her clients' heads, she would be useless if she couldn't - but she doesn't feel what they fee. She employs understanding and caring, not empathy.p149 There is a world difference, between understanding the misery of the person who is talking to you because you have felt misery in the past, even though now you are calm, and understanding the misery of the person who is talking to you because  you are mirroring them and feeling their misery right now. The first, which doesn't involve empathy in any sense, just understanding, has all advantages of the second and none of its cost.p154 My worst moments as a father aren't when I don't care, they're when I care too much, when I cannot disengage from my children's frustration and pain.  --my comment: so true for me.Against Fairness by Stephen T.

The main focus of this book, this kind of empathy is what the author against.Simply mirror other people's feeling. The act of feeling what you believe other people feel - experience what they experience. The act of coming to experience the world as you think someone else does, also called sympathy by philosophers Adam Smith and David Humep17 As Adam Smith put it, we have capacity to think about another person and ""place ourselves in his situation.... and become in some measure the same person with him, and thence form some idea of his sensations, and even feel something which, though weaker in degree, is not altogether unlike him."" This is emotional empathy, feel what you feel.Emotional Empathy is biased and parochial; it is spotlight (metaphor, narrow focus, only light up the area you focus, ignore surrounding) , it focus on certain people at the expense of others; it is innumerate (we often pay too much attention to one person, ignore too many suffering), it is not in the direction of increase of justice, so it distort our moral and policy decision in ways cause suffering instead of relieving it.

222,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1216728-sophia,4,"In most respects, this is a really good book; it's the author defending a specific, at first glance controversial, idea and backing it up with science, history and reason. It’s very accessible, a decent length, including arguments and counter arguments and counter counter arguments. Anyone interested in morality should give it a read. Bloom essentially argues that the human tendency of literally feeling what someone else is feeling, “emotional empathy”, is detrimental to individuals and society as a whole, for 3 main reasons: it’s more often paralyzing than motivating, it’s unnecessarily painful, and it is inescapably limited in scope. Instead, all of what’s good about people can be attributed to compassion; caring without feeling the same thing.The idea I agreed with the most was that empathy is a problem because it is limited in scope, meaning the human mind can only handle feeling empathy for a limited number of individuals at a time, and invariably those individuals are “ranked” by closeness (family, friends, neighbours, other). This makes it a cousin of racism in a weird sense; by shining a spotlight on just your people, you can so ignore everyone else that you don’t notice the harm you cause. So in war, it’s not so much a lack of empathy for the enemy (which on it’s own would just lead to apathy) but an excess of empathy towards your own group, or any other group which moves you to do something, blind to anyone else. While it would be nice to extend empathy to the enemy, that’s just not how our brains were wired. Along the same lines, I personally appreciated the change in perspective from thinking of empathy as the source of morality to just a manifestation of it. A couple months ago, I went through a mini crisis where I had to stop reading the news, because I realized behind every death toll number were actual people, who were terrified for their lives, and then had that snuffed out; and there was just so much death and pain, but I didn’t want to stop feeling this connection, because I worried that would be callous, denying reality. The idea that empathy is just not the tool for the job helps a lot; instead it’s better that I feel compassion, a detached awareness of a problem, followed by an evaluation of whether I can do anything to help; not so I would feel better, but just to help. If empathy was causing me to turn off the news so that I would feel less pain, then clearly it was a problem not a solution.The idea that compassion not only can but should replace empathy was a little harder to swallow, but the more I think about it, the more I agree. I started trying to find an example to prove this wrong, and an easy one popped up on tv: spring breakers continuing to gather despite the coronavirus lockdown. At first glance, it seems that these millennials (eye roll) were not feeling any empathy for the elderly and the sick at risk, and if they had, they would have stayed home. While this is true, it would actually be enough for them just to feel compassion, and in hindsight, that’s what jumpstarted me into proper self-isolation; in the early days, I saw the numbers, and realized with the 14 day incubation period there was no other way to stop this, so I stayed home, before even the Italian death toll hit 1000. Only later did I come across the personal stories of some of the victims, making me want to curl up in a ball and cry; but while that technically would also keep me at home, compassion left me the presence of mind to plan how to avoid trips outside, contact my relatives to provide helpful information, and avoid hoarding toilet paper. In a similar vein, there’s currently the debate about whether the economy is “worth” the lives of the elderly and infirm. Anyone arguing using empathy would be horrified at the idea that the economy should factor into such a decision, but actually if the economy collapses, so too will future healthcare and medical research, leading possibly to even more deaths, not to mention suffering from just lower quality of life. Now, is the economy really going to collapse? Maybe not, but its not going to be empathy, but rational, albeit compassionate, analysis that will find the answer. Like with this, most other legal and political decisions would benefit from taking a step back from empathy, and just dealing with compassion; the alternative results in one-sided views that devolves into entrenched partisanship, as we currently see.On the topic of news, Bloom actually missed a golden opportunity to criticize the media for it’s practice of starting almost every article with some first-name basis narrative about some victim; as if the reader couldn’t be brought to care unless there was a soul behind each tragedy. It always really bothered me to read this; on the one hand because it gave me pain when all I wanted was information, on the other hand because it glaringly defied the objectivity I would hope for in the news. Bloom brings up the case of how you can just as easily empathize with poor young black Americans afraid for their lives, or with self-sacrificing police officers, trying to help their city but afraid for their lives; yet oh so rarely can people do both. But we shouldn’t try; and the news should stop trying to get that to happen. Instead, we should just be presented with cold hard facts that help with better decision making on how much power and trianing to give police and what kind of reform programs work.The main problem with this book is I think Bloom gives too much “credit” to empathy, and disregards other forms of “emotional decision making” behind many of the problems he attributes to empathy. War in particular he argues comes down to one side feeling empathy for some victim, and taking up arms to fight against the aggressor. But actually empathy, as he writes elsewhere, is often paralyzing, especially when the emotion involved is fear and trauma; instead seeing this in others often provokes anger instead, and it is this that leads people to war. So just like he claims mainstream definition of empathy is jut “everything good and nice about people”, he tends to attribute every non-selfish emotional action to empathy. If instead of being “against empathy” he had more accurately stated his position as “against emotional decision making” I think he would reveal himself as being far less controversial than his title suggests (nor as original).Also, an important omission from his thesis is whether it is even possible to have compassion without empathy; he argues for us to make decisions like this, which is fine, but can you as a human develop a sense of compassion, for anyone, without first feeling empathy? Bloom repeatedly hints that you can, but while he talks about individuals without both empathy and compassion (psychopaths), he doesn’t mention a class of people without empathy but with compassion. Well actually, he does mention Buddhist monks, but they learn this state of enlightenment, they're not naturally endowed with it. He also claims children have instincts of compassion without showing corresponding empathy, but the child’s version of compassion is not particularly useful. The story he gives is of a toddler, who has learned that showing off his belly makes adults smile. One day his older brother gets hurt, and in an attempt to make his brother feel better, he shows him his belly. While clearly the “theory of mind” that his brother was hurting was there, and the instinct to try and help as well, but the chosen solution was not particularly helpful. Instead, being able to feel empathy, as in imagine also being hurt, would allow for a more appropriate response. So ultimately, I still suspect Bloom is wrong about empathy, even by his narrow definition, being only an impediment. My intuitive theory would be that empathy is a necessary tool for learning not only what could hurt us, but also what could make us feel better and as a consequence could help others feel better. If you have a friend who just had a tough breakup, and you yourself have never even dated, compassion may not even be enough to realize why the situation is painful, and therefore what you as a friend could do to help. Yes, in the grand scheme of things, its better for the friend to have broken off from a bad relationship, but that is not the consolation that’s going to help right in that moment. If the situation were reversed, I think it would be nice to have a compassionate friend, but I would really want an empathic best friend. In conclusion, in the grand scheme of decision making, empathy can be as detrimental as racism, focusing a spotlight only on a small group for not objective reasons. But I don’t think deep interpersonal relationships would be possible without it. "
223,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2896545-meg,2,"The basic argument here is one that I can certainly get behind: We should strive for more cognitive empathy, but less emotional empathy. Our decisions and policies should be driven primarily by rational evaluation of how we can do the most good with our resources, rather than exhausting our resources through the avenues that tug most on our heartstrings.I had a few major problems, though, too. In the end, Paul Bloom and I fundamentally disagree in our worldviews. This manifested in three particular ways throughout the book:1) As a white, straight, male, affluent, American Yale professor, Bloom writes from a place of EXTREME privilege...and he makes virtually no effort to even acknowledge this, let alone compensate for it. Many of his points were weakened for me by the fact that they wouldn't hold up if the privilege was removed.2) Bloom is, by his own admission, not a sincere advocate of making personal sacrifices for the common good. He writes, ""I could never take seriously people who refuse to take long flights to see those they love because of worries about contributing to climate change. Or even those who put their children into a public school that they know to be terrible even though they can easily afford a private school, just out of a broader principle of common good. Even when it comes to charity, I am not a good utilitarian."" As a Gryffindor and a 1 on the Enneagram, this is not just foreign to me, it's repulsive.3) I couldn't get past the feeling that a lot of this book was written out of semantic quibbling between the scholarly elite. The sensationalist title soon gave way to a core position that, while it made sense, was less revolutionary than one might expect.All in all, I'm still grateful to this book. The fact that I disagreed with certain points and favored others was a helpful exercise in critical reading. I was motivated to think deeply while reading and came out with a much more nuanced understanding of empathy and my associated beliefs. I'm not at all suggesting that others shouldn't read this book -- but if you do read it, just make sure you do so through a critical lens."

It is, in fact, a poorly organised sequence of paragraphs commenting on a variety of studies that could be loosely linked with or interpreted in the context of empathy.

The argument is not without merit -- empathy, rather than a force for good, is a force for tribalism. We feel more for people like us. When a victim is like us, and the perpetrator is unlike us, we feel disproportionately more for the victim. If the victim is unlike us, but the perpetrator belongs to our tribe, we tend to dismiss the victim and feel for the perpetrator. Empathy is also number-blind; we care for one, but not for hundreds. Empathy stirs injustice -- in studies quoted in the book, people would move kids up the treatment lists disregarding other children, just because they knew that one kid and did not know the rest of them. And of course there are the Nazis, there is Hitler. The author is also right to add (after Smith) that empathy only makes us sympathize with those who feel bad. Empathetic people do not experience joy and happiness when others experience happiness or achieve success. They envy them. The capacity for ""positive"" empathy is limited to ""small joys"" in life. And so, Bloom claims, we should rather focus on compassion, sort of Buddhist-style. And the argument seems to be valid, it's just the book that is bad."
225,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14711872-jamie,3,"The attention grabbing title suggests a shocking case study, but Paul Bloom's subtitle is a much better metric for what this thoughtful book presents. Empathy is defined as ""the act of coming to experience the world as you think someone else does,"" and it does not refer to compassion or understanding but rather emotional assumptions which are devoid of reason. At first, the work felt like a reprimand over semantics since most of society would define empathy as an appeal to understanding through dialogue. But once Bloom distinguishes empathy from deliberative reasoning and cognitive empathy, his denigration of this practice unveils empathy's limitations and dangers. Logic and reason should be given precedence in order to capacitate self-control, intelligence, and balanced compassion for the future.Bloom's writing is unexpectedly humorous with tongue-in-cheek making this an entertaining read. Unfortunately, he frames every idea precisely with plenty of caveats that almost negate many of his statements. He seems to expect, and tries to prevent, critique of his findings which results in long-winded lines of dialogue that end up saying very little with each point. This round-about quantifying of ideas suggests that his thesis is not as shocking or profound as he may have wished it to be. However, the examples he offers illustrate his view and prove that empathy is not the cure all for humanities problems, and the perception that empathy is a superior trait is certainly called into question. Morality is motivating but ambiguous, and it is far more important to practice reason and emotional intelligence in the pursuit of a better future."

I think he makes some compelling arguments, the most convincing of which was that his narrowly-defined version of empathy serves as a tool to prioritize a single person over thousands or millions of people, which can be used for both good AND for bad - it's apolitical and amoral (i.e. how empathy for orphans in latin american countries causes more harm than good w/ white savior volunteering trips, unsustainable orphanage businesses, and fake orphans as a ""tourist trap""). he is a little insensitive about certain topics at times, and also denies his white privilege on one occasion, which was interesting. ultimately I think his final thesis is pretty reasonable, it is just not an amazingly well written book."

And we currently have been evolving for 350,000 years. I estimate that, sure, we are heading to a more and more rational civilization, but 350,000 years is still too short for an advanced developed civilization. We are, after all, an average species on an average planet. But why against compassion. We are actually doing really great under this ""not-quite-rational-but-very-compassionate"" world.No matter how the society evolves, the compassionate ones always have comparative advantage in survival.

I think it is a great essay that was diluted into book. On several occasions I found myself skimming through some sections which instead of reinforcing (or repeating) an idea or argument were actually straying off the path. For this reason I even contemplated giving it 3 stars before settling to 4. In the end, I settled for 4 stars. I didn't do it out of empathy for the effort the author put in it, but for the great content.

230,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,2,"The death of one man is a tragedy, the death of millions is a statistic.-	Joseph StalinAgainst Empathy? Who could be against empathy? You might as well say you’re against puppies!Against Empathy: The Case for Rational Compassion has a provocative title (deliberately so, for $ales purposes no doubt), but the claim Paul Bloom (Professor of psychology and cognitive science at Yale University) is making is substantially more banal. Bloom claims that, while empathy can serve as a spotlight, focusing attention on issues of importance, it more often than not leads to morally incorrect conclusions. Instead, he argues that ‘rational compassion’ serves as a better guide for determining our correct moral course of action. Before getting into details we first need to define what Bloom means by ‘empathy’. Bloom considers empathy to be the ability to put oneself in another’s shoes and to feel the things that they are feeling. This is illustrated by Bill Clinton’s famous quip “I feel your pain” and differs from sympathy or compassion in important ways. Here’s an example to help illustrate the difference between these concepts. Say your friend’s beloved pet dies and they are heartbroken as a consequence. Feeling your friend’s sadness is an example of Bloom’s empathy. On the other hand, if you were to comfort a child who fears there are monsters in the closet, you would not be experiencing the fear the child is feeling (since you presumably know that monsters don’t exist). This is therefore an example of compassion, and not empathy. So, how does empathy steer us wrong? Here’s one way … let’s say you witness a child receiving vaccination shots. The child screams and cries and later develops redness and swelling around the injection site and experiences obvious discomfort. You empathize so much with the child’s plight you crusade against childhood vaccinations vowing to end the suffering brought about by the shots. Unfortunately, this leads to a resurgence of polio that kills thousands and paralyzes tens of thousands as well as measles which kills tens of thousands and sickens millions. This is a morally reprehensible outcome brought about by an excess of empathy. Another way in which empathy steers us wrong is that it makes us care about those with whom we are close, but does a poor job in getting us to respond to the tragedies of strangers. As Adam Smith famously wrote (comparing the loss of someone’s pinky finger to a hypothetical earthquake in China that kills millions):If he was to lose his little finger to-morrow, he would not sleep to-night; but, provided he never saw them, he will snore with the most profound security over the ruin of a hundred millions of his brethren, and the destruction of that immense multitude seems plainly an object less interesting to him, than this paltry misfortune of his own.Instead, Bloom argues that rational compassion (a mixture of caring coupled with a detached cost-benefit analysis) provides a better moral compass for guiding our behavior, especially as it takes the broader consequences of ones actions into consideration. We can choose to be kind and act to alleviate the suffering of others without experiencing the misery of their condition. To which I can only respond … Meh. Is this even an interesting question? Obviously, the consequences of moral actions are meaningful. If I help an old lady cross a street only to steer her into the path of an oncoming bus … I probably shouldn’t expect that boy scout merit badge. Outcomes matter, but who thinks otherwise?Also, Bloom is forced to pepper the pages of his book with innumerable caveats which dilute his argument. Empathy can often be good, Bloom concedes. It can bring attention to a social needs and aid in charitable giving. Empathy also has many different definitions, to some it can mean kindness, to others … sympathy, all of which Bloom supports. Thus in order to make his argument cohesive Bloom first has to reduce it to a watery gruel. If I were to define ‘puppies’ as those things that crap on the rug and chew my shoes to shreds, then I’m against puppies! Bloom is similarly forced into a narrow definition of ‘empathy’ and as such must concede so much ground from the get-go one wonders why he felt this was an argument worth having. In reality what he is arguing against are over-emotional decisions that one arrives at through a knee jerk reaction. Of course if he were to have titled the book Against Over-Emotional Decisions Based Upon Knee Jerk Reactions it would have been greeted with a collective yawn. Let’s imagine for a moment that Bloom is correct on every point and in every particular, then what? Would we then set about a program of changing human nature so as to eliminate empathy from the human psyche? Of course not. Could we convince humanity to suddenly begin debating moral issues only in rational terms? The idea is laughable … as evidence I point to every comments section of every web page on the entire internet. Not only is this an uninteresting question, the ideas Bloom puts forth could be fully explored in a magazine article length treatment. In fact, you’ll find my full rebuttal of this point in an upcoming book Against Text Padding: The Case for Making a Concise Point. I’m going to publish it on a postage stamp."
231,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1349032-juliane-roell,1,"The author makes a rather poor argument that probably could have been summed up in a short essay.

234,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11138286-kari,5,"Against Empathy puts forth the position that empathy is not only largely impotent as a force for good, but can actually be a force for harm, bigotry, violence, etc. The author argues that reason and a distanced compassion is far superior to empathy as a benefit to society.WHAT I LIKED: I loved this book! I wish I’d read it with a highlighter. It challenged my preconceptions (a wonderful trait in books). It was humorous and engrossing. The writer was engaging, logical, and thorough in his research. He quoted philosophers who agreed with him and those who didn’t, always explaining why he believes as he does.WHAT I DIDN’T LIKE: I wish the book had been longer and even more in depth."
235,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5863458-andrea-mcdowell,2,"Imagine an entire book written critiquing empathy--written by a psychologist, no less--that doesn't once mention attachment theory or the importance of that close atunement by a caregiver during a child's formative years for psychological development. This will give you an idea of the considerable gaps in reasoning in this book that purports to demonstrate how importance reasoning (paired with compassion rather than empathy) is to proper moral decision making. A selection of other, similar gaps:p. 106: argument that it doesn't matter to a starving child if they are given food by a smiling face or if the food is dropped by a drone. Of course it matters. Raise your hand if you see no difference between birthday presents dropped off by drone rather than delivered by the smiling faces of your friends and family. People, particularly children, need to know that they are important and that they matter to people *as people*, and this is hardly communicated by a drone drop. The entire bit just before that about the kid who got a job on wall street so he could make large donations to the poor. While this is obviously an improvement over getting a job on wall street so you can buy a yacht, it does--contrary to Bloom's conclusion-without-support--makes things worse for the global poor. The investment machine that Wall Street powers is directly, intimately and daily linked to the actions of global companies who deprive people of land, food, and their lives. He can't possibly be ignorant of this; it smacks of cherry-picking.p. 107: He dismisses the claim that literature increases empathy, completely ignoring the scientific research that demonstrate that it does. p. 126: He argues that working on climate changes has nothing to do with empathy, as there are no identifiable Others with which to empathize. This book was written in America in 2016. At that time, California was experiencing the worst drought of its history, fueled by climate change. The Syrian refugee crisis, spurred in large part by a climate-change drought in the north of the country, was raging at that time. Both crises dominated the news with pictures of drowned toddlers, boats full of desperate people with nowhere to go, etc. No identifiable others? What planet was Bloom living on? I work in climate change. This is not a ""pale statistical abstraction"" for me, but is daily fueled by the impacts I know this is having on people, animals and landscapes. p. 154: Parenting. Here is where you would think attachment theory would make an appearance. Nope! Instead he makes a curious argument (repeated throughout the book) that empathy uniquely enslaves people and makes it impossible to consider how to respond using reason. I'll come back to this.p. 183-185: Psychopaths! Here, Bloom argues by aphorism. That is, he includes quotes by famous people asserting that a thing must be so, without providing evidence, and then concludes that indeed it is so. Eg. a quote from Steven Pinker about how crimes and violence committed in the name of morality ""would surely outnumber the fatalities from amoral conquest and predation,"" and accepts this statement as fact. Oh? Give us a statistic, Bloom. Give us some numbers with a source. You might think he'd have something to say here about the legendary lack of empathy in psychopaths. Nope!p. 232: IQ tests! ""A long time ago people said things like 'IQ tests just measure how good you are at doing IQ tests,' but nobody takes this seriously anymore."" (This in an argument about how IQ tests measure the potential for life success, as some kind of corollary argument for reason or reasoning ability--he never clarifies the connection he tries to draw here.) So I typed that phrase--IQ tests just measure how good you are at taking IQ tests--into google, and found this article from 2017 https://theconversation.com/the-iq-te... and this from 2014 https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/... . Seems like the conversation over the utility of IQ tests continues to rage on, Paul.Not to mention that describing IQ tests as good arbiters of reasoning ability, and claiming that no one questions this anymore, without discussing the differing results between different demographic groups and how completely obvious it is that privilege and material well-being factor into higher IQ scores--is racist and sexist. p. 234: ""I said that if you were curious about what sort of person a child would grow up to be, an intelligence test would be a great measure."" Fun! So, I was in a gifted program from grade 4-grade 13/OAC, said program based on the results of universally administered aptitude/IQ tests within the schools. Everyone I went to school with did extremely well on IQ tests, within the top 1-2 percentile.Yes, there are neurosurgeons and professors and lawyers within that group of people.There are also highschool and university drop-outs who have spent their entire adult lives bewailing how unfairly life has treated them because they are GENIUSES goddammit and they DESERVE better.So.Later on he talks about the importance of self-control and how well this was demonstrated in the infamous Marshmallow Test. Which has now been debunked as a measure of affluence rather than willpower. https://www.theatlantic.com/family/ar...p. 238: Here he talks about how good people are at reasoning in every day matters such as whether to buy a house or local politics such as zoning regulations. ""My own experience is that the level of rational discourse here is high,"" he says.Dear Lord. Apparently Paul Bloom, alone among North American adults, has never heard of NIMBYism. As an environmental professional now for a few decades, let me state categorically that the level of rational discourse in local political and planning matter is abysmal, and emotion plays an enormous role in the conclusions people draw. I used to work in wind energy and read a study at that time showing that people who claimed negative health impacts from a local wind farm were almost certain to be able to see it from a window in their house; didn't matter how far away it was or whether they could hear it or not. And keep in mind that Mr. Bloom wrote the sentences defending the rationality of everyday Americans in whether or not to purchase a house in 2016, a mere 8 years after the mortgage crisis.So this is a small collection of my ""Oh my god you have got to be kidding me"" moments from reading this book, but you might be wondering about the overall argument.I picked up the book on the strength of Kate Manne's mentioning of it in her book Down Girl, where she writes of his claim that empathy is ""biased and innumerate"": that is, that the empathy we feel reflects our own biases, and favours the one over the many. Manne then expands on this to discuss how empathy flows up the social hierarchy, and our society's tendency to, for example, express empathy towards perpetrators (""this allegation will destroy his career!"") over victims. That was the best part of Against Empathy, and having read it, you can probably skip the rest of the book. On the strength of it, I gave it two stars rather than one.But its weaknesses are many. A short list:1. The definition of empathy changes on every page to be whatever Bloom needs it to be in order to dismiss it. At the beginning of the book, empathy can be directed towards groups at a distance: he uses the example of the Sandy Hook massacre. At the end of the book, empathy can only be triggered in direct proximity to one or a small group of people who are directly emoting in your presence. At the beginning, again as with the Sandy Hook example, the empathy inspired isn't directly feeling exactly what the other person is feeling--he wouldn't and doesn't claim he feels the same rage and grief as the children's parents do--but at the end it is direct and exact mirroring, and only this mirroring, that counts as empathy. I could go on.2. Of course, any emotion or capacity joined to Reason is going to be superior to any emotion or capacity specifically entirely unconnected to Reason, so saying Compassion + Reason is a better guide to moral decision making than Empathy Alone is ... obvious. Let's experiment: Anger + Reason is better than Love Alone (think: people stalking the object of their romantic obsession, people using anger plus critical reasoning to advance social causes). Shame + Reason is better than Happiness Alone (research showing that the single-minded pursuit of happiness is linked with selfishness and moral deterioration; the capacity of reasoning one's way out of shame to restore social bonds and inspire moral improvement). Hate + Reason is better than Joy Alone (I have to admit that this is a tricky one, but I think a person who can reason about their hate can identify bridges that needed burning and separate themselves from destructive people and relationships much better than people who think any sign of hate is a moral failing; and Joy, if it comes at another's expense and is expressed without consideration of that fact, could be hurtful). We should simply assume and act as if all of our capacities are better when we can reason them through.3. He never explains why empathy is so impossible to reason through; he simply states that he himself can't do it, and then seems to assume that no one else can either. But of course empathy can join with Reason; an effective parent will do so as a matter of daily course. He brings up an example of how empathy would make a parent unable to subject their child to vaccinations because of the pain from the needle, but this is nonsense. Empathy simply makes it easier for the parent to understand and respond to the child's pain and confusion afterwards. Compassion wouldn't cut it.My daughter has a genetic syndrome that was only diagnosed when she was nearly 14. She had many, many tests beginning in infancy to try to diagnose it. I will never forget the first, when she was a tiny baby, about 5 lbs at the time, and it took me and two nurses to pin her down while they drew blood from her little arms. And I wept while she screamed, in her confusion and pain and fear. It did not stop me from getting her tested. It did provide a break of balancing the pain of any given test from the benefit of whatever knowledge we expected to gain from it, which is what happens when empathy is joined with reason.4. All feelings have a purpose. We are creatures who evolved, and we share these feelings with many of our non-human relatives; they have adaptive and survival value or they wouldn't exist. Any argument that tries to do away with any particular feeling must, I believe, acknowledge and understand the value that exists before a coherent and convincing argument can be made against it. This goes for the Dalai Lama's incessant harping against anger, Brene Brown's wholly unconvincing dismissal of shame, and it goes here for Paul Bloom's devaluation of empathy. 5. He repeatedly insists that the idea that people are incapable of truly reasoning is baseless, without providing any convincing argument against the vast evidence--never mentioned--that human reasoning ability is inextricably connected with emotion. That neurologically people are incapable of reaching conclusions without emotions. His argument reflects an unearned faith in the existence of One True Reasonable Conclusion for any argument; of course, there isn't one. This isn't, as he claims, a dismissal of Reason; it's an admission of its limitations and its inherent dependency on our emotional responses. We reason using thoughts and feelings, and any reasoned conclusions is partially dependent on feelings which must be admitted to and explored as part of a reasoned exploration. There are plenty of people out there who claim that there beliefs that the earth is flat, that climate change is a hoax, that vaccines cause autism, etc. are reasoned arguments based on evidence, which they clearly are not. His own book would have been better if he himself had done so.On page 10, Bloom lists his main influences for his argument against empathy and for reason:Richard DavidsonSam Harris (article about his assertion that black americans score lower on IQ tests because they are less intelligent here: https://www.vox.com/2018/4/9/17210248...)Jesse PrinzPeter Singer (disabled humans not persons; adult gorillas are persons; apparently supports the rights of parents to kill their disabled children? http://web.archive.org/web/2017030700...)Michael LynchMichael Shermer (multiple accusations of sexual assault: https://www.buzzfeed.com/markoppenhei...)Hrm. What kinds of conclusions do you think a person is going to reach with influences like these?Let's ignore the fact that they are all white, able-bodied, male, and with the exception of one, straight.Let's consider that this list is 50% known unrepentant asshole.Essentially, Paul Bloom sets up a straw man of unconstrained empathy without the benefit of any reasoning counterbalance and spends about 240 pages pummeling it with half-facts and anecdotes.

The title of this book consists of two parts, the ""against empathy"" part and the ""rational compassion"" part. I expected the author to go into each aspect in depth , arguing at first why empathy is a bad thing, then proposing the replacement and explaining how we can use the replacement to avoid the negative consequences of empathy.And here lies my main issue with this book, the author dedicates 5 chapters out of 6 to the arguments against empathy. and while that is already an unbalanced ratio for both arguments, I felt the last chapter was wasted on arguing if human beings are actually rational or not rather than explaining how being rational is the solution to the problems of empathy. so after finishing the book even 
if
 you agree that empathy is bad , you are left with nothing , just feeling bad about having a normal human emotion, and not knowing what to do about it.my second issue that I have with the book is the writing style. the book is written in a sort of a discussion like style , first arguing for one side then after that saying how one would counter that argument . And while acknowledging criticism and counter arguments is way better than stating your side of the argument as facts, it is done here in a really bad way that left me more often than not confused rather than informed. And if that was not enough already , the author tend to go off tracks A LOT either with unnecessary examples or with topics that seem unrelated to the main topic at hand. Here is an illustration how Paul Bloom presents his ideas I can't deny that he did have a point on the limitation of empathy , that it is like a spotlight , it is narrow and it can lead to hasty decisions that have unwanted consequences, and it may not be the emotion that can save humanity from evil( if you are someone who thinks this way than maybe this book has a lot to offer you). But that wasn't enough to convince me to have a similar opinion like the author and be ""Against empathy"". for me the only takeaway from this book was that we shouldn't act based strictly on emotions (empathy or other emotions like anger ) and that we should try to be as rational as possible before making any decisions."
238,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28727983-e,3,"Empathy is a poor way to make decisions, mostly because it inhibits rationality. It causes us to overvalue the proximate and undervalue the distant (he didn't bring this up, but that's also a reason people don't buy enough insurance, or eat healthy). Empathy screws up how we spend our ""charity dollars,"" how we react to wrongs, how we prioritize the use of scarce resources, and more. Bloom is not against compassion, mind you; he is against empathy as frequently defined as ""feeling yourself what you imagine others must be feeling."" Lots of studies have shown that when you get the studies' subjects to feel empathetically toward others, their rationality immediately goes down the tube. Heck, get them to feel empathy toward someone being mistreated, and then ask him how they would punish an unrelated wrong, and their proposed punishments get much harsher.This is Bloom's main argument. He makes it well near the beginning of the book, but kind of rambles and wanders the rest of the way. He talks about brain waves. He talks about how conservatives aren't actually less empathetic than liberals. He tries to talk about how empathy affects intimate relationships but never really gets there. He defends rationality when it comes to morality (I found this to be quite insightful, and important, but he doesn't connect it well to the rest of the book). And, though he is careful to define empathy precisely, he doesn't always hold himself to that definition when critiquing it.So I docked him a few stars. He also obviously doesn't know how to deal with religion. He mentions it in passing, although I would argue it affects profoundly the arguments he is trying to make. (It might even help his case. I would argue, for example, that the Biblical faith is all for rational morality. I would also argue that it would warn us against taking empathy too far, but it might not be as pessimistic as is Bloom.)So an interesting read, especially if you're trying to make better decisions (or feel better about yourself for not being very empathetic)."

I guess it's a good book if you're new to the notion of affective empathy not being that good. But we autistic activists have been familiar with the notion for decades. You'll find so many good blog posts and tumblr or twitter rants on the subject matter from people in the neurodivergent political sphere. It will be better than this book. You'll have more answers. You'll read them and hopefully you'll be better towards people who don't use their empathy.I thought the book would be autistic friendly. I thought it would also tackle the idea that cognitive empathy is mandatory to have a right to exist. I thought it would talk about how cognitive empathy is relative, how autistic and allistic people have trouble standing in each other's shoes, but how cognitive empathy is useless if you know how to LISTEN and if you're willing to be a kind, moral person once you've listened enough. It didn't. In fact, I had trouble going on once I read that you can't be a good person with a good moral compass if you don't ""have"" cognitive empathy. Showing how the author doesn't know shit about cognitive empathy. He based his book on his neurotypical views of empathy, and I couldn't relate. And I actually knew more, and better than him. I'm deeply disappointed by the book, and I won't read this author again.Now, it's probably a good introduction if you know nothing about empathy. It challenges your views and tackles several misconceptions. I'd recommend you read it if you think the problem with empathy is we don't have enough of it. Still, chapter one is basically a repeat of the prologue, and the ideas are repeated over and over, there is a Q/A section that I thought was very out of place... And once you've been convinced that you don't need to empathize to make good moral decisions and/or be a compassionate and kind person, it pretty much stops being interesting. I thought it would go a lot further."

The author is against emotional empathy. Emotional empathy let us to feel what other people feels, mirror people's feeling, which could be so distraught to paralyze us to take effective action and narrow focus of bias could make us to make unwise actions. Cognitive empathy make us understand other people's feeling without experiencing it, lead us positive compassion, kindness , reasoning, more effective way to help people.Statistical data and reasoning seem always cold, hard to stir people to act, and ever worse when data and reasoning against our intuition and our bias, like ""identifiable victim effect"".

Author's own conclusion---1. Our moral decisions and actions are powerfully shaped by the force of empathy.---2. This often make the world worse.---3. We have the capacity to do better.2. Cognitive empathy is morally neutral. cognitive empathy: understand you feel, but do not feel it. It is positive compassion, kindness. The understanding and feeling are different neuron processing, you can understand it without feeling it, that is cognitive empathy. We are much better to use reasons, cost-benefit, compassion, kindness to make decisions, give intelligently, with eye towards consequence. Depersonalize the process and circumvent our natural preference and bias, with compassion for others, rational-making taking happiness and suffering into account. Reduce our candidates to X, Y, Z, designing procedure such as blind reviewing and blind auditions. Bring everyone down rather than bring everyone up. Don't try to make them (strangers) more weight. Rather, make yourself less weight. Bring everyone to the same level by diminish yourself. Put yourself, and those you love, on the level of strangers. p138 Buddhist texts distinguish ""sentimental compassion"", which corresponds to what we could call empathy and ""great compassion"", which is what we would simply called compassion. The first is to be avoid, as it exhausts the bodhisattva. It's the second that is worth pursing. Great compssion is more distanced and reserved, and can be sustained indefinitely.... In contrast to (emotional) empathy, compassion does not means sharing the suffering of others: rather, it is characterized by feeling of warmth, concern and care for other, as well as a strong motivation to improve the other's well-being. Compassion is feeling for and not feeling with the other. p139 There is a neural difference: Empathy training led to increased activation in the insula and anterior cingulate cortes. Compassion training led to activation in other parts of the brain, such as the medical orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum.p141 Mindful meditation reduces activation of the brain networks associated with simulating the feeling of people in distress, in favour of networks associated with feelings of social affiliation. Buddhist scholar Thupten Jinpa: ""Meditation-based training enables practitioners to move quickly from feeling the distress of others to acting with compassion to alleviated it.""... Not only can compassion and kindness exist independently of empathy, they are sometime opposed . Sometimes, we are better people if we suppress our empathic feeling. p145 My friend (psychologist) does get into her clients' heads, she would be useless if she couldn't - but she doesn't feel what they fee. She employs understanding and caring, not empathy.p149 There is a world difference, between understanding the misery of the person who is talking to you because you have felt misery in the past, even though now you are calm, and understanding the misery of the person who is talking to you because  you are mirroring them and feeling their misery right now. The first, which doesn't involve empathy in any sense, just understanding, has all advantages of the second and none of its cost.p154 My worst moments as a father aren't when I don't care, they're when I care too much, when I cannot disengage from my children's frustration and pain.  --my comment: so true for me.Against Fairness by Stephen T.

The main focus of this book, this kind of empathy is what the author against.Simply mirror other people's feeling. The act of feeling what you believe other people feel - experience what they experience. The act of coming to experience the world as you think someone else does, also called sympathy by philosophers Adam Smith and David Humep17 As Adam Smith put it, we have capacity to think about another person and ""place ourselves in his situation.... and become in some measure the same person with him, and thence form some idea of his sensations, and even feel something which, though weaker in degree, is not altogether unlike him."" This is emotional empathy, feel what you feel.Emotional Empathy is biased and parochial; it is spotlight (metaphor, narrow focus, only light up the area you focus, ignore surrounding) , it focus on certain people at the expense of others; it is innumerate (we often pay too much attention to one person, ignore too many suffering), it is not in the direction of increase of justice, so it distort our moral and policy decision in ways cause suffering instead of relieving it.

252,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1216728-sophia,4,"In most respects, this is a really good book; it's the author defending a specific, at first glance controversial, idea and backing it up with science, history and reason. It’s very accessible, a decent length, including arguments and counter arguments and counter counter arguments. Anyone interested in morality should give it a read. Bloom essentially argues that the human tendency of literally feeling what someone else is feeling, “emotional empathy”, is detrimental to individuals and society as a whole, for 3 main reasons: it’s more often paralyzing than motivating, it’s unnecessarily painful, and it is inescapably limited in scope. Instead, all of what’s good about people can be attributed to compassion; caring without feeling the same thing.The idea I agreed with the most was that empathy is a problem because it is limited in scope, meaning the human mind can only handle feeling empathy for a limited number of individuals at a time, and invariably those individuals are “ranked” by closeness (family, friends, neighbours, other). This makes it a cousin of racism in a weird sense; by shining a spotlight on just your people, you can so ignore everyone else that you don’t notice the harm you cause. So in war, it’s not so much a lack of empathy for the enemy (which on it’s own would just lead to apathy) but an excess of empathy towards your own group, or any other group which moves you to do something, blind to anyone else. While it would be nice to extend empathy to the enemy, that’s just not how our brains were wired. Along the same lines, I personally appreciated the change in perspective from thinking of empathy as the source of morality to just a manifestation of it. A couple months ago, I went through a mini crisis where I had to stop reading the news, because I realized behind every death toll number were actual people, who were terrified for their lives, and then had that snuffed out; and there was just so much death and pain, but I didn’t want to stop feeling this connection, because I worried that would be callous, denying reality. The idea that empathy is just not the tool for the job helps a lot; instead it’s better that I feel compassion, a detached awareness of a problem, followed by an evaluation of whether I can do anything to help; not so I would feel better, but just to help. If empathy was causing me to turn off the news so that I would feel less pain, then clearly it was a problem not a solution.The idea that compassion not only can but should replace empathy was a little harder to swallow, but the more I think about it, the more I agree. I started trying to find an example to prove this wrong, and an easy one popped up on tv: spring breakers continuing to gather despite the coronavirus lockdown. At first glance, it seems that these millennials (eye roll) were not feeling any empathy for the elderly and the sick at risk, and if they had, they would have stayed home. While this is true, it would actually be enough for them just to feel compassion, and in hindsight, that’s what jumpstarted me into proper self-isolation; in the early days, I saw the numbers, and realized with the 14 day incubation period there was no other way to stop this, so I stayed home, before even the Italian death toll hit 1000. Only later did I come across the personal stories of some of the victims, making me want to curl up in a ball and cry; but while that technically would also keep me at home, compassion left me the presence of mind to plan how to avoid trips outside, contact my relatives to provide helpful information, and avoid hoarding toilet paper. In a similar vein, there’s currently the debate about whether the economy is “worth” the lives of the elderly and infirm. Anyone arguing using empathy would be horrified at the idea that the economy should factor into such a decision, but actually if the economy collapses, so too will future healthcare and medical research, leading possibly to even more deaths, not to mention suffering from just lower quality of life. Now, is the economy really going to collapse? Maybe not, but its not going to be empathy, but rational, albeit compassionate, analysis that will find the answer. Like with this, most other legal and political decisions would benefit from taking a step back from empathy, and just dealing with compassion; the alternative results in one-sided views that devolves into entrenched partisanship, as we currently see.On the topic of news, Bloom actually missed a golden opportunity to criticize the media for it’s practice of starting almost every article with some first-name basis narrative about some victim; as if the reader couldn’t be brought to care unless there was a soul behind each tragedy. It always really bothered me to read this; on the one hand because it gave me pain when all I wanted was information, on the other hand because it glaringly defied the objectivity I would hope for in the news. Bloom brings up the case of how you can just as easily empathize with poor young black Americans afraid for their lives, or with self-sacrificing police officers, trying to help their city but afraid for their lives; yet oh so rarely can people do both. But we shouldn’t try; and the news should stop trying to get that to happen. Instead, we should just be presented with cold hard facts that help with better decision making on how much power and trianing to give police and what kind of reform programs work.The main problem with this book is I think Bloom gives too much “credit” to empathy, and disregards other forms of “emotional decision making” behind many of the problems he attributes to empathy. War in particular he argues comes down to one side feeling empathy for some victim, and taking up arms to fight against the aggressor. But actually empathy, as he writes elsewhere, is often paralyzing, especially when the emotion involved is fear and trauma; instead seeing this in others often provokes anger instead, and it is this that leads people to war. So just like he claims mainstream definition of empathy is jut “everything good and nice about people”, he tends to attribute every non-selfish emotional action to empathy. If instead of being “against empathy” he had more accurately stated his position as “against emotional decision making” I think he would reveal himself as being far less controversial than his title suggests (nor as original).Also, an important omission from his thesis is whether it is even possible to have compassion without empathy; he argues for us to make decisions like this, which is fine, but can you as a human develop a sense of compassion, for anyone, without first feeling empathy? Bloom repeatedly hints that you can, but while he talks about individuals without both empathy and compassion (psychopaths), he doesn’t mention a class of people without empathy but with compassion. Well actually, he does mention Buddhist monks, but they learn this state of enlightenment, they're not naturally endowed with it. He also claims children have instincts of compassion without showing corresponding empathy, but the child’s version of compassion is not particularly useful. The story he gives is of a toddler, who has learned that showing off his belly makes adults smile. One day his older brother gets hurt, and in an attempt to make his brother feel better, he shows him his belly. While clearly the “theory of mind” that his brother was hurting was there, and the instinct to try and help as well, but the chosen solution was not particularly helpful. Instead, being able to feel empathy, as in imagine also being hurt, would allow for a more appropriate response. So ultimately, I still suspect Bloom is wrong about empathy, even by his narrow definition, being only an impediment. My intuitive theory would be that empathy is a necessary tool for learning not only what could hurt us, but also what could make us feel better and as a consequence could help others feel better. If you have a friend who just had a tough breakup, and you yourself have never even dated, compassion may not even be enough to realize why the situation is painful, and therefore what you as a friend could do to help. Yes, in the grand scheme of things, its better for the friend to have broken off from a bad relationship, but that is not the consolation that’s going to help right in that moment. If the situation were reversed, I think it would be nice to have a compassionate friend, but I would really want an empathic best friend. In conclusion, in the grand scheme of decision making, empathy can be as detrimental as racism, focusing a spotlight only on a small group for not objective reasons. But I don’t think deep interpersonal relationships would be possible without it. "
253,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2896545-meg,2,"The basic argument here is one that I can certainly get behind: We should strive for more cognitive empathy, but less emotional empathy. Our decisions and policies should be driven primarily by rational evaluation of how we can do the most good with our resources, rather than exhausting our resources through the avenues that tug most on our heartstrings.I had a few major problems, though, too. In the end, Paul Bloom and I fundamentally disagree in our worldviews. This manifested in three particular ways throughout the book:1) As a white, straight, male, affluent, American Yale professor, Bloom writes from a place of EXTREME privilege...and he makes virtually no effort to even acknowledge this, let alone compensate for it. Many of his points were weakened for me by the fact that they wouldn't hold up if the privilege was removed.2) Bloom is, by his own admission, not a sincere advocate of making personal sacrifices for the common good. He writes, ""I could never take seriously people who refuse to take long flights to see those they love because of worries about contributing to climate change. Or even those who put their children into a public school that they know to be terrible even though they can easily afford a private school, just out of a broader principle of common good. Even when it comes to charity, I am not a good utilitarian."" As a Gryffindor and a 1 on the Enneagram, this is not just foreign to me, it's repulsive.3) I couldn't get past the feeling that a lot of this book was written out of semantic quibbling between the scholarly elite. The sensationalist title soon gave way to a core position that, while it made sense, was less revolutionary than one might expect.All in all, I'm still grateful to this book. The fact that I disagreed with certain points and favored others was a helpful exercise in critical reading. I was motivated to think deeply while reading and came out with a much more nuanced understanding of empathy and my associated beliefs. I'm not at all suggesting that others shouldn't read this book -- but if you do read it, just make sure you do so through a critical lens."
254,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46716546-weronika,2,"It might be a three stars book, but I vowed to subtract a star for any book that quotes the marshmallow study results (the book quotes the marshmallow study results!!!). It is, in fact, a poorly organised sequence of paragraphs commenting on a variety of studies that could be loosely linked with or interpreted in the context of empathy. Mixed into that is some useful literature (Adam Smith, of all people!) and some colourful, though somewhat clichéd examples from history (Abe Lincoln saving piglets!). The argument is not without merit -- empathy, rather than a force for good, is a force for tribalism. We feel more for people like us. When a victim is like us, and the perpetrator is unlike us, we feel disproportionately more for the victim. If the victim is unlike us, but the perpetrator belongs to our tribe, we tend to dismiss the victim and feel for the perpetrator. Empathy is also number-blind; we care for one, but not for hundreds. Empathy stirs injustice -- in studies quoted in the book, people would move kids up the treatment lists disregarding other children, just because they knew that one kid and did not know the rest of them. And of course there are the Nazis, there is Hitler. The author is also right to add (after Smith) that empathy only makes us sympathize with those who feel bad. Empathetic people do not experience joy and happiness when others experience happiness or achieve success. They envy them. The capacity for ""positive"" empathy is limited to ""small joys"" in life. And so, Bloom claims, we should rather focus on compassion, sort of Buddhist-style. And the argument seems to be valid, it's just the book that is bad."
255,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14711872-jamie,3,"The attention grabbing title suggests a shocking case study, but Paul Bloom's subtitle is a much better metric for what this thoughtful book presents. Empathy is defined as ""the act of coming to experience the world as you think someone else does,"" and it does not refer to compassion or understanding but rather emotional assumptions which are devoid of reason. At first, the work felt like a reprimand over semantics since most of society would define empathy as an appeal to understanding through dialogue. But once Bloom distinguishes empathy from deliberative reasoning and cognitive empathy, his denigration of this practice unveils empathy's limitations and dangers. Logic and reason should be given precedence in order to capacitate self-control, intelligence, and balanced compassion for the future.Bloom's writing is unexpectedly humorous with tongue-in-cheek making this an entertaining read. Unfortunately, he frames every idea precisely with plenty of caveats that almost negate many of his statements. He seems to expect, and tries to prevent, critique of his findings which results in long-winded lines of dialogue that end up saying very little with each point. This round-about quantifying of ideas suggests that his thesis is not as shocking or profound as he may have wished it to be. However, the examples he offers illustrate his view and prove that empathy is not the cure all for humanities problems, and the perception that empathy is a superior trait is certainly called into question. Morality is motivating but ambiguous, and it is far more important to practice reason and emotional intelligence in the pursuit of a better future."

I think he makes some compelling arguments, the most convincing of which was that his narrowly-defined version of empathy serves as a tool to prioritize a single person over thousands or millions of people, which can be used for both good AND for bad - it's apolitical and amoral (i.e. how empathy for orphans in latin american countries causes more harm than good w/ white savior volunteering trips, unsustainable orphanage businesses, and fake orphans as a ""tourist trap""). he is a little insensitive about certain topics at times, and also denies his white privilege on one occasion, which was interesting. ultimately I think his final thesis is pretty reasonable, it is just not an amazingly well written book."

Who could be against empathy? You might as well say you’re against puppies!Against Empathy: The Case for Rational Compassion has a provocative title (deliberately so, for $ales purposes no doubt), but the claim Paul Bloom (Professor of psychology and cognitive science at Yale University) is making is substantially more banal. Bloom claims that, while empathy can serve as a spotlight, focusing attention on issues of importance, it more often than not leads to morally incorrect conclusions. Instead, he argues that ‘rational compassion’ serves as a better guide for determining our correct moral course of action. Before getting into details we first need to define what Bloom means by ‘empathy’. Bloom considers empathy to be the ability to put oneself in another’s shoes and to feel the things that they are feeling. This is illustrated by Bill Clinton’s famous quip “I feel your pain” and differs from sympathy or compassion in important ways. Here’s an example to help illustrate the difference between these concepts. Say your friend’s beloved pet dies and they are heartbroken as a consequence. Feeling your friend’s sadness is an example of Bloom’s empathy. On the other hand, if you were to comfort a child who fears there are monsters in the closet, you would not be experiencing the fear the child is feeling (since you presumably know that monsters don’t exist). This is therefore an example of compassion, and not empathy. So, how does empathy steer us wrong? Here’s one way … let’s say you witness a child receiving vaccination shots. The child screams and cries and later develops redness and swelling around the injection site and experiences obvious discomfort. You empathize so much with the child’s plight you crusade against childhood vaccinations vowing to end the suffering brought about by the shots. Unfortunately, this leads to a resurgence of polio that kills thousands and paralyzes tens of thousands as well as measles which kills tens of thousands and sickens millions. This is a morally reprehensible outcome brought about by an excess of empathy. Another way in which empathy steers us wrong is that it makes us care about those with whom we are close, but does a poor job in getting us to respond to the tragedies of strangers. As Adam Smith famously wrote (comparing the loss of someone’s pinky finger to a hypothetical earthquake in China that kills millions):If he was to lose his little finger to-morrow, he would not sleep to-night; but, provided he never saw them, he will snore with the most profound security over the ruin of a hundred millions of his brethren, and the destruction of that immense multitude seems plainly an object less interesting to him, than this paltry misfortune of his own.Instead, Bloom argues that rational compassion (a mixture of caring coupled with a detached cost-benefit analysis) provides a better moral compass for guiding our behavior, especially as it takes the broader consequences of ones actions into consideration. We can choose to be kind and act to alleviate the suffering of others without experiencing the misery of their condition. To which I can only respond … Meh. Is this even an interesting question? Obviously, the consequences of moral actions are meaningful. If I help an old lady cross a street only to steer her into the path of an oncoming bus … I probably shouldn’t expect that boy scout merit badge. Outcomes matter, but who thinks otherwise?Also, Bloom is forced to pepper the pages of his book with innumerable caveats which dilute his argument. Empathy can often be good, Bloom concedes. It can bring attention to a social needs and aid in charitable giving. Empathy also has many different definitions, to some it can mean kindness, to others … sympathy, all of which Bloom supports. Thus in order to make his argument cohesive Bloom first has to reduce it to a watery gruel. If I were to define ‘puppies’ as those things that crap on the rug and chew my shoes to shreds, then I’m against puppies! Bloom is similarly forced into a narrow definition of ‘empathy’ and as such must concede so much ground from the get-go one wonders why he felt this was an argument worth having. In reality what he is arguing against are over-emotional decisions that one arrives at through a knee jerk reaction. Of course if he were to have titled the book Against Over-Emotional Decisions Based Upon Knee Jerk Reactions it would have been greeted with a collective yawn. Let’s imagine for a moment that Bloom is correct on every point and in every particular, then what? Would we then set about a program of changing human nature so as to eliminate empathy from the human psyche? Of course not. Could we convince humanity to suddenly begin debating moral issues only in rational terms? The idea is laughable … as evidence I point to every comments section of every web page on the entire internet. Not only is this an uninteresting question, the ideas Bloom puts forth could be fully explored in a magazine article length treatment. In fact, you’ll find my full rebuttal of this point in an upcoming book Against Text Padding: The Case for Making a Concise Point. I’m going to publish it on a postage stamp."

His definition of ""empathy"" seems to be changing and he often makes straw man arguments. I really wanted to like this, but found myself rather disappointed with it."

263,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11570392-alice,3,The central argument is provocative if not a bit subtle but much of the book seems repetitive and doesn't seem to delve into this argument in much depth. Basically all you need is to read the first chapter to grasp the point.
264,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11138286-kari,5,"Against Empathy puts forth the position that empathy is not only largely impotent as a force for good, but can actually be a force for harm, bigotry, violence, etc. The author argues that reason and a distanced compassion is far superior to empathy as a benefit to society.WHAT I LIKED: I loved this book! I wish I’d read it with a highlighter. It challenged my preconceptions (a wonderful trait in books). It was humorous and engrossing. The writer was engaging, logical, and thorough in his research. He quoted philosophers who agreed with him and those who didn’t, always explaining why he believes as he does.WHAT I DIDN’T LIKE: I wish the book had been longer and even more in depth."
265,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5863458-andrea-mcdowell,2,"Imagine an entire book written critiquing empathy--written by a psychologist, no less--that doesn't once mention attachment theory or the importance of that close atunement by a caregiver during a child's formative years for psychological development. This will give you an idea of the considerable gaps in reasoning in this book that purports to demonstrate how importance reasoning (paired with compassion rather than empathy) is to proper moral decision making. A selection of other, similar gaps:p. 106: argument that it doesn't matter to a starving child if they are given food by a smiling face or if the food is dropped by a drone. Of course it matters. Raise your hand if you see no difference between birthday presents dropped off by drone rather than delivered by the smiling faces of your friends and family. People, particularly children, need to know that they are important and that they matter to people *as people*, and this is hardly communicated by a drone drop. The entire bit just before that about the kid who got a job on wall street so he could make large donations to the poor. While this is obviously an improvement over getting a job on wall street so you can buy a yacht, it does--contrary to Bloom's conclusion-without-support--makes things worse for the global poor. The investment machine that Wall Street powers is directly, intimately and daily linked to the actions of global companies who deprive people of land, food, and their lives. He can't possibly be ignorant of this; it smacks of cherry-picking.p. 107: He dismisses the claim that literature increases empathy, completely ignoring the scientific research that demonstrate that it does. p. 126: He argues that working on climate changes has nothing to do with empathy, as there are no identifiable Others with which to empathize. This book was written in America in 2016. At that time, California was experiencing the worst drought of its history, fueled by climate change. The Syrian refugee crisis, spurred in large part by a climate-change drought in the north of the country, was raging at that time. Both crises dominated the news with pictures of drowned toddlers, boats full of desperate people with nowhere to go, etc. No identifiable others? What planet was Bloom living on? I work in climate change. This is not a ""pale statistical abstraction"" for me, but is daily fueled by the impacts I know this is having on people, animals and landscapes. p. 154: Parenting. Here is where you would think attachment theory would make an appearance. Nope! Instead he makes a curious argument (repeated throughout the book) that empathy uniquely enslaves people and makes it impossible to consider how to respond using reason. I'll come back to this.p. 183-185: Psychopaths! Here, Bloom argues by aphorism. That is, he includes quotes by famous people asserting that a thing must be so, without providing evidence, and then concludes that indeed it is so. Eg. a quote from Steven Pinker about how crimes and violence committed in the name of morality ""would surely outnumber the fatalities from amoral conquest and predation,"" and accepts this statement as fact. Oh? Give us a statistic, Bloom. Give us some numbers with a source. You might think he'd have something to say here about the legendary lack of empathy in psychopaths. Nope!p. 232: IQ tests! ""A long time ago people said things like 'IQ tests just measure how good you are at doing IQ tests,' but nobody takes this seriously anymore."" (This in an argument about how IQ tests measure the potential for life success, as some kind of corollary argument for reason or reasoning ability--he never clarifies the connection he tries to draw here.) So I typed that phrase--IQ tests just measure how good you are at taking IQ tests--into google, and found this article from 2017 https://theconversation.com/the-iq-te... and this from 2014 https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/... . Seems like the conversation over the utility of IQ tests continues to rage on, Paul.Not to mention that describing IQ tests as good arbiters of reasoning ability, and claiming that no one questions this anymore, without discussing the differing results between different demographic groups and how completely obvious it is that privilege and material well-being factor into higher IQ scores--is racist and sexist. p. 234: ""I said that if you were curious about what sort of person a child would grow up to be, an intelligence test would be a great measure."" Fun! So, I was in a gifted program from grade 4-grade 13/OAC, said program based on the results of universally administered aptitude/IQ tests within the schools. Everyone I went to school with did extremely well on IQ tests, within the top 1-2 percentile.Yes, there are neurosurgeons and professors and lawyers within that group of people.There are also highschool and university drop-outs who have spent their entire adult lives bewailing how unfairly life has treated them because they are GENIUSES goddammit and they DESERVE better.So.Later on he talks about the importance of self-control and how well this was demonstrated in the infamous Marshmallow Test. Which has now been debunked as a measure of affluence rather than willpower. https://www.theatlantic.com/family/ar...p. 238: Here he talks about how good people are at reasoning in every day matters such as whether to buy a house or local politics such as zoning regulations. ""My own experience is that the level of rational discourse here is high,"" he says.Dear Lord. Apparently Paul Bloom, alone among North American adults, has never heard of NIMBYism. As an environmental professional now for a few decades, let me state categorically that the level of rational discourse in local political and planning matter is abysmal, and emotion plays an enormous role in the conclusions people draw. I used to work in wind energy and read a study at that time showing that people who claimed negative health impacts from a local wind farm were almost certain to be able to see it from a window in their house; didn't matter how far away it was or whether they could hear it or not. And keep in mind that Mr. Bloom wrote the sentences defending the rationality of everyday Americans in whether or not to purchase a house in 2016, a mere 8 years after the mortgage crisis.So this is a small collection of my ""Oh my god you have got to be kidding me"" moments from reading this book, but you might be wondering about the overall argument.I picked up the book on the strength of Kate Manne's mentioning of it in her book Down Girl, where she writes of his claim that empathy is ""biased and innumerate"": that is, that the empathy we feel reflects our own biases, and favours the one over the many. Manne then expands on this to discuss how empathy flows up the social hierarchy, and our society's tendency to, for example, express empathy towards perpetrators (""this allegation will destroy his career!"") over victims. That was the best part of Against Empathy, and having read it, you can probably skip the rest of the book. On the strength of it, I gave it two stars rather than one.But its weaknesses are many. A short list:1. The definition of empathy changes on every page to be whatever Bloom needs it to be in order to dismiss it. At the beginning of the book, empathy can be directed towards groups at a distance: he uses the example of the Sandy Hook massacre. At the end of the book, empathy can only be triggered in direct proximity to one or a small group of people who are directly emoting in your presence. At the beginning, again as with the Sandy Hook example, the empathy inspired isn't directly feeling exactly what the other person is feeling--he wouldn't and doesn't claim he feels the same rage and grief as the children's parents do--but at the end it is direct and exact mirroring, and only this mirroring, that counts as empathy. I could go on.2. Of course, any emotion or capacity joined to Reason is going to be superior to any emotion or capacity specifically entirely unconnected to Reason, so saying Compassion + Reason is a better guide to moral decision making than Empathy Alone is ... obvious. Let's experiment: Anger + Reason is better than Love Alone (think: people stalking the object of their romantic obsession, people using anger plus critical reasoning to advance social causes). Shame + Reason is better than Happiness Alone (research showing that the single-minded pursuit of happiness is linked with selfishness and moral deterioration; the capacity of reasoning one's way out of shame to restore social bonds and inspire moral improvement). Hate + Reason is better than Joy Alone (I have to admit that this is a tricky one, but I think a person who can reason about their hate can identify bridges that needed burning and separate themselves from destructive people and relationships much better than people who think any sign of hate is a moral failing; and Joy, if it comes at another's expense and is expressed without consideration of that fact, could be hurtful). We should simply assume and act as if all of our capacities are better when we can reason them through.3. He never explains why empathy is so impossible to reason through; he simply states that he himself can't do it, and then seems to assume that no one else can either. But of course empathy can join with Reason; an effective parent will do so as a matter of daily course. He brings up an example of how empathy would make a parent unable to subject their child to vaccinations because of the pain from the needle, but this is nonsense. Empathy simply makes it easier for the parent to understand and respond to the child's pain and confusion afterwards. Compassion wouldn't cut it.My daughter has a genetic syndrome that was only diagnosed when she was nearly 14. She had many, many tests beginning in infancy to try to diagnose it. I will never forget the first, when she was a tiny baby, about 5 lbs at the time, and it took me and two nurses to pin her down while they drew blood from her little arms. And I wept while she screamed, in her confusion and pain and fear. It did not stop me from getting her tested. It did provide a break of balancing the pain of any given test from the benefit of whatever knowledge we expected to gain from it, which is what happens when empathy is joined with reason.4. All feelings have a purpose. We are creatures who evolved, and we share these feelings with many of our non-human relatives; they have adaptive and survival value or they wouldn't exist. Any argument that tries to do away with any particular feeling must, I believe, acknowledge and understand the value that exists before a coherent and convincing argument can be made against it. This goes for the Dalai Lama's incessant harping against anger, Brene Brown's wholly unconvincing dismissal of shame, and it goes here for Paul Bloom's devaluation of empathy. 5. He repeatedly insists that the idea that people are incapable of truly reasoning is baseless, without providing any convincing argument against the vast evidence--never mentioned--that human reasoning ability is inextricably connected with emotion. That neurologically people are incapable of reaching conclusions without emotions. His argument reflects an unearned faith in the existence of One True Reasonable Conclusion for any argument; of course, there isn't one. This isn't, as he claims, a dismissal of Reason; it's an admission of its limitations and its inherent dependency on our emotional responses. We reason using thoughts and feelings, and any reasoned conclusions is partially dependent on feelings which must be admitted to and explored as part of a reasoned exploration. There are plenty of people out there who claim that there beliefs that the earth is flat, that climate change is a hoax, that vaccines cause autism, etc. are reasoned arguments based on evidence, which they clearly are not. His own book would have been better if he himself had done so.On page 10, Bloom lists his main influences for his argument against empathy and for reason:Richard DavidsonSam Harris (article about his assertion that black americans score lower on IQ tests because they are less intelligent here: https://www.vox.com/2018/4/9/17210248...)Jesse PrinzPeter Singer (disabled humans not persons; adult gorillas are persons; apparently supports the rights of parents to kill their disabled children? http://web.archive.org/web/2017030700...)Michael LynchMichael Shermer (multiple accusations of sexual assault: https://www.buzzfeed.com/markoppenhei...)Hrm. What kinds of conclusions do you think a person is going to reach with influences like these?Let's ignore the fact that they are all white, able-bodied, male, and with the exception of one, straight.Let's consider that this list is 50% known unrepentant asshole.Essentially, Paul Bloom sets up a straw man of unconstrained empathy without the benefit of any reasoning counterbalance and spends about 240 pages pummeling it with half-facts and anecdotes.

The title of this book consists of two parts, the ""against empathy"" part and the ""rational compassion"" part. I expected the author to go into each aspect in depth , arguing at first why empathy is a bad thing, then proposing the replacement and explaining how we can use the replacement to avoid the negative consequences of empathy.And here lies my main issue with this book, the author dedicates 5 chapters out of 6 to the arguments against empathy. and while that is already an unbalanced ratio for both arguments, I felt the last chapter was wasted on arguing if human beings are actually rational or not rather than explaining how being rational is the solution to the problems of empathy. so after finishing the book even 
if
 you agree that empathy is bad , you are left with nothing , just feeling bad about having a normal human emotion, and not knowing what to do about it.my second issue that I have with the book is the writing style. the book is written in a sort of a discussion like style , first arguing for one side then after that saying how one would counter that argument . And while acknowledging criticism and counter arguments is way better than stating your side of the argument as facts, it is done here in a really bad way that left me more often than not confused rather than informed. And if that was not enough already , the author tend to go off tracks A LOT either with unnecessary examples or with topics that seem unrelated to the main topic at hand. Here is an illustration how Paul Bloom presents his ideas I can't deny that he did have a point on the limitation of empathy , that it is like a spotlight , it is narrow and it can lead to hasty decisions that have unwanted consequences, and it may not be the emotion that can save humanity from evil( if you are someone who thinks this way than maybe this book has a lot to offer you). But that wasn't enough to convince me to have a similar opinion like the author and be ""Against empathy"". for me the only takeaway from this book was that we shouldn't act based strictly on emotions (empathy or other emotions like anger ) and that we should try to be as rational as possible before making any decisions."
268,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28727983-e,3,"Empathy is a poor way to make decisions, mostly because it inhibits rationality. It causes us to overvalue the proximate and undervalue the distant (he didn't bring this up, but that's also a reason people don't buy enough insurance, or eat healthy). Empathy screws up how we spend our ""charity dollars,"" how we react to wrongs, how we prioritize the use of scarce resources, and more. Bloom is not against compassion, mind you; he is against empathy as frequently defined as ""feeling yourself what you imagine others must be feeling."" Lots of studies have shown that when you get the studies' subjects to feel empathetically toward others, their rationality immediately goes down the tube. Heck, get them to feel empathy toward someone being mistreated, and then ask him how they would punish an unrelated wrong, and their proposed punishments get much harsher.This is Bloom's main argument. He makes it well near the beginning of the book, but kind of rambles and wanders the rest of the way. He talks about brain waves. He talks about how conservatives aren't actually less empathetic than liberals. He tries to talk about how empathy affects intimate relationships but never really gets there. He defends rationality when it comes to morality (I found this to be quite insightful, and important, but he doesn't connect it well to the rest of the book). And, though he is careful to define empathy precisely, he doesn't always hold himself to that definition when critiquing it.So I docked him a few stars. He also obviously doesn't know how to deal with religion. He mentions it in passing, although I would argue it affects profoundly the arguments he is trying to make. (It might even help his case. I would argue, for example, that the Biblical faith is all for rational morality. I would also argue that it would warn us against taking empathy too far, but it might not be as pessimistic as is Bloom.)So an interesting read, especially if you're trying to make better decisions (or feel better about yourself for not being very empathetic)."

I guess it's a good book if you're new to the notion of affective empathy not being that good. But we autistic activists have been familiar with the notion for decades. You'll find so many good blog posts and tumblr or twitter rants on the subject matter from people in the neurodivergent political sphere. It will be better than this book. You'll have more answers. You'll read them and hopefully you'll be better towards people who don't use their empathy.I thought the book would be autistic friendly. I thought it would also tackle the idea that cognitive empathy is mandatory to have a right to exist. I thought it would talk about how cognitive empathy is relative, how autistic and allistic people have trouble standing in each other's shoes, but how cognitive empathy is useless if you know how to LISTEN and if you're willing to be a kind, moral person once you've listened enough. It didn't. In fact, I had trouble going on once I read that you can't be a good person with a good moral compass if you don't ""have"" cognitive empathy. Showing how the author doesn't know shit about cognitive empathy. He based his book on his neurotypical views of empathy, and I couldn't relate. And I actually knew more, and better than him. I'm deeply disappointed by the book, and I won't read this author again.Now, it's probably a good introduction if you know nothing about empathy. It challenges your views and tackles several misconceptions. I'd recommend you read it if you think the problem with empathy is we don't have enough of it. Still, chapter one is basically a repeat of the prologue, and the ideas are repeated over and over, there is a Q/A section that I thought was very out of place... And once you've been convinced that you don't need to empathize to make good moral decisions and/or be a compassionate and kind person, it pretty much stops being interesting. I thought it would go a lot further."

The author is against emotional empathy. Emotional empathy let us to feel what other people feels, mirror people's feeling, which could be so distraught to paralyze us to take effective action and narrow focus of bias could make us to make unwise actions. Cognitive empathy make us understand other people's feeling without experiencing it, lead us positive compassion, kindness , reasoning, more effective way to help people.Statistical data and reasoning seem always cold, hard to stir people to act, and ever worse when data and reasoning against our intuition and our bias, like ""identifiable victim effect"". But we should fight our emotion and sensation, use our brain and heart to make wise choices. Doing more mindful meditation, acting with compassion and reason, don't be burden with too much emotional empathy weighing yourself down to become the useless bleeding-heart.Chapter 4: intimacyaddress more detrimental of emotional empathy and more positive cognitive empathy: called by compassion.

Author's own conclusion---1. Our moral decisions and actions are powerfully shaped by the force of empathy.---2. This often make the world worse.---3. We have the capacity to do better.2. Cognitive empathy is morally neutral. cognitive empathy: understand you feel, but do not feel it. It is positive compassion, kindness. The understanding and feeling are different neuron processing, you can understand it without feeling it, that is cognitive empathy. We are much better to use reasons, cost-benefit, compassion, kindness to make decisions, give intelligently, with eye towards consequence. Depersonalize the process and circumvent our natural preference and bias, with compassion for others, rational-making taking happiness and suffering into account. Reduce our candidates to X, Y, Z, designing procedure such as blind reviewing and blind auditions. Bring everyone down rather than bring everyone up. Don't try to make them (strangers) more weight. Rather, make yourself less weight. Bring everyone to the same level by diminish yourself. Put yourself, and those you love, on the level of strangers. p138 Buddhist texts distinguish ""sentimental compassion"", which corresponds to what we could call empathy and ""great compassion"", which is what we would simply called compassion. The first is to be avoid, as it exhausts the bodhisattva. It's the second that is worth pursing. Great compssion is more distanced and reserved, and can be sustained indefinitely.... In contrast to (emotional) empathy, compassion does not means sharing the suffering of others: rather, it is characterized by feeling of warmth, concern and care for other, as well as a strong motivation to improve the other's well-being. Compassion is feeling for and not feeling with the other. p139 There is a neural difference: Empathy training led to increased activation in the insula and anterior cingulate cortes. Compassion training led to activation in other parts of the brain, such as the medical orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum.p141 Mindful meditation reduces activation of the brain networks associated with simulating the feeling of people in distress, in favour of networks associated with feelings of social affiliation. Buddhist scholar Thupten Jinpa: ""Meditation-based training enables practitioners to move quickly from feeling the distress of others to acting with compassion to alleviated it.""... Not only can compassion and kindness exist independently of empathy, they are sometime opposed . Sometimes, we are better people if we suppress our empathic feeling. p145 My friend (psychologist) does get into her clients' heads, she would be useless if she couldn't - but she doesn't feel what they fee. She employs understanding and caring, not empathy.p149 There is a world difference, between understanding the misery of the person who is talking to you because you have felt misery in the past, even though now you are calm, and understanding the misery of the person who is talking to you because  you are mirroring them and feeling their misery right now. The first, which doesn't involve empathy in any sense, just understanding, has all advantages of the second and none of its cost.p154 My worst moments as a father aren't when I don't care, they're when I care too much, when I cannot disengage from my children's frustration and pain.  --my comment: so true for me.Against Fairness by Stephen T.

The act of feeling what you believe other people feel - experience what they experience. The act of coming to experience the world as you think someone else does, also called sympathy by philosophers Adam Smith and David Humep17 As Adam Smith put it, we have capacity to think about another person and ""place ourselves in his situation.... and become in some measure the same person with him, and thence form some idea of his sensations, and even feel something which, though weaker in degree, is not altogether unlike him."" This is emotional empathy, feel what you feel.Emotional Empathy is biased and parochial; it is spotlight (metaphor, narrow focus, only light up the area you focus, ignore surrounding) , it focus on certain people at the expense of others; it is innumerate (we often pay too much attention to one person, ignore too many suffering), it is not in the direction of increase of justice, so it distort our moral and policy decision in ways cause suffering instead of relieving it. Empathy-Altruism Theory; Empathy-induced Altruism (this altruism is more like emotional empathy) is neither moral nor immoral, it is is amoral, does not have necessary positive consequence. =======================Terms and ideas of the book:1.

It’s very accessible, a decent length, including arguments and counter arguments and counter counter arguments. Anyone interested in morality should give it a read. Bloom essentially argues that the human tendency of literally feeling what someone else is feeling, “emotional empathy”, is detrimental to individuals and society as a whole, for 3 main reasons: it’s more often paralyzing than motivating, it’s unnecessarily painful, and it is inescapably limited in scope. Instead, all of what’s good about people can be attributed to compassion; caring without feeling the same thing.The idea I agreed with the most was that empathy is a problem because it is limited in scope, meaning the human mind can only handle feeling empathy for a limited number of individuals at a time, and invariably those individuals are “ranked” by closeness (family, friends, neighbours, other). This makes it a cousin of racism in a weird sense; by shining a spotlight on just your people, you can so ignore everyone else that you don’t notice the harm you cause. So in war, it’s not so much a lack of empathy for the enemy (which on it’s own would just lead to apathy) but an excess of empathy towards your own group, or any other group which moves you to do something, blind to anyone else. While it would be nice to extend empathy to the enemy, that’s just not how our brains were wired. Along the same lines, I personally appreciated the change in perspective from thinking of empathy as the source of morality to just a manifestation of it. A couple months ago, I went through a mini crisis where I had to stop reading the news, because I realized behind every death toll number were actual people, who were terrified for their lives, and then had that snuffed out; and there was just so much death and pain, but I didn’t want to stop feeling this connection, because I worried that would be callous, denying reality. The idea that empathy is just not the tool for the job helps a lot; instead it’s better that I feel compassion, a detached awareness of a problem, followed by an evaluation of whether I can do anything to help; not so I would feel better, but just to help. If empathy was causing me to turn off the news so that I would feel less pain, then clearly it was a problem not a solution.The idea that compassion not only can but should replace empathy was a little harder to swallow, but the more I think about it, the more I agree. I started trying to find an example to prove this wrong, and an easy one popped up on tv: spring breakers continuing to gather despite the coronavirus lockdown. At first glance, it seems that these millennials (eye roll) were not feeling any empathy for the elderly and the sick at risk, and if they had, they would have stayed home. While this is true, it would actually be enough for them just to feel compassion, and in hindsight, that’s what jumpstarted me into proper self-isolation; in the early days, I saw the numbers, and realized with the 14 day incubation period there was no other way to stop this, so I stayed home, before even the Italian death toll hit 1000. Only later did I come across the personal stories of some of the victims, making me want to curl up in a ball and cry; but while that technically would also keep me at home, compassion left me the presence of mind to plan how to avoid trips outside, contact my relatives to provide helpful information, and avoid hoarding toilet paper. In a similar vein, there’s currently the debate about whether the economy is “worth” the lives of the elderly and infirm. Anyone arguing using empathy would be horrified at the idea that the economy should factor into such a decision, but actually if the economy collapses, so too will future healthcare and medical research, leading possibly to even more deaths, not to mention suffering from just lower quality of life. Now, is the economy really going to collapse? Maybe not, but its not going to be empathy, but rational, albeit compassionate, analysis that will find the answer. Like with this, most other legal and political decisions would benefit from taking a step back from empathy, and just dealing with compassion; the alternative results in one-sided views that devolves into entrenched partisanship, as we currently see.On the topic of news, Bloom actually missed a golden opportunity to criticize the media for it’s practice of starting almost every article with some first-name basis narrative about some victim; as if the reader couldn’t be brought to care unless there was a soul behind each tragedy. It always really bothered me to read this; on the one hand because it gave me pain when all I wanted was information, on the other hand because it glaringly defied the objectivity I would hope for in the news. Bloom brings up the case of how you can just as easily empathize with poor young black Americans afraid for their lives, or with self-sacrificing police officers, trying to help their city but afraid for their lives; yet oh so rarely can people do both. But we shouldn’t try; and the news should stop trying to get that to happen. Instead, we should just be presented with cold hard facts that help with better decision making on how much power and trianing to give police and what kind of reform programs work.The main problem with this book is I think Bloom gives too much “credit” to empathy, and disregards other forms of “emotional decision making” behind many of the problems he attributes to empathy. War in particular he argues comes down to one side feeling empathy for some victim, and taking up arms to fight against the aggressor. But actually empathy, as he writes elsewhere, is often paralyzing, especially when the emotion involved is fear and trauma; instead seeing this in others often provokes anger instead, and it is this that leads people to war. So just like he claims mainstream definition of empathy is jut “everything good and nice about people”, he tends to attribute every non-selfish emotional action to empathy. If instead of being “against empathy” he had more accurately stated his position as “against emotional decision making” I think he would reveal himself as being far less controversial than his title suggests (nor as original).Also, an important omission from his thesis is whether it is even possible to have compassion without empathy; he argues for us to make decisions like this, which is fine, but can you as a human develop a sense of compassion, for anyone, without first feeling empathy? Bloom repeatedly hints that you can, but while he talks about individuals without both empathy and compassion (psychopaths), he doesn’t mention a class of people without empathy but with compassion. Well actually, he does mention Buddhist monks, but they learn this state of enlightenment, they're not naturally endowed with it. He also claims children have instincts of compassion without showing corresponding empathy, but the child’s version of compassion is not particularly useful. The story he gives is of a toddler, who has learned that showing off his belly makes adults smile. One day his older brother gets hurt, and in an attempt to make his brother feel better, he shows him his belly. While clearly the “theory of mind” that his brother was hurting was there, and the instinct to try and help as well, but the chosen solution was not particularly helpful. Instead, being able to feel empathy, as in imagine also being hurt, would allow for a more appropriate response. So ultimately, I still suspect Bloom is wrong about empathy, even by his narrow definition, being only an impediment. My intuitive theory would be that empathy is a necessary tool for learning not only what could hurt us, but also what could make us feel better and as a consequence could help others feel better. If you have a friend who just had a tough breakup, and you yourself have never even dated, compassion may not even be enough to realize why the situation is painful, and therefore what you as a friend could do to help. Yes, in the grand scheme of things, its better for the friend to have broken off from a bad relationship, but that is not the consolation that’s going to help right in that moment. If the situation were reversed, I think it would be nice to have a compassionate friend, but I would really want an empathic best friend. In conclusion, in the grand scheme of decision making, empathy can be as detrimental as racism, focusing a spotlight only on a small group for not objective reasons. But I don’t think deep interpersonal relationships would be possible without it. "
283,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2896545-meg,2,"The basic argument here is one that I can certainly get behind: We should strive for more cognitive empathy, but less emotional empathy. Our decisions and policies should be driven primarily by rational evaluation of how we can do the most good with our resources, rather than exhausting our resources through the avenues that tug most on our heartstrings.I had a few major problems, though, too. In the end, Paul Bloom and I fundamentally disagree in our worldviews. This manifested in three particular ways throughout the book:1) As a white, straight, male, affluent, American Yale professor, Bloom writes from a place of EXTREME privilege...and he makes virtually no effort to even acknowledge this, let alone compensate for it. Many of his points were weakened for me by the fact that they wouldn't hold up if the privilege was removed.2) Bloom is, by his own admission, not a sincere advocate of making personal sacrifices for the common good. He writes, ""I could never take seriously people who refuse to take long flights to see those they love because of worries about contributing to climate change. Or even those who put their children into a public school that they know to be terrible even though they can easily afford a private school, just out of a broader principle of common good. Even when it comes to charity, I am not a good utilitarian."" As a Gryffindor and a 1 on the Enneagram, this is not just foreign to me, it's repulsive.3) I couldn't get past the feeling that a lot of this book was written out of semantic quibbling between the scholarly elite. The sensationalist title soon gave way to a core position that, while it made sense, was less revolutionary than one might expect.All in all, I'm still grateful to this book. The fact that I disagreed with certain points and favored others was a helpful exercise in critical reading. I was motivated to think deeply while reading and came out with a much more nuanced understanding of empathy and my associated beliefs. I'm not at all suggesting that others shouldn't read this book -- but if you do read it, just make sure you do so through a critical lens."
284,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46716546-weronika,2,"It might be a three stars book, but I vowed to subtract a star for any book that quotes the marshmallow study results (the book quotes the marshmallow study results!!!). It is, in fact, a poorly organised sequence of paragraphs commenting on a variety of studies that could be loosely linked with or interpreted in the context of empathy. Mixed into that is some useful literature (Adam Smith, of all people!) and some colourful, though somewhat clichéd examples from history (Abe Lincoln saving piglets!). The argument is not without merit -- empathy, rather than a force for good, is a force for tribalism. We feel more for people like us. When a victim is like us, and the perpetrator is unlike us, we feel disproportionately more for the victim. If the victim is unlike us, but the perpetrator belongs to our tribe, we tend to dismiss the victim and feel for the perpetrator. Empathy is also number-blind; we care for one, but not for hundreds. Empathy stirs injustice -- in studies quoted in the book, people would move kids up the treatment lists disregarding other children, just because they knew that one kid and did not know the rest of them. And of course there are the Nazis, there is Hitler. The author is also right to add (after Smith) that empathy only makes us sympathize with those who feel bad. Empathetic people do not experience joy and happiness when others experience happiness or achieve success. They envy them. The capacity for ""positive"" empathy is limited to ""small joys"" in life. And so, Bloom claims, we should rather focus on compassion, sort of Buddhist-style. And the argument seems to be valid, it's just the book that is bad."
285,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14711872-jamie,3,"The attention grabbing title suggests a shocking case study, but Paul Bloom's subtitle is a much better metric for what this thoughtful book presents. Empathy is defined as ""the act of coming to experience the world as you think someone else does,"" and it does not refer to compassion or understanding but rather emotional assumptions which are devoid of reason. At first, the work felt like a reprimand over semantics since most of society would define empathy as an appeal to understanding through dialogue. But once Bloom distinguishes empathy from deliberative reasoning and cognitive empathy, his denigration of this practice unveils empathy's limitations and dangers. Logic and reason should be given precedence in order to capacitate self-control, intelligence, and balanced compassion for the future.Bloom's writing is unexpectedly humorous with tongue-in-cheek making this an entertaining read. Unfortunately, he frames every idea precisely with plenty of caveats that almost negate many of his statements. He seems to expect, and tries to prevent, critique of his findings which results in long-winded lines of dialogue that end up saying very little with each point. This round-about quantifying of ideas suggests that his thesis is not as shocking or profound as he may have wished it to be. However, the examples he offers illustrate his view and prove that empathy is not the cure all for humanities problems, and the perception that empathy is a superior trait is certainly called into question. Morality is motivating but ambiguous, and it is far more important to practice reason and emotional intelligence in the pursuit of a better future."
286,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97551411-sarah,4,"this was more of a 3.5 than a 4 but I felt bad for paul because his goodreads rating is pretty low for this book. despite the almost clickbait-esque title, paul is not in fact against all kindness; he just does not think that empathy in the sense of ""I feel what you're feeling too"" (think bill clinton I feel your pain, stepping into someone's shoes) is as amazing as everyone makes it out to be. I think he makes some compelling arguments, the most convincing of which was that his narrowly-defined version of empathy serves as a tool to prioritize a single person over thousands or millions of people, which can be used for both good AND for bad - it's apolitical and amoral (i.e. how empathy for orphans in latin american countries causes more harm than good w/ white savior volunteering trips, unsustainable orphanage businesses, and fake orphans as a ""tourist trap""). he is a little insensitive about certain topics at times, and also denies his white privilege on one occasion, which was interesting. ultimately I think his final thesis is pretty reasonable, it is just not an amazingly well written book."
287,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5242010-rex,1,"We Homo sapiens are by default compassionate animals. This is our basic evolutionary drive. I believe the landscape that the author described in the book about the rational society is a myth. We Homo sapiens are not rational civil intellectuals, rather empathetic animals. And we currently have been evolving for 350,000 years. I estimate that, sure, we are heading to a more and more rational civilization, but 350,000 years is still too short for an advanced developed civilization. We are, after all, an average species on an average planet. But why against compassion. We are actually doing really great under this ""not-quite-rational-but-very-compassionate"" world.No matter how the society evolves, the compassionate ones always have comparative advantage in survival. I will always stand on the ""The Age of Empathy"" (Frans de Waal) side."
288,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105618454-em,4,"The book is not as controversial as its title; it is not about being a cold-blooded insensitive bastard, but an appeal to common-sense, logic, and rational thinking. And kindness and compassion, the more appropriate option(s) in Mr. Bloom's view. Or rather my view of his view. My only gripe concerning this book is its length. I think it is a great essay that was diluted into book. On several occasions I found myself skimming through some sections which instead of reinforcing (or repeating) an idea or argument were actually straying off the path. For this reason I even contemplated giving it 3 stars before settling to 4. In the end, I settled for 4 stars. I didn't do it out of empathy for the effort the author put in it, but for the great content. And here's a personal argument mirroring the book's theme: if I had been truly empathic I would have given it 5 stars and made this review 5-6 times longer. :)"

But the book just...sucks.If someone else could re-write this with some way of relating it to me with actions to take it has the potential to be fantastic.

290,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,2,"The death of one man is a tragedy, the death of millions is a statistic.-	Joseph StalinAgainst Empathy? Who could be against empathy? You might as well say you’re against puppies!Against Empathy: The Case for Rational Compassion has a provocative title (deliberately so, for $ales purposes no doubt), but the claim Paul Bloom (Professor of psychology and cognitive science at Yale University) is making is substantially more banal. Bloom claims that, while empathy can serve as a spotlight, focusing attention on issues of importance, it more often than not leads to morally incorrect conclusions. Instead, he argues that ‘rational compassion’ serves as a better guide for determining our correct moral course of action. Before getting into details we first need to define what Bloom means by ‘empathy’. Bloom considers empathy to be the ability to put oneself in another’s shoes and to feel the things that they are feeling. This is illustrated by Bill Clinton’s famous quip “I feel your pain” and differs from sympathy or compassion in important ways. Here’s an example to help illustrate the difference between these concepts. Say your friend’s beloved pet dies and they are heartbroken as a consequence. Feeling your friend’s sadness is an example of Bloom’s empathy. On the other hand, if you were to comfort a child who fears there are monsters in the closet, you would not be experiencing the fear the child is feeling (since you presumably know that monsters don’t exist). This is therefore an example of compassion, and not empathy. So, how does empathy steer us wrong? Here’s one way … let’s say you witness a child receiving vaccination shots. The child screams and cries and later develops redness and swelling around the injection site and experiences obvious discomfort. You empathize so much with the child’s plight you crusade against childhood vaccinations vowing to end the suffering brought about by the shots. Unfortunately, this leads to a resurgence of polio that kills thousands and paralyzes tens of thousands as well as measles which kills tens of thousands and sickens millions. This is a morally reprehensible outcome brought about by an excess of empathy. Another way in which empathy steers us wrong is that it makes us care about those with whom we are close, but does a poor job in getting us to respond to the tragedies of strangers. As Adam Smith famously wrote (comparing the loss of someone’s pinky finger to a hypothetical earthquake in China that kills millions):If he was to lose his little finger to-morrow, he would not sleep to-night; but, provided he never saw them, he will snore with the most profound security over the ruin of a hundred millions of his brethren, and the destruction of that immense multitude seems plainly an object less interesting to him, than this paltry misfortune of his own.Instead, Bloom argues that rational compassion (a mixture of caring coupled with a detached cost-benefit analysis) provides a better moral compass for guiding our behavior, especially as it takes the broader consequences of ones actions into consideration. We can choose to be kind and act to alleviate the suffering of others without experiencing the misery of their condition. To which I can only respond … Meh. Is this even an interesting question? Obviously, the consequences of moral actions are meaningful. If I help an old lady cross a street only to steer her into the path of an oncoming bus … I probably shouldn’t expect that boy scout merit badge. Outcomes matter, but who thinks otherwise?Also, Bloom is forced to pepper the pages of his book with innumerable caveats which dilute his argument. Empathy can often be good, Bloom concedes. It can bring attention to a social needs and aid in charitable giving. Empathy also has many different definitions, to some it can mean kindness, to others … sympathy, all of which Bloom supports. Thus in order to make his argument cohesive Bloom first has to reduce it to a watery gruel. If I were to define ‘puppies’ as those things that crap on the rug and chew my shoes to shreds, then I’m against puppies! Bloom is similarly forced into a narrow definition of ‘empathy’ and as such must concede so much ground from the get-go one wonders why he felt this was an argument worth having. In reality what he is arguing against are over-emotional decisions that one arrives at through a knee jerk reaction. Of course if he were to have titled the book Against Over-Emotional Decisions Based Upon Knee Jerk Reactions it would have been greeted with a collective yawn. Let’s imagine for a moment that Bloom is correct on every point and in every particular, then what? Would we then set about a program of changing human nature so as to eliminate empathy from the human psyche? Of course not. Could we convince humanity to suddenly begin debating moral issues only in rational terms? The idea is laughable … as evidence I point to every comments section of every web page on the entire internet. Not only is this an uninteresting question, the ideas Bloom puts forth could be fully explored in a magazine article length treatment. In fact, you’ll find my full rebuttal of this point in an upcoming book Against Text Padding: The Case for Making a Concise Point. I’m going to publish it on a postage stamp."

294,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11138286-kari,5,"Against Empathy puts forth the position that empathy is not only largely impotent as a force for good, but can actually be a force for harm, bigotry, violence, etc. The author argues that reason and a distanced compassion is far superior to empathy as a benefit to society.WHAT I LIKED: I loved this book! I wish I’d read it with a highlighter. It challenged my preconceptions (a wonderful trait in books). It was humorous and engrossing. The writer was engaging, logical, and thorough in his research. He quoted philosophers who agreed with him and those who didn’t, always explaining why he believes as he does.WHAT I DIDN’T LIKE: I wish the book had been longer and even more in depth."
295,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5863458-andrea-mcdowell,2,"Imagine an entire book written critiquing empathy--written by a psychologist, no less--that doesn't once mention attachment theory or the importance of that close atunement by a caregiver during a child's formative years for psychological development. This will give you an idea of the considerable gaps in reasoning in this book that purports to demonstrate how importance reasoning (paired with compassion rather than empathy) is to proper moral decision making. A selection of other, similar gaps:p. 106: argument that it doesn't matter to a starving child if they are given food by a smiling face or if the food is dropped by a drone. Of course it matters. Raise your hand if you see no difference between birthday presents dropped off by drone rather than delivered by the smiling faces of your friends and family. People, particularly children, need to know that they are important and that they matter to people *as people*, and this is hardly communicated by a drone drop. The entire bit just before that about the kid who got a job on wall street so he could make large donations to the poor. While this is obviously an improvement over getting a job on wall street so you can buy a yacht, it does--contrary to Bloom's conclusion-without-support--makes things worse for the global poor. The investment machine that Wall Street powers is directly, intimately and daily linked to the actions of global companies who deprive people of land, food, and their lives. He can't possibly be ignorant of this; it smacks of cherry-picking.p. 107: He dismisses the claim that literature increases empathy, completely ignoring the scientific research that demonstrate that it does. p. 126: He argues that working on climate changes has nothing to do with empathy, as there are no identifiable Others with which to empathize. This book was written in America in 2016. At that time, California was experiencing the worst drought of its history, fueled by climate change. The Syrian refugee crisis, spurred in large part by a climate-change drought in the north of the country, was raging at that time. Both crises dominated the news with pictures of drowned toddlers, boats full of desperate people with nowhere to go, etc. No identifiable others? What planet was Bloom living on? I work in climate change. This is not a ""pale statistical abstraction"" for me, but is daily fueled by the impacts I know this is having on people, animals and landscapes. p. 154: Parenting. Here is where you would think attachment theory would make an appearance. Nope! Instead he makes a curious argument (repeated throughout the book) that empathy uniquely enslaves people and makes it impossible to consider how to respond using reason. I'll come back to this.p. 183-185: Psychopaths! Here, Bloom argues by aphorism. That is, he includes quotes by famous people asserting that a thing must be so, without providing evidence, and then concludes that indeed it is so. Eg. a quote from Steven Pinker about how crimes and violence committed in the name of morality ""would surely outnumber the fatalities from amoral conquest and predation,"" and accepts this statement as fact. Oh? Give us a statistic, Bloom. Give us some numbers with a source. You might think he'd have something to say here about the legendary lack of empathy in psychopaths. Nope!p. 232: IQ tests! ""A long time ago people said things like 'IQ tests just measure how good you are at doing IQ tests,' but nobody takes this seriously anymore."" (This in an argument about how IQ tests measure the potential for life success, as some kind of corollary argument for reason or reasoning ability--he never clarifies the connection he tries to draw here.) So I typed that phrase--IQ tests just measure how good you are at taking IQ tests--into google, and found this article from 2017 https://theconversation.com/the-iq-te... and this from 2014 https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/... . Seems like the conversation over the utility of IQ tests continues to rage on, Paul.Not to mention that describing IQ tests as good arbiters of reasoning ability, and claiming that no one questions this anymore, without discussing the differing results between different demographic groups and how completely obvious it is that privilege and material well-being factor into higher IQ scores--is racist and sexist. p. 234: ""I said that if you were curious about what sort of person a child would grow up to be, an intelligence test would be a great measure."" Fun! So, I was in a gifted program from grade 4-grade 13/OAC, said program based on the results of universally administered aptitude/IQ tests within the schools. Everyone I went to school with did extremely well on IQ tests, within the top 1-2 percentile.Yes, there are neurosurgeons and professors and lawyers within that group of people.There are also highschool and university drop-outs who have spent their entire adult lives bewailing how unfairly life has treated them because they are GENIUSES goddammit and they DESERVE better.So.Later on he talks about the importance of self-control and how well this was demonstrated in the infamous Marshmallow Test. Which has now been debunked as a measure of affluence rather than willpower. https://www.theatlantic.com/family/ar...p. 238: Here he talks about how good people are at reasoning in every day matters such as whether to buy a house or local politics such as zoning regulations. ""My own experience is that the level of rational discourse here is high,"" he says.Dear Lord. Apparently Paul Bloom, alone among North American adults, has never heard of NIMBYism. As an environmental professional now for a few decades, let me state categorically that the level of rational discourse in local political and planning matter is abysmal, and emotion plays an enormous role in the conclusions people draw. I used to work in wind energy and read a study at that time showing that people who claimed negative health impacts from a local wind farm were almost certain to be able to see it from a window in their house; didn't matter how far away it was or whether they could hear it or not. And keep in mind that Mr. Bloom wrote the sentences defending the rationality of everyday Americans in whether or not to purchase a house in 2016, a mere 8 years after the mortgage crisis.So this is a small collection of my ""Oh my god you have got to be kidding me"" moments from reading this book, but you might be wondering about the overall argument.I picked up the book on the strength of Kate Manne's mentioning of it in her book Down Girl, where she writes of his claim that empathy is ""biased and innumerate"": that is, that the empathy we feel reflects our own biases, and favours the one over the many. Manne then expands on this to discuss how empathy flows up the social hierarchy, and our society's tendency to, for example, express empathy towards perpetrators (""this allegation will destroy his career!"") over victims. That was the best part of Against Empathy, and having read it, you can probably skip the rest of the book. On the strength of it, I gave it two stars rather than one.But its weaknesses are many. A short list:1. The definition of empathy changes on every page to be whatever Bloom needs it to be in order to dismiss it. At the beginning of the book, empathy can be directed towards groups at a distance: he uses the example of the Sandy Hook massacre. At the end of the book, empathy can only be triggered in direct proximity to one or a small group of people who are directly emoting in your presence. At the beginning, again as with the Sandy Hook example, the empathy inspired isn't directly feeling exactly what the other person is feeling--he wouldn't and doesn't claim he feels the same rage and grief as the children's parents do--but at the end it is direct and exact mirroring, and only this mirroring, that counts as empathy. I could go on.2. Of course, any emotion or capacity joined to Reason is going to be superior to any emotion or capacity specifically entirely unconnected to Reason, so saying Compassion + Reason is a better guide to moral decision making than Empathy Alone is ... obvious. Let's experiment: Anger + Reason is better than Love Alone (think: people stalking the object of their romantic obsession, people using anger plus critical reasoning to advance social causes). Shame + Reason is better than Happiness Alone (research showing that the single-minded pursuit of happiness is linked with selfishness and moral deterioration; the capacity of reasoning one's way out of shame to restore social bonds and inspire moral improvement). Hate + Reason is better than Joy Alone (I have to admit that this is a tricky one, but I think a person who can reason about their hate can identify bridges that needed burning and separate themselves from destructive people and relationships much better than people who think any sign of hate is a moral failing; and Joy, if it comes at another's expense and is expressed without consideration of that fact, could be hurtful). We should simply assume and act as if all of our capacities are better when we can reason them through.3. He never explains why empathy is so impossible to reason through; he simply states that he himself can't do it, and then seems to assume that no one else can either. But of course empathy can join with Reason; an effective parent will do so as a matter of daily course. He brings up an example of how empathy would make a parent unable to subject their child to vaccinations because of the pain from the needle, but this is nonsense. Empathy simply makes it easier for the parent to understand and respond to the child's pain and confusion afterwards. Compassion wouldn't cut it.My daughter has a genetic syndrome that was only diagnosed when she was nearly 14. She had many, many tests beginning in infancy to try to diagnose it. I will never forget the first, when she was a tiny baby, about 5 lbs at the time, and it took me and two nurses to pin her down while they drew blood from her little arms. And I wept while she screamed, in her confusion and pain and fear. It did not stop me from getting her tested. It did provide a break of balancing the pain of any given test from the benefit of whatever knowledge we expected to gain from it, which is what happens when empathy is joined with reason.4. All feelings have a purpose. We are creatures who evolved, and we share these feelings with many of our non-human relatives; they have adaptive and survival value or they wouldn't exist. Any argument that tries to do away with any particular feeling must, I believe, acknowledge and understand the value that exists before a coherent and convincing argument can be made against it. This goes for the Dalai Lama's incessant harping against anger, Brene Brown's wholly unconvincing dismissal of shame, and it goes here for Paul Bloom's devaluation of empathy. 5. He repeatedly insists that the idea that people are incapable of truly reasoning is baseless, without providing any convincing argument against the vast evidence--never mentioned--that human reasoning ability is inextricably connected with emotion. That neurologically people are incapable of reaching conclusions without emotions. His argument reflects an unearned faith in the existence of One True Reasonable Conclusion for any argument; of course, there isn't one. This isn't, as he claims, a dismissal of Reason; it's an admission of its limitations and its inherent dependency on our emotional responses. We reason using thoughts and feelings, and any reasoned conclusions is partially dependent on feelings which must be admitted to and explored as part of a reasoned exploration. There are plenty of people out there who claim that there beliefs that the earth is flat, that climate change is a hoax, that vaccines cause autism, etc. are reasoned arguments based on evidence, which they clearly are not. His own book would have been better if he himself had done so.On page 10, Bloom lists his main influences for his argument against empathy and for reason:Richard DavidsonSam Harris (article about his assertion that black americans score lower on IQ tests because they are less intelligent here: https://www.vox.com/2018/4/9/17210248...)Jesse PrinzPeter Singer (disabled humans not persons; adult gorillas are persons; apparently supports the rights of parents to kill their disabled children? http://web.archive.org/web/2017030700...)Michael LynchMichael Shermer (multiple accusations of sexual assault: https://www.buzzfeed.com/markoppenhei...)Hrm. What kinds of conclusions do you think a person is going to reach with influences like these?Let's ignore the fact that they are all white, able-bodied, male, and with the exception of one, straight.Let's consider that this list is 50% known unrepentant asshole.Essentially, Paul Bloom sets up a straw man of unconstrained empathy without the benefit of any reasoning counterbalance and spends about 240 pages pummeling it with half-facts and anecdotes.

The title of this book consists of two parts, the ""against empathy"" part and the ""rational compassion"" part. I expected the author to go into each aspect in depth , arguing at first why empathy is a bad thing, then proposing the replacement and explaining how we can use the replacement to avoid the negative consequences of empathy.And here lies my main issue with this book, the author dedicates 5 chapters out of 6 to the arguments against empathy. and while that is already an unbalanced ratio for both arguments, I felt the last chapter was wasted on arguing if human beings are actually rational or not rather than explaining how being rational is the solution to the problems of empathy. so after finishing the book even 
if
 you agree that empathy is bad , you are left with nothing , just feeling bad about having a normal human emotion, and not knowing what to do about it.my second issue that I have with the book is the writing style. the book is written in a sort of a discussion like style , first arguing for one side then after that saying how one would counter that argument . And while acknowledging criticism and counter arguments is way better than stating your side of the argument as facts, it is done here in a really bad way that left me more often than not confused rather than informed. And if that was not enough already , the author tend to go off tracks A LOT either with unnecessary examples or with topics that seem unrelated to the main topic at hand. Here is an illustration how Paul Bloom presents his ideas I can't deny that he did have a point on the limitation of empathy , that it is like a spotlight , it is narrow and it can lead to hasty decisions that have unwanted consequences, and it may not be the emotion that can save humanity from evil( if you are someone who thinks this way than maybe this book has a lot to offer you). But that wasn't enough to convince me to have a similar opinion like the author and be ""Against empathy"". for me the only takeaway from this book was that we shouldn't act based strictly on emotions (empathy or other emotions like anger ) and that we should try to be as rational as possible before making any decisions."
298,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28727983-e,3,"Empathy is a poor way to make decisions, mostly because it inhibits rationality. It causes us to overvalue the proximate and undervalue the distant (he didn't bring this up, but that's also a reason people don't buy enough insurance, or eat healthy). Empathy screws up how we spend our ""charity dollars,"" how we react to wrongs, how we prioritize the use of scarce resources, and more. Bloom is not against compassion, mind you; he is against empathy as frequently defined as ""feeling yourself what you imagine others must be feeling."" Lots of studies have shown that when you get the studies' subjects to feel empathetically toward others, their rationality immediately goes down the tube. Heck, get them to feel empathy toward someone being mistreated, and then ask him how they would punish an unrelated wrong, and their proposed punishments get much harsher.This is Bloom's main argument. He makes it well near the beginning of the book, but kind of rambles and wanders the rest of the way. He talks about brain waves. He talks about how conservatives aren't actually less empathetic than liberals. He tries to talk about how empathy affects intimate relationships but never really gets there. He defends rationality when it comes to morality (I found this to be quite insightful, and important, but he doesn't connect it well to the rest of the book). And, though he is careful to define empathy precisely, he doesn't always hold himself to that definition when critiquing it.So I docked him a few stars. He also obviously doesn't know how to deal with religion. He mentions it in passing, although I would argue it affects profoundly the arguments he is trying to make. (It might even help his case. I would argue, for example, that the Biblical faith is all for rational morality. I would also argue that it would warn us against taking empathy too far, but it might not be as pessimistic as is Bloom.)So an interesting read, especially if you're trying to make better decisions (or feel better about yourself for not being very empathetic)."
299,0062339338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63928547-liane-lanovaz,2,"I has high hopes for this book, and oh boy, was I disappointed. I guess it's a good book if you're new to the notion of affective empathy not being that good. But we autistic activists have been familiar with the notion for decades. You'll find so many good blog posts and tumblr or twitter rants on the subject matter from people in the neurodivergent political sphere. It will be better than this book. You'll have more answers. You'll read them and hopefully you'll be better towards people who don't use their empathy.I thought the book would be autistic friendly. I thought it would also tackle the idea that cognitive empathy is mandatory to have a right to exist. I thought it would talk about how cognitive empathy is relative, how autistic and allistic people have trouble standing in each other's shoes, but how cognitive empathy is useless if you know how to LISTEN and if you're willing to be a kind, moral person once you've listened enough. It didn't. In fact, I had trouble going on once I read that you can't be a good person with a good moral compass if you don't ""have"" cognitive empathy. Showing how the author doesn't know shit about cognitive empathy. He based his book on his neurotypical views of empathy, and I couldn't relate. And I actually knew more, and better than him. I'm deeply disappointed by the book, and I won't read this author again.Now, it's probably a good introduction if you know nothing about empathy. It challenges your views and tackles several misconceptions. I'd recommend you read it if you think the problem with empathy is we don't have enough of it. Still, chapter one is basically a repeat of the prologue, and the ideas are repeated over and over, there is a Q/A section that I thought was very out of place... And once you've been convinced that you don't need to empathize to make good moral decisions and/or be a compassionate and kind person, it pretty much stops being interesting. I thought it would go a lot further."
