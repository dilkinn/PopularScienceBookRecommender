It has been a few years since I last looked at it. It is a little heavy going but it uses a modeling approach to simulate random adaptations be they genes or chemical networks or cultural products like products in an economy and has them mutate over a fitness landscape with peaks and valleys of benefit. The author also had the number of connections between ""genes"" or how much integration between parts is allowed. In other words, varying the interconnectedness of these ""genes"" or in other words how modularly independent each gene was in the collection genes and how this influenced them as they moved across this fitness landscape to climb fitness peaks. He found how much randomness needed to avoid getting trapped on a low peak. The problem with being on a low peak is you have to move down for a bit to randomly find a high peak. The of course if there is too much random movement allowed you wind up moving away from good peaks too often. This is all at the word description, of course, most of the data in the book look at the right amount of connectedness between ""genes"" the right amount of random movements on this fitness landscape. The data showed that a system can move to higher peaks under the right conditions of random movement and the right complexity of ""gene"" connections. This balance usually was a happy medium between frigid order and boiling chaos. There were also some interesting cycles found in random networks that had a certain number of connections between states as they cycled from state to state. Again the right level of connectedness lead to some beautifully complex order as the system moved randomly from state to state. Very interesting book and I am going from memory so excuse any errors I make in talking about it. needless to say, it does hint that Mathematics may rig things a bit so that complex things like life can emerge under the right conditions."

The standard tools of evolution (mutation + natural selection) have no material to work with here so they don't have any effect. Although Kauffman is very optimistic about laboratory experiments, other experiments have proven that any laboratory-manufactured self-replicating DNA over time tends towards the very minimum complexity necessary (thus shedding any and all unnecessary complexity for replication). In the evolutionary sense (he who reproduces the most is the fittest) simplicity reigns and complexity is a burden. This observational fact is 100% contrary to what Kauffman seeks to demonstrate: that self-organization is an innate quality of matter and complexity is a natural consequence. Kauffman misses the forest for the trees. "

3,0195079515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509598-alex-lee,4,"This is a thick book, but not because of its number of pages. In this book Kauffman goes deep into protein modeling through Boolean networks. This is perhaps a little dated, as the book was written in 1993 (data science has since provided more advanced methods perhaps). But the key is the same. Kauffman looks at modeling different activities to see how likely mutation can work for evolution.Most of this book is about this kind of modeling. He then ends the book with a chapter on cell differentiation, as it occurs in different zygotes of developing animals. This chapter is very different because it contains a different kind of logic; one that is a far leap from the random chaos of genetic mutation and protein manipulation.This is an impressive work covering lots of hard biological scientific examinations, of which I am not expert enough to really criticize. The methodology is pretty simple though. Kauffman provides lots of computer models to try and show that mutation can give rise to order. This is something that can be controlled by computers because natural selection criteria is ""given"" in any examination -- he assumes that it works because any odd selection process could work, we don't need to concern ourselves about that, we only need to see that genetic mutation can accommodate any given selection process... he finds some interesting examples, but ultimately concludes that local valleys/peaks in optimization is sufficient to forestall mutation and that natural selection cannot easily overcome such leaps in development. So that suggests there is a limit on how species can optimize even though niches can slide.This actually kind of destroys the notion of progress a bit, because there is no ""higher"" change only that there is change.What is interesting in this book is that Kauffman seems to acknowledge implicitly that cell differentiation and genetic mutation are potentially two different logics; how they coordinate is perhaps largely unknown because early cell differentiation in early (pre)fetal stages is completely unknown. He nonetheless provides a chapter in which he speculates based on experimentation, how that differentiation could occur but there seems to need to be some kind of coordination between cell signalling for this to happen. Kauffman is caught up in the mechanization for organization -- tiny incremental changes however seem completely indeterminate. What might be interesting is to model even the cell differentiation mechanism in species development, as if a computer could trace various mutations in a population as it impacts unborn animals. That in itself would probably eliminate the differentiation as a separate mechanism because everything remains controlled by genetics. In some sense though, Kauffman perhaps lacks the appropriate language for this but I don't know. There seems to be too many unknown and moving parts because the context of the cell itself is self-created via the genetics. As he argues, it is not impossible for every possible cell to be viable as many states of the cell available through genetics won't be functional or even worse -- be completely cancerous.How this is managed and sorted out is still a mystery, although Schrodinger provides a very interesting view, one in which thermodynamic impulses drive evolution as well, as energetic impulses continually look for more degrees of freedom to be expressed, something that happens regardless of what other constraints (environmental, or otherwise) may have additional influences."

6,0195079515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/541481-chessie,0,"Well after busting through the first 15 pages of very dry and condensed summary of the main theories being debated today in evolution, I've moved the book from my current read to my to-read shelf. I was curious about the book based on a cite from one of Dawkins books, and am interested in reading more about matter's inclination to organizing itself, and what this could imply not only in regards to additional factors in evolution (besides the most important natural selection) but also what this could imply regarding the very first forms of life-how life could have evolved from matter. The book also raises what could be constraints on evolution and also what are the patterns we can expect to evolve. Just to note not recommended to those intimidated by math."
