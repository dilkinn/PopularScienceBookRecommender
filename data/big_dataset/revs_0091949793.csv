2,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5866774-alex-sarll,0,"I have a few books called The Science of Superheroes, The Science of Doctor Who and the like. The sort of thing I'd hardly not pick up from the free box, but I've never read any of 'em - because I know it'll just consist of 'The science in this source is lousy, but here's a thing which is sort of vaguely similar'. The Science of Discworld is an altogether different beast. Because Discworld never even pretended to run on scientific principles, so what you get instead is our world being accidentally created in a pocket universe within Discworld, and then peered at from without (or interfered with) by the wizards of Unseen University - a bit like Lovecraft's elder gods, but generally benevolent and much more concerned about missing lunch. So the popular science book by Stewart and Cohen (themselves pretty good at this sort of thing) hangs off the spine of a Terry Pratchett novella - and one featuring my favourite Discworld characters, at that.This mix worked brilliantly for three books - each covering a defined and pretty separate area of science, each with a good little wizards story as a springboard for the principles. Here, I'm not so sure. The editing doesn't help - there's repetition, and sentences that are clearly missing important parts, though unusually it gets better as the book goes along (my usual experience is that errors accumulate more towards the end of a book - presumably because whoever is meant to be looking for them lost interest, or had to rush to meet a deadline). But even beyond that, I'm not sure the overall concept of the book was clear enough. In places it's updating the science from the previous books which has now become outmoded, which is fair enough - and in turn using that to illustrate the wider principle of how science, presented with new facts, changes its mind (a process they admit isn't always perfectly adhered to, but is nonetheless done with better grace than certain other world-views manage). Some of the stuff in this is really interesting - especially the new understanding of ribosomes as potentially more important than DNA, or the debunking of the 'Goldilocks universe' idea, showing how the idea that our universe is somehow perfectly adapted for our existence is based on several false premises and proves precisely nothing. Elsewhere, though, they're basically joining in the culture wars against creationist arses. Now, I'm all in favour of creationist-bashing - ideally with something like this - but it can all feel rather like preaching to the choir (inappropriate metaphor chosen deliberately). I suppose part of the point is that Science of Discworld books sell even in places that don't sell many books (eg my little local Tesco), and to people who wouldn't (be allowed to) buy The God Delusion, but it still involves going over some old ground for the rest of us. And then, to hang that off, you have the Pratchett novella. In which the Omnian church (who live on Discworld, but insist it's spherical) learn of Roundworld's existence, and claim ownership of it. This would be fine if Pratchett hadn't reformed them into a basically decent church many books ago, meaning he now has to dig out a fundamentalist offshoot, make them far more powerful than seems plausible under the circs, yet still have the main church kick against them in precisely the way even the blessedly mild CofE fails to do against their christian equivalents. A court case follows, which in its speechifying and consistent wish fulfillment feels less like Pratchett and more like popular liberal wankfest The West Wing. This book's intentions are good, but they're insufficiently clear, and the execution was definitely fumbled."
3,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8016506-hayley,2,"I have loved the previous science of the discworld books but this one really disappointed me. My first issue with it was the focus on religion. Although very respectful the constant argument against religion was to me a bit repetitive and not as interesting as some of the other scientific explanations and theories discussed in the other books. Maybe as someone with religious beliefs and a real interest in science the focus of this book did not sit comfortably with me. Maybe this links in well with me not liking my views beingchallenged (something that is discussed in the book)but for whatever reason I just could not get as interested in this book as with the others in this series.My second major issue with this book was the discworld sections. In the other books I have really loved the mixture of the scientific chapters interspersed with a mini discworld story, but this one just doesn't live up to my expectations. The story did not grip me and the characters just did not feel alive. Rincewind appears but could just be any old wizard. None of the characteristics/ personality of Rincewind shine through. I don't think that this will be a book that I will be tempted to read again."
4,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58046120-eleanor,3,"3.5 stars.This was the first new-to-me Discworld content I’ve read in a while, so I was super excited to dive back into one of my favorite fantasy worlds. As I think a lot of other reviews have mentioned, the scientific content of this book was a lot less hard science and more psychology of belief stuff—aka why people believe in or don’t believe in God, aka (because this book was written by three atheists) a methodical takedown of the concept of belief in a higher power in general.Now, that wasn’t the whole of Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen’s contributions to the book. There were several chapters that hardly included any religion v science content. I was especially fascinated by the parts on quantum superposition, the size and shape of the universe, and the RNA world hypothesis, as well as some great digressions on subatomic particles, topology, and statistics. And Stewart and Cohen state that science and religion can and should coexist, moderates in both camps recognize that a lot of the bad blood between them is unnecessary and harmful, and religions often promote good morals. (A couple of anecdotes throughout the book also seem to indicate that Cohen, despite no longer believing in the theological aspects of Judaism, still finds great value in the cultural aspects of that community.) But although the authors state those things a few times, that’s not the predominant tone of the book or what mainly comes across. The idea that belief in a higher power is fundamentally irrational and results from a fundamentally irrational approach to the idea of knowledge is the theme that weaves together this book. Even if it’s not the central focus of every chapter, it’s usually in the background. This theme is also very heavy-handedly and explicitly communicated through the main character, Marjorie, and some of her speeches and actions. It felt sometimes like the Discworld side of the story was just constructed to, for lack of a better phrase, shove this message in people’s faces, instead of letting the themes the authors wanted to communicate spring organically from well-developed plot and characters.I’m not religious, but I still didn’t like how condescending the whole book came across. I don’t think it intended to be that way, but I also think it’s difficult for many nonreligious people (myself included sometimes) to discuss religion without incredulously thinking something like how the hell could you believe in an imaginary man in the sky, which just means we have to pay extra attention to our rhetoric and make sure we’re communicating respect for religious people as human beings even if we don’t agree with their belief system. I feel like this book didn’t really do that. Even though it made some good points (ex. debunking common misinterpretations of the nature of scientific inquiry), those got lost in the rather grating tone.Another gripe I have with the science side of this book is that it almost doesn’t seem to be sure of its audience. As I mentioned, some of the chapters were filed with great, more technical scientific content. But substantial portions of them were dedicated to explaining that the Earth isn’t flat, and evolution does indeed exist, and the Earth is more than 10,000 years old, and so on. Which I understand some people might not believe, but to me, it was all so . . . basic? Like half the book was a Beginner’s Guide to How the Universe Works for religious people, whom Stewart and Cohen seem to think were born yesterday, and half the book was highly technical equations about the volume of hyperspheres that you have to take a Khan Academy break to understand. It was like the book wanted to have as large an audience as possible, so it included stuff for everyone, despite the fact that half of the its content would be ridiculous to most readers. All that being said, I did still enjoy reading this book. Aside from all those gripes, there were many aspects I enjoyed. I liked the more hard sciencey chapters (particularly the parts that got into biochem and microbiology, though that’s just me). I also loved seeing many of our favorite Discworld characters back at it again, particularly Ridcully, Vetinari, and Ponder. (I thought Rincewind fell a little flat, which was sad, because Interesting Times was my first Discworld book and Rincewind was my favorite Discworld character for a long time.) The cameo from (view spoiler)[Angua (hide spoiler)] was also a nice treat :)On the whole, I’d give the Discworld side of this book about a 4/5, and the science side more like a 3/5. Thus, my rating.I really wanna go back and reread some old Discworld books now. Maybe Night Watch or Thief of Time? We’ll see :)Please feel free to comment on this review, as with all my others, but let’s be extra conscious about keeping the tone respectful and calm. If you really need to rant, hmu in those Goodreads email messages :) "

6,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7916772-silent-count,3,"I wasn't expecting to see another ""Science of Discworld"" and was excited when I learned of it's existence. Then unfortunately, I read it.In terms of subject matter, ""Judgement Day"" is certainly the most advanced of the ""Science of Discworld"" series. While it does retread some of the ground covered in the earlier books, this one takes a closer look at some of the big questions our scientists ask of the universe. How did it all begin? Where is it going? What actually is the shape of the universe? And how close are we to answering any of these questions?All interesting enough but Messers Cohen and Stuart seem have stumbled into the same pit which Richard Dawkins has long since disappeared into. You see the problem is thus: faith is belief despite the absence of evidence. People who have faith are not going to be swayed by pointing out the absence of evidence, nor by the existence of evidence contradicting their faith, because if they were the kind to be swayed by such things, they wouldn't have their faith-based beliefs to begin with. Yet, intelligent and knowledgeable as they are, Cohen and Stewart fail to wrap their collective mind around that line of thought so they subsequently devote countless pages to the folly of providing evidence and logical arguments that religion is not consistent with the scientific method. We all know, but the faithful just don't care!Sadly the ""Discworld"" chapters of the book both compound, and are a reflection of, the mistakes made by the ""scientific"" chapters - they try to preach science to the faithful. As a result, they seem disjointed. More a description of a series of events rather than a story with a plot.There some interesting and worthwhile topics discussed in this book, so if you have an interest in science... well, there are still better books out there to take a look at. However, if you like science and enjoy the view from a turtle-shaped world, there are worse ways you could spend an afternoon."
7,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7868531-gerd,2,"Wow. What a disappointment. The major flaw with this installment of the 'Science of Discworld' series is that it is not really a 'Science of Discworld' book. The Discworld part is very small and - frankly - badly written. It makes one wonder whether Terry Pratchett was really much involved with writing those parts. The science parts of the book suffer from a. being too long b. no clear structure c. swinging wildly between being too detailed and being to general. The overall book feels like someone just wanted to bash religions - or more likely get back to someone who is religious and wasn't very nice about it. Don't get me wrong, I am all in favor for showing clearly that religions are a relic from the past, that shouldn't exist anymore in our rational, 'enlightened' time. But the style of saying over and over again that proponents of religion are simply dumb morons doesn't help. The book has no clear objective, there are no real ideas, information or action proposals on how to change the situation. In contrast to especially books 1 and 2 of the series, it just seems like someone has a grudge and wanted to write his frustrations away. What a pity - given the scientific facts, history of science and insights into current scientific developments, it could really have been a great book."
8,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1038815-jc,3,"This is the first of the Science of Discworld books I have read. I am sorry to say I was somewhat disappointed in it. Coming from a science background, having read and enjoyed many ""Science of..."" and ""Philosophy of..."" books, and being a BIG fan of Discworld and other Pratchett writings, I was excited to read this. But, I felt the authors constantly waffled regarding who their audience was. The result was that sometimes it was way too dense, or assuming too much background knowledge on the part of its readers, while at other times it was way too simplistic for any one with even a high school level of science (esp. Physics and Biology) knowledge. I could have enjoyed the book if it stuck to either the simplistic, introductory level, or if it had consistently spoke to an audience with a basic background in the subject matter. However, the often abrupt changes in tone was off-putting. At the same time, many section were fascinating and well-constructed. So, I had mixed feelings. I will probably read at least one of the earlier ones, as many who have read the previous three think this is the weakest of the series so far. Maybe I was just expecting too much."
9,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3451020-gosia,5,"Now! Now we are talking! I knew I was persistent with reading the Science of Discworld for a reason, I know why I don't give up on book or series I start!I started my adventure with Discworld with Rincewind series, so normal was my reason to get to Science. The problem is.. I'm 100% humanist. Like, learning languages. Like reading books. Like learning about religions/history.I'm not really a science person, I was happy when biology ended in high school and almost burnt all my math books(thank Godness I didn't do it, I'm financial analyst now, but you get my point, right?)Reading three parts of Science taught me quite a lot, I didn't know all these stuff, but it was kinda.. well, not boring, but not that amusing as it should be.This one though, even if it's talking about THAT things also, IS AWESOME, kay? Loved every single page of it. Humor is witty, the Authors are talking about themselves - which makes it cool - plus The Mags story with Ms Librarian is really cool too. Awesome one. Now, off I go to the Witches series. #YESSSSS "
10,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62631147-margaret-mackley,3,"Not a lot of Terry Pratchett in this. Good scientific explanations by the other authors. I'm not sure that a religious person would enjoy this, but I found the debate between the human centred (religious) view of our world v the universe centred (scientific) view quite entertaining. I still got a bit bogged down in the science parts at times and wished there was a bit more of Discworld in the book. Thought provoking nevertheless."

12,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21130273-chris-boulton,4,".. and so passes another ending of a Discworld related series.. guess I'm gonna have to get used to that seeing as, you know, he's no longer with us, mortal coils and all that.It's been a while since I delved into the Science of Discworld books.. tbh I think I probably should have re-read the first three - as a refresher - and then read this one but hindsight is an amazing thing. What I do remember though is distinctly preferring the ""Discworld chapters"" more than the ""Science Chapters"". I was younger and still pretty new to the Discworld so I think part of me just wanted to read another DW novel but was disappointed to discover he was there to learn things.. maths, science and stuff like that - ""UGH!"" said younger me, ""I get enough of that at school!""There is also the issue that I'm not all that bright... sure, I can pull out good bits of information (generally useless but interesting, I think) when occasionally some discussion kicks off a memory of an episode of QI and I'm like ""did you know that the Blue Whale's testicles holds.. "" or ""they can only swallow things the size of a grapefruit?!"".. but if you want proper science-y or maths-y intelligence then I'm not your man.Annnyway.. my point is that in this particular edition of the SoDW.. I think I actually preferred the ""Science Chapters"" (SC) to the ""Discworld Chapters"" (DWC). The DWCs were too short and fragmented for my liking .. I remember the story being quite involved and enjoyable in the previous books.. here they just felt like fillers until you got to the SCs. But the SCs were informative, enjoyable, funny and - being not particularly bright (as mentioned previously) - largely understandable.. even if I had to read them twice, occasionally thump the side of my head while screaming ""HELLO? IS ANYONE THERE?!"" or simply shrug and move on sometimes.Might have to go on the ""retrieve from the parent's house for a reread"" list.. maybe. Anyway, now I'm starting a new trilogy that I'm not all that excited about attempting.. but I think it's probably time to give it a go... ""The Hunger Games""."
13,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59904753-eric,3,"This review applies to The Science of Discworld volumes I-IV. Overall, I'd give these a 3.5. We've all run into books titled ""The Science of..."". These sad volumes generally try to coerce some vague relationship between current scientific theories and whatever key narrative elements (hyperspace, transporters, etc.) are hallmarks of the host series' stories. The Science of Discworld books are something else entirely. They start with the assertion that a flat world riding through space on a turtle is the only reasonable design. There is, therefore, no need to explain it. When the wizards on Discworld accidentally create a non-magical universe that seems to work on spherical principles (""Roundworld""), there is a great deal to explain. How does a non-magical universe work with nothing to tell it how things should be?The books are one part Discworld story, used primarily as a framing device, and one part detailed science primer - not of the Disc, which needs no explanation, but of our own world. Subatomic physics, scientific method and history, evolution, culture, biology, and other topics are covered in a narrative non-mathematical way. Generally the coverage is solidly reasoned and very clearly explained. While both the stories and the science are serviceable, neither are spectacular - with one exception. The authors present a recurring argument that homo sapiens should actually be named pan narrans - ""the storytelling ape"". They make the case that our apparently unique ability to tell stories, factual, representational, counterfactual, and otherwise is the driving force behind the human endeavors of culture, science, and religion. It's a fascinating and convincing assertion."
14,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1050800-laurie,3,"This volume of the Science of Discworld books goes over evolution, cosmology, and religion, among other things. The discussion of these things is presented if fairly straightforward terms that most readers will be able to understand without having to resort to Google too often. I’ve read several books on quantum physics and cosmology (and still remain boggled by the subjects) and have to say this book puts in a very understandable way. The heart of the book, though, is a thread that runs through all the subjects, and that is why do people believe in things that cannot be proved scientifically. Why do some cling to young earth theories that geologists assure them are not true, or feel that their religion, and only their religion, is real and true despite *not* being able to prove it? Their answer is that religion is human-centered, even though it tries to explain universe centered things. A human centered world view concentrates on the smaller things, on a human scale. Science says the universe is huge, cold, and doesn’t give a damn about humans. A universe centered view offers no comfort. Like the other SoD books, the science is strung together with a weak Discworld story. And it’s very weak in this book. A couple of pages of story at the start of every chapter makes it a very short story, and it has no plot arc. A fair number of Discworld characters put in appearances, but it’s like they are just wheeled out to wave at the crowd and be gone. If you’re looking for an overview of the sciences presented in this book, it’s fine. But don’t expect a real Discworld story. "
15,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5469227-d-l-morrese,4,"I'm not sure how much of this was written by the late, great Sir Terry, but I didn't see much of his signature wit in it. It is, however, a fine overview of how a scientific perspective differs from a mystical perspective. Science, the authors claim, is universe-centered. We are a consequence of the way the universe is. Mysticism and religion tend to be human-centered, placing Man (somewhat arrogantly) as the reason for the nature of the universe. Obviously, there is much discussion about the Anthropic Principle (both Strong and Weak). They also challenge the claim that science is a belief system, not unlike that of religions. The key reason it's not is that virtue in religious belief systems is gauged by faithful acceptance of the dogma/scriptures/dictates of the religion and accepting them as true. In science, the greatest virtue comes from challenging current beliefs and discovering ways in which they are flawed."
16,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19055083-john-dunlop,3,"I like this series of books. The scientific parts are very accesable and just as good as the fiction parts.On this particular book, not so much.The science was still as educational and amusing as it always was.The discworld part..........well...........look i know Terry Pratchett is not a well man and I take my hat off to him, the last few books he's written have surpassed my expectations, but on this book I get the impression his name is being used as a marketing tool. The discworld sections only amount to three or four pages each and amount to nothing more than a synopsis for a story.I enjoyed the book, but I think my expectations were too high."
17,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5731179-chris-moorhead,4,"Not as good as the other volumes in this series, IMHO, but I found the 'updates' on the scientific parts revisited in this book very interesting. I enjoy the writing style of Stewart and Cohen and would recommend other books by them, although they are a much heavier on the science parts. Altogether, however, a good read."
18,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5021915-sara,1,I stop part way through. It's not a story like other Terry Pratchett books. It more like weird bits of info about actually science and their opinions of them. It reads too much like a textbook and not enough like a novel.
19,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8012211-neil,1,"First of all, it's not 'a brilliant new Discworld novel'.It's a rather dull treatise on physics by two blokes who are NOT Pratchett, with interposing passages by the great man to give it a touch of entertainment value. I didn't read the first three, I'm happy to say."

21,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1157324-peter-dunn,4,"While this is the weakest of the four Science of Discworld books it’s merely the weakest of four fabulous books all of which will make you both laugh and think, often at the same time. It is just that this one will make you do so fractionally less than the other three.Why do I think it is just a tiny bit weaker than the others? Two reasons: -Firstly Terry’s Discworld sequences in this book feel less substantial than in the previous three books. They are probably exactly the same length as before but the overall story seems slightly weaker and less engaging than the others. Of course any Terry Pratchett Discworld stuff is sure to amuse, entertain and make you think, and this does all those things but just a little less powerfully that usual.Secondly Jack and Ian’s sections focus this time on religion and in particular how more extreme or dogmatic versions of religion may actually impede good thinking or even science itself, both as a thought process and as an endeavour. This is fine except this time that one topic seems to be the almost single focus to the exclusion of all else. In the previous three books Ian and Jack were able to be much more discursive, fitting in thoughts on many other things without losing the thrust of their main thesis, and they had also covered some of the same ground on religion in books one and two. So, as I have said, these sections are well worth reading, and will challenge your thinking, but marginally less so than the previous three books in the series did.So I need to make two declarations of interest here. First Terry and Jack are/were both researchers at the University of Warwick which also currently employs me, so than might perhaps bias me a tadge. Secondly I (as Terry, Jack and Ian knows/knew) am a very bad Evangelical Christian so that might bias me a little in the opposite direction. However I know Jack and Ian won’t think that I am carping too much here as an Evangelical because as they amusingly noted in Science of Discworld 2:‘So let us begin by acknowledging, as we did towards the end of The Science of Discworld, that 'all religions are true, for a given value of true' ' And they also noted in the same book:‘If you are religious, and you want to feel comfortable about what we're saying, you can always assume that we're talking about all the other religions, but not yours.’So I will assume that then….. :-)I am saddened to be writing this in same month that Jack passed away. He will be missed but thankfully we still have the many great publications he left us - including this book. GNU Jack. GNU Terry. "
22,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7552897-sebastian,3,"I enjoyed the previous Science of Discworld books. I adore Terry Pratchett. I like the writing style of Stewart and Cohen. I even dig the quirky way they refer to themselves in the third person, though I vaguely recall Pratchett himself warning us about people like that in one of his books. Somehow, though, in this fourth installment all of this never quite comes together to produce a coherent whole.It could be, in part, misplaced expectations – with a name like “Judgement Day”, I expected this one to be about, well, end-of-the-world scenarios or at least planet-wide disasters of some sort. So as I discovered, bit by bit, that it is a drawn-out discussion of rationalism vs. religious belief, my excitement slowly faded, especially since in my case, they are, ahem, well, preaching to the choir. In fact, other than being like a friendlier double-act version of Dawkins, there is no clear guiding idea for this volume – the science bits are few and far between, while the criticism of faith-based reasoning falls into the very trap part of the book talks about – that kind of reasoning is impervious to this kind of logic. The only reason I can see for the book (other than the obvious financial one) is to serve as a kind of light rallying of the forces, to remind us that we, the non-religious, are part of a global community, and possibly to arm us with a few small tools that might come in useful in potential debates about this issue.Despite all of the above, I don’t feel my time has been wasted, and the Pratchett bits, though short and not terribly well developed, are entertaining, but it would seem that this series has hit the limits of its potential about a volume ago."
23,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21853313-brandt,3,"At this point, when writing about The Science of Discworld series, I'm certain that I am repeating myself. From a conceptual level, a book that uses a Discworld story as a frame story for the science writers Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen to pontificate about different topics in science seems like a winner, but in execution it feels like Pratchett would only give them half baked narratives to work with in the process, sometimes begging the question if Stewart and Cohen would give Pratchett the topics they wanted to cover and then he would write accordingly. I've covered this in depth in the review for Darwin's Watch so i will not be repeating myself here, which is more than I can say for Pratchett, Stewart and Cohen here, as much of what they write about they have already addressed in the first three novels.Effectively, finishing the Science novels effectively also ends the ""Rincewind/Wizards"" track from this Discworld reading guide. I still feel like I haven't found what everyone seems to love about Discworld but there's still a lot of reading to do. Since I couldn't decide between the Watch and Witches tracks, I decided to go ""Ancient Civilizations"" next, since Small Gods was referenced many times in the Science of Discworld novels. But I've about had my fill of Rincewind and the Unseen University at this point, so good riddance."
24,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92319089-colin-scott-mackenzie,3,"Not for meA clever enough book, I suppose - but not what I expected. As a deist or is it theist (to use the author's terminology) I simply did not like the way he talked down to those of us who prefer the possibility of a divine being interested in our welfare by his setting up scenarios to which he obviously already had a crushing response handy.I am as capable as any of suspending belief in order to enjoy fantasy which is probably why I have enjoyed most of the disciples series so much but that does not prevent me from appreciating hard reality as that might be explained by godless scientists - and I didn't buy this book to endure a lecture on atheism. OK he did try to provide a measure of balance and there were parts his argument which were good but it was not what I expected. It is just too anti for proper enjoyment for a reader not already far along the agnostic declivity but curately-egg-like parts were indeed clever enlightening is why in spite of not liking it very much I award three stars. It should really be listed in some philosophic category and not try to slip it past an unsuspecting readership in the guise of a near relative of the original series. Perhaps I should have read the blurb rather better - if there was one ,that is."

As someone who used to count myself among their numbers, I turned away when 9/11 revealed what the movement was, in fact, actually concerned with - religious extremeism that does not endorse the current imperial order, a topic not so mysteriously glossed over.This holds true with the critical religious analysis here: if it's something bad being put on display, it's not abortion clinic bombings or ethnoreligious apartheid policies (those things that do not run against western hegemony), it's ISIS fighters yelling OM IS GOOD. If it's something good? It's the misguided but relateable old chaps at the Church of England or similar, or just simple condescension toward those pitiable backward savages.The discworld part was good, and the rest not bad and sometimes interesting. Suffered from a lot of the same issue Darwin's Watch did where the science chapters were like 6x longer than the story ones. Better than that one, but still a shadow of how good the first one was."
26,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18534820-william-tracy,3,"This one's a pretty solid 3.5 stars. It is, unfortunately, a Discworld-related book published late in Sir Terry's career, which means the writing of the Discworld sections suffers. It's a terrible thing to see a master writer's skill degrade. These sections are also far too short in comparison with the sciencey parts, leaving a very short fantasy tale of maybe 20-30 pages.On the Science parts, Ian and Jack once again provide some great technical detail and connections between events, but as others have said, I was left with a bit of a bad taste from the overly pushy atheist slant of the writing. It's not that I disagree with their points, but more the perspective that anyone who believes in a religion, or even believes in God, must be very stupid.Finally, I would say the first few chapters are probably hard to get through for those with less than a masters degree in a math or science area. A lot of the discussion about fundamental universe effects was interesting, but nearly went over my head, and I read about this stuff."
27,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1832507-peter,3,"Alternately Discworld story and scientific explanation, this is a tried and tested format. It's also a little tired. This time we are thinking about science and religion (belief). The thinking about science is reasonable clear, while I am no science expert I am a keen hobbyist and read a lot, even so some of it wasn't that well explained. Belief, on the other hand, wasn't thought about at all, except that it is seen as irrational, and some very pointed examples of how this worked against the common good. As I read this in very short bursts, over a very long period, I probably have a more negative view, but it seemed to me that the story parts were rather contrived, and lacked the interest of the earlier books. Time to call it a day and not bother with book 5?Still, just about worth a read."

The science parts of the book seemed overly long compared to the previous volumes and I found myself skimming them rather than actually absorbing the information they were giving). The Discworld parts were very short but the main message of 'science good religion bad' was quite heavy handed. It's not that the book is badly written, it just comes down to personal opinions and this book really wasn't for me."
29,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2990171-t,3,"I listened to the audio version which had a very good narrator.This was my first Discworld book so I was not familiar with the parallel construction using a science story and a Discworld story. I liked both and eventually stopped trying so hard to relate the two. I found the science component fascinating and while the details were often over my head, I hung with the concepts. The Discworld story was entertaining - Margery Dawe was a plucky gal - I ended up wishing it was a bigger part of the book."

I don't always agree with some of the sentiments regarding the superiority of science over religion, but these scientists are always respectful of religious views even when they are disagreeing with them, which is becoming increasingly uncommon in our sometimes aggressively secular culture."

I'm a bit sad it's over.I would probably get more out of these if I read them in print instead of audio, and especially if the print has charts or illustrative examples or something like that. Big Science Ideas for Things You Can't See are hard for me, but these books make them not scary. Best for existing fans, must-haves for all libraries."

While the other books in the science series offered me with super in-depth and engaging expositions, this one tends to scrape the surface of various topics, dipping here and there, with some sort of randomness that makes me wander what’s really the point of this book. It’s a little bit of a disappointment mildly said."
33,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3775401-marie,4,"So I should confess that I skipped most of the science chapters. Not because I didn't find them interesting, I did, but because my brain didn't like constantly switching back and forth between fiction and non-fiction. I'm sure I'll go back and read them one of these days, but for now my rating is solely for the story."

49,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28292862-tom-owens,3,"It has been a long time since I've delved into Discworld, and even longer since attacking the hybrid Discworld/Roundworld ""Science of Discworld"" series. The three previous books have been an interesting mix of Discworld narrative and real-life science. The science has veered from the ""simple"" science that anyone with even a vague interest in could follow through to some slightly more difficult concepts that required a bit more background knowledge to understand fully. But it has always been relatively consistent and not too varied in the level of understanding required.I was expecting something similar from number four but I have to confess to a slight level of disappointment with this one. While it is true that the topics covered in this book are slightly more philosophical and ""touchy-feely"" than early books, this doesn't excuse some of the writing being very inconsistent. It jumps too far; from needing a simple background in science for some sections through to topics that require several advanced PhDs (or a willingness to simply turn the page and ignore that bit).Cosmology is never an easy topic to cover, and it is even harder to cover it for the masses. But I felt the writers never really found the correct pitch for the target audience (in fact it seems sometimes they don't know who the target audience are). There are some fantastic sections, just not enough consistency.The other main problem I had with this book was the slightly ""lecturey"" feel to it. The authors are scientific men, who just about keep their disdain for religious beliefs under control. A big part of the book is the difference between ""human-centred"" and ""universe-centred"" thinking, which seems to mimic quite well the difference between those of a religious persuasion and those from a more scientific world. But it is all very preachy, along the lines of ""How can you silly religious people believe so blindly in faith when the evidence is all to the contrary?"". I get their point, but not the approach. It often feels patronising and rather petulant sometimes; like trying to explain to a child a complex problem and being frustrated that the child wants to just play (not that I am referring to those of great faith as children you understand)!!It all comes across as a frustrated attempt to convert believers into sceptics, missing the point that the reason many believers believe cannot be put into simple scientific equations or concepts. They simply do, and all the scientific evidence won't make a jot of difference. The whole essence of the topics gets lost under this weight of frustration for me.The Discworld sections too disappointed. They were a couple of strung together sections that in all reality brought nothing to the book and simply served to clean the intellectual palate between topics. The other books had a much better balance between the fiction and non-fiction sections but I'm afraid this one gets it woefully wrong.Overall this really should have been better. The tried and tested concept has been amended too much for my liking and the complexity of the topics is possibly beyond what the typical reader would have expected. The Discworld elements don't work and this book is, I feel, trading on the success of that series without incorporating enough of those elements. It needs to be lighter and I think most people expected it to be. Verdict: 3 stars out of 5 - A disappointing entry. Too focused on trying to push the world of science over religion and too inconsistent in its tone and approach. Lip-service paid to Discworld rather than using that part of the narrative to connect the dots in a more coherent manner."
50,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90180390-ninjamuse,2,"The Science of Discworld IV: Judgement Day - Terry Pratchett, Ian Stewart, and Jack CohenIn brief: Roundworld’s being threatened—by Omnian fundamentalists! Will the wizards save it this time? And what is the nature of belief anyway? How do we know anything? Fourth in a series, part of a larger universe.Thoughts: This is not my favourite of the Science of Discworld books, but I’m not all that surprised by that, given that Pratchett was in his final years when he helped write it. (The vim and brio are lacking for me in a lot of his later work.) The science chapters are probably about the same quality as they’ve always been, but the framing Discworld story felt even looser and more didactic than the others have.Bear in mind it’s been years since my last Science of Discworld so I might just be misremembering things. It happens. And that I read this primarily on long-distance transit while not completely awake, so there’s that too.Science first, because why not. I liked that the authors tackled belief systems and knowledge to cap off the series. I didn’t learn much—which might be part of what was lackluster, come to think of it—but it felt like a very fitting way to end things, to talk about what’s known, what knowing things means, how we’ve come to know fundamental things about the earth, the universe, and physics in general, and how religions fit into the picture. It’s as encompassing and inclusive as Discworld and the Science of Discworld books usually are. They’re not saying that religion is wrong or untruthful, just that it’s different sort of truth than science provides. (There are also some discussions that continue from past books a bit, such as evolution, in that we’ve learned more since they were written.)The Discworld segments, though… They’re a bit one-note and they felt slow. There’s not much going on besides the trial, which takes a while to get to and get through, and even though the Wizards are collecting evidence in the meantime, we don’t see that much of their work. They also don’t really feel like themselves? Sort of a watered-down version? None of that got to me really, though. What bugged me most was the addition of Marjorie Daw.I can see the narrative point of bringing her in as an outsider POV in the chaos of the Wizards, but she didn’t seem to have much to do besides that. Ask a few questions in a quasi-Socratic dialogue and occasionally make outbursts, but that was it. Oh, and provide a little bit of atheist/librarian humour. She didn’t feel believable to me, let alone rounded the way I’m used to, and it make the whole thing feel a bit flat as a result. Like adding her was a cop-out.So now I come down to my usual questions of whether I’d recommend this and to whom. I’m not sure. The science sections are interesting with some good food for thought but I didn’t find them enlightening or mind-blowing, but the Discworld parts are nothing to write home about. I guess if you’re a completist Discworld fan? If you’ve read the other Science of Discworlds? But this isn’t the one to start with, by any means.Warnings: Sexism. Religious extremists, slightly mocked. Possible shaking of one’s beliefs about the world and one’s role in it, though probably not to the point of existential crisis.6/10 (7 but it lost points with Marjorie.)"
51,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,2,"Pratchett's tenure as a movement atheist, which arguably started with Science III (2005) but didn't hit its stride until Nation (2008), has been equal parts tedious and embarrassing. Science IV, which purports to discuss the conflict between science and religion (with the obligatory prevarication because Stewart is involved), does not break the trend.My problem isn't with the choice of subject—though the mainstream atheist/skeptic movement did, to nobody's greater surprise than mine, actually pretty much settle on an answer a few years ago (the accommodationists rightly lost), the question of whether science and religion are fundamentally incompatible is not an unimportant one—or even the fact that they refuse to settle on a meaningful conclusion, waffling into the aether in the final chapter; it's with the general execution.The book covers all of the memes this side of Mithras you can expect to hear in a typical New Atheist echo chamber, and the pop-sci marshalled to underscore the point is the same tired dross you can find in any of dozens of books the movement has produced since 2006, or, indeed, any of the associated ``science fan'' discussion forums. Little regard is paid to accuracy or coherence, and there is absolutely no sign of arguments honed in battle with actual religious people, accommodationists, or fence-sitters. Important (in context, at least), common accommodationist and religious talking points are left completely unaddressed, and the arguments there are are so sloppily constructed and so full of weak spots a person so inclined could use to discard them entirely, they will only appeal to people already convinced. The whole thing is lazy, patronising, and borderline anti-intellectual.And none of it, of course, is improved by being couched in the most poorly written Discworld story to date. It seems whoever wrote the fiction part never actually read a Discworld novel, but only had names and job titles for the characters to be used. None of the established characters actually behave in-character, and the storyline itself is a dull and uneventful afterthought.I hate to blame all of Pratchett's faults since 2007 on Alzheimer's, but I would hate even more to accuse him of creative laziness and indifference, and something is going on there.Someone who hasn't already read so much pop-sci covering the same ground and who isn't yet tired of the Dawkinsite brand of atheist and who is more charitably disposed to the authors might find this book tolerable or even entertaining. I'm pretty much done with Pratchett and Stewart."
52,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5568134-helle,2,"To me, The Science of Discworld IV: Judgement Day was an unnecessary addition to the Science of Discworld novels. The Discworld story between the science chapters was amusing, but way too short (but this was also the case in the earlier books).The science was the biggest let-down. In parts it was just a repetition of previous installments. Sometimes I thought it was too difficult to really understand it, a problem I did not have before. And it also seemed jumbled; there was no real thread through it all."
53,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9749667-jan,3,"I would almost prefer to read a similar book about cosmology and contemporary theories concerning life, universe and everything without the Discworld layer. The Discworld part of the story feels underdeveloped - Pratchett was always good in communicating interesting ideas using allegory, satire, word-play and deep characters, but I miss almost all of this here. For example when I look at the antagonist and compare him with Vorbis from Small Gods, Vorbis comes out as a well fleshed-out character while the reverend from Discworld Science is just a strawman. Also, I experience some cogniive dissonance probably arising from the fact that I live in one of most atheist countries in the world and there are no issues like the intelligent-design-in-schools problems. From my point of view, the decision to base entire book on conflict of science and religion feels unnecessary, a bit like when you meet an interesting patron in a pub who has lots to say in his field of expertise, but also has an agenda that has to be listened to before you get to the other topic that you really want to know.I guess that somone might say ""Oh, lucky you! Atheism is prevalent in your country, but here, we need this book. And Richard Dawkins too.""Possibly. But while the God is gone (or at least a bit more gone than elsewhere), evil and lack of critical thinking remain, they just do not manifest themselves as will of God, but as nationalism, jingoism, chauvinism, ""common sense"", both ""political correctness"" and ""fight against political correctness"", acceptance of rumors, hate that is easy, twisted infotainment, ""defense of our secular values"" (while stomping on them) and so on. Discworld was always good in serving secular humanist values as long as they were not too pushed. Discworld science, in my opinion, just pushes too much. "
54,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21314590-john,4,"This is a great science book with a mediocre Discworld story stitched in. The two parts don't mesh nearly as well as the as the previous Science of Discworld books. However, even a mediocre Discworld story is pretty good, and the rest of the book gives a pretty good summary of the current state of science, its philosophy, and the apparent conflict with religion. For example, a question that has been vexing me for a while is answered (kind of) in the book, i.e., what is the size and shape of the universe? This is important from a philosophical point of view because some forms of Relativism depend on an infinite number of points of view which can only be true in an infinitely large or infinitely old universe. Anyhow it turns out that the size and shape of the universe is an open question. It was previously believed that the universe was a finite, closed, expanding hypersphere. However that option is just one topology that satisfies the Theory of Relativity and it requires Dark Energy and Dark Matter to exist to remain valid, which makes it a little suspect. Other topologies are being investigated and may fit observations better. Verifying these by experiment will be tricky.The books position regarding religion has drawn criticism. However, the authors go out of their way to point out the science's limitations and the strengths of moderate religions. It's the fundamentalists that it jabs at and I'm perfectly fine with that, give the amount of misery they are causing in the world. One thing the book does lack is a bibliography: a lot of good books were mentioned in passing throughout the text and it would have been nice to gather them into one place, with a brief note about them."
55,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4244903-preston-postle,2,"As readers of previous ""Science of Discworld"" books know (but really, how many of you are there?), the conceit here is that the blundering wizards of Unseen University have accidentally brought into existence a sparkling blue planet in a bottle. As they investigate it -- and the universe in which it moves -- they learn about the science that makes things tick. The books alternate between fictional chapters written by Pratchett that describe the adventures of the wizards, and hard science biology/astronomy/physics non-fiction written by his scientist co-authors.The problem with this fourth volume in the series is that the science is painfully abstruse while the fictional segments don't add up to a story. Non-fiction: DULL. Fiction: DULL. Dull, dull, dull. The gist of the analysis here is ""why do humans think and believe as they do, and how does religion fit into all this?"" The bottom-line conclusion seems to be ""if you believe in God, you're a bit of a boob,"" but the authors expend an awful lot of words not coming right out and saying this.Instinctive thinking vs. logical, evidence-based thinking. It's an interesting comparison, but I think it could have been done in a lot less space. This thinker is a bit of a stinker."
56,0091949793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4931052-patrick-lum,2,"What I always liked about the Science of the Discworld books was that they made high-scale, complex, abstract science easy for me to comprehend, if not necessarily understand. Here they didn't quite strike that right balance: I found my attention wandering as terms and jargon cascaded upon me, often only able to return to the book through force of will. I'm not sure if I've gotten dumber or if the book got worse at simplifying things, but either way I found it more difficult to follow than usual. The lack of a central unifying theme doesn't help (or rather, the central unifying theme is so broad it doesn't aid understanding)Apparently by this point PTerry's embuggerance had progressed to the point where he had forgotten what Rincewind's unique character voice sounded like, and other aspects of the narrative plot were similarly weak; not that I expect so much out of these spin-off books necessarily, but it seemed depressingly apparent that the Pratchett who was writing this book had other things on his mind, possibly.Nonetheless - I did enjoy it, all in all, and I look forward to perhaps dissecting it with more attention at some point."

So I ended up starting again at the beginning.The Discworld/Pratchett story chapters at the Unseen University, I clung to like a woman about to go off the Rim. The bits by Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen seemed well-written (and I would love to know a lot more about Jack Cohen's life based on the titbits here) but I had a problem with them: a) there was far too much compared with the Discworld story and felt a bit all over the place and b) I've read quite a lot of physics (for me) over the last year and this was just confirming that I still don't get it and my grasp of the more biological was probably illusory, not helped by not reading early enough in the day. I was interested in their examination of belief and why people are religious and quite comfortable as atheist and British."

The Pratchett sections take up around 50 pages of this 325 page book and don't represent him at his best, the story is episodic, uninvolving and poorly characterized, lots of his stock company of characters are present but seem to have lost most of their personality. Pratchett's wisdom is still there, his world view is about as refreshingly right as ever and his wit is still sharp, but he seems to have put this one together by numbers. Stewart and Cohen's sections are somewhat better, although they do rather too often head for the ""Quantum"" end of the scale, but when they are discussing and debunking religion and belief systems in general (the main thrust of the book) they are often very interesting. "
