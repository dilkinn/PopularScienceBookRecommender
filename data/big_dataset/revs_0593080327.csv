Or how about the time you ate some fresh lettuce out of the garden and two days later garden slugs climbed out of your stomach and into your mouth? Or your grandmother got pregnant at age 75? Or your neighbor swallowed 27 knives and lived? These are the types of curiosities contained in this humorous book written tongue-in-cheek by a medical historianThe author researched old books, pamphlets, letters, and doctors notes from the 18th and 19th centuries to find the information some of which will make you wince. He warns the reader that the majority of the cases are exaggerations, frauds accepted as truth, and misdiagnosis errors by medical practitioners. Medicine was still pretty much a guessing game during those times and in some cases the author proves how the story absolutely could not be true (such as the man who taught his child to breathe underwater) while others are not probable but could be possible (such as the man who swallowed his false teeth and lived).I think the author had as much fun writing this book as it is to read it. Let's be honest...how many people do you know who urinate through their ear? Funny stuff indeed."

Written by a medical historian, this book delves back to the 19th century, assembled mostly through old medical journals and newspaper clippings. With groupings like ""Unfortunate Predicaments"" telling of 'honking like a goose'; ""Mysterious Illnesses"" with 'the woman who peed through her nose'; ""Dubious Remedies"" with 'the pigeon's rump cure'; ""Tall Tales"" with 'the slugs and the porcupine'; ""Hidden Dangers"" with 'killed by his false teeth' this book is filled with unbelievable stories of unimaginable situations. The cures are even more bizarre! Hot water bottles, opium, laxatives and leeches were everyday cures and possibly the most sane. These hard to believe illnesses and cures makes our modern medicine such an evolution. But it also testifies as to the resilience of people, who were actually just lab rats at the time. It makes you wonder what of today's medical miracles will become ridiculous, dangerous, and obsolete in the near future. A fun book to read, that will have you both appalled, at some of the stories, yet thankful you live in the current world of medicine. "
2,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2946544-christopher,5,"Medicine is an ever-evolving profession, and its history can be downright weird. Medical historian Thomas Morris has combed through countless vintage medical journals and historical documents showcasing the progress medicine has made in a relatively short time. His work goes beyond bizarre anecdotes, and instead softens the wonky view of health, breaking into sections ranging from Horrifying Operations to Mysterious Illnesses. Collected here are stories not just of fatal mistakes, but also triumphs and impossible medical breakthroughs.Who knew pain and poor health could be so funny? The assembled trove of research on maladies and operations are entertaining on their own. The documents in the section discussing the death of the 11th Earl of Kent are morbidly hilarious in their deadpan delivery, but Morris’s asides heighten the material. This carries onto the rest of the book as well. He’s reserved in his delivery, letting source materials speak for themselves, but he knows just how to insert a joke to lighten the mood. It’s necessary when reading about forks stuck in orifices or the ever-present tobacco smoke enema. He doesn’t always hit the obvious jokes, but he hits the right ones.This is not to suggest that Morris only provides comedic relief. While he does poke gentle fun at some of the more ludicrous ideas, he’s careful not to mock everything outright. He gives praise for some fairly ingenious ideas— and some successes, like a successful 18th century self-performed lithotripsy. However, it’s his explorations of the potential justifications for some ideas that sets this book apart. He has no problem digging deep into research in order to uncover why doctors and medical practitioners assumed outrageous (by today’s standards) remedies would work. Sure, placing a dove on the anus as a treatment seems absurd, but there was some bit of reasoning behind it.Most books that present anecdote after anecdote begin losing steam around the halfway point. However, Morris has found a workaround here— and it’s not just because the stories shared are cringe-inducing or groan-worthy. Rather, he’s crafted a well-thought-out text that’s tightly packed and clips along nicely. It’s almost like he’s telling the stories directly to the reader, taunting, “You’ll never believe this next part.”Perhaps most interestingly, Morris challenges readers to not be so sure of our methods today. If we consider the the typical processes of the previous century outlandish now, what will future professionals think of our performance today? If nothing else, we should be thankful we live in a time of anesthesia and antibiotics.Note: I received a free ARC of this book through NetGalley. "

The cases themselves were fascinating and intriguing. You’ll definitely remember these short notations and leave with some truly horrific visuals. (In case it’s not clear from the title, this medical history text is extremely graphic—if you’re squeamish, I’d pass on this one).However, I wish the author had wrapped these short anecdotes together into a different narrative structure. It was a boring read, and felt much longer than necessary because it was essentially reading clip after clip of historical reporting...with commentary that felt repetitive in style even as it discussed unique events. In a way, I feel like this book was a million tiny blog posts slammed together. So for that, it’s not an enjoyable book to sit down and read all at once. "
4,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1702050-fox,2," The Mystery of the Exploding Teeth: And Other Curiosities from the History of Medicine contains a distressing lack of exploding teeth stories. Don't get me wrong, the exploding teeth do make an appearance - and indeed, the first hand accounts of them are even more startling than you might imagine. A report as loud as a gunshot, a molar split in half - these are the sorts of details I was very much looking forward to. Yet only two accounts are in the book, and not much speculation is there as to just why people's teeth were exploding. Luckily, there are many more bizarre tales to be told between this book's covers.I was torn between two or three stars and eventually settled upon two for a few reasons. The book was incredibly entertaining, yes, and there were a whole host of bizarre stories within it. The problems for me arose from the lack of elaboration on each of the cases. The pithy remarks were occasionally amusing, but I think the book would have been better served by diving deeper into fewer stories than the broad brush over many. Quality over quantity, after ll.Nonetheless, this was a very entertaining book and definitely gave me some inspiration for future writing. Who, after all, can forget the image of a child vomiting up live slugs? What about a person sticking a fork up their anus in an attempt to relieve constipation? Or, maybe, a person getting most of their ribs removed while remaining conscious throughout the entire procedure - without any anesthesia? And the enemas. Oh, the enemas.Medical history will probably always amuse me, and this is a fun dip into it. If you want deeper dives and more comprehensive analysis, though, I think the podcast Sawbones is a better starting point."

6,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/733932-lori,3,"Author Thomas Morris compiled cases from various sources--newspapers, books, medical journals, etc.--with some unusual twists. In some instances, things are grotesque, in others just odd. The treatments sometimes bring a little humor to the story. I enjoyed the glimpses of actual headlines or snippets of the books, but this was just a mediocre read for me. Some stories were revulsive. The author uses a lot of quotes from his sources so the original voices do not become lost to the modern reader. I do think it provides good diversion for those interested in the history of medicine. In these times of COVID-19, a look at some of the past's mysterious illnesses may bring a little comic relief--or it may be a little too much like current headlines. "

It hooked me from page one and I devoured it whenever I found spare time.The human capacity for mischief, misadventure and downright idiocy is apparently a trait that progress cannot eradicate.The Mystery of the Exploding Teeth is a gathering of stories from history that suspend belief in some cases or in some cases just show the strength of the human body. Many of these cases have been documented in medical journals, although some passed through word of mouth and are largely believed to be tall tales, which are included in their own section.Super-mesenteric-vein-expia-thrombosis, the Clinical Sequelae Can Be Quite Atrocious”—the improbable title of an article about a serious complication of appendicitis.Thomas Morris provides a humorous narration that I enjoyed even more than the stories about humans who survived eating knives or bullets through the head.And more importantly, the correct answer to the question “Can you swallow more knives?” is never “All the knives aboard the ship.”Highly recommended as a humorous but interesting read. If not just to remind you of how lucky we are to live in a time where enemas and bleedings are not the answer to EVERYTHING and anesthetic and anesthesia exist."

11,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,3,"“Horrible Histories for Adults” is the tagline: Morris pulls out obscure and hardly believable stories from medical history, as reported in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century books and periodicals, and presents them as a mixture of primary text and modern commentary. I got a poor impression from the first section, which is full of puerile sniggering at penises getting stuck in unlikely places and objects being inserted into orifices. Some of the later sections on bizarre remedies and gruesome surgeries are of more interest. Overall, there’s too much swallowing of random stuff. This was entertaining enough to keep as a bedside book, but not all I was hoping for considering this was what I treated myself to (new, full-price) with a birthday book token.A favorite line: “‘Injurious excess of exertion’ is a good phrase, and one which I intend to use next time I am feeling too lazy to go out for a run.”"

And more importantly, the correct answer to the question 'Can you swallow more knives?' is never 'All the knives aboard the ship.'""I love reading about weird medical stuff. And this book has a lot of weird stuff. From a young man in 1724 who had a fork lodged in his anus to a man who survived, and recovered fully, other than having a stiff knee, being shot and stabbed with a bayonet. Most of the odd medical cases or dubious remedies offered here are from the 1700's to the early 1900's, and make you extremely thankful that you live in an age of hand-washing and medical care that does not contain leeches or crow bile. I really enjoyed that this book isn't overly scientific. While there's nothing wrong with being scientific, this book is fun to read instead of feeling like homework for high-school biology. It also isn't full of irrelevant anecdotes that draw you away from the hilarious medical anomalies that presented themselves to old school doctors.Also, as a side note, apparently the human yearning to stick things into your butt that don't belong there is not a new thing. People have apparently been fascinated by, and getting things lodged into, the anus for the entirety of medical history."

Thomas Morris pulls together little known, unusual and sometimes scary medical stories from the period between the 17th and early 20th centuries. Gathered from medical journals and other sources, these tales show the ways doctors tried and even sometimes succeeded to cure people in the days before antibiotics and modern surgery. Some cures are precursors to more modern treatments, while others are blind alleys (pigeons to treat convulsions, anyone?) Morris provides the history of the doctors involved and helpfully footnotes the modern names for body parts and cures for the reader, which I liked. He also lets us know what happened to the patient afterwards if that information is available. I found it fascinating and a reminder of why I don’t want to live in the olden times. -Lynn H."

The author writes with a great sense of humor and his translation/commentary of the historical documentation is almost always just as entertaining as the subject of the case.I gasped and groaned to myself while reading this book and felt compelled to share (uninvited, usually) the particularly gruesome or weird cases with whomever was unfortunate enough to be within earshot. One thing I will say is while I appreciated the ""tall tales"" section for the dubious medical stories, I felt it was a bit unnecessary when the book was loaded with so many other more credibly (?) noted cases.But, overall a must read if you love weird medical history!"

The Mystery of the Exploding Teeth and Other Curiosities from the History of Medicine
 was a funny, informative and kinda gross read.The author extracts information from old timey leaflets, advertisements, pamphlets, and medical journals about bizarre medical cases and fake medical news, before fake news was even coined.Mr. Morris adds minor sarcastic jokes to some of the articles he summarizes, and makes the old fashioned narrative come alive with his helpful tidbits and explanations.It's like I sometimes say; nothing is grosser than real life."
22,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4062878-holly-mcintyre,3,"I am not certain how this book manages to be both bizarrely interesting and, at the same time, mildly boring. The eleven pages of citations testify to thorough research into the medical literature of Europe and the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries. Antique medical terms are helpfully explained. The writing is clear and at times humorous. In the end, however, there are only so many ways to describe the survival of gruesome accidents, the catastrophic results of putting objects where they do not belong, or the laughable-if-they-were-not-so-lethal treatments of the time. The book reads as if it were a super-extended column of Ripley’s Believe It or Not. I longed for a context in which to place the anecdotes. What do these tales of illness and treatment tell us about the people and society of two centuries ago? Without context the stories are but freak shows. By the end I had enormous appreciation for what human bodies can sometimes overcome, gratitude that medicine today is not quite so misguided, and a whisper of fear that it may, in fact, be."

24,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2579781-paul,5,"After listening to the first chapter of this, I texted my wife that there was a book she would really like about weird and gruesome medical stories and gave her an abbreviated form of one or two of the ones I'd heard already. I wasn't there when she got the text, but it would only be a little exaggeration to suggest that she dropped everything and ran to her computer to put it on her phone, making it my most successful book recommendation with her to date. By the end of the book, I felt completely vindicated in my early recommendation - this book delivers the goods.Even now (she's a bit behind me in the book), we keep talking about the crazy stories that Morris dug up. Stories like 
The pigeon's rump cure
, where unfortunately the obvious question of, ""Why did anyone think to try this in the first place?"" still remains sadly unanswered. As a side-note, it was not obvious from the book that the author has a blog with more of this kind of stuff on it - I only found that out when trying to google for more information on the pigeon's rump cure.Anyone who reads my other reviews will know that I am deeply suspicious of the popular forms of many disciplines - pop science, pop history, pop economics, etc - because they tend to sensationalize and create narratives to fit the story, but in this book I think Morris managed to come up with something reasonable. The cases are likely sensationalized somewhat by the original reports, but Morris resists the urge to draw any sort of big picture conclusions from them - he's basically saying, ""Hey look at this crazy thing that probably happened mostly like this."" Note the ""probably happened mostly like this"" part of it - Morris also injects a bit of skepticism into many of these reports - which is quite the opposite of pop science puffery.I think pretty much the only people likely to be disappointed with this book (other than those who are quite squeamish) are people looking for some sort of in-depth investigative reporting. Morris is mostly working from case studies published in medical journals over 100 years old. I think he does a fair job trying to go a little deeper by trying to probe how what we've learned in medicine would change how the symptoms were viewed, and by trying to give additional biographical details about the people involved, but there are definitely some stories where that information simply doesn't exist and Morris nobly resists the urge to guess.5 of 5 stars"

First of all it is a nonfiction about historical medical cases, but just listening to them you almost just can't believe this is truly a nonfiction, but rather a historical science fiction. The cases are most of the time just outlandish and if you have an interest in anything related to the medical field, this is something for you. The narrators are amazing together with how it is written, I feel like to get the full experience you have to listen to the audiobook instead of reading it. You have 2 narrators, 1 of 2, the writer giving their point of view about the medical cases and the second narrator citing snippets from the original source of the medical case (document, book, newspaper, ...) Both of them have a very pleasant voice to listen too. Also how it was written, from the point of view from the writer, it almost feels like someone having a conversation with you about said medical cases.Very very very amusing, to the point of unbelievable and definitely recommend this to either read, or my preferable option, listen to.

These tales from all over the world are absorbing as long as you are not grossed out by, well, really disturbing material. If you're looking for something to read that will help you exercise by making your muscles contract in sympathetic wincing or your legs cross involuntarily, this book is for you. From the several men who put things up their urethrae to the man whose intestines all fell into his (of course horribly distended) scrotal sac, to the woman who urinated out of every orifice, there's something here to fix every reader with hypnotic horror. In addition to learning about the ghastly things that can happen to the human body, there's also a great deal to learn about the treatments of the time, which included mercury, crows' saliva, and bird butts. There may even be a few lessons to be learned here, if for example you are kind of person to accept bets on how many clasp knives you can swallow in one go (""all the ones you have on board"" not being the right answer). I personally had to stop reading this after a few cases and go back to something more calming, before attempting it again a few days later. I suspect most readers would feel the same."
27,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106905848-mars,3,"Somewhat of a fun read. The cases were funny, sad and remarkable, some all at once. The treatments by some doctors were even crazier and more entertaining, to think some were orthodox at the time really affirms to me that medicine had such a bizarre history. Probably still bizarre, give it another 100 years and everything today maybe be viewed with the same incredulous, patronizing lens as we view the accounts in this book.They were all astoundingly fascinating though, I think the stories that stood out to me the most were the ones of the man swallowing over 30 knives on multiple occassions, and the one of the man who deliberately cut his penis into two halves which I found sad more than amusing. Unfortunately not much on exploding teeth though, I would've appreciated more of them!Nice read. I may have rushed through some parts since I've found some of the author's in-lime comments disengaging and unnecessary at times-- the absurdity of the cases speak for themselves.

I'm so very glad I did! It is an incredibly interesting, funny and sometimes heart breaking account of medical conditions and prosedures performed between 1600 and 1900. The narrative is also funny, with the narrator obviously getting as much entertainment out of the odd, insane and disgusting stories as the reader should be. I was definitely disturbed by some of the accounts, the case of the man who cut his own penis in half may stay with me for a while, but I really enjoyed learning about medicine before anesthesia was available. It definitely gave me a new appreciation for the time period we live in! I would highly recommend this book.

The medicine discussed is from 100 and more years ago, and this results in humorously bad ideas, and frighteningly unsterile and painful techniques! People should have learned that the success of an individual technique did NOT necessarily imply the overall efficaciousness of said technique in all cases. I am so happy that science – and medicine – have improved greatly since then! It is still the case that sometimes doctors can say ""I'm not sure WHY it works, but it does"", but fortunately that attitude is not the ruling one in most cases. It is inconceivable that the idea of ""the for humors"" was popular as long as it was!The litany of cases is truly interesting, and some of the successes go to show how resilient is the human body! Of course, the resilience of imagination is also pointed out :-)"

The information is presented in very easily digestible terms that will not have you reaching for a medical dictionary: any foreign terms are described in the footnotes and there are several humorous asides by the author.

Although the commentary was often pretty cheesy, Thomas Morris provided helpful context into the state of medicine at the time and he did a very good job finding cases that are absurd, fascinating, repulsive and (occasionally) highly unlikely in medical journal canon. I found this book very entertaining."

I found the author's snarky comments peppered in every 10-60 seconds between the actual case histories read by a different narrator to be very disruptive and unfunny, and increasingly annoying as the book went on. I'm not sure what their purpose was, it didn't contribute anything worthwhile and took away from the narrative quite a bit. Maybe in the physical book form it wouldn't be as annoying but it was pretty bad in the audiobook. I also found the frequent interruptions for footnote definitions annoying as well. About 50% of those were unnecessary and obvious from contextual clues, or were words which people already know. The collection of case histories was interesting, but the execution left a lot to be desired."

Ranging from unfortunate to downright gruesome, it paints a pretty vivid picture of a series of interesting wounds (some of them self-inflicted) and afflictions (ergot poisoning, anybody?) that we really don't get to see in 2020 Although, TBH, a scythe-related injury nowadays would at least give us a break from the common lawnmower-induced ones :)"

He is now a freelance writer and medical historian. His first book, The Matter of the Heart: A History of the Heart in Eleven Operations, wonthe Royal Society of Literature and the Jerwood Charitable Foundation award. The award is one of three annual awards, one of £10,000 and two of £5,000, offered to authors on their first works of non-fiction. Mr. Morris now lives in London.Who is the target audience?This book is for everyone 16 or older. The Mystery of the Exploding Teeth is written for the masses and not just for those who want to learn about historic medicine. The book is full of individual cases hand-picked through time to provide the reader with a glimpse of common medical procedures, some uncommon medical procedures, and allot of very interesting cases.SynopsisThe Mystery of the Exploding Teeth: And Other Curiosities from the History of Medicine, is a sojourn into some of the most interesting medical cases and the procedures used in those cases. It is told through the eyes of the people who were actually there. This book is a conglomeration of notes, letters, personal views of the doctors, and sometimes the patients. The author does a great job of finding the most interesting cases in history. There are some interesting cases that include various items escaping the bodies from all different places, some not very good places. How about the surgeries where the patient is not anesthetized and is an active participant? There is a chapter of patients who survived extreme injuries, some lived normal lives after their injuries.ConclusionAfter reading this book, I listened to the audible version and the narrator added so much more to the enjoyment. He does a great job with the inflection of his voice and the bits that are in French. The little jokes he throws in are awesome. This tome, at times, had me laughing, cringing, crying, and always wondering about the historic doctors and their sometime weird practices. The cases offer a wide variety of injuries and maladies; the causes of some of these will haunt me. I would definitely recommend this book to a friend."

The stories brought in this book are often absurd and quite shocking, but we have to see it from the perspective of the doctors that are shown there, who did not have the same knowledge, instruments, techniques or remedies that we have today. That is why these cases are as fascinating as they are absurd.It's a good tip for those who like crazy and medical stories."

I voluntarily reviewed an advance readers copy of this book. No remuneration was exchanged and all opinions presented herein are my own except as noted. Thomas Morris’s THE MYSTERY OF THE EXPLODING TEETH is the perfect read for any doctor, or people who, like me, find medial procedures and history fascinating but have not studied medicine. With Audible, Audiobooks.com, Amazon, etc, you can still arrange for someone to receive this hilarious, and not seriously gross, volume in print, ebook, or audio for the doctor replaces your blood with port wine. mats by the big day! listened to this book over the course of about two days, but with its vignetted style, someone could easily dip in and out to of the book for several weeks while reading other books, The style also makes it good for when you only have short periods of time to concentrate, unless you are recovering form illness or surgery on anything other than your sense of humor.If the book focused more on salacious humor it would be less funny and informative. I felt a little guilty for laughing at the serious medical stories about which Morris writes — I sure those experiencing them did not find them at all amusing. Imagine, you’re a woman bleeding out after delivery and the doctor, after manually stopping the hemorrhage, replaces some of your blood with port wine! Okay, that would be funny even, perhaps, to the patient. Morris focused on human foibles and the meandering path medical science has followed; the “body humors,” poor anatomical understanding, lack of anesthesia, and more are explored. I am always amazed by what people can be convinced to swallow: needles, knives, heaven only knows what else, are swallowed and extracted by intrepid, bumbling or genius medical practitioners. How did our species ever survive the lack of medical knowledge and our own supreme idiocy. If you’re curious about the types of medical strangeness on which Morris writes check out his blog post about a waiter who swallowed spoons to amuse patrons: http://www.thomas-morris.uk/the-spoon....There is a bit of “Ripley’s Believe It or Not” in the author’s style, but seriously it is hard to believe anyone would want to swallow needles or stick other items into their own body. The narration is excellent and the two different narrators change it up, but it’s not because the material is too dry, rather it reflects the accents of the letter or article writer. I think both the author and Farley did very well, I especially like non-fiction to have author narration as their understanding of the subject often lends credibility to the ideas presented. I also enjoyed the usually well-done accents. While the history seems focused on British and American medicine, other countries medical oddities are considered as well. I enjoyed listening to the stories and my husband did as well, making it a good choice for road trips. Warning though, if you laugh too hard pull over! "
55,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35113927-spencer,4,"	I first saw this book featured at the Kinokuniya bookstore in Los Angeles. As I casually flipped through its pages, my eyes were drawn to case studies’ titles that included urination from the eyes, forks in the rectum, and human pincushions. These horrifying yet humorous passages were a good indicator for the read ahead; obviously educational and wildly hilarious. 	Medical historian Thomas Morris sifted through hundreds of years of medical texts in order to cull countless stories of medieval, colonial, and Victorian tales. He breaks them up into several chapters. I had two distinct issues with this book, as a whole: two of the chapters are especially dull to get through, and the book itself is very upsetting. Whilst I found a lot of the stories funny, or at least illuminating about how far we have come in the past five hundred years, there were a lot of times where I went fetal. Just today, in finishing this book, I came across a story that made me scream, “No,” a record twelve times. If you’re squeamish this is not the book for you. The dull chapters mostly dealt with surgery, which for a layman like me, became especially technical.	Overall, Morris is a thoroughly entertaining writer who added just the right amount of panache and self-reflection in order to properly bookend many of these stories. It must have been especially difficult to make sense of the countless uses of Old English and old-timey slang. Morris also makes it a point to always showcase the contemporary climate in which these occurrences took place, which helped contextualize a lot of the more confounding ideas and cures. "
56,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1094141-christina-tang-bernas,4,"I was walking by the ""New Books"" shelf in the local library and was arrested by the title of this book. I'm morbidly fascinated with weird medical/death/historical stuff, so I put aside the other books I was reading, checked it out, and finished it quite rapidly. I have a sense that Thomas Morris is an information hoarder like me, and he has put together a really fascinating overview of medicine and the attitudes both patients and doctors had about medicine especially before a lot of technology had been invented yet. A mix of scientific method, quackery, and guesswork fills these pages, and almost all of them were interesting to read. Mr. Morris is able to quickly relate the details of each case while keeping it interesting. He explains words that have fallen out of use or any complicated medical jargon, and he seems to have a good foundation in anatomy and medical science. Two things keep me from giving it 5 stars. One, sometimes his own personal comments, while mostly funny and wry, can sometimes veer towards unnecessary and/or too sarcastic/snarky. Some stories needed that extra personal commentary, but not all of them. Two, the book ends very abruptly. I thought there would be a concluding summary or interesting final observations by the author. But, I finished reading the last case, and it immediately jumped to the ""Sources"" page. It seems rather abrupt to me, kind of like a movie that just ends and there's no feeling of resolution. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed it. "

In Unfortunate Predicaments, we meet young men who did many ill-conceived things to their nether regions. We also meet a man who ate four knives on a dare and didn’t go to a doctor when only three came out his other end. A lifetime of doing this trick eventually killed him. In Mysterious Illnesses, a woman makes herself a human pin cushion and a boy vomits up his own twin. Horrifying Operations makes the reader impressed by the fortitude of his or her forebears. Before anesthesia, a man held up a candle for the surgeon while his other arm was being amputated at the shoulder. Another used a knitting needle and a tiny file three times daily for weeks to break up his bladder stone.Okay, you either like weird stuff like this or you don’t. As someone who used to gobble Ripley’s Believe It or Not books in my youth, I love it.

Are you intrigued by gruesome medical history or just disturbing true stories? Well then, boy do I have the book for you! This book was fascinating. I'm not a big nonfiction fan. If I'm reading nonfiction it has to be something that really interest me or something absurd/weird/strange/gross. THIS BOOK WAS ALL OF THAT AND MORE! Plus as an added bonus the author is hilarious. The bits of humor he inserts within each medical story will have you shuddering with laughter and disgust. This book is a collection of old medical journal entries. Each one more terrifying than the last. If you don't cringe at least 25 times during this book....congratulations! but also, go check yourself into a hospital cause something is wrong with you. Tales of a woman peeing from every hole in her body, a man that chose his hand and a piece of wood over a woman, a man those swallowed knives as a party trick, and many many more. Oh! Don't forget the port wine enemas...oh no, we could never forget those! Each chapter tells a tale. They are pretty short but uber creepy/interesting. Just go get the book you'll regret it and love it all at once. You're welcome."
59,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79009298-chinchila,5,"I'm sure I won't be able to forget the many things that I read about in this book. I like the order that Morris used to present the stories and I especially enjoyed his narrative tone, sarcasm, and funny remarks- it really took my mind of the horrific events being described. We are truly lucky to live in this age where our grasp of human anatomy and medicine is so well-advanced, we don't have to suffer through horrific procedures while fully awake, as those people did. My favorite stories are about the sailor that kept swallowing knives as a party trick and the Italian guy (Give that man a medal) that kept getting shot because he never seemed to learn the lesson. The dubious remedies chapter was also a gem, especially the tapeworm trap (thanks, I hate it!). At the end of the day, we may laugh at these utterly idiotic ideas but those doctors were just trying to do their best (except for Dr. Schultz, man wtf), with the knowledge that they had. We have come so far and I couldn't be any grateful. I don't know what the 19th century people were made of but I know I wouldn't have lasted a day. "
60,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22970895-elise,5,"This book was an excellent read. I appreciate the weaving of historical writing and the author's own comments into the narrative. The stories are as fascinating and gripping, as they are unbelievable. To read about medicine and health as experienced in the past, makes me incredibly grateful to live in the present (as I will hopefully never need to take crow's vomit or be subjected to a tobacco-smoke enema). Some stories make you wince, while others might elicit a giggle, or even a head shake. Many of the cases found in the book are somewhat incredulous. The author provides educated guesses as to the actual cause of the illnesses, while also describing why the cures did or didn't work, and proving historical context. As is to be expected, in most cases where the illness was cured, it was in spite of, not due to the ""cure."" The cases can be read one by one, or as an entire chapter, making this book ideal for reading on the bus, or on a break during the workday. While I borrowed this book from the library, I would definitely consider buying a copy for myself. "
61,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/829466-sara,3,"This was a really quirky book. It was an interesting premise. The author found old medical stories from the 1800s that covered strange medical mysteries and stories. Some of them are weird, some of them are funny, some of them are gross. The format is short descriptors of medical stories in between fairly vague explanations of the stories. Pros: Many of the stories were funny and the treatments were pretty horrific, but amusing. They sure used a lot of enemas back then! It was also entertaining to read the old time prose of medical literature way back when and muse on the ignorance. Definitely this was a more unique book. Cons: Some of the explanations were somewhat insufficient, some of the stories were a little uncomfortably gross, and some stories seemed a bit needled in. The ending was kind of abrupt. The format gets a little tiresome by the end. This is a fun book because you can pick it up easily for casual reading and it's engaging. Lastly, it'll really make you appreciate getting sick in this century and how far medicine has advanced. "
62,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76183816-stephanie-lorentzen,4,"The Mystery of the Exploding Teeth grabs you with it's intriguing title, locks you in with its horrifying first paragraph and without skipping a beat, sucks you down into a black hole of unimaginable medical horror, keeping a fast clip of story after story of relentless suffering until you abruptly finish and ask yourself...what just happened? It gave me nightmares. As I read, I couldn't stop myself from constantly gasping and scaring the shit out of my poor husband. It's harrowing and riveting, but it's also shamelessly titillating and completely lacking in compassion. While I did learn quite a lot about 18th and 19th century medicine, I feel a little ashamed of myself for reading this book. Thomas Morris never acknowledged the humanity of the patients described in his book - people with sex addictions, women who had nightmarish miscarriages, or individuals suffering from difficult birth defects. In fact, he seems to revel in the jokes he makes at their expense."
63,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7413967-karen,3,"Another recently finished book on quack medication and medical care during Victorian times. This book wasn't near as hilarious as ""Quackery: A Brief History of the Worst Ways to Cure Everything.""I unfortunately read everything I can about this particular topic as I teach physiology and pathophysiology to college students. And I like to use stories to get their interest, and usually these books are full of stories. The difference was in the manner of presentation. The above book is very snarky, and just hilarious...this book was more serious, and like other reviewers have said, not very well organized. I got the feeling this book was just done in 'stream of conscience' rather than having a very straight-forward table of contents prior to starting to write, and this showed in the lack of organization. That isn't to say that the book isn't good, but organization would have enhanced the stories significantly."
64,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21548113-lillybooks,2,"The history of medicine is a lot of things, but weird is the primary adjective and that is what makes it so much fun to read about. This book is exactly as promised, and that is a whole lot of weird. But here's the thing: as much I enjoyed the concept and the way it was organized and told, I realized that men (it's always men doing it and it's always men who wrote about it) have been doing stupid things to their neither regions since people starting writing accounts of medical events. After a very short while, it's just boring to read another story about putting something where it shouldn't go. My extra ocular muscles were sore from all my eye rolling. There are a few stories of non-genital medical mysteries and those were by far the most interesting. The question is: are these tales of stupid men truly the majority of early medical accounts or was it the author himself who was giddy with laughter about them?"

There are many stories that the author has tried to verify, or at least to verify the reporting person, broken up into several different categories. The book is written in a very accessible way and would be easy to read for someone without a medical background. The point of the book is not to horrify the reader or to vilify the medical practitioners, but instead to look back with a bit of humor at what was. The author does point out that many of the stories could be compiled under the heading, ""stupid things that young males do"". I was also very surprised at the number of creative places and objects come into contact with a man's most precious piece of anatomy:) This is a great book and well worth the read!"
66,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26636611-linda-edmonds-cerullo,5,"Very entertaining and, at times, unbelievable account of medicine through the years. The author has a marvelous way of finding humor in sometimes gut-wrenching and appalling treatments and conditions. Difficult to believe that doctors once thought it was wise to nearly bleed people to death or dehydrate them while they were seriously ill. A bit of a warning for all of us who rely on our doctor's advice that, historically, doctors have been wrong more often than they have been right. Scary thought, but another reason to follow your gut instincts on treatment and diagnoses. Not for the faint-hearted or easily squeamish, but a fascinating study of experimental treatments and the rationale behind them. Also interesting to read of the terribly dangerous and outrageous things people have done to their own body at times. Enjoyed this book very much. "
67,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98526795-daniel-volce,5,"Morris' language throughout was amazingly vivid enough to make you envision, feel, and unfortunately, smell the action of each case. There were moments during which I was laughing at the stupidity of some of the patients as well as the limited knowledge of the doctors of the time. Yet as soon as you chuckle, Morris brings you back with sobering details. He really can paint a picture with his words, which is rare for a lot of nonfiction books. His fictional tone often had me researching the cases he presented, and I was always satisfied even more with the story-telling nature of the events he had so thoroughly researched. Even those, like myself, with very limited knowledge in medical jargon can entirely enjoy this book, and I'll be recommending it to anyone who asks about good nonfiction books!"
68,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/270341-thurston-hunger,3,"Three stars for culling old newspaper and medical journals for the authors stand-up material. Morris clearly delights in the humor found in what passed as science in years gone by, he has a hard time resisting a footnote per page, to get his winks in.The story started out like an episode of Saturday Night Live's ""Appalachian Emergency Room"" and I think I lack that fetish gene even for grins and giggles. The book is easy to read in interrupted moments, a long flight perhaps or with kids/business swarming around your limited free hours. Or maybe best suited as the book in the bathroom if you are that type, honestly I am not.I supposed the pitch to this comes with a dig at modern medicine, and what we'll hear about in 50 years, provided our doctors and snakeoil salesmen don't kill us before then.I'd recommend going through Mary Roach's catalog after this, if not before."
69,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3287981-kim-staley,3,"I enjoyed all the kooky stories from the annals of medicine, but as a couple other people noted, I think that I personally would have enjoyed the book more if there were fewer cases that each had more back story or explanation. And why I usually enjoyed the author's pithy remarks, there were times they fell a bit flat, especially about a few cases that seemed more awful than funny. Some stories made me cringe rather than chuckle because they seemed so painful. I confess that I read about one man's medical predicament--caused by his continual ""self abuse""--with my legs crossed, even though I don't own the discussed bits of anatomy, because the whole situation was so dreadful. But in a fascinating, couldn't stop reading sort of way. Overall, if you love weird medical cases or medical history, then this is a solid read. 3.5 stars."

It makes me wonder what type of treatments we use now will be considered antiquated centuries from now. However, I felt the author’s commentary usually completely unnecessary outside of the scope of giving us context and explaining terms. I understand that he’s trying to give us some personality rather than a collection of obscure medical articles, but I found myself often rolling my eyes at his unfunny jokes. At first I thought it was his British humor, but I actually enjoy British humor and have a very similar sense of humor myself. I’m not sure what he could have done different, but I guess it just wasn’t for me.I read this for the r/books book club - January 2020."

The brief sub-chapters were comprised mostly of verbatim citations of old medical journals peppered with the author's sometimes explanatory, usually quippy commentary. I found myself putting the book down every few sub-chapters, with nothing noteworthy really sticking to my mind (except for a few that no amount of mental purging could remove), and not really wanting to pick it up again.

The first chapter was laugh out loud funny, filled with anecdotes mostly to do with silly situations people got themselves into that required unusual medical rescues. The rest of the book delves into cures, unusual surgeries, rare diagnosis, etc. that almost made my head want to explode (not really), but it was all very interesting. How in the world did we humans survive so long? Thank goodness the medical profession is always curious and willing to put us back together, with some modern day moral codes and laws for guidance."

(Although the exploding teeth one was a bit of a letdown. ) It's amazing what the human body can endure despite our (or our physician's) best attempts to mess them up. Main takeaways:1. In addition to bloodletting/leaches, 19th century physicians treated nearly every possible malady by trying to empty the patients bowels with enemas, emetics, and laxatives. (I am so grateful for modern medicine!)2. People have been sticking inappropriate objects up their butts for many centuries. "

The collection of bizarre, macabre, weird, and unbelievable medical histories gets tiring after a while. I wish it had less stories, but included a bit more explanations from the modern perspective for each. Now and then author points to some strange phenomenon and says ""we now know that this could have been real and caused by X"", but these references are always brief. I ended up googling these things as I was reading the book and they were often quite interesting and even educational. But if you are just looking for pure entertainment, then you'll probably enjoy it."
75,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5778691-rebekah,5,"Thoroughly entertaining! This collection of bizarre medical stories had me laughing - and cringing - from the start. Some of my favorites were titled, ""The Boy Who Got His Wick Stuck in a Candlestick"", ""The Pigeon's Rump Cure"", ""A Flaming Nuisance"", and ""Swallowing Knives Is Bad For You"". I really felt like the first chapter could have been titled ""Men Sticking Things Where They Don't Belong"". If you are looking for a book full of humorous and fascinating tales from medical history, this is the book for you. Honestly, if you just need a light read and a good laugh, you should read this book."
76,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71353461-laura-bailo,0,"I loved this book! The history of medicine has always fascinated me, and this book manages to hit the perfect balance between entertaining and informative. The cases told within this book are definitely curious, and told in such a way that they're funny (a little bit disgusting a times), and fascinating. And isn't that the best way to learn about history? The author sounds like someone I would love to go out for drinks with. His commentary is just right, funny without being cringeworthy, and it makes the book even better. If you want to have a good time while learning something, I definitely recommend this! "
77,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90689287-megan-hartley,4,"I thought this book was an enjoyable read. Thomas Morris tells the tales of medical history's weirdest and wildest cases. These stories are compiled in a similar fashion to a Guiness Book which makes them very interesting read. I'm a slow reader and ended up reading over half of the book in a day due to it's entertainment value. I was recommended this book due to my liking of The Butchering Art. Anyone who likes reading about medical history will like this book. This book has made me very grateful for modern medicine, that's for sure!"
78,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1715224-jessi,3,The title of this book will draw almost anyone in. Exploding teeth? Cool. And this author does put together a very nice collection of medical mysteries from the early days of human history. He includes scans of newspaper and journal articles and provides interpretations for words and phrases that are no longer in use and provides commentary on each.This was an interesting book for the first two chapters or so but it palled for me after awhile. This book would be great for reluctant middle and high schoolers who would probably devour it.
79,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8608191-matthew-bolin,4,"3.5 stars.A fascinating and highly readable collection of articles from 17th-19th century medical journals, with historical context, clarification, and commentary by the author.Downgraded due to the habit of his commentary to at times simply be interruptions of the article excerpts to make sarcastic comments or asides and nothing more. This both interrupts the flow of the work and makes the tone of it unnecessarily less serious. Aside from this flaw, though, it is entertaining and informative."
80,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1588869-duckoffimreading,3,"Interesting compilation of strange medical occurrences and their treatments from the 1700s and 1800s. All I gotta say is: thank god I live in a world of modern medicine! In all fairness, there was a doctor quoted from back when acknowledging that when people in future times hear of their practices, they will think they are nonsensical or even rudimentary compared to the advances of modern medicine - same can be said of our current practices too! Lots of blood, bodily fluids and extensions of the truth - if you are in to that kind of thing ;)"
81,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101338245-jess-lewis-turner,3,"The author’s approach to the material can be summed up by two parenthetical remarks contained in one short sentence: “(known technically as a sequestrum)” and “(yuck).” On the whole, this collection of case narratives tends more toward Ripley’s Believe It Or Not than academic medical history. That being said, the historical notes that are included are sound (if not nuanced or fully contextualized). He’s collected some excellent cases for the casual reader, suitable for your weirder cocktail parties. "
82,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12709990-aurel-mihai,1,"This is one of those coffee table books with an eye catching cover and a clever title that really turns out to be just a bunch of fluff written to get the author a commission. The cases cited by the author are interesting, but the author's commentary is juvenile and adds nothing to the reading. This is not medical journal MST3k, this is Jackass reads old medical journals. I did finish it, but after a while found myself skimming the brief author commentary and just reading the original quotes, which are unintentionally (to the original author) interesting or humorous. "
83,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5959839-bexa,3,"Morris book is basically what I do when reading old newspapers. He has taken the interesting, disturbing, and grotesque medical mysteries and compiled them into this book, which book intrigues and grosses me out. I did have to put this book down a couple of times because I was grossed out, but was still full of crazy facts. The only downside is that while he puts similar topics together, there's not a cohesive structure through out it, so while it's interesting, it is just chunks of facts thrown at you."
84,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1671246-paul,5,"This book is a ton of fun for those who like medical stories of old...if only to realize how far medicine has actually come. I picked it up in the UK, and the author focuses primarily on very very bizarre cases from old medical journals, from the 1600s onward. These short stories are worthy of being read aloud (in fact that is what I did with my wife) since the underlying text is so amazing and the author's commentary and clarifications often very very funny. I simply loved this book!"
85,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3294279-viriam,4,"A fun quick page turner. That these oddities came to light while the author was doing medical research is facinating. Some of the stories are over long but the fact thet they are from medical journals gives them a depth that goes beyond the Ripley's approach. Makes me glad for the progress in medical understanding, although i wonder how many articles in todays journals will be looked at askance in 100 years."
86,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/136066-casey,4,"This was a thoroughly entertaining volume roughly divided up by theme. I wish there'd been a bit of an epilogue since the book ends quite abruptly, but as long as you know you'll be getting several short stories with a little transition, you should be fine. Everything is carefully sourced, and Morris does weigh in occasionally about whether the stories should be taken with a grain of salt (or outright ignored)."
87,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7632956-hannah-wales,5,"I really loved this book. I'm a huge fan of reading old-timey, weird medical stuff, so this was right up my alley. The author did an excellent job of incorporating original sources with his own narration. Beyond this, the footnotes and his sense of humor made the book a fun, accessible read. I definitely recommend it to anyone with an interest in medicine, particularly how BAD we used to be at it or how amazing the human body is at overcoming some wild injuries."
88,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7005465-michelle,3,"I have never seen such a compendium of ridiculous medical knowledge! It is incredible to see how far we have come and how far we have to go when it comes to caring for our patients and how to prepare for the unexpected. It is a dense read with heavy medical jargon, especially taking direct quotes directly from the doctors in these special cases. Nonetheless, it is an enjoyable read that makes a dry subject like medicine more approachable and hilarious!"
89,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37158116-kat-aden,5,"Absolutely wonderfully horrible. This anthology of medical history anecdotes are tempered with attempted modern day explanations of just about every thing that can go wrong to a human body. It also includes many horrible things humans do to their own body and the horrible things doctors have done in an attempt to cure them. The tone is wry, ironic, and occasionally laced with dad jokes. For those with a strong constitution and a somewhat graveyard sense of humor, this is a very enjoyable read."
90,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8434622-guera25,4,"What a joyful romp. For someone who isn't a doctor, Morris offers clear explanations of medical procedures and terminology, and his humor was less performatively snide than that found in Quackery, a similar book. It's a leisurely, strangely summery tour through the vagaries of medicine and the human body, and I enjoyed every page of it. A must-have coffee-table book and perfect for when you need a reminder that humans are so wonderfully weird."
91,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1366273-lisa,5,"Morris does an outstanding job disseminating a hefty amount of medical information with the added baggage of an extended time period.The Footnotes are essential in understanding the cases in context and although they have a tendency to make the read a bit choppy at times, the payoff is well worth whatever pace or flow you may think you've lost.I highly recommend this anyone who, like me, is into weird medical S★‽‡, or any macabre variety of historical, gross or nerdy topic."
92,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17206785-bill,4,"An absolutely fascinating journey through a couple centuries’ evolution in health/medical needs, diagnoses, and “treatments.”Some are downright terrifying, while other are “laugh out loud” amusing.Technically, the text of the book (hardcover edition) ends on p.330, followed by source citations and index.Be amazed! Be astounded! Be ready to thank your doctor for the progress they get to enjoy."
93,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32618332-shild-livsdatter,5,"I love these kinds of medical fun fact books. They're easy to read, a little gross, and often very funny. If you like this, I also recommend reading Blood and Guts: A History of Surgery by Richard Hollingham, Working Stiff by Judy Melinek and The Butchering Art by Lindsay Fitzharris.Only complaint I have is that the ""Hidden Dangers"" chapter should not have been the last, as it was a little less exciting than the rest of them."
94,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44118683-thuy-pham,3,"It’s a good read for what it is. It’s nowhere near the level of Under the Knife by Arnold van de Laar, but as a collection of stories about bizzare and ridiculous way people treat illness in the old days, it’s fine. I actually don’t enjoy his commentaries from time to time. Some of the jokes are just too obvious, too childish, and at times feel a bit lazy. I enjoy simplicity in humor, but I do wish the humor in this book was a bit more clever, or at least more well thought out. "
95,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5868245-lyman,4,"Held my attention throughout and interesting enough to...Find a place on my bookshelf. I delved further into this subject pursuing my interest in civil war battlefield injuries, and was taken into subjects that ere truly remarkable, astonishing, unbelievably frightening -, and that’s putting it lightly!I would have given it ***** if any of these cures would have exorcised my complaints!"
96,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1206965-rach,3,"This book was entertaining enough, but felt more like a series of blog entries. This could be because at least some of the stories *were* posted online at the author's website. I think this would have been a more interesting book if there had been some overarching narrative outside of ""here's a bunch of weird medical stories"". "
97,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10404428-koen,2,"Makes you appreciate the heck out of modern medical science.Entertaining read by medical historian Thomas Morris. A collection of weird, bizarre and nasty stories found in historic medical journals and books.Putting things in places they don't belong, it turns out, is something people have been doing for a long time!2,5 stars."
98,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54669274-jess-kallberg,4,"A fast and fun read through the bizarre annals of medicine. Think of this as a compilation of the strangest medical oddities and treatments. While I certainly enjoyed the read, I did wish for a little more analysis or nuance in the cases, but this read more as pure entertainment. Fascinating nonetheless. "
99,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/267733-kara,4,"A fun little romp through weird medical stories largely from the 17th-early 20th centuries, told with a healthy dose of dad humor. Favorites: In the 17th century, tonsils were known as ""almonds of the ear""! The guy who coughed up part of his own spine! And the kid who got a goose larynx stuck in his own, so he honked when he breathed! (I'm a terrible person.)"
100,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18366293-erica,4,"After reading this, I'm amazed that people in previous centuries ever went to the doctor! Mind you, with some of the predicaments these same people got themselves into - swallowing knives, eating bugs, tearing off limbs - the help of anyone would probably have been an improvement. I also found the author's asides to be very funny."
101,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106849707-emma-hayes,4,"This was a fascinating read. The author does explain a lot of the old-timey medical jargon to make it easier to understand, but I think the book still requires some knowledge of modern medical terminology to understand. It had a blunt ending which I wasn’t quite expecting, but overall was an enjoyable and interesting read."
102,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10039791-giorgio,4,"It is a fine book, if you like to hear/read gross things: smoke blew into children asses, knives inside digestive tracts, picking bladder rocks through the uretra...I confess I do not like it.4 stars cause it us well-written and researched, the dual voice choice in the audiobook version is very good too, causing a refreshing funny tone."
103,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24746698-elisa,4,"Very, very funny in parts, which is surprising considering the subject. I enjoyed this read. It's hard to believe how dedicated the author was, reading boring medical manuals only to pic all the bizarre cases. The audiobook is narrated by the author, and a professional narrator reads the actual texts so it was really entertaining. "
104,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7346229-kieran-delaney,3,"I really enjoyed this at the start and some of the cases are fascinating - it’s well written to, with Pratchet style humour woven throughout but... it just sorted of ran out of steam and ended very abruptly. The final 20% of the book is made up of references and an index - it ended so abruptly I thought I was missing the final chapter."
105,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5300139-robert,3,A fun little read. I enjoy the idea of a researcher saying “let me go find crazy published medical articles and write a book about the nuttiest I find.” The stories in the book are crazy and not for the faint of heart. However they get a bit redundant after a while which is why I rated this a 3.5. 
106,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38657732-katie-bee,4,"Delightfully bizarre and engrossingly weird. A great gift choice for someone hard to buy for - that is, as long as they don't have a weak stomach!My only wish is that the ending hadn't petered out. If it had stuck the landing, that would have rounded out the book very well."
107,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15827555-karen,3,"I am extremely grateful that I was not born before the dawn of the use of anesthetics during surgery. Yikes! Some of these ""curiosities"" are more curious than others, but all-in-all it was quite an interesting read. Again, yikes!"
108,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2617295-janette,2,"Started out very interesting/entertaining and continued to have some worthwhile anecdotes here and there. I also enjoyed the author's dry, British wit, but have to admit that the cases got rather tedious from time to time. However, it's still worth a read for anyone interested in this subject."
109,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5594709-jaime-oakeson,3,"Totally grawesome (grossly awesome)!! For about half of the stories I had to find someone to recount the bizarre details (willingly or otherwise), and the other half had a hard time holding my attention."
110,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4544904-bill-bennett,3,"An entertaining read of dubious authenticity. The events recounted usually cited obscure medical journals from the 16th and 17th century. However, I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone interested in medicine as it was practiced a couple of hundred years ago, "
111,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1312257-colleen,3,"Didn’t like this one as much as some of the other medical mysteries. Hard to be entertained when the patients were dying left and right and the tone was a bit light. Overall, though, an interesting read"
112,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7515884-thelma,3,"If you like old-time remedies and scary stuff like that, you'll enjoy this book. The remedies are horrible and some of the ailments even worse. And sometimes I wonder if modern medicine has advanced all that much."
113,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51987914-karen-moizer,5,"A cracking read. Interesting, revolting, hillarious and bizarre in equal measure. I love reading stuff like this. I'm always amazed by the things people will do to themselves, stuff into themselves or endure."
114,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52479630-sollie,4,"I'm impressed by the level of research, as well as the simplified format for telling the stories in bite-sizes. Sometimes I found the narrative voice a bit distracting, but that was overcome by the fascinating window into 1600-1900's medicine and history."
115,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100894043-jane-finnsson,5,This was such a fun book with all the wild and whacky medical procedures from back in the day mixed with a healthy dose of “how did they manage that?” When reading about the injuries. The short cases are a great for just picking up and putting down when you are limited on time. 
116,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5663488-chad,5,This book is well worth the read. It is both fascinating to see how medicine has evolved and entertaining to see the pitfalls along the way. The fact that the individual stories are short makes it easy to pick up and put down. This also makes it easy to go through at your own pace.
117,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61686329-ella,3,"This book is not for the faint of heart....I am faint of heart. I read about 20 pages in before I finally admitted that I was doing more dry heaving than learning, and promptly returned the book. The writing style was good and the medical mysteries are interesting.I just couldn't handle it."
118,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1684507-sheryl,4,"This was a fascinating book, which pulled at all my curious feelings for strange medical cases in history. It was an intriguing non-fiction, that was fun to read. I do not say that lightly, since I do not typically read non-fiction. I would definitely recommend this book."
119,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2707976-geoff,3,"Basically, the author reviewed a bunch of old (in some cases very old) medical case studies and picked out some of the better stories. He then combined them with some of his British humor and this book is the result.Humorous but no real great medical insight provided. "
