Or how about the time you ate some fresh lettuce out of the garden and two days later garden slugs climbed out of your stomach and into your mouth? Or your grandmother got pregnant at age 75? Or your neighbor swallowed 27 knives and lived? These are the types of curiosities contained in this humorous book written tongue-in-cheek by a medical historianThe author researched old books, pamphlets, letters, and doctors notes from the 18th and 19th centuries to find the information some of which will make you wince. He warns the reader that the majority of the cases are exaggerations, frauds accepted as truth, and misdiagnosis errors by medical practitioners. Medicine was still pretty much a guessing game during those times and in some cases the author proves how the story absolutely could not be true (such as the man who taught his child to breathe underwater) while others are not probable but could be possible (such as the man who swallowed his false teeth and lived).I think the author had as much fun writing this book as it is to read it. Let's be honest...how many people do you know who urinate through their ear? Funny stuff indeed."

Written by a medical historian, this book delves back to the 19th century, assembled mostly through old medical journals and newspaper clippings. With groupings like ""Unfortunate Predicaments"" telling of 'honking like a goose'; ""Mysterious Illnesses"" with 'the woman who peed through her nose'; ""Dubious Remedies"" with 'the pigeon's rump cure'; ""Tall Tales"" with 'the slugs and the porcupine'; ""Hidden Dangers"" with 'killed by his false teeth' this book is filled with unbelievable stories of unimaginable situations. The cures are even more bizarre! Hot water bottles, opium, laxatives and leeches were everyday cures and possibly the most sane. These hard to believe illnesses and cures makes our modern medicine such an evolution. But it also testifies as to the resilience of people, who were actually just lab rats at the time. It makes you wonder what of today's medical miracles will become ridiculous, dangerous, and obsolete in the near future. A fun book to read, that will have you both appalled, at some of the stories, yet thankful you live in the current world of medicine. "
2,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2946544-christopher,5,"Medicine is an ever-evolving profession, and its history can be downright weird. Medical historian Thomas Morris has combed through countless vintage medical journals and historical documents showcasing the progress medicine has made in a relatively short time. His work goes beyond bizarre anecdotes, and instead softens the wonky view of health, breaking into sections ranging from Horrifying Operations to Mysterious Illnesses. Collected here are stories not just of fatal mistakes, but also triumphs and impossible medical breakthroughs.Who knew pain and poor health could be so funny? The assembled trove of research on maladies and operations are entertaining on their own. The documents in the section discussing the death of the 11th Earl of Kent are morbidly hilarious in their deadpan delivery, but Morris’s asides heighten the material. This carries onto the rest of the book as well. He’s reserved in his delivery, letting source materials speak for themselves, but he knows just how to insert a joke to lighten the mood. It’s necessary when reading about forks stuck in orifices or the ever-present tobacco smoke enema. He doesn’t always hit the obvious jokes, but he hits the right ones.This is not to suggest that Morris only provides comedic relief. While he does poke gentle fun at some of the more ludicrous ideas, he’s careful not to mock everything outright. He gives praise for some fairly ingenious ideas— and some successes, like a successful 18th century self-performed lithotripsy. However, it’s his explorations of the potential justifications for some ideas that sets this book apart. He has no problem digging deep into research in order to uncover why doctors and medical practitioners assumed outrageous (by today’s standards) remedies would work. Sure, placing a dove on the anus as a treatment seems absurd, but there was some bit of reasoning behind it.Most books that present anecdote after anecdote begin losing steam around the halfway point. However, Morris has found a workaround here— and it’s not just because the stories shared are cringe-inducing or groan-worthy. Rather, he’s crafted a well-thought-out text that’s tightly packed and clips along nicely. It’s almost like he’s telling the stories directly to the reader, taunting, “You’ll never believe this next part.”Perhaps most interestingly, Morris challenges readers to not be so sure of our methods today. If we consider the the typical processes of the previous century outlandish now, what will future professionals think of our performance today? If nothing else, we should be thankful we live in a time of anesthesia and antibiotics.Note: I received a free ARC of this book through NetGalley. "

The cases themselves were fascinating and intriguing. You’ll definitely remember these short notations and leave with some truly horrific visuals. (In case it’s not clear from the title, this medical history text is extremely graphic—if you’re squeamish, I’d pass on this one).However, I wish the author had wrapped these short anecdotes together into a different narrative structure. It was a boring read, and felt much longer than necessary because it was essentially reading clip after clip of historical reporting...with commentary that felt repetitive in style even as it discussed unique events. In a way, I feel like this book was a million tiny blog posts slammed together. So for that, it’s not an enjoyable book to sit down and read all at once. "
4,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1702050-fox,2," The Mystery of the Exploding Teeth: And Other Curiosities from the History of Medicine contains a distressing lack of exploding teeth stories. Don't get me wrong, the exploding teeth do make an appearance - and indeed, the first hand accounts of them are even more startling than you might imagine. A report as loud as a gunshot, a molar split in half - these are the sorts of details I was very much looking forward to. Yet only two accounts are in the book, and not much speculation is there as to just why people's teeth were exploding. Luckily, there are many more bizarre tales to be told between this book's covers.I was torn between two or three stars and eventually settled upon two for a few reasons. The book was incredibly entertaining, yes, and there were a whole host of bizarre stories within it. The problems for me arose from the lack of elaboration on each of the cases. The pithy remarks were occasionally amusing, but I think the book would have been better served by diving deeper into fewer stories than the broad brush over many. Quality over quantity, after ll.Nonetheless, this was a very entertaining book and definitely gave me some inspiration for future writing. Who, after all, can forget the image of a child vomiting up live slugs? What about a person sticking a fork up their anus in an attempt to relieve constipation? Or, maybe, a person getting most of their ribs removed while remaining conscious throughout the entire procedure - without any anesthesia? And the enemas. Oh, the enemas.Medical history will probably always amuse me, and this is a fun dip into it. If you want deeper dives and more comprehensive analysis, though, I think the podcast Sawbones is a better starting point."

6,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/733932-lori,3,"Author Thomas Morris compiled cases from various sources--newspapers, books, medical journals, etc.--with some unusual twists. In some instances, things are grotesque, in others just odd. The treatments sometimes bring a little humor to the story. I enjoyed the glimpses of actual headlines or snippets of the books, but this was just a mediocre read for me. Some stories were revulsive. The author uses a lot of quotes from his sources so the original voices do not become lost to the modern reader. I do think it provides good diversion for those interested in the history of medicine. In these times of COVID-19, a look at some of the past's mysterious illnesses may bring a little comic relief--or it may be a little too much like current headlines. "

It hooked me from page one and I devoured it whenever I found spare time.The human capacity for mischief, misadventure and downright idiocy is apparently a trait that progress cannot eradicate.The Mystery of the Exploding Teeth is a gathering of stories from history that suspend belief in some cases or in some cases just show the strength of the human body. Many of these cases have been documented in medical journals, although some passed through word of mouth and are largely believed to be tall tales, which are included in their own section.Super-mesenteric-vein-expia-thrombosis, the Clinical Sequelae Can Be Quite Atrocious”—the improbable title of an article about a serious complication of appendicitis.Thomas Morris provides a humorous narration that I enjoyed even more than the stories about humans who survived eating knives or bullets through the head.And more importantly, the correct answer to the question “Can you swallow more knives?” is never “All the knives aboard the ship.”Highly recommended as a humorous but interesting read. If not just to remind you of how lucky we are to live in a time where enemas and bleedings are not the answer to EVERYTHING and anesthetic and anesthesia exist."

11,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,3,"“Horrible Histories for Adults” is the tagline: Morris pulls out obscure and hardly believable stories from medical history, as reported in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century books and periodicals, and presents them as a mixture of primary text and modern commentary. I got a poor impression from the first section, which is full of puerile sniggering at penises getting stuck in unlikely places and objects being inserted into orifices. Some of the later sections on bizarre remedies and gruesome surgeries are of more interest. Overall, there’s too much swallowing of random stuff. This was entertaining enough to keep as a bedside book, but not all I was hoping for considering this was what I treated myself to (new, full-price) with a birthday book token.A favorite line: “‘Injurious excess of exertion’ is a good phrase, and one which I intend to use next time I am feeling too lazy to go out for a run.”"

And more importantly, the correct answer to the question 'Can you swallow more knives?' is never 'All the knives aboard the ship.'""I love reading about weird medical stuff. And this book has a lot of weird stuff. From a young man in 1724 who had a fork lodged in his anus to a man who survived, and recovered fully, other than having a stiff knee, being shot and stabbed with a bayonet. Most of the odd medical cases or dubious remedies offered here are from the 1700's to the early 1900's, and make you extremely thankful that you live in an age of hand-washing and medical care that does not contain leeches or crow bile. I really enjoyed that this book isn't overly scientific. While there's nothing wrong with being scientific, this book is fun to read instead of feeling like homework for high-school biology. It also isn't full of irrelevant anecdotes that draw you away from the hilarious medical anomalies that presented themselves to old school doctors.Also, as a side note, apparently the human yearning to stick things into your butt that don't belong there is not a new thing. People have apparently been fascinated by, and getting things lodged into, the anus for the entirety of medical history."

Thomas Morris pulls together little known, unusual and sometimes scary medical stories from the period between the 17th and early 20th centuries. Gathered from medical journals and other sources, these tales show the ways doctors tried and even sometimes succeeded to cure people in the days before antibiotics and modern surgery. Some cures are precursors to more modern treatments, while others are blind alleys (pigeons to treat convulsions, anyone?) Morris provides the history of the doctors involved and helpfully footnotes the modern names for body parts and cures for the reader, which I liked. He also lets us know what happened to the patient afterwards if that information is available. I found it fascinating and a reminder of why I don’t want to live in the olden times. -Lynn H."

The author writes with a great sense of humor and his translation/commentary of the historical documentation is almost always just as entertaining as the subject of the case.I gasped and groaned to myself while reading this book and felt compelled to share (uninvited, usually) the particularly gruesome or weird cases with whomever was unfortunate enough to be within earshot. One thing I will say is while I appreciated the ""tall tales"" section for the dubious medical stories, I felt it was a bit unnecessary when the book was loaded with so many other more credibly (?) noted cases.But, overall a must read if you love weird medical history!"

The Mystery of the Exploding Teeth and Other Curiosities from the History of Medicine
 was a funny, informative and kinda gross read.The author extracts information from old timey leaflets, advertisements, pamphlets, and medical journals about bizarre medical cases and fake medical news, before fake news was even coined.Mr. Morris adds minor sarcastic jokes to some of the articles he summarizes, and makes the old fashioned narrative come alive with his helpful tidbits and explanations.It's like I sometimes say; nothing is grosser than real life."
22,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4062878-holly-mcintyre,3,"I am not certain how this book manages to be both bizarrely interesting and, at the same time, mildly boring. The eleven pages of citations testify to thorough research into the medical literature of Europe and the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries. Antique medical terms are helpfully explained. The writing is clear and at times humorous. In the end, however, there are only so many ways to describe the survival of gruesome accidents, the catastrophic results of putting objects where they do not belong, or the laughable-if-they-were-not-so-lethal treatments of the time. The book reads as if it were a super-extended column of Ripley’s Believe It or Not. I longed for a context in which to place the anecdotes. What do these tales of illness and treatment tell us about the people and society of two centuries ago? Without context the stories are but freak shows. By the end I had enormous appreciation for what human bodies can sometimes overcome, gratitude that medicine today is not quite so misguided, and a whisper of fear that it may, in fact, be."

24,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2579781-paul,5,"After listening to the first chapter of this, I texted my wife that there was a book she would really like about weird and gruesome medical stories and gave her an abbreviated form of one or two of the ones I'd heard already. I wasn't there when she got the text, but it would only be a little exaggeration to suggest that she dropped everything and ran to her computer to put it on her phone, making it my most successful book recommendation with her to date. By the end of the book, I felt completely vindicated in my early recommendation - this book delivers the goods.Even now (she's a bit behind me in the book), we keep talking about the crazy stories that Morris dug up. Stories like 
The pigeon's rump cure
, where unfortunately the obvious question of, ""Why did anyone think to try this in the first place?"" still remains sadly unanswered. As a side-note, it was not obvious from the book that the author has a blog with more of this kind of stuff on it - I only found that out when trying to google for more information on the pigeon's rump cure.Anyone who reads my other reviews will know that I am deeply suspicious of the popular forms of many disciplines - pop science, pop history, pop economics, etc - because they tend to sensationalize and create narratives to fit the story, but in this book I think Morris managed to come up with something reasonable. The cases are likely sensationalized somewhat by the original reports, but Morris resists the urge to draw any sort of big picture conclusions from them - he's basically saying, ""Hey look at this crazy thing that probably happened mostly like this."" Note the ""probably happened mostly like this"" part of it - Morris also injects a bit of skepticism into many of these reports - which is quite the opposite of pop science puffery.I think pretty much the only people likely to be disappointed with this book (other than those who are quite squeamish) are people looking for some sort of in-depth investigative reporting. Morris is mostly working from case studies published in medical journals over 100 years old. I think he does a fair job trying to go a little deeper by trying to probe how what we've learned in medicine would change how the symptoms were viewed, and by trying to give additional biographical details about the people involved, but there are definitely some stories where that information simply doesn't exist and Morris nobly resists the urge to guess.5 of 5 stars"

First of all it is a nonfiction about historical medical cases, but just listening to them you almost just can't believe this is truly a nonfiction, but rather a historical science fiction. The cases are most of the time just outlandish and if you have an interest in anything related to the medical field, this is something for you. The narrators are amazing together with how it is written, I feel like to get the full experience you have to listen to the audiobook instead of reading it. You have 2 narrators, 1 of 2, the writer giving their point of view about the medical cases and the second narrator citing snippets from the original source of the medical case (document, book, newspaper, ...) Both of them have a very pleasant voice to listen too. Also how it was written, from the point of view from the writer, it almost feels like someone having a conversation with you about said medical cases.Very very very amusing, to the point of unbelievable and definitely recommend this to either read, or my preferable option, listen to.

These tales from all over the world are absorbing as long as you are not grossed out by, well, really disturbing material. If you're looking for something to read that will help you exercise by making your muscles contract in sympathetic wincing or your legs cross involuntarily, this book is for you. From the several men who put things up their urethrae to the man whose intestines all fell into his (of course horribly distended) scrotal sac, to the woman who urinated out of every orifice, there's something here to fix every reader with hypnotic horror. In addition to learning about the ghastly things that can happen to the human body, there's also a great deal to learn about the treatments of the time, which included mercury, crows' saliva, and bird butts. There may even be a few lessons to be learned here, if for example you are kind of person to accept bets on how many clasp knives you can swallow in one go (""all the ones you have on board"" not being the right answer). I personally had to stop reading this after a few cases and go back to something more calming, before attempting it again a few days later. I suspect most readers would feel the same."
27,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106905848-mars,3,"Somewhat of a fun read. The cases were funny, sad and remarkable, some all at once. The treatments by some doctors were even crazier and more entertaining, to think some were orthodox at the time really affirms to me that medicine had such a bizarre history. Probably still bizarre, give it another 100 years and everything today maybe be viewed with the same incredulous, patronizing lens as we view the accounts in this book.They were all astoundingly fascinating though, I think the stories that stood out to me the most were the ones of the man swallowing over 30 knives on multiple occassions, and the one of the man who deliberately cut his penis into two halves which I found sad more than amusing. Unfortunately not much on exploding teeth though, I would've appreciated more of them!Nice read. I may have rushed through some parts since I've found some of the author's in-lime comments disengaging and unnecessary at times-- the absurdity of the cases speak for themselves.

I'm so very glad I did! It is an incredibly interesting, funny and sometimes heart breaking account of medical conditions and prosedures performed between 1600 and 1900. The narrative is also funny, with the narrator obviously getting as much entertainment out of the odd, insane and disgusting stories as the reader should be. I was definitely disturbed by some of the accounts, the case of the man who cut his own penis in half may stay with me for a while, but I really enjoyed learning about medicine before anesthesia was available. It definitely gave me a new appreciation for the time period we live in! I would highly recommend this book.

The medicine discussed is from 100 and more years ago, and this results in humorously bad ideas, and frighteningly unsterile and painful techniques! People should have learned that the success of an individual technique did NOT necessarily imply the overall efficaciousness of said technique in all cases. I am so happy that science – and medicine – have improved greatly since then! It is still the case that sometimes doctors can say ""I'm not sure WHY it works, but it does"", but fortunately that attitude is not the ruling one in most cases. It is inconceivable that the idea of ""the for humors"" was popular as long as it was!The litany of cases is truly interesting, and some of the successes go to show how resilient is the human body! Of course, the resilience of imagination is also pointed out :-)"

The information is presented in very easily digestible terms that will not have you reaching for a medical dictionary: any foreign terms are described in the footnotes and there are several humorous asides by the author.

The pages are littered with utterly pointless asides and ""ahems', ""deal with it"", ""oh wells"" - grow up, Thomas. Write like an adult FFS."
55,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3919719-stephanie,5,"What People Will Do to the Human Body Inspires Mind-Boggling Medical Historyhttp://fangswandsandfairydust.com/201...Bizarre doesn’t begin to describe the history of medicine. I voluntarily reviewed an advance readers copy of this book. No remuneration was exchanged and all opinions presented herein are my own except as noted. Thomas Morris’s THE MYSTERY OF THE EXPLODING TEETH is the perfect read for any doctor, or people who, like me, find medial procedures and history fascinating but have not studied medicine. With Audible, Audiobooks.com, Amazon, etc, you can still arrange for someone to receive this hilarious, and not seriously gross, volume in print, ebook, or audio for the doctor replaces your blood with port wine. mats by the big day! listened to this book over the course of about two days, but with its vignetted style, someone could easily dip in and out to of the book for several weeks while reading other books, The style also makes it good for when you only have short periods of time to concentrate, unless you are recovering form illness or surgery on anything other than your sense of humor.If the book focused more on salacious humor it would be less funny and informative. I felt a little guilty for laughing at the serious medical stories about which Morris writes — I sure those experiencing them did not find them at all amusing. Imagine, you’re a woman bleeding out after delivery and the doctor, after manually stopping the hemorrhage, replaces some of your blood with port wine! Okay, that would be funny even, perhaps, to the patient. Morris focused on human foibles and the meandering path medical science has followed; the “body humors,” poor anatomical understanding, lack of anesthesia, and more are explored. I am always amazed by what people can be convinced to swallow: needles, knives, heaven only knows what else, are swallowed and extracted by intrepid, bumbling or genius medical practitioners. How did our species ever survive the lack of medical knowledge and our own supreme idiocy. If you’re curious about the types of medical strangeness on which Morris writes check out his blog post about a waiter who swallowed spoons to amuse patrons: http://www.thomas-morris.uk/the-spoon....There is a bit of “Ripley’s Believe It or Not” in the author’s style, but seriously it is hard to believe anyone would want to swallow needles or stick other items into their own body. The narration is excellent and the two different narrators change it up, but it’s not because the material is too dry, rather it reflects the accents of the letter or article writer. I think both the author and Farley did very well, I especially like non-fiction to have author narration as their understanding of the subject often lends credibility to the ideas presented. I also enjoyed the usually well-done accents. While the history seems focused on British and American medicine, other countries medical oddities are considered as well. I enjoyed listening to the stories and my husband did as well, making it a good choice for road trips. Warning though, if you laugh too hard pull over! "
56,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35113927-spencer,4,"	I first saw this book featured at the Kinokuniya bookstore in Los Angeles. As I casually flipped through its pages, my eyes were drawn to case studies’ titles that included urination from the eyes, forks in the rectum, and human pincushions. These horrifying yet humorous passages were a good indicator for the read ahead; obviously educational and wildly hilarious. 	Medical historian Thomas Morris sifted through hundreds of years of medical texts in order to cull countless stories of medieval, colonial, and Victorian tales. He breaks them up into several chapters. I had two distinct issues with this book, as a whole: two of the chapters are especially dull to get through, and the book itself is very upsetting. Whilst I found a lot of the stories funny, or at least illuminating about how far we have come in the past five hundred years, there were a lot of times where I went fetal. Just today, in finishing this book, I came across a story that made me scream, “No,” a record twelve times. If you’re squeamish this is not the book for you. The dull chapters mostly dealt with surgery, which for a layman like me, became especially technical.	Overall, Morris is a thoroughly entertaining writer who added just the right amount of panache and self-reflection in order to properly bookend many of these stories. It must have been especially difficult to make sense of the countless uses of Old English and old-timey slang. Morris also makes it a point to always showcase the contemporary climate in which these occurrences took place, which helped contextualize a lot of the more confounding ideas and cures. "
57,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1094141-christina-tang-bernas,4,"I was walking by the ""New Books"" shelf in the local library and was arrested by the title of this book. I'm morbidly fascinated with weird medical/death/historical stuff, so I put aside the other books I was reading, checked it out, and finished it quite rapidly. I have a sense that Thomas Morris is an information hoarder like me, and he has put together a really fascinating overview of medicine and the attitudes both patients and doctors had about medicine especially before a lot of technology had been invented yet. A mix of scientific method, quackery, and guesswork fills these pages, and almost all of them were interesting to read. Mr. Morris is able to quickly relate the details of each case while keeping it interesting. He explains words that have fallen out of use or any complicated medical jargon, and he seems to have a good foundation in anatomy and medical science. Two things keep me from giving it 5 stars. One, sometimes his own personal comments, while mostly funny and wry, can sometimes veer towards unnecessary and/or too sarcastic/snarky. Some stories needed that extra personal commentary, but not all of them. Two, the book ends very abruptly. I thought there would be a concluding summary or interesting final observations by the author. But, I finished reading the last case, and it immediately jumped to the ""Sources"" page. It seems rather abrupt to me, kind of like a movie that just ends and there's no feeling of resolution. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed it. "
58,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20456668-diane-hernandez,4,"If there is a strange medical tale, it is recorded in the Mystery of the Exploding Teeth.With section titles like Unfortunate Predicaments, Mysterious Illnesses, and Horrifying Operations, how could this book be anything but a rollicking ride through the pages of bad choices. In Unfortunate Predicaments, we meet young men who did many ill-conceived things to their nether regions. We also meet a man who ate four knives on a dare and didn’t go to a doctor when only three came out his other end. A lifetime of doing this trick eventually killed him. In Mysterious Illnesses, a woman makes herself a human pin cushion and a boy vomits up his own twin. Horrifying Operations makes the reader impressed by the fortitude of his or her forebears. Before anesthesia, a man held up a candle for the surgeon while his other arm was being amputated at the shoulder. Another used a knitting needle and a tiny file three times daily for weeks to break up his bladder stone.Okay, you either like weird stuff like this or you don’t. As someone who used to gobble Ripley’s Believe It or Not books in my youth, I love it.

Are you intrigued by gruesome medical history or just disturbing true stories? Well then, boy do I have the book for you! This book was fascinating. I'm not a big nonfiction fan. If I'm reading nonfiction it has to be something that really interest me or something absurd/weird/strange/gross. THIS BOOK WAS ALL OF THAT AND MORE! Plus as an added bonus the author is hilarious. The bits of humor he inserts within each medical story will have you shuddering with laughter and disgust. This book is a collection of old medical journal entries. Each one more terrifying than the last. If you don't cringe at least 25 times during this book....congratulations! but also, go check yourself into a hospital cause something is wrong with you. Tales of a woman peeing from every hole in her body, a man that chose his hand and a piece of wood over a woman, a man those swallowed knives as a party trick, and many many more. Oh! Don't forget the port wine enemas...oh no, we could never forget those! Each chapter tells a tale. They are pretty short but uber creepy/interesting.

If you to know the outlandish, the concerning, unlucky and sometimes foolish ways in which people managed to hurt themselves or get hurt, or the weird ailments they professed to have, this book has it all! Sometimes it brought about a mighty wince or two or a cringe of sympathy from the circumstances. The information is presented in very easily digestible terms that will not have you reaching for a medical dictionary: any foreign terms are described in the footnotes and there are several humorous asides by the author. My only qualm is that it ended very abruptly, but it was an entertaining enough read that I didn’t mind."

Many of the stories have gruesome details that make it difficult to read this book without cringing and making a horrified face throughout. One of my complaints is the personality of the author, which is inserted throughout and, in my opinion, makes too much light of serious, painful topics. For example, after one cringe-inducing case, he writes, “Once you’ve dried your tears of mirth, perhaps you’ll spare a thought for the poor fellow” (40). This and other similar sentences were rather off putting, but the book was still overall fascinating."

The bits of humor he inserts within each medical story will have you shuddering with laughter and disgust. This book is a collection of old medical journal entries. Each one more terrifying than the last. If you don't cringe at least 25 times during this book....congratulations! but also, go check yourself into a hospital cause something is wrong with you. Tales of a woman peeing from every hole in her body, a man that chose his hand and a piece of wood over a woman, a man those swallowed knives as a party trick, and many many more. Oh! Don't forget the port wine enemas...oh no, we could never forget those! Each chapter tells a tale. They are pretty short but uber creepy/interesting.

If you to know the outlandish, the concerning, unlucky and sometimes foolish ways in which people managed to hurt themselves or get hurt, or the weird ailments they professed to have, this book has it all! Sometimes it brought about a mighty wince or two or a cringe of sympathy from the circumstances. The information is presented in very easily digestible terms that will not have you reaching for a medical dictionary: any foreign terms are described in the footnotes and there are several humorous asides by the author. My only qualm is that it ended very abruptly, but it was an entertaining enough read that I didn’t mind."
91,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19900248-sarah,4,"This book is not for the faint of heart! Many of the stories have gruesome details that make it difficult to read this book without cringing and making a horrified face throughout. One of my complaints is the personality of the author, which is inserted throughout and, in my opinion, makes too much light of serious, painful topics. For example, after one cringe-inducing case, he writes, “Once you’ve dried your tears of mirth, perhaps you’ll spare a thought for the poor fellow” (40). This and other similar sentences were rather off putting, but the book was still overall fascinating."

I found this book very entertaining."
109,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67091097-ren,3,"I listened to the audiobook and that may have impacted my enjoyment of this book. I found the author's snarky comments peppered in every 10-60 seconds between the actual case histories read by a different narrator to be very disruptive and unfunny, and increasingly annoying as the book went on. I'm not sure what their purpose was, it didn't contribute anything worthwhile and took away from the narrative quite a bit. Maybe in the physical book form it wouldn't be as annoying but it was pretty bad in the audiobook. I also found the frequent interruptions for footnote definitions annoying as well. About 50% of those were unnecessary and obvious from contextual clues, or were words which people already know. The collection of case histories was interesting, but the execution left a lot to be desired."

Ranging from unfortunate to downright gruesome, it paints a pretty vivid picture of a series of interesting wounds (some of them self-inflicted) and afflictions (ergot poisoning, anybody?) that we really don't get to see in 2020 Although, TBH, a scythe-related injury nowadays would at least give us a break from the common lawnmower-induced ones :)"

He is now a freelance writer and medical historian. His first book, The Matter of the Heart: A History of the Heart in Eleven Operations, wonthe Royal Society of Literature and the Jerwood Charitable Foundation award. The award is one of three annual awards, one of £10,000 and two of £5,000, offered to authors on their first works of non-fiction. Mr. Morris now lives in London.Who is the target audience?This book is for everyone 16 or older. The Mystery of the Exploding Teeth is written for the masses and not just for those who want to learn about historic medicine. The book is full of individual cases hand-picked through time to provide the reader with a glimpse of common medical procedures, some uncommon medical procedures, and allot of very interesting cases.SynopsisThe Mystery of the Exploding Teeth: And Other Curiosities from the History of Medicine, is a sojourn into some of the most interesting medical cases and the procedures used in those cases. It is told through the eyes of the people who were actually there. This book is a conglomeration of notes, letters, personal views of the doctors, and sometimes the patients. The author does a great job of finding the most interesting cases in history. There are some interesting cases that include various items escaping the bodies from all different places, some not very good places. How about the surgeries where the patient is not anesthetized and is an active participant? There is a chapter of patients who survived extreme injuries, some lived normal lives after their injuries.ConclusionAfter reading this book, I listened to the audible version and the narrator added so much more to the enjoyment. He does a great job with the inflection of his voice and the bits that are in French. The little jokes he throws in are awesome. This tome, at times, had me laughing, cringing, crying, and always wondering about the historic doctors and their sometime weird practices. The cases offer a wide variety of injuries and maladies; the causes of some of these will haunt me. I would definitely recommend this book to a friend."

The bits of humor he inserts within each medical story will have you shuddering with laughter and disgust. This book is a collection of old medical journal entries. Each one more terrifying than the last. If you don't cringe at least 25 times during this book....congratulations! but also, go check yourself into a hospital cause something is wrong with you. Tales of a woman peeing from every hole in her body, a man that chose his hand and a piece of wood over a woman, a man those swallowed knives as a party trick, and many many more. Oh! Don't forget the port wine enemas...oh no, we could never forget those! Each chapter tells a tale. They are pretty short but uber creepy/interesting. Just go get the book you'll regret it and love it all at once. You're welcome."

Although the commentary was often pretty cheesy, Thomas Morris provided helpful context into the state of medicine at the time and he did a very good job finding cases that are absurd, fascinating, repulsive and (occasionally) highly unlikely in medical journal canon. I found this book very entertaining."
139,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67091097-ren,3,"I listened to the audiobook and that may have impacted my enjoyment of this book. I found the author's snarky comments peppered in every 10-60 seconds between the actual case histories read by a different narrator to be very disruptive and unfunny, and increasingly annoying as the book went on. I'm not sure what their purpose was, it didn't contribute anything worthwhile and took away from the narrative quite a bit. Maybe in the physical book form it wouldn't be as annoying but it was pretty bad in the audiobook. I also found the frequent interruptions for footnote definitions annoying as well. About 50% of those were unnecessary and obvious from contextual clues, or were words which people already know. The collection of case histories was interesting, but the execution left a lot to be desired."

Ranging from unfortunate to downright gruesome, it paints a pretty vivid picture of a series of interesting wounds (some of them self-inflicted) and afflictions (ergot poisoning, anybody?) that we really don't get to see in 2020 Although, TBH, a scythe-related injury nowadays would at least give us a break from the common lawnmower-induced ones :)"
142,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74415844-nemo-nemo,4,"Author’s BioThomas Morris was a successful radio producer for the British Broadcasting Company (BBC) for many years. He is now a freelance writer and medical historian. His first book, The Matter of the Heart: A History of the Heart in Eleven Operations, wonthe Royal Society of Literature and the Jerwood Charitable Foundation award. The award is one of three annual awards, one of £10,000 and two of £5,000, offered to authors on their first works of non-fiction. Mr. Morris now lives in London.Who is the target audience?This book is for everyone 16 or older. The Mystery of the Exploding Teeth is written for the masses and not just for those who want to learn about historic medicine. The book is full of individual cases hand-picked through time to provide the reader with a glimpse of common medical procedures, some uncommon medical procedures, and allot of very interesting cases.SynopsisThe Mystery of the Exploding Teeth: And Other Curiosities from the History of Medicine, is a sojourn into some of the most interesting medical cases and the procedures used in those cases. It is told through the eyes of the people who were actually there. This book is a conglomeration of notes, letters, personal views of the doctors, and sometimes the patients. The author does a great job of finding the most interesting cases in history. There are some interesting cases that include various items escaping the bodies from all different places, some not very good places. How about the surgeries where the patient is not anesthetized and is an active participant? There is a chapter of patients who survived extreme injuries, some lived normal lives after their injuries.ConclusionAfter reading this book, I listened to the audible version and the narrator added so much more to the enjoyment. He does a great job with the inflection of his voice and the bits that are in French. The little jokes he throws in are awesome. This tome, at times, had me laughing, cringing, crying, and always wondering about the historic doctors and their sometime weird practices. The cases offer a wide variety of injuries and maladies; the causes of some of these will haunt me. I would definitely recommend this book to a friend."
143,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64537232-victor-carvalho,5,"This book by Darkside Books is one of the first three on the Macabra label, which is the partnership of the publisher with the website dedicated to the works of terror Macabra.tv.Here the author shows us medical reports from the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries that were published in medical magazines of the time or in books. The stories brought in this book are often absurd and quite shocking, but we have to see it from the perspective of the doctors that are shown there, who did not have the same knowledge, instruments, techniques or remedies that we have today. That is why these cases are as fascinating as they are absurd.It's a good tip for those who like crazy and medical stories."

The pages are littered with utterly pointless asides and ""ahems', ""deal with it"", ""oh wells"" - grow up, Thomas. Write like an adult FFS."
145,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3919719-stephanie,5,"What People Will Do to the Human Body Inspires Mind-Boggling Medical Historyhttp://fangswandsandfairydust.com/201...Bizarre doesn’t begin to describe the history of medicine. I voluntarily reviewed an advance readers copy of this book. No remuneration was exchanged and all opinions presented herein are my own except as noted. Thomas Morris’s THE MYSTERY OF THE EXPLODING TEETH is the perfect read for any doctor, or people who, like me, find medial procedures and history fascinating but have not studied medicine. With Audible, Audiobooks.com, Amazon, etc, you can still arrange for someone to receive this hilarious, and not seriously gross, volume in print, ebook, or audio for the doctor replaces your blood with port wine. mats by the big day! listened to this book over the course of about two days, but with its vignetted style, someone could easily dip in and out to of the book for several weeks while reading other books, The style also makes it good for when you only have short periods of time to concentrate, unless you are recovering form illness or surgery on anything other than your sense of humor.If the book focused more on salacious humor it would be less funny and informative. I felt a little guilty for laughing at the serious medical stories about which Morris writes — I sure those experiencing them did not find them at all amusing. Imagine, you’re a woman bleeding out after delivery and the doctor, after manually stopping the hemorrhage, replaces some of your blood with port wine! Okay, that would be funny even, perhaps, to the patient. Morris focused on human foibles and the meandering path medical science has followed; the “body humors,” poor anatomical understanding, lack of anesthesia, and more are explored. I am always amazed by what people can be convinced to swallow: needles, knives, heaven only knows what else, are swallowed and extracted by intrepid, bumbling or genius medical practitioners. How did our species ever survive the lack of medical knowledge and our own supreme idiocy. If you’re curious about the types of medical strangeness on which Morris writes check out his blog post about a waiter who swallowed spoons to amuse patrons: http://www.thomas-morris.uk/the-spoon....There is a bit of “Ripley’s Believe It or Not” in the author’s style, but seriously it is hard to believe anyone would want to swallow needles or stick other items into their own body. The narration is excellent and the two different narrators change it up, but it’s not because the material is too dry, rather it reflects the accents of the letter or article writer. I think both the author and Farley did very well, I especially like non-fiction to have author narration as their understanding of the subject often lends credibility to the ideas presented. I also enjoyed the usually well-done accents. While the history seems focused on British and American medicine, other countries medical oddities are considered as well. I enjoyed listening to the stories and my husband did as well, making it a good choice for road trips. Warning though, if you laugh too hard pull over! "
146,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35113927-spencer,4,"	I first saw this book featured at the Kinokuniya bookstore in Los Angeles. As I casually flipped through its pages, my eyes were drawn to case studies’ titles that included urination from the eyes, forks in the rectum, and human pincushions. These horrifying yet humorous passages were a good indicator for the read ahead; obviously educational and wildly hilarious. 	Medical historian Thomas Morris sifted through hundreds of years of medical texts in order to cull countless stories of medieval, colonial, and Victorian tales. He breaks them up into several chapters. I had two distinct issues with this book, as a whole: two of the chapters are especially dull to get through, and the book itself is very upsetting. Whilst I found a lot of the stories funny, or at least illuminating about how far we have come in the past five hundred years, there were a lot of times where I went fetal. Just today, in finishing this book, I came across a story that made me scream, “No,” a record twelve times. If you’re squeamish this is not the book for you. The dull chapters mostly dealt with surgery, which for a layman like me, became especially technical.	Overall, Morris is a thoroughly entertaining writer who added just the right amount of panache and self-reflection in order to properly bookend many of these stories. It must have been especially difficult to make sense of the countless uses of Old English and old-timey slang. Morris also makes it a point to always showcase the contemporary climate in which these occurrences took place, which helped contextualize a lot of the more confounding ideas and cures. "
147,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1094141-christina-tang-bernas,4,"I was walking by the ""New Books"" shelf in the local library and was arrested by the title of this book. I'm morbidly fascinated with weird medical/death/historical stuff, so I put aside the other books I was reading, checked it out, and finished it quite rapidly. I have a sense that Thomas Morris is an information hoarder like me, and he has put together a really fascinating overview of medicine and the attitudes both patients and doctors had about medicine especially before a lot of technology had been invented yet. A mix of scientific method, quackery, and guesswork fills these pages, and almost all of them were interesting to read. Mr. Morris is able to quickly relate the details of each case while keeping it interesting. He explains words that have fallen out of use or any complicated medical jargon, and he seems to have a good foundation in anatomy and medical science. Two things keep me from giving it 5 stars. One, sometimes his own personal comments, while mostly funny and wry, can sometimes veer towards unnecessary and/or too sarcastic/snarky. Some stories needed that extra personal commentary, but not all of them. Two, the book ends very abruptly. I thought there would be a concluding summary or interesting final observations by the author. But, I finished reading the last case, and it immediately jumped to the ""Sources"" page. It seems rather abrupt to me, kind of like a movie that just ends and there's no feeling of resolution. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed it. "
148,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20456668-diane-hernandez,4,"If there is a strange medical tale, it is recorded in the Mystery of the Exploding Teeth.With section titles like Unfortunate Predicaments, Mysterious Illnesses, and Horrifying Operations, how could this book be anything but a rollicking ride through the pages of bad choices. In Unfortunate Predicaments, we meet young men who did many ill-conceived things to their nether regions. We also meet a man who ate four knives on a dare and didn’t go to a doctor when only three came out his other end. A lifetime of doing this trick eventually killed him. In Mysterious Illnesses, a woman makes herself a human pin cushion and a boy vomits up his own twin. Horrifying Operations makes the reader impressed by the fortitude of his or her forebears. Before anesthesia, a man held up a candle for the surgeon while his other arm was being amputated at the shoulder. Another used a knitting needle and a tiny file three times daily for weeks to break up his bladder stone.Okay, you either like weird stuff like this or you don’t. As someone who used to gobble Ripley’s Believe It or Not books in my youth, I love it.

Thomas Morris’s THE MYSTERY OF THE EXPLODING TEETH is the perfect read for any doctor, or people who, like me, find medial procedures and history fascinating but have not studied medicine.

I felt a little guilty for laughing at the serious medical stories about which Morris writes — I sure those experiencing them did not find them at all amusing. Imagine, you’re a woman bleeding out after delivery and the doctor, after manually stopping the hemorrhage, replaces some of your blood with port wine! Okay, that would be funny even, perhaps, to the patient. Morris focused on human foibles and the meandering path medical science has followed; the “body humors,” poor anatomical understanding, lack of anesthesia, and more are explored. I am always amazed by what people can be convinced to swallow: needles, knives, heaven only knows what else, are swallowed and extracted by intrepid, bumbling or genius medical practitioners. How did our species ever survive the lack of medical knowledge and our own supreme idiocy. If you’re curious about the types of medical strangeness on which Morris writes check out his blog post about a waiter who swallowed spoons to amuse patrons: http://www.thomas-morris.uk/the-spoon....There is a bit of “Ripley’s Believe It or Not” in the author’s style, but seriously it is hard to believe anyone would want to swallow needles or stick other items into their own body. The narration is excellent and the two different narrators change it up, but it’s not because the material is too dry, rather it reflects the accents of the letter or article writer. I think both the author and Farley did very well, I especially like non-fiction to have author narration as their understanding of the subject often lends credibility to the ideas presented. I also enjoyed the usually well-done accents. While the history seems focused on British and American medicine, other countries medical oddities are considered as well. I enjoyed listening to the stories and my husband did as well, making it a good choice for road trips. Warning though, if you laugh too hard pull over! "
176,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35113927-spencer,4,"	I first saw this book featured at the Kinokuniya bookstore in Los Angeles. As I casually flipped through its pages, my eyes were drawn to case studies’ titles that included urination from the eyes, forks in the rectum, and human pincushions. These horrifying yet humorous passages were a good indicator for the read ahead; obviously educational and wildly hilarious. 	Medical historian Thomas Morris sifted through hundreds of years of medical texts in order to cull countless stories of medieval, colonial, and Victorian tales. He breaks them up into several chapters. I had two distinct issues with this book, as a whole: two of the chapters are especially dull to get through, and the book itself is very upsetting. Whilst I found a lot of the stories funny, or at least illuminating about how far we have come in the past five hundred years, there were a lot of times where I went fetal. Just today, in finishing this book, I came across a story that made me scream, “No,” a record twelve times. If you’re squeamish this is not the book for you. The dull chapters mostly dealt with surgery, which for a layman like me, became especially technical.	Overall, Morris is a thoroughly entertaining writer who added just the right amount of panache and self-reflection in order to properly bookend many of these stories. It must have been especially difficult to make sense of the countless uses of Old English and old-timey slang. Morris also makes it a point to always showcase the contemporary climate in which these occurrences took place, which helped contextualize a lot of the more confounding ideas and cures. "
177,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1094141-christina-tang-bernas,4,"I was walking by the ""New Books"" shelf in the local library and was arrested by the title of this book. I'm morbidly fascinated with weird medical/death/historical stuff, so I put aside the other books I was reading, checked it out, and finished it quite rapidly. I have a sense that Thomas Morris is an information hoarder like me, and he has put together a really fascinating overview of medicine and the attitudes both patients and doctors had about medicine especially before a lot of technology had been invented yet. A mix of scientific method, quackery, and guesswork fills these pages, and almost all of them were interesting to read. Mr. Morris is able to quickly relate the details of each case while keeping it interesting. He explains words that have fallen out of use or any complicated medical jargon, and he seems to have a good foundation in anatomy and medical science. Two things keep me from giving it 5 stars. One, sometimes his own personal comments, while mostly funny and wry, can sometimes veer towards unnecessary and/or too sarcastic/snarky. Some stories needed that extra personal commentary, but not all of them. Two, the book ends very abruptly. I thought there would be a concluding summary or interesting final observations by the author. But, I finished reading the last case, and it immediately jumped to the ""Sources"" page. It seems rather abrupt to me, kind of like a movie that just ends and there's no feeling of resolution. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed it. "
178,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20456668-diane-hernandez,4,"If there is a strange medical tale, it is recorded in the Mystery of the Exploding Teeth.With section titles like Unfortunate Predicaments, Mysterious Illnesses, and Horrifying Operations, how could this book be anything but a rollicking ride through the pages of bad choices. In Unfortunate Predicaments, we meet young men who did many ill-conceived things to their nether regions. We also meet a man who ate four knives on a dare and didn’t go to a doctor when only three came out his other end. A lifetime of doing this trick eventually killed him. In Mysterious Illnesses, a woman makes herself a human pin cushion and a boy vomits up his own twin. Horrifying Operations makes the reader impressed by the fortitude of his or her forebears. Before anesthesia, a man held up a candle for the surgeon while his other arm was being amputated at the shoulder. Another used a knitting needle and a tiny file three times daily for weeks to break up his bladder stone.Okay, you either like weird stuff like this or you don’t. As someone who used to gobble Ripley’s Believe It or Not books in my youth, I love it.

Are you intrigued by gruesome medical history or just disturbing true stories? Well then, boy do I have the book for you! This book was fascinating. I'm not a big nonfiction fan. If I'm reading nonfiction it has to be something that really interest me or something absurd/weird/strange/gross. THIS BOOK WAS ALL OF THAT AND MORE! Plus as an added bonus the author is hilarious. The bits of humor he inserts within each medical story will have you shuddering with laughter and disgust. This book is a collection of old medical journal entries. Each one more terrifying than the last. If you don't cringe at least 25 times during this book....congratulations! but also, go check yourself into a hospital cause something is wrong with you. Tales of a woman peeing from every hole in her body, a man that chose his hand and a piece of wood over a woman, a man those swallowed knives as a party trick, and many many more. Oh! Don't forget the port wine enemas...oh no, we could never forget those! Each chapter tells a tale. They are pretty short but uber creepy/interesting.

If you to know the outlandish, the concerning, unlucky and sometimes foolish ways in which people managed to hurt themselves or get hurt, or the weird ailments they professed to have, this book has it all! Sometimes it brought about a mighty wince or two or a cringe of sympathy from the circumstances. The information is presented in very easily digestible terms that will not have you reaching for a medical dictionary: any foreign terms are described in the footnotes and there are several humorous asides by the author. My only qualm is that it ended very abruptly, but it was an entertaining enough read that I didn’t mind."
181,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19900248-sarah,4,"This book is not for the faint of heart! Many of the stories have gruesome details that make it difficult to read this book without cringing and making a horrified face throughout. One of my complaints is the personality of the author, which is inserted throughout and, in my opinion, makes too much light of serious, painful topics. For example, after one cringe-inducing case, he writes, “Once you’ve dried your tears of mirth, perhaps you’ll spare a thought for the poor fellow” (40). This and other similar sentences were rather off putting, but the book was still overall fascinating."

Throwing up worms, swallowing needles, passing swords in the washroom, spontaneously combusting - this book pulls no punches on the obscure and the outrageous - but all true.

These horrifying yet humorous passages were a good indicator for the read ahead; obviously educational and wildly hilarious. 	Medical historian Thomas Morris sifted through hundreds of years of medical texts in order to cull countless stories of medieval, colonial, and Victorian tales. He breaks them up into several chapters. I had two distinct issues with this book, as a whole: two of the chapters are especially dull to get through, and the book itself is very upsetting. Whilst I found a lot of the stories funny, or at least illuminating about how far we have come in the past five hundred years, there were a lot of times where I went fetal. Just today, in finishing this book, I came across a story that made me scream, “No,” a record twelve times. If you’re squeamish this is not the book for you. The dull chapters mostly dealt with surgery, which for a layman like me, became especially technical.	Overall, Morris is a thoroughly entertaining writer who added just the right amount of panache and self-reflection in order to properly bookend many of these stories. It must have been especially difficult to make sense of the countless uses of Old English and old-timey slang. Morris also makes it a point to always showcase the contemporary climate in which these occurrences took place, which helped contextualize a lot of the more confounding ideas and cures. "

I found the author's snarky comments peppered in every 10-60 seconds between the actual case histories read by a different narrator to be very disruptive and unfunny, and increasingly annoying as the book went on. I'm not sure what their purpose was, it didn't contribute anything worthwhile and took away from the narrative quite a bit. Maybe in the physical book form it wouldn't be as annoying but it was pretty bad in the audiobook. I also found the frequent interruptions for footnote definitions annoying as well. About 50% of those were unnecessary and obvious from contextual clues, or were words which people already know. The collection of case histories was interesting, but the execution left a lot to be desired."

Ranging from unfortunate to downright gruesome, it paints a pretty vivid picture of a series of interesting wounds (some of them self-inflicted) and afflictions (ergot poisoning, anybody?) that we really don't get to see in 2020 Although, TBH, a scythe-related injury nowadays would at least give us a break from the common lawnmower-induced ones :)"

He is now a freelance writer and medical historian. His first book, The Matter of the Heart: A History of the Heart in Eleven Operations, wonthe Royal Society of Literature and the Jerwood Charitable Foundation award. The award is one of three annual awards, one of £10,000 and two of £5,000, offered to authors on their first works of non-fiction. Mr. Morris now lives in London.Who is the target audience?This book is for everyone 16 or older. The Mystery of the Exploding Teeth is written for the masses and not just for those who want to learn about historic medicine. The book is full of individual cases hand-picked through time to provide the reader with a glimpse of common medical procedures, some uncommon medical procedures, and allot of very interesting cases.SynopsisThe Mystery of the Exploding Teeth: And Other Curiosities from the History of Medicine, is a sojourn into some of the most interesting medical cases and the procedures used in those cases. It is told through the eyes of the people who were actually there. This book is a conglomeration of notes, letters, personal views of the doctors, and sometimes the patients. The author does a great job of finding the most interesting cases in history. There are some interesting cases that include various items escaping the bodies from all different places, some not very good places. How about the surgeries where the patient is not anesthetized and is an active participant? There is a chapter of patients who survived extreme injuries, some lived normal lives after their injuries.ConclusionAfter reading this book, I listened to the audible version and the narrator added so much more to the enjoyment. He does a great job with the inflection of his voice and the bits that are in French. The little jokes he throws in are awesome. This tome, at times, had me laughing, cringing, crying, and always wondering about the historic doctors and their sometime weird practices. The cases offer a wide variety of injuries and maladies; the causes of some of these will haunt me. I would definitely recommend this book to a friend."

The stories brought in this book are often absurd and quite shocking, but we have to see it from the perspective of the doctors that are shown there, who did not have the same knowledge, instruments, techniques or remedies that we have today. That is why these cases are as fascinating as they are absurd.It's a good tip for those who like crazy and medical stories."

I felt a little guilty for laughing at the serious medical stories about which Morris writes — I sure those experiencing them did not find them at all amusing. Imagine, you’re a woman bleeding out after delivery and the doctor, after manually stopping the hemorrhage, replaces some of your blood with port wine! Okay, that would be funny even, perhaps, to the patient. Morris focused on human foibles and the meandering path medical science has followed; the “body humors,” poor anatomical understanding, lack of anesthesia, and more are explored.

262,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74415844-nemo-nemo,4,"Author’s BioThomas Morris was a successful radio producer for the British Broadcasting Company (BBC) for many years. He is now a freelance writer and medical historian. His first book, The Matter of the Heart: A History of the Heart in Eleven Operations, wonthe Royal Society of Literature and the Jerwood Charitable Foundation award. The award is one of three annual awards, one of £10,000 and two of £5,000, offered to authors on their first works of non-fiction. Mr. Morris now lives in London.Who is the target audience?This book is for everyone 16 or older. The Mystery of the Exploding Teeth is written for the masses and not just for those who want to learn about historic medicine. The book is full of individual cases hand-picked through time to provide the reader with a glimpse of common medical procedures, some uncommon medical procedures, and allot of very interesting cases.SynopsisThe Mystery of the Exploding Teeth: And Other Curiosities from the History of Medicine, is a sojourn into some of the most interesting medical cases and the procedures used in those cases. It is told through the eyes of the people who were actually there. This book is a conglomeration of notes, letters, personal views of the doctors, and sometimes the patients. The author does a great job of finding the most interesting cases in history. There are some interesting cases that include various items escaping the bodies from all different places, some not very good places. How about the surgeries where the patient is not anesthetized and is an active participant? There is a chapter of patients who survived extreme injuries, some lived normal lives after their injuries.ConclusionAfter reading this book, I listened to the audible version and the narrator added so much more to the enjoyment. He does a great job with the inflection of his voice and the bits that are in French. The little jokes he throws in are awesome. This tome, at times, had me laughing, cringing, crying, and always wondering about the historic doctors and their sometime weird practices. The cases offer a wide variety of injuries and maladies; the causes of some of these will haunt me. I would definitely recommend this book to a friend."
263,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64537232-victor-carvalho,5,"This book by Darkside Books is one of the first three on the Macabra label, which is the partnership of the publisher with the website dedicated to the works of terror Macabra.tv.Here the author shows us medical reports from the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries that were published in medical magazines of the time or in books. The stories brought in this book are often absurd and quite shocking, but we have to see it from the perspective of the doctors that are shown there, who did not have the same knowledge, instruments, techniques or remedies that we have today. That is why these cases are as fascinating as they are absurd.It's a good tip for those who like crazy and medical stories."
264,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3417175-mentalexotica,2,"Some terrifically interesting if not incredible medical stories and anecdotes, but absolutely awful writing by Thomas Morris who fancies himself a witty man. The authour has ruined his own book by trying to be clever and failing as it were, miserably. The pages are littered with utterly pointless asides and ""ahems', ""deal with it"", ""oh wells"" - grow up, Thomas. Write like an adult FFS."
265,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3919719-stephanie,5,"What People Will Do to the Human Body Inspires Mind-Boggling Medical Historyhttp://fangswandsandfairydust.com/201...Bizarre doesn’t begin to describe the history of medicine. I voluntarily reviewed an advance readers copy of this book. No remuneration was exchanged and all opinions presented herein are my own except as noted. Thomas Morris’s THE MYSTERY OF THE EXPLODING TEETH is the perfect read for any doctor, or people who, like me, find medial procedures and history fascinating but have not studied medicine. With Audible, Audiobooks.com, Amazon, etc, you can still arrange for someone to receive this hilarious, and not seriously gross, volume in print, ebook, or audio for the doctor replaces your blood with port wine. mats by the big day! listened to this book over the course of about two days, but with its vignetted style, someone could easily dip in and out to of the book for several weeks while reading other books, The style also makes it good for when you only have short periods of time to concentrate, unless you are recovering form illness or surgery on anything other than your sense of humor.If the book focused more on salacious humor it would be less funny and informative. I felt a little guilty for laughing at the serious medical stories about which Morris writes — I sure those experiencing them did not find them at all amusing. Imagine, you’re a woman bleeding out after delivery and the doctor, after manually stopping the hemorrhage, replaces some of your blood with port wine! Okay, that would be funny even, perhaps, to the patient. Morris focused on human foibles and the meandering path medical science has followed; the “body humors,” poor anatomical understanding, lack of anesthesia, and more are explored. I am always amazed by what people can be convinced to swallow: needles, knives, heaven only knows what else, are swallowed and extracted by intrepid, bumbling or genius medical practitioners. How did our species ever survive the lack of medical knowledge and our own supreme idiocy. If you’re curious about the types of medical strangeness on which Morris writes check out his blog post about a waiter who swallowed spoons to amuse patrons: http://www.thomas-morris.uk/the-spoon....There is a bit of “Ripley’s Believe It or Not” in the author’s style, but seriously it is hard to believe anyone would want to swallow needles or stick other items into their own body. The narration is excellent and the two different narrators change it up, but it’s not because the material is too dry, rather it reflects the accents of the letter or article writer. I think both the author and Farley did very well, I especially like non-fiction to have author narration as their understanding of the subject often lends credibility to the ideas presented. I also enjoyed the usually well-done accents. While the history seems focused on British and American medicine, other countries medical oddities are considered as well. I enjoyed listening to the stories and my husband did as well, making it a good choice for road trips. Warning though, if you laugh too hard pull over! "
266,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35113927-spencer,4,"	I first saw this book featured at the Kinokuniya bookstore in Los Angeles. As I casually flipped through its pages, my eyes were drawn to case studies’ titles that included urination from the eyes, forks in the rectum, and human pincushions. These horrifying yet humorous passages were a good indicator for the read ahead; obviously educational and wildly hilarious. 	Medical historian Thomas Morris sifted through hundreds of years of medical texts in order to cull countless stories of medieval, colonial, and Victorian tales. He breaks them up into several chapters. I had two distinct issues with this book, as a whole: two of the chapters are especially dull to get through, and the book itself is very upsetting. Whilst I found a lot of the stories funny, or at least illuminating about how far we have come in the past five hundred years, there were a lot of times where I went fetal. Just today, in finishing this book, I came across a story that made me scream, “No,” a record twelve times. If you’re squeamish this is not the book for you. The dull chapters mostly dealt with surgery, which for a layman like me, became especially technical.	Overall, Morris is a thoroughly entertaining writer who added just the right amount of panache and self-reflection in order to properly bookend many of these stories. It must have been especially difficult to make sense of the countless uses of Old English and old-timey slang. Morris also makes it a point to always showcase the contemporary climate in which these occurrences took place, which helped contextualize a lot of the more confounding ideas and cures. "
267,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1094141-christina-tang-bernas,4,"I was walking by the ""New Books"" shelf in the local library and was arrested by the title of this book. I'm morbidly fascinated with weird medical/death/historical stuff, so I put aside the other books I was reading, checked it out, and finished it quite rapidly. I have a sense that Thomas Morris is an information hoarder like me, and he has put together a really fascinating overview of medicine and the attitudes both patients and doctors had about medicine especially before a lot of technology had been invented yet. A mix of scientific method, quackery, and guesswork fills these pages, and almost all of them were interesting to read. Mr. Morris is able to quickly relate the details of each case while keeping it interesting. He explains words that have fallen out of use or any complicated medical jargon, and he seems to have a good foundation in anatomy and medical science. Two things keep me from giving it 5 stars. One, sometimes his own personal comments, while mostly funny and wry, can sometimes veer towards unnecessary and/or too sarcastic/snarky. Some stories needed that extra personal commentary, but not all of them. Two, the book ends very abruptly. I thought there would be a concluding summary or interesting final observations by the author. But, I finished reading the last case, and it immediately jumped to the ""Sources"" page. It seems rather abrupt to me, kind of like a movie that just ends and there's no feeling of resolution. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed it. "
268,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20456668-diane-hernandez,4,"If there is a strange medical tale, it is recorded in the Mystery of the Exploding Teeth.With section titles like Unfortunate Predicaments, Mysterious Illnesses, and Horrifying Operations, how could this book be anything but a rollicking ride through the pages of bad choices. In Unfortunate Predicaments, we meet young men who did many ill-conceived things to their nether regions. We also meet a man who ate four knives on a dare and didn’t go to a doctor when only three came out his other end. A lifetime of doing this trick eventually killed him. In Mysterious Illnesses, a woman makes herself a human pin cushion and a boy vomits up his own twin. Horrifying Operations makes the reader impressed by the fortitude of his or her forebears. Before anesthesia, a man held up a candle for the surgeon while his other arm was being amputated at the shoulder. Another used a knitting needle and a tiny file three times daily for weeks to break up his bladder stone.Okay, you either like weird stuff like this or you don’t. As someone who used to gobble Ripley’s Believe It or Not books in my youth, I love it. If you do too, you’re in for a treat with the Mystery of the Exploding Teeth. 4 stars!Thanks to Dutton Books and NetGalley for a copy in exchange for an honest review."

Are you intrigued by gruesome medical history or just disturbing true stories? Well then, boy do I have the book for you! This book was fascinating. I'm not a big nonfiction fan. If I'm reading nonfiction it has to be something that really interest me or something absurd/weird/strange/gross. THIS BOOK WAS ALL OF THAT AND MORE! Plus as an added bonus the author is hilarious. The bits of humor he inserts within each medical story will have you shuddering with laughter and disgust. This book is a collection of old medical journal entries. Each one more terrifying than the last. If you don't cringe at least 25 times during this book....congratulations! but also, go check yourself into a hospital cause something is wrong with you. Tales of a woman peeing from every hole in her body, a man that chose his hand and a piece of wood over a woman, a man those swallowed knives as a party trick, and many many more. Oh! Don't forget the port wine enemas...oh no, we could never forget those! Each chapter tells a tale. They are pretty short but uber creepy/interesting.

If you to know the outlandish, the concerning, unlucky and sometimes foolish ways in which people managed to hurt themselves or get hurt, or the weird ailments they professed to have, this book has it all! Sometimes it brought about a mighty wince or two or a cringe of sympathy from the circumstances. The information is presented in very easily digestible terms that will not have you reaching for a medical dictionary: any foreign terms are described in the footnotes and there are several humorous asides by the author. My only qualm is that it ended very abruptly, but it was an entertaining enough read that I didn’t mind."
271,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19900248-sarah,4,"This book is not for the faint of heart! Many of the stories have gruesome details that make it difficult to read this book without cringing and making a horrified face throughout. One of my complaints is the personality of the author, which is inserted throughout and, in my opinion, makes too much light of serious, painful topics. For example, after one cringe-inducing case, he writes, “Once you’ve dried your tears of mirth, perhaps you’ll spare a thought for the poor fellow” (40). This and other similar sentences were rather off putting, but the book was still overall fascinating."

Ranging from unfortunate to downright gruesome, it paints a pretty vivid picture of a series of interesting wounds (some of them self-inflicted) and afflictions (ergot poisoning, anybody?) that we really don't get to see in 2020 Although, TBH, a scythe-related injury nowadays would at least give us a break from the common lawnmower-induced ones :)"

He is now a freelance writer and medical historian. His first book, The Matter of the Heart: A History of the Heart in Eleven Operations, wonthe Royal Society of Literature and the Jerwood Charitable Foundation award. The award is one of three annual awards, one of £10,000 and two of £5,000, offered to authors on their first works of non-fiction. Mr. Morris now lives in London.Who is the target audience?This book is for everyone 16 or older. The Mystery of the Exploding Teeth is written for the masses and not just for those who want to learn about historic medicine. The book is full of individual cases hand-picked through time to provide the reader with a glimpse of common medical procedures, some uncommon medical procedures, and allot of very interesting cases.SynopsisThe Mystery of the Exploding Teeth: And Other Curiosities from the History of Medicine, is a sojourn into some of the most interesting medical cases and the procedures used in those cases. It is told through the eyes of the people who were actually there. This book is a conglomeration of notes, letters, personal views of the doctors, and sometimes the patients. The author does a great job of finding the most interesting cases in history. There are some interesting cases that include various items escaping the bodies from all different places, some not very good places. How about the surgeries where the patient is not anesthetized and is an active participant? There is a chapter of patients who survived extreme injuries, some lived normal lives after their injuries.ConclusionAfter reading this book, I listened to the audible version and the narrator added so much more to the enjoyment. He does a great job with the inflection of his voice and the bits that are in French. The little jokes he throws in are awesome. This tome, at times, had me laughing, cringing, crying, and always wondering about the historic doctors and their sometime weird practices. The cases offer a wide variety of injuries and maladies; the causes of some of these will haunt me. I would definitely recommend this book to a friend."

The stories brought in this book are often absurd and quite shocking, but we have to see it from the perspective of the doctors that are shown there, who did not have the same knowledge, instruments, techniques or remedies that we have today. That is why these cases are as fascinating as they are absurd.It's a good tip for those who like crazy and medical stories."
294,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3417175-mentalexotica,2,"Some terrifically interesting if not incredible medical stories and anecdotes, but absolutely awful writing by Thomas Morris who fancies himself a witty man. The authour has ruined his own book by trying to be clever and failing as it were, miserably. The pages are littered with utterly pointless asides and ""ahems', ""deal with it"", ""oh wells"" - grow up, Thomas. Write like an adult FFS."

I voluntarily reviewed an advance readers copy of this book. No remuneration was exchanged and all opinions presented herein are my own except as noted. Thomas Morris’s THE MYSTERY OF THE EXPLODING TEETH is the perfect read for any doctor, or people who, like me, find medial procedures and history fascinating but have not studied medicine. With Audible, Audiobooks.com, Amazon, etc, you can still arrange for someone to receive this hilarious, and not seriously gross, volume in print, ebook, or audio for the doctor replaces your blood with port wine. mats by the big day! listened to this book over the course of about two days, but with its vignetted style, someone could easily dip in and out to of the book for several weeks while reading other books, The style also makes it good for when you only have short periods of time to concentrate, unless you are recovering form illness or surgery on anything other than your sense of humor.If the book focused more on salacious humor it would be less funny and informative. I felt a little guilty for laughing at the serious medical stories about which Morris writes — I sure those experiencing them did not find them at all amusing. Imagine, you’re a woman bleeding out after delivery and the doctor, after manually stopping the hemorrhage, replaces some of your blood with port wine! Okay, that would be funny even, perhaps, to the patient. Morris focused on human foibles and the meandering path medical science has followed; the “body humors,” poor anatomical understanding, lack of anesthesia, and more are explored. I am always amazed by what people can be convinced to swallow: needles, knives, heaven only knows what else, are swallowed and extracted by intrepid, bumbling or genius medical practitioners. How did our species ever survive the lack of medical knowledge and our own supreme idiocy. If you’re curious about the types of medical strangeness on which Morris writes check out his blog post about a waiter who swallowed spoons to amuse patrons: http://www.thomas-morris.uk/the-spoon....There is a bit of “Ripley’s Believe It or Not” in the author’s style, but seriously it is hard to believe anyone would want to swallow needles or stick other items into their own body. The narration is excellent and the two different narrators change it up, but it’s not because the material is too dry, rather it reflects the accents of the letter or article writer. I think both the author and Farley did very well, I especially like non-fiction to have author narration as their understanding of the subject often lends credibility to the ideas presented. I also enjoyed the usually well-done accents. While the history seems focused on British and American medicine, other countries medical oddities are considered as well. I enjoyed listening to the stories and my husband did as well, making it a good choice for road trips. Warning though, if you laugh too hard pull over! "
296,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35113927-spencer,4,"	I first saw this book featured at the Kinokuniya bookstore in Los Angeles. As I casually flipped through its pages, my eyes were drawn to case studies’ titles that included urination from the eyes, forks in the rectum, and human pincushions. These horrifying yet humorous passages were a good indicator for the read ahead; obviously educational and wildly hilarious. 	Medical historian Thomas Morris sifted through hundreds of years of medical texts in order to cull countless stories of medieval, colonial, and Victorian tales. He breaks them up into several chapters. I had two distinct issues with this book, as a whole: two of the chapters are especially dull to get through, and the book itself is very upsetting. Whilst I found a lot of the stories funny, or at least illuminating about how far we have come in the past five hundred years, there were a lot of times where I went fetal. Just today, in finishing this book, I came across a story that made me scream, “No,” a record twelve times. If you’re squeamish this is not the book for you. The dull chapters mostly dealt with surgery, which for a layman like me, became especially technical.	Overall, Morris is a thoroughly entertaining writer who added just the right amount of panache and self-reflection in order to properly bookend many of these stories. It must have been especially difficult to make sense of the countless uses of Old English and old-timey slang. Morris also makes it a point to always showcase the contemporary climate in which these occurrences took place, which helped contextualize a lot of the more confounding ideas and cures. "
297,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1094141-christina-tang-bernas,4,"I was walking by the ""New Books"" shelf in the local library and was arrested by the title of this book. I'm morbidly fascinated with weird medical/death/historical stuff, so I put aside the other books I was reading, checked it out, and finished it quite rapidly. I have a sense that Thomas Morris is an information hoarder like me, and he has put together a really fascinating overview of medicine and the attitudes both patients and doctors had about medicine especially before a lot of technology had been invented yet. A mix of scientific method, quackery, and guesswork fills these pages, and almost all of them were interesting to read. Mr. Morris is able to quickly relate the details of each case while keeping it interesting. He explains words that have fallen out of use or any complicated medical jargon, and he seems to have a good foundation in anatomy and medical science. Two things keep me from giving it 5 stars. One, sometimes his own personal comments, while mostly funny and wry, can sometimes veer towards unnecessary and/or too sarcastic/snarky. Some stories needed that extra personal commentary, but not all of them. Two, the book ends very abruptly. I thought there would be a concluding summary or interesting final observations by the author. But, I finished reading the last case, and it immediately jumped to the ""Sources"" page. It seems rather abrupt to me, kind of like a movie that just ends and there's no feeling of resolution. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed it. "
298,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20456668-diane-hernandez,4,"If there is a strange medical tale, it is recorded in the Mystery of the Exploding Teeth.With section titles like Unfortunate Predicaments, Mysterious Illnesses, and Horrifying Operations, how could this book be anything but a rollicking ride through the pages of bad choices. In Unfortunate Predicaments, we meet young men who did many ill-conceived things to their nether regions. We also meet a man who ate four knives on a dare and didn’t go to a doctor when only three came out his other end. A lifetime of doing this trick eventually killed him. In Mysterious Illnesses, a woman makes herself a human pin cushion and a boy vomits up his own twin. Horrifying Operations makes the reader impressed by the fortitude of his or her forebears. Before anesthesia, a man held up a candle for the surgeon while his other arm was being amputated at the shoulder. Another used a knitting needle and a tiny file three times daily for weeks to break up his bladder stone.Okay, you either like weird stuff like this or you don’t. As someone who used to gobble Ripley’s Believe It or Not books in my youth, I love it. If you do too, you’re in for a treat with the Mystery of the Exploding Teeth. 4 stars!Thanks to Dutton Books and NetGalley for a copy in exchange for an honest review."
299,0593080327,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64277245-becky,4,"I got this book on netgalley in exchange for my honest opinion.THIS BOOK IS NUTS! Are you intrigued by gruesome medical history or just disturbing true stories? Well then, boy do I have the book for you! This book was fascinating. I'm not a big nonfiction fan. If I'm reading nonfiction it has to be something that really interest me or something absurd/weird/strange/gross. THIS BOOK WAS ALL OF THAT AND MORE! Plus as an added bonus the author is hilarious. The bits of humor he inserts within each medical story will have you shuddering with laughter and disgust. This book is a collection of old medical journal entries. Each one more terrifying than the last. If you don't cringe at least 25 times during this book....congratulations! but also, go check yourself into a hospital cause something is wrong with you. Tales of a woman peeing from every hole in her body, a man that chose his hand and a piece of wood over a woman, a man those swallowed knives as a party trick, and many many more. Oh! Don't forget the port wine enemas...oh no, we could never forget those! Each chapter tells a tale. They are pretty short but uber creepy/interesting. Just go get the book you'll regret it and love it all at once. You're welcome."
