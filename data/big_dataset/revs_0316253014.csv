0,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5881217-ricardo-is-reading,5,"Depending on your outlook on things, this book will either make you feel like you have lived a vastly underwhelming and underachieving sort of life, full of these lost opportunities, these missed chances... or it will make you feel infinitely inspired, like you can live more and do more just be more in general, and it will serve as fuel to your rocket, to use a hackneyed analogy.Being what I think of as a jaded sort of optimist, I'm somewhere in-between.But Col. Hadfield is definitely leaning heavily towards the inspiring part, and does so with admirable grace and aplomb.So, really, this is a book about life in general. It follows Chris Hadfield's career as an astronaut, but you can tell that if he never made that particular goal — if instead he stayed on as a skiing instructor, or became an airline pilot, or Something Else Entirely — he would have still written the same kind of book. And that's what makes it special, I think. It is about the life of an astronaut, yes, but the emphasis is very much on life.The book's central message can be found in this answer Chris Hadfield gave during his Ask Me Anything session on the website Reddit :Decide in your heart of hearts what really excites and challenges you, and start moving your life in that direction. Every decision you make, from what you eat to what you do with your time tonight, turns you into who you are tomorrow, and the day after that. Look at who you want to be, and start sculpting yourself into that person. You may not get exactly where you thought you’d be, but you will be doing things that suit you in a profession you believe in. Don’t let life randomly kick you into the adult you don’t want to become.Really, the book stems off from there. But one of the things I appreciate about it is that, while it is encouraging and urging you forward, it doesn't sugar-coat things at all. It tells you, straight on, that life is this hard thing. But it also tells you that the fact that it's hard is what makes it, ultimately, beautiful and fulfilling and so very, very worth it. And, despite all of my cynical posturings, that is a message I can get definitely get behind."
1,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"Update There is a PBS documentary, premiered March 2nd, A Year in Space about Scott Kelly's marathon space adventure which just ended. If you have read this book, you will enjoy the film immensely. So many explained in the book, are shown in the film. From the first where you see the three astronauts crammed into the rocket, you understand where each of them is sitting, why you can hear Russian and why it is a Soyuz space ship. And so it goes on. It is wonderful to see all the concepts and technology in the book in action in the film. Unmissable. (I don't think it would work the other way round so much, see the film, read the book)._____________America is a meritocracy. Anything that can be seen as helpful or inspirational and so aiding the climb upwards usually is. So I understand why people think it is a self-help book. But it really isn't. What it is, is the extremely detailed memoir of a very genial man who loves to educate people as much as he likes to do things himself. This education is not in the form of ""do this like I did and you will be a more successful person,"" but more ""this is how I became an astronaut and this is how astronauts approach their work. We know most of us will work on Earth and never make it to the ISS, but being an astronaut is a team effort and we are major players in that team.""Since the space shuttle got retired the only way to the ISS is via the Soyuz spacecraft. These are extremely small so that all the really big astronauts immediately had their chances of getting into space dropped to nil. But it also begs the question, why aren't there more, many more, female astronauts? Women are smaller and lighter and consume less resources, whether air, water or food. No physical strength is required in space and the training on Earth is obviously quite achievable for women as there are female astronauts. Why aren't there more? Misogyny? This is a man's job but hey this is the modern world so we'll let 'em up every now and again? I don't know.One of the great strengths of the book is the author himself who is an immensely likeable man with an attitude that everything is a learning experience. This again is not self-help, it's because every single thing that happens in space has to be dealt with with only the resources and training of the men aboard. There is a thick manual going back to the 60s where every problem that has been encountered has it's solution written down step-by-step for the astronauts to follow. So when they encounter a new problem, they need to think of the future and how their experience could help future astronauts deal with a similar situation.The day-to-day life on a space station is quite often funny. I knew they slept in hanging sleeping bags but I didn't know their arms were free and as they slept their arms would drift up and wave around, along with their hair. Ball games, for recreational time, were played with large globules of water or other fluids. Garbage disposal is by sending everything back in the small supply rockets that are sent up to them. These little ships burn out before ever reaching Earth. Getting back to Earth is a wild 3 1/2 hour tumble that ends with a big bump.I would suggest viewing the author's video of himself singing Bowie's Space Oddity and floating in the ISS to get a really good idea of just who the author is - a really great guy."
2,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14457130-whitney-atkinson,4,"I started this book just because I needed an audiobook to listen to as I got ready in the morning and drove to work, and this one was available. For backstory, I’m obsessed with NASA’s youtube channel. If you haven’t watched their videos about how astronauts live in space—showering, eating, sleeping, etc.—I highly recommend you do so, because it’s SO fascinating!! Particularly, one of the most common faces on those videos is Chris Hadfield, whose name I knew because of the channel and subsequently made me want to pick up his book!The word “guide” in the title of this book was a bit misleading, because it was actually almost a story of Chris’s journey to outer space and back. There was advice sprinkled throughout, but it was really from his standpoint as an astronaut rather than telling the reader how to live their life on Earth. Nevertheless, it read as a great memoir.I think this book was so fascinating. I listened to 7 out of 8 hours of it in one sitting. Chris narrates the audiobook, and he made his book sound like a story he was telling to a friend, riddled with emotional moments, as well as funny ones. This book perfectly captures the grandeur of being in space—a place where so few people have been—but then being able to relate the experience to things the readers may understand. I was excited he talked about filming videos aboard the ISS and how he went viral, because I recognized several of the videos he’d talked about that I’ve already seen myself. This book was everything I wanted that wasn’t just a restatement of what I’ve seen in those videos.The most stand-out part of this is a section where he talks about managing fear. Backstory: outer space is my most irrational, illogical fear. I’m never going to be required to go there, nor do I intend to ever pursue a career in the sky, but for some reason, even looking up into the sky for too long and thinking about going to space or watching a movie about space travel gives me anxiety. It just sounds like a horrifying, dangerous experience that I would never volunteer for. Chris talks about how one of his most frequently asked questions is “How do you manage with fear?” and questions relating to his nerves about going to space and managing crises. His response to this and the way that he discusses managing fears and being prepared and maintaining a healthy level of pessimism while still pursuing the best outcome was actually touching. It was interesting to hear about how he manages the mental and physical strains of being in space, and even though I’m never going to be in his situation and that’s why this book was such an eye-opening book for me, it still gave me a lot to take away as far as getting along with people in a team and how to be a strong, reliable leader.I hate sci-fi and science, so I was pleased that this didn’t linger too much on those fronts at all. There was a lot of explanation of the crafts and procedures they do while on board, but it was actually fascinating rather than laborious to read about. It’ll especially be cool to think about in 50 years when technology has far surpassed what he describes in this book.If you’re looking to get into a memoir that explores the life of someone extraordinary who does extraordinary things yet still stays humble and true in his account of it, I highly recommend this. It was fantastically narrated and will definitely be a read I ponder for months and maybe even years to come. (But even if you don’t read it, I do recommend looking up those NASA videos on youtube and seeing how people do things in zero gravity. It’s my fascination even though the prospect of being in their shoes terrifies me.)"
3,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"The final review is under the audio book. It was narrated brilliantly by the author, full of warmth, full of humour, full of wanting to share with us all. Finished. Proper review to come. Five stars and no it's not a self-help inspirational book. Far from it as his mantra is Sweat the Small Stuff and we can't do that in real life unless we have OCD.Update I've just read the most amazing thing. That it only takes 6 hours to get to the ISS. That's faster than getting from London to NY. Today I listened to the BBC abridged version of this book. It was so brilliant I didn't think I'd be able to wait for the hardback to come so I downloaded it. I have hardly done anything else since. I've just been out, to a beach club with some local music and changed my mind to come home and listen to it."
4,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,5,"Most of us nerds got a good idea of who Chris Hadfield is from his youtube videos last year filmed on the International Space Station. For the last few years the Mars rovers have been the sexy at NASA with the demise of the shuttle, the hitchhiking on Russian craft, oh and that psycho cross-country drive diaper caper really doing a number on NASA astronaut public image. But then Chris Hadfield and mustache came along and fixed it all up again. After a gap of 20 or so years I find myself wanting to be an astronaut when I grow up again.So I approached this book with some delight, expecting some fun stories from his time in space; how they go to the toilet etc. Which is what you get, to some degree, but you get so much more. The same man who has enough passion to make those videos and promote space exploration so well in that medium can also write a hugely inspiring, humble and insightful work on his life, his philosophies and the universe.Dotted between the stories of Chris' years working at NASA are wonderful insights into behavior such as how to take criticism, how to learn not to worry and plan instead, how to constructively think negatively, how to keep yourself inspired and set and achieve goals. And most importantly how not to be an asshole while doing it. These lessons meant more to me than other 'life lessons' that you see in the bookstores under self-help or inspiration. This advise made more practical sense than any quote I have seen attributed to the Dalai Lama or some such. But I don't think this type of inspiration is for everyone. I think it will be most applicable to the engineering/scientist type mindset, just like Chris himself.So this book comes most highly recommended. I felt at times that I was right alongside Chris in parts of his journey and I listened intently to his wisdom on how to be a person with integrity, humility, determination and a sense of humour."
5,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3667656-darcy-mclaughlin,4,"As a Canadian I am horribly biased towards Chris Hadfield and pretty much anything he does. I was completely captured by his photos from space on Twitter, his videos about life on the International Space Station, and his uncanny ability to make space travel cool again. Once I found out he was publishing a book, I knew I would have to read it, and I assumed I would enjoy it as much as I have his other exploits.What truly surprised me is the aspect I loved most about this book had nothing to do with space travel. Sure Hadfield writes about some exciting moments; like scary incidents while spacewalking and tumultuous landings, but the real draw for me was his personal observations as to what made him a good astronaut, and essentially a successful person. He explains so many intriguing approaches to every day life, things that make you reconsider the way you do your own job or interact with others. It's all presented in his fairly matter of fact prose. There's always a slightly technical feel to the way Chris writes, but some sections like the opening chapter are beautifully written. His description of the views from space are almost poetic, indicating that his skills surpass the realm of science and qualify him as a true author. This book isn't a lengthy read, nor a hard one. It's extremely enjoyable and features valuable life lessons along with a very unique perspective. I don't often use this term but Chris Hadfield is certainly a hero to myself, a person who exemplifies positive change in the world around him and encourages others to pursue their dreams. For me, this book is just a further confirmation of that belief."
6,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45248887-greta-g,5," Warning: Spoiler-ish summary!
Getting ready to play “Rocket Man”. Just in case.
“If the only thing you really enjoyed was whipping around Earth in a spaceship, you’d hate being an astronaut.”Instead, you sit in a classroom studying orbital mechanics. In Russian. You practice tricky, repetitive tasks as well as highly challenging ones to the point of exhaustion, and you’re away from home more than half the time. An astronaut is a perpetual student. There’s no such thing as over-preparation ; it’s your best chance of improving your odds. ”I was learning so much every day that I could almost hear my neurons firing.”Trainers in the space program specialize in devising bad-news scenarios for astronauts to act out, over and over again, in increasingly elaborate simulations. While play-acting grim scenarios day in and day out may sound like a good recipe for clinical depression, it actually pushes astronauts to develop a new set of instincts: instead of reacting to danger with a fight-or-flight adrenaline rush, they’re trained to respond unemotionally by immediately prioritizing threats and methodically seeking to defuse them. ”Rehearsing for catastrophe has made me positive that I have the problem-solving skills to deal with tough situations and come out the other side smiling.”At Nasa, everyone is a critic. Astronauts are not just expected to respond positively to criticism, but to go one step further and draw attention to their missteps and miscalculations. It’s not easy for hyper-competitive people to talk openly about screw-ups that make them look foolish or incompetent. Management has to create a climate where owning up to mistakes is permissible and colleagues have to agree, collectively, to cut each other some slack. For an astronaut, depersonalising criticism is a basic survival skill. When astronauts are killed on the job, the reason is almost always an overlooked detail that seemed unimportant at the time.“Early success is a terrible teacher. You’re essentially being rewarded for a lack of preparation, so when you find yourself in a situation where you must prepare, you can’t do it. You don’t know how.”The environment is also highly competitive, without the competition ever being explicitly acknowledged. Astronaut Candidates (ASCANs, pronounced exactly as you might imagine) are being evaluated and compared on everything they do - everything - and space flight assignments are based on how well they perform. So the demands are bottomless.‘Who are you flying with?’ is the first question astronauts ask each other. Sometimes integration is not so easy, because astronauts don’t get to pick their fellow travelers. No one wants to go to space with a jerk. But at some point, they just have to accept the people in their crew, stop wishing they were flying with Neil Armstrong, and start figuring out how their crewmates’ strengths and weaknesses mesh with their own. ”You can’t change the bricks, and together, you still have to build a wall.”The longer the flight, the more important personalities become. When you can’t even go outside to let off steam, personality conflicts can compromise a mission or derail it altogether. NASA looks for a certain type of person, someone who plays well with others, and who can be locked in a tin can for six months and excel, so temperament alone could disqualify you for space flight. “A certain personality type that was perfectly acceptable, even stereotypical, in the past - the real hard-ass, say - is not wanted on the voyage when it is going to be a long one.Astronauts are, without exception, extremely competitive. So how do you take a group of hyper-competitive people and get them to hyper-cooperate, to the point where they seek opportunities to help one another shine? ... For some astronauts, the transition is relatively painless - a relief, even, after decades of solitary striving. For others, it’s a huge shock to the system and requires a fundamental reorientation.Astronauts do survival training, on water and on land. They learn to think of success as a team sport. It takes a few years to instill the ability to work in a team productively and cheerfully in tough conditions into wildly competitive people. Survival training simulates some aspects of space travel really well. In both cases, a small group of people is thrown into a challenging environment with specific objectives to accomplish and no one else to rely on except each other. Good leadership means leading the way, not hectoring other people to do things your way. Bullying, bickering and competing for dominance are, even in a low-risk situation, excellent ways to destroy morale and diminish productivity. ...Groupthink is a good thing when it comes to risks. If you’re only thinking about yourself, you can’t see the whole picture.“For me, the takeaway from all my survival training is that the key question to ask when you’re part of a team, whether on Earth or in Space, is, ‘How can I help us get where we need to go?’ You don’t need to be a superhero. Empathy and a sense of humor are often more important ...” Searching for ways to lighten the mood is never a waste of time. 
Time to go out, Rocket Man.
Not so fast. On orbit, even a head cold is a big deal. Without gravity, your sinuses don’t clear and your immune system doesn’t fight back as effectively, so you feel much sicker, much longer - and in such a confined space, it’s pretty much guaranteed that the rest of the crew will be infected.In the 1960s, astronauts frequently launched in apparently perfect health, but then, a day or so into the mission, a virus would make its presence known. But not until 1970 did NASA decide it might be a good idea to isolate crews pre-flight.“Time-honored astronaut traditions make us feel we’re part of the tribe , and there were plenty of them during our final hours in quarantine. Some were less picturesque than others. The night before we launched, we gave ourselves an enema, followed , after a suitable interval, by another one. While this did not feel like my finest hour in space exploration, it was definitely preferable to soiling my diaper the next day. Afterward, a doctor took swabs of all parts of my body - behind my ears, my tongue, my crotch - to see if I had any infections, then rubbed me down with alcohol just in case I did.”These days, the purpose of quarantine is as much psychological as it is medical: an enforced time-out ensures the astronauts transition to a new kind of existence and go into a high-pressure situation feeling calm and fully prepared.Some version of the Soyuz has been flying for more than 45 years. As rocket ships go, it’s one of the most reliable and durable in the world, and can safely launch in just about any weather. Fifty percent of the risk of a catastrophic failure during a long-duration space mission occurs in the first 10 minutes after liftoff.“The Soyuz is so small that it makes the Shuttle seem almost cavernous. A Dodge Caravan has about 163 cubic feet of space; the Soyuz has 265 cubic feet of living space - theoretically. In reality, a lot of that space is taken up by cargo and gear that’s been lashed down and secured for launch. In any event, it’s not a lot of space for three full-grown adults to share for a few days. But during launch, we even have less elbow room because we are confined to the re-entry module, which is also the only part of the Soyuz that survives the return to Earth. On our way home we jettison the other two: the service module, which houses the instruments and engines, and the orbital module, which provides additional living space once we are on orbit.”Unlike the Shuttle, which was powered by fuel cells, the Soyuz is solar-powered; to keep its solar arrays pointed at the sun, the vehicle spins like a chicken on a rotisserie barbecue. Outside the window, then, what you see is Earth, tumbling over and over, which is hard to look at when your stomach is unsettled.“And as my vestibular system adapted during our day of downtime, I started to be able to look out the window for longer and longer periods of time. The world was rolling by underneath, every place I’d read about or dreamed of visiting streaming past. There was the Sahara, there was Lake Victoria and the Nile, snaking all the way up to the Mediterranean. Explorers gave their lives trying to find the source of the Nile, but I could detect it with a casual glance, no effort at all.”Opening the hatch always takes longer than anyone would want, because first the crew has to ascertain that the impact of docking hadn’t damaged the Soyuz. It bumps into the Station with reasonable force and speed; they need to check all the seals to ensure there isn’t a slow leak. Only when we knew the vehicle was intact could we change out of our Sokhols and into regular blue spacesuits, which, like all Russian space clothing, have straps that go under your feet to pull the pant legs down. That’s helpful in zero gravity, where there’s nothing to prevent the hem of your pants from migrating well north of your ankle.”The ISS is a one-million-pound spaceship that’s the size of a football field, including the end zones, and boasts a full acre of solar panels. It’s so big, with so many discrete modules, that it’s possible to go nearly a full day without seeing another crewmate. It’s an awe-inspiring international project, this mammoth co-op in the sky. Now a huge, humming, functioning laboratory, the ISS is anything but open-concept; it’s not possible to take in the whole interior at a glance. The main structure is a long series of connected cylinders and spheres, only they’re square inside, not circular. At certain angles, it’s possible to see clear from one end to the other, but poking out along the length of it, like branches on a massive tree, are three Russian modules and three American ones, along with a European and a Japanese module.The Cupola, an observatory module built by the European Space Agency, had been installed on the Station. It is a thing of beauty, a 360-degree dome of windows on the world. There are trapezoidal windows on all six sides and, on top, directly facing Earth, a round, 31-inch window, the largest ever on a spaceship. It’s the ultimate room with a view, but highly functional, too: its command and control workstations enable astronauts to guide operations outside the Station, including controlling the robotic arm.There’s a lot of adhesive in there because the walls are just about completely covered with Velcro. In space, if you don’t hang on to them, things like spoons, pencils, scissors and test tubes simply drift away, only to turn up a week later, clinging to the filter covering an air intake duct. That’s why there’s Velcro on the back of just about every imaginable item: so it will stay put on a Velcro wall.It’s noisy like a hospital, too. Without gravity, heat doesn’t rise, so air doesn’t mix and move; the fans and pumps that are necessary for comfort and survival whir, clunk and hum, a continuous blur of sound that’s occasionally punctuated by the loud ping or bang of a micrometeorite hitting the Station.In zero gravity, there’s no need for a mattress or pillow; you already feel like you’re resting on a cloud, perfectly supported, so there’s no tossing and turning to find a more comfortable position. Once in my pajamas (Russian-made, long john-esque) I zipped myself into my hooded sleeping bag, which resembles a cocoon with armholes. From my Shuttle days, I knew that a dormant astronaut is an interesting sight, with both arms floating in front Frankenstein-style, hair fanned out like a mane and a facial expression of utter contentment. Turning off my little light, I was perfectly at ease in this otherworldly place, knowing that in Houston and Korolev, people in Mission Control were keeping watch as we spun through the sky and into sleep, on our journey around and around the world.”The absence of gravity alters the texture of daily life because it affects almost everything the crew does. Toothbrushing, for instance: you need to swallow the toothpaste. Hand washing requires a bag of water that has already been mixed with a bit of no-rinse soap. Long, hot showers are out, obviously. You just do a wipe-down with a clammy cloth. Hair washing involves scrubbing your scalp vigorously with no-rinse shampoo, then drying off carefully to be sure stray wet hairs don’t wind up floating all over the spacecraft and clogging up air filters or getting in people’s eyes and noses.There’s no such thing as no-rinse laundry soap, so cleaning of clothes is impossible. Instead, the crew just wears them over and over, until they wear out. Preparing meals is not laborious on a space station. All liquids, including coffee and tea, come in pouches; most are powdered, and you simply add water, then sip through a straw. The majority of the food on board is dehydrated, so again, you just inject hot or cold water directly into the packages using a kind of needle, then cut open the packages and dig in. There’s a lot of sticky stuff like oatmeal, pudding and cooked spinach, because it clumps and is therefore easier to trap on a spoon and get into your mouth without having to chase it all over the place.“Many astronauts, myself included, crave spicy foods after a while, because the congestion that comes with weightlessness means that things taste pretty much the way they do when you have a head cold. Everything is just a bit more bland.”Exercise is mandatory during a long-duration flight. Astronauts have to work out two hours a day to keep their muscles and bones strong enough to handle the extreme physical demands of spacewalking and also to ensure them when they get back to Earth, they are still able to stand on their own two feet. Getting exercise isn’t all that easy in an environment where movement is so easy, though. It requires special equipment: a stationary bike the astronauts clip their shoes into so they don’t float away, and a treadmill with a harness contraption that pulls them down so they run on the moving track rather than through thin air.“We also have to be careful about perspiration. When there’s no force pulling sweat downward, it just accumulates on your body like a slowly expanding liquid shield. If you turn your head quickly, that huge, wet glob of sweat might dislodge, sail across the module and smack an unsuspecting crewmate in the face. Proper etiquette on the ISS is to have a towel tucked into your clothes or floating beside you while you work out, to soak up your sweat. Later, you hang the towel on a clip so the moisture is absorbed back into the air and, along with urine, can be recycled as water. Yes, water. Drinking water, actually. Until 2010, water on the ISS came in large, lined duffel bags delivered by the Shuttle or resupply vehicles, but now an onboard purification system helps us reclaim about 1,600 gallons a year.”In space, things happen to your body that may or may not be bad for your long-term health. So far, there’s no evidence that astronauts have a significantly increased risk of cancer or cataracts, but they do absorb more radiation than they would at sea level, and it’s worth figuring out what to do about that.Other anatomical changes associated with long-duration space flight are definitely negative: the immune system weakens, the heart shrinks because it doesn’t have to strain against gravity, eyesight tends to degrade, sometimes markedly (no one’s exactly sure why yet). The spine lengthens as the little sacs of fluid between the vertebrae expand, and bone mass decreases as the body sheds calcium. Without gravity, you don’t need muscle and bone mass to support your own weight, which is what makes life in space so much fun but also so inherently bad for the human body, long-term.About half of the scientific experiments the crew does is related to investigating what is happening to their own bodies in space.“A lot of times the work isn’t glamorous, but that’s okay. The workplace itself is, after all, in a pretty great location.”Undocking is a peaceful contrast to the fiery pageantry of launch. It takes about three minutes for the giant hooks and catches to release. Gradually, little springs push the Soyuz away and it drifts off. At first, they travel slowly, but after three minutes, the engines are fired and they start to pick up speed. They need to get a safe distance from the ISS before lighting the engines again, or the exhaust and spattering of waste fuel would batter her big solar arrays. This puts them on a slightly different trajectory than the ISS as they orbit the Earth. After about two and a half hours it’s time: they turn the ship tail-first and set up for deorbit burn. There’s a critical moment during the burn when there’s no turning back; they’ve decelerated so much that they’re committed to falling into the atmosphere. What follows is a wild 54-minute tumble to Earth that feels more or less like 15 explosions followed by a car crash.”“We try to catch our breath, weak after the multi-axis disorienting tumble, the wildest of amusement park rides. To complete the effect, our seats suddenly slam upward, rising automatically to the top level of their shock absorbers to cushion us from the brunt of what’s about to happen. The crush of acceleration helps us tighten our straps. We know the moment of impact will be bad; the seats’liners were custom-built to mold to our bodies so that our backs don’t break. Just before impact no one says anything ... We’re all clenching our teeth, lightly, so we don’t bite through our tongues.”They’re back on Earth, at last. A normal landing, right on target. “I’m smiling, doing my best to impersonate a person who doesn’t feel disoriented and sick. But my arms feel so heavy I can barely lift them, and I stay motionless, to reduce exertion. Every part of my body feels sore or shocked, or both. It’s like being a newborn, this sudden sensory overload of noise, color, smells and gravity after months of quietly floating, encased in relative calm and isolation. No wonder babies cry in protest when they’re born.”In fact, it isn’t over: every flight is followed by months of rehabilitation, medical testing and exhaustive debriefing with everyone from the top administration at NASA to the people who resupply the ISS.“After the empowering environment of space, where I could move a refrigerator with one fingertip, it seemed... well, unfair. Despite exercising two hours a day on the ISS, I was, back on Earth, a weakling. A lot of what happens to the human body in space is really similar to what happens during the aging process. In post-flight quarantine, in fact, Tom and I tottered around like two old duffers, getting a preview of what life might be like if we made it to 90. Our blood vessels had hardened; our cardiovascular systems had changed. We had shed calcium and minerals in space, so our bones were weaker; so were our muscles, because for 22 hours a day, they’d encountered no resistance whatsoever.”Endings don’t have to be emotionally wrenching if you believe you did a good job and you’re prepared to let go. I view my retirement the same way. I did the best I could and I served my purpose, but the time has come to move on. One of the most important lessons I’ve learned as an astronaut is to value the wisdom of humility, as well as the sense of perspective it gives you."
7,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4183205-josephine,4,"Something frustrating happened at work the other — a “something” that continually resurfaces again and again and again. And, predictably, the few of us who were stuck working last week, did what we always do: we griped bitterly, stirring ourselves up in the same old fit of resentment and anger.When that started happening, I found myself thinking about something I’d read in Chris Hadfield’s memoir, “An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth,” where he wrote about his father:""…he also disapproved of whining because he understood that it is contagious and destructive. Comparing notes on how unfair or difficult or ridiculous something is does promote bonding – and sometimes that’s why griping continues, because it’s reinforcing an us-against-the-world feeling. Very quickly, though, the warmth of unity morphs to the sourness of resentment which makes hardships seem even more intolerable and doesn’t help get the job done. Whining is the antithesis of expeditionary behaviour, which is all about rallying the troops around a common goal."" (p.151)Actually, there were a lot of things from Hadfield’s memoir that stuck with me — particularly when it came to work.I don’t think that what I’ve experienced is anything new; there are scores of others who likely experience the same problem every day: working on a team where not everybody pulls their weight and you’re stuck being viewed as an equal to someone who continually slacks off and takes the credit for things you may have had to help them out with.Recently, there were two of us who were asked to help a teammate out, but it became quickly clear that we were essentially doing the work for this person — and it was difficult to stem the rising tide of resentment that was building up.And, here, I thought about what Hadfield wrote:""It’s not enough to shelve your own competitive streak. You have to try, consciously, to help others succeed. Some people feel this is like shooting themselves in the foot – why aid someone else in creating a competitive advantage? I don’t look at it that way. Helping someone else look good doesn’t make me look worse. In fact, it often improves my own performance, particularly in stressful situations."" (p.159-160)""It’s counterintuitive, but I think it’s true: promoting your colleagues’ interests helps you stay competitive, even in a field where everyone is top-notch. And it’s easy to do once you understand that you have a vested interest in your co-workers’ success. In a crisis, you want them to want to help you survive and succeed, too. They may be the only people in the world who can."" (p.162)The fact that I’ve highlighted a lot of passages in Hadfield’s book — and taken the time to type them out here — says a lot about what I thought about his memoir.What’s funny is that I’ve read a lot of self-help books (hasn’t everyone?) and none of them really provided the kind of practical words of wisdom that I could actually swallow and try to live by. Instead, you have Hadfield who was basically saying the opposite of what so many self-help authors had advised: yes, you should sweat the small stuff and yes, you should anticipate the worst.He writes:""It’s puzzling to me that so many self-help gurus urge people to visualize victory, and stop there. Some even insist that if you wish for good things long enough and hard enough, you’ll get them – and, conversely, that if you focus on the negative, you actually invite bad things to happen. Why make yourself miserable worrying? Why waste time getting ready for disasters that may never happen?Anticipating problems and figuring out how to solve them is actually the opposite of worrying: it’s productive. Likewise, coming up with a plan of action isn’t a waste of time if it gives you peace of mind. While it’s true that you may wind up being ready for something that never happens, if the stakes are at all high, it’s worth it."" (p.100)Reading “An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth” is time well spent.Hadfield is inspiring in the best way possible: he sets an example."

Like everyone else I ended up adoring the man, but he sure is a preacher, and the book is plump with sermons about being humble, being kind to one's fellow men, the goodness of practice, practice, practice, the importance of being a team player, and loving your family.... All this preaching though is underpinned with solid of examples of Hadfield being an absolutely sterling human being , including having a sense of humour about his tendency to pontificate.I read the book like a snail reading about a ferret. This man is not of my ilk. I love books that do this for me - showing me a character that is completely alien to me. Hadfield, for all his modesty, is a superhero. I learned that to become an astronaut one has to be a super-champion. Hadfield was an incredibly successful fighter pilot and then test pilot, with a degree in mathematical engineering, before being considered for astronaut training. It is not a job passed casually on to people with bulging muscles who like aeroplanes and the thought of walking in space.There is a lot of rocket talk, and talk about what it is like to live without gravity on a space station. If this is your thing you will enjoy these descriptions enormously. They are not my thing, even so Hadfield is jolly writer and I was pulled along at a clipping pace. Even better, he made various videos whilst up on the space station, and this one became a blockbuster, with good reason. It is absolutely a must watch! Here we have Hadfield singing David Bowie's ""Space Oddity"" Please take a few minutes out of your life to watch it....http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poZCIN...He stayed on the space station for about 5 months. For me by far the most interesting part of this was his experience when he returned to earth. It reputedly takes as long to recover from being in space as it does to spend time there. We hear so much about the weirdness of loss of gravity - but this is the first time I'd heard about the weirdness of getting gravity back. It was payback time.I thought this was a cracking good read. I usually give my bedtime reads a perfunctory paragraph review, but I had to do a proper review for this one. It was just so good. I am now a firm Chris Hadfield fan ♥."
9,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50173624-ashwood,5,"Okay, this was a fantastic read!! Wow, I’m really thinking I want to be an Astronaut now, lol. I’m really really glad I decided to pick up this one. "
10,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26494171-lilyanne,3,"Essentially a long dad-like lecture on how the lessons Chris Hadfield has absorbed from a life in pursuit of the goal of going to space can be applied to your ordinary life here on Earth. Like any lecture by a beloved parent, there is good and bad here. The bad: it can be repetitive. The point he returns to again and again is “be prepared!” It is advice that I personally don’t need, if anything I need to learn to be more spontaneous. But it is advice that definitely made me feel like Astronaut Chris and I were kindred spirits. The good: lessons on preventing the single-minded pursuit of a goal from being destructive; conquering fear; making a positive impact on any situation by aiming to have a neutral impact. And of course the fascinating and surprising stories of an astronaut’s everyday life, a life that very few of us will be lucky enough to experience. Hadfield is self-deprecating and humble, but clearly a master at his chosen profession. Overall, it was a pleasure to read his insights."
11,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,4,"This is definitely one of the most interesting and compelling memoirs of sorts that proffers valuable life lessons; ones which go against conventional thinking and life coaching. Visualising success, not sweating the small stuff and not caring about what others think; Chris Hadfield's experience as an astronaut - or more importantly, on becoming an astronaut - proves otherwise. It is so refreshing to read about Hadfield's lifelong dedication and commitment to achieve his boyhood aspirations. It is all too common nowadays in my working experience in dealing with the younger generation where self-entitlement is so prevalent that these two attributes are becoming increasingly rare. Instant gratification and shortcuts are preferred over having the experience of undertaking the journey and the satisfaction of having reached the destination through one's diligence and dedication. Hadfield himself wrote a line which encapsulated the meaning of having the journey before the destination. (Sanderson and Stormlight fans, you know this all too well!)The book also contains wonderful insights into what it means to be an astronaut. From the hours and hours of training about literally everything possible from making minor repairs on a spacecraft in zero gravity to managing serious emergencies and even a simulation with loved ones on what to do, step by step, when one dies on a space mission. Even the quarantine period prior to a launch was more involved than one would have thought. I especially enjoyed the tidbits about life on a space station in zero gravity. Even the simplest quotidian activities like eating and drinking, going to the toilet, brushing your teeth, exercising and sleeping needed to be considered carefully. I also checked out a few of his YouTube videos of life on the ISS, and they are fascinating. Hadfield comes across as being so down-to-earth and avuncular that I enjoyed listening to his narration and watching his videos. Being an astronaut had been one of my childhood dreams, with 'dream' being the operative word here, and as such, I welcomed this book with open arms. Much to my delight, it was also an enlightening and enjoyable read/listen that I will recommend to anyone who loves real-life stories of dedication and commitment, which has its just rewards."
12,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/693662-stephan,2,"Reads like a job interview. I was hoping for something a bit more sensory. Instead, Hadfield describes his accomplishments unemotionally and without a lot of insight - other than ""work hard and dream big!"". Hadfield is definitely accomplished and has stories to tell. But I wish each statement didn't end with a notch on his belt."
13,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8998339-christopher,3,"I haven't seen my family in weeks. Writing a review on Chris Hadfield's book takes effort; effort you have to be prepared for, sweating the small stuff, with single minded focus and superhuman determination. It's not as simple as reading the book and writing this review. Months and months of exacting preparation and endless training, before the book was even released, went into this review. I photographed all the locations and interviewed the people I thought likely to be mentioned in the book, and even though the majority of them weren't mentioned, it felt good knowing that no matter the anecdote, I was prepared for it. I had the audio book, recorded in Commander Hadfield's voice, play simultaneously as I read the book, on the chance that some unforeseen grammar disaster, such as a misplaced comma or overlooked spelling error (like the one that brought down Neil Armstrong's book) would not affect Hadfield's fatherly advice. Immediately prior to writing the review, I lived in a sensory depravation tank for a week, to prevent possible memetic contamination from social media. Then, I wrote endless simulated reviews with all possible star ratings, ran scenario's involving grammar errors and troll comments left below the review, and even a scenario involving Goodreads inexplicably converting to a Youtube format, without notice. I'm proud to say I did pretty well on that test, by cramming video editing lessons the night before from a Russian language site. You have to sweat the small stuff. Finally the time has come to upload the review. I took courses in HTML, web publishing and had a short stint as an intern in the Goodreads IT department. In the past other reviews have failed to post entirely, but I was trained to work the problem. I ran through my checklists, copied and pasted the review, and thinking of my wife and children who had taken jobs to support this review, uploaded. An Astronauts Guide to Life on Earth: 3.5 stars. "
14,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"I greatly enjoyed this book. Chris Hadfield is a remarkable man; his achievements speak for themselves. Despite his remarkable life, he comes out sounding rather humble. He always lets the reader know that each space flight is an incredible team effort. Being an astronaut is not mainly about going into space; it is about the process of training, learning, practicing, undergoing grueling difficulties, and helping others. It means taking a back seat to one's ego. It is about seeing other astronauts ""cut in line"" in front of you, and helping them in their projects and prospects.Of course, Hadfield goes into some detail in describing what life is like in space, especially in the International Space Station. But most of the book is about his life on Earth, and the lessons that we can all draw from his experiences. His most basic lesson is ""do sweat the small stuff."" In space, of course, it is the details that make or break success, indeed, make or break survival. But here on Earth, also, Hadfield believes that it is the ""small stuff"" that makes life more fulfilling."
15,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9752900-carolyn,3,"This was a book I had looked forward to reading so perhaps I expected too much. Without a doubt this is a decent story told by a decent story teller and you feel like you are listening to dad or a favourite teacher tell you about a great adventure ""back when"" that is riddled with valuable life lessons he hopes to impart in order help you to make your own life more meaningful. The Colonel is definitely ""a teacher"".This said, I found this to be a difficult read partly due to the repetitive and ""take my advice I know better"" tone. Yes it is best to be a team player, yes strive to be a zero, yes sweat the little stuff before it becomes big stuff. All are valuable lessons to be learned but I felt it needed more about the daily life on ISS or the interesting behind the scenes things about how a kid from Sarnia, Canada, makes it to command the ISS (which we do hear about, but I wanted more).The anecdotes were laid out in a dizzying manner (perhaps reminiscent of the De-orbit in the Soyuz capsule?)that further interrupted the flow of the story. They just seemed to lack any type of organization to keep the story flowing.Without question Col. Hadfield is a remarkable and gracious man, with countless talents and skills. Without question this story was far better told in his voice than any other author's. I think perhaps the book and the Colonel himself would have been better served if he had an editor sit down with him and encourage him to tease out more meat to the story. This would have done his story far more justice, rather than deliver what feels like a rush job to simply capitalize on his Rock Star status.The book does not deserve a 3, but it is not quite a 4 and I am ever so glad to have read this but I am left wishing there was more. "
16,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3500204-catherine-howard,5,"Well, the last book I'll finish in 2013 has turned out to be my favourite of the year... I'm a major NASA nut, and I've read a lot of astronaut biographies. All the Apollo era ones, and a few Space Shuttle ones as well. But while they were all intriguing reading, only Michael Collins' Carrying the Fire (Apollo 11 -- he was the guy who stayed in the command module while Neil and Buzz got to walk on the moon) came close to what I was looking for: an account of how it FEELS to be in space. Prior to the Shuttle program nearly every astronaut came from a military background, be they test pilots or engineers. Manned space exploration was just beginning, so it wasn't like they had always dreamed of being in space. They wanted to be at the top of their profession, and back then that meant astronaut. In space, they admired the view, yes, but they were more concerned with completing their checklists and their mission than taking notes that would help convey the awesomeness of the experience to the readers of their biographies later on. Later, Shuttle astronauts would look upon their roles with even less gravity -- not all of them, of course, but because the Shuttle seemed to make spaceflight routine, it was widespread -- and one of my biggest disappointments was meeting an astronaut who was aboard the mission I saw launch from Cape Canaveral, only to hear him say that he and his colleagues rang up and ordered NASA astronaut applications ""like pizza"". (And then later, reveal that he didn't know what year Challenger exploded. ""1986"" the woman next to me spat at him.) Another Shuttle era biography seemed to spend more time talking about a female astronaut's legs than time in space. What we want to read, of course, is an account of going to space by someone like us, someone who would have pains in their jaw from smiling the whole way up, who would float to the nearest window to gaze back at Earth in awe, who would come home and write lyrically and beautifully and descriptively about how they FELT while they were in space... And that is just what Commander Hadfield has done. I knew it from the first line: ""The windows of a spaceship casually frame miracles."" Having decided age 9 and while watching Armstong walk on the moon that he was going to be an astronaut, he made his whole life about pursuing that goal -- and of course, it came true. Not only did it come true but he flew on three missions and had a long stay on the ISS and, thanks to social media and a certain YouTube music video, became perhaps the most popular astronaut of all time. This is an amazing book which manages to be a highly readable account of space flight AND a guide to life. There were plenty of new revelations even for the NASA nut (I knew they trained hard but boy, I'd no idea HOW hard or for how long) and anyone embarking or in the midst of a corporate career ladder climb could do worse than take Hadfield's advice for becoming a valuable and appreciated member of a working team. He also states the case for space exploration although not with a heavy hand. (Did you know, for example, that Canada spends less on space travel per year than Canadians spend on Halloween candy?! Or that since the Shuttle helped put GPS satellites in orbit, no one who has ever used Google Maps can complain about the money we spend on space.) He also drove something home for me that really resonated, considering my goal is something that may never happen: to get a book deal. Most astronauts who train never fly in space, and so you'd ask yourself: why bother? Hadfield explains that you must find joy in the training, in the work, in the preparation, so that even if your dream doesn't happen, you still enjoyed every moment of its pursuit and have something to be proud of at the end.And all the while, manages to write beautifully, come across wonderfully and keep the reader turning the page.I LOVED this book and had I read it sooner in the year, I might have given a copy of it to everyone I know. Even if you've no interest in space -- perhaps especially if you don't -- you should read this book. Just brilliant. "
17,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18760394-alexandra-charron,1,"for Olivia and sam: the reason this book gets one star is because he is so goddamn full of himself. Sure it's cool and stuff that he's an astronaut but at the end of the day it's just a job and your paid to do it. he's just super annoying in the way he talks about it, I don't find him humble which I think is why. I found him extremely repetitive too. It felt like I was reading the same thing over and over again, I spent the whole time wishing there would be a climax but there never was one. It was like listening to someone who is monotone to be honest. More or less this would have made a really nice like ""special edition: Chris hadfield"" magazine with some cool photos "
18,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22985424-sad-sunday-if-i-say-it-s-bad-it-s-bad,4,"Chris Hadfield might not be the best writer but he is an interesting person and a great storyteller. I consider him to be a very well-round person - his fields of expertise reach far beyond being an astronaut. The book had it's flaws - it feels like it's been written in one sitting, there were moments I wanted to know more and moments when less information would have sufficed, some ideas repeat themselves (be prepared, always learn) over and over, but it's an amazing glimpse into the life and achievements of one astronaut. So many cool facts about the space life that will make you inner geek happy. But well, it might diminish you dream of becoming an astronaut (don't worry, commercial flights are almost now). One of his goals was to bring space exploration ""closer"" to people and I think he achieved that 100%. This is Chris performing David Bowie's ""Space Oddity"" in space (ISS).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaOC9..."
19,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4802330-heino-colyn,5,"I learned a lot while reading this book, but my main takeaway is that Chris Hadfield is a really, really nice guy. Reading similar books I often think ""wow, this guy is an ass but he gets the job done, so I guess it is fine?"" Hadfield has every reason to be a jerk, but his attitude and humbleness is so refreshing and contrasting when compared to a lot of people who reached his level of success.I kind of wish that I read this on Kindle so that I could make and share some notes and highlights, but the paperback ambushed me while I was out browsing. I'd still like to share two of my favourite quotes:[...] one of the most important lessons I've learned as an astronaut: value the wisdom of humility, as well as the sense of perspective it gives you.But fundamentally, life off Earth is in two important respects not at all unworldly: You can choose to focus on the surprises and pleasures, or the frustrations. And you can choose to appreciate the smallest scraps of experience, the everyday moments, or to value only the grandest, most stirring ones.Great read, whether you're into space or not."
20,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5742086-megan-baxter,4,"It was a no-brainer that I would get to this book eventually. It only took so long because I was very far down the hold list at the library, and waited patiently while reading other books for it to arrive. A book written by Chris Hadfield? Canada's best known astronaut (at least these days), who made life on the ISS exciting for so many more people than those who had been interested in space for years? Count me in.Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement.

21,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/118210-sarah,4,"Hadfield debunks a lot of pervasive cultural myths about success, thank goodness, and astronauting is a perfect (albeit extreme) exemplar for demonstrating these truths. The main myths, as extrapolated by a crude American non-astronaut:1. Talent is the best indicator of success. You can have the most natural aptitude ever for being an astronaut but if you don’t prepare like mad, you will end up dead.2. Just think positively! Visualizing success means nothing if you aren’t prepared for what might go wrong.3. Helping others diminishes your chances of success. Helping others increases the likelihood that your endeavor will succeed, and that you will not end up dead.4. Hot shots get ahead. No one likes a relentless self-promoter, and luckily no one will send one to space because they’ll detract from the mission; annoyed, distracted astronauts = dead astronauts.5. Big life events are the best moments of your life. Facetiousness aside, this is probably one of the more meaningful lessons for living a fulfilled life: ""…you can choose to appreciate the smallest scraps of experience, the everyday moments, or to value only the grandest, most stirring ones. Ultimately, the real question is whether you want to be happy."" 6. All Canadians are super polite. Hahaha just kidding! Hadfield doesn’t debunk this one at all. "

23,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"Chris Hadfield's book is an autobiography, an astronaut's memoir, and in the first half, a self-help guidebook to developing the kind of mental attitude it takes to be an astronaut. For education, it is clear one has to go deep in subjects NASA thinks important to learn - science, technology, engineering and math. Attending the USAF test pilot school seems like a good idea too, as well as just plain WOW! The book is full of good advice and interesting, but I wish the earnestness about teamwork and perseverance and focus in the early pages had been toned down just a tad! The second half of the book is full of details about what it is like to be rocketed off of Earth, what living aboard the ISS involves, and how the body feels and responds after returning to conditions of gravity. Hadfield also explains those famous videos! It is a very interesting book and I enjoyed reading it.Due to Hadfield's son's interest in photography, we have videos about life aboard the ISS:http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=...Hadfield can sing!https://youtu.be/KaOC9danxNoSome people think Hadfield is arrogant, but I completely disagree. Others are less than enthusiastic about the title of this book, 'An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth' thinking it a self-help book. I am a hater of this title, too. It sounds like a mental or New Age self-help title but I thought his advice is sound, if a bit too repetitious and extended in the early autobiographical portions. However, I read the entire book anyway, and I liked it. I feel his interest in publicity and public media is more about developing interest in going to space and encouragement of STEM education than it is about self-aggrandizement. If there are people in the world entitled to crow about their achievements, in my opinion, one of those includes folk who struggle to be an astronaut. The book clearly shows a dedication to a science education and physical fitness must begin early in life, and a mental focus and toughness is a must, especially in democracies where the development of one's self is primarily self-directed by choice, and eventually financially-supported by both family resources and a government program. At the same time, when the personal rewards of sacrifice and striving alone for decades are won, we demand modesty and self-abasement from the achiever! It is a delicate balance of ego and leadership, and I think the charismatic Hadfield deserves his hard-won accolades. The book makes clear he has 'the right stuff' (even if he also is a nice, earnest Canadian). ; )"
24,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,4,"Really 4.5 stars.The publisher says:Colonel Chris Hadfield has spent decades training as an astronaut and has logged nearly 4000 hours in space. During this time he has broken into a Space Station with a Swiss army knife, disposed of a live snake while piloting a plane, and been temporarily blinded while clinging to the exterior of an orbiting spacecraft. The secret to Col. Hadfield's success-and survival-is an unconventional philosophy he learned at NASA: prepare for the worst-and enjoy every moment of it. My thoughts:It was a pleasure to read Chris Hadfield’s memoir—it took me only 1 day. I was surprised at how many little “rules of living” that I share with an astronaut. For example, I always have Plan B and Plan C prepared, just in case Plan A doesn’t work. By and large, I find that I really don’t need Plan C, but it is useful to have anticipated disaster and to know “where do I go from here?” (But I also have a little saying: What Miss Wanda wants, Miss Wanda gets—I’m pretty used to getting my own way!)Like Hadfield, I also believe in enjoying the small things. If we only are happy during the big positive events, we won’t be happy very often! I celebrate any small victory or beautiful everyday event so that there are things to enjoy on a regular basis. (As well as reading An Astronaut’s Guide, I also cleared, cleaned and reorganized my cookbook shelf in the kitchen yesterday—I’m spending far more time than I thought I would just admiring my handy work and celebrating cleanliness!!)Of course, besides the philosophical themes, it was also fun to hear about the details of living in space. Hadfield answers most of my questions about living conditions aboard the ISS (although I’m still wondering how female astronauts/cosmonauts deal with the bathroom issue?) In addition to the danger factor, that alone would keep me from ever wanting to go to space! Besides, if there aren’t any birds there, why would a birding-obsessed gal such as myself ever want to go there?I was also amused to find out that Hadfield’s children tease him—playing a game called The Colonel Says, where they yell out some of his favourite sayings and laugh hysterically at them! Still, they seem to be very supportive of his endeavours, with one son helping him with social media while he was commander of the ISS. All in all, a person has to be very driven and competitive to become an astronaut, but despite this Hadfield comes across as a pretty decent guy that it would be very interesting to have a coffee with (presumably Tim Horton’s coffee, the favourite on the ISS). "
25,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3660423-josen,4,"4.5......... Let me just start by saying it's times like this that I thank God for book clubs. :) I read this for a group that I'm in and I'm so glad because I don't think that I would've picked this up on my own. This book is written by Col. Chris Hadfield, a Canadian astronaut. Hadfield writes about the technical aspects of being an astronaut from the preparations, to the space missions, to returning home. That, alone, was interesting to read but he also writes about how all of his training had prepared him for life in general, whether it was work related, family related or personally related. Even with his many accomplishments his experiences have taught him how to be humble and to understand that, as in a space mission, everyone from the people who make the astronaut suits to his space crew play an important part in achieving success. Along with some of the technical terms, Hadfield also writes with humor which makes this an easy read. I think this is a great, inspirational book and I highly recommend it! "
26,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38756055-rae,5,"Great balls of fire, what a great book! Hadfield is my new hero. Well written, funny, insightful, and the perfect narrator to his own book to boot. 5 solid stars!"
27,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10743961-rob,4,"Executive Summary: This book was pretty interesting at times, but got a bit annoying at others. 3.5 stars.Audiobook: I'm always leery about authors narrating their own books, but in the case of nonfiction I think it's generally a better track record. Mr. Hadfield does a fine job. Nothing fantastic, but I don't really want fantastic in non fiction anyways. If nothing else he knows best what he was feeling during the various events he described in his book.
Full Review
I picked this up on a deal at some point or another. I was interested in reading it, but not exactly itching to read it. I finally gave it a shot because I needed a short book to fill in time between my last book and new release I'd been eagerly waiting for. So this fit the bill nicely.I (like many people I imagine) first learned of Chris Hadfield when his Space Oddity cover from the ISS went viral. As a reader of a lot of sci-fi, I don't pay nearly as much attention to our actual space program as probably should. He did a pretty good at bringing public attention to it, at least for a little while.I think the most interesting parts of this book were the anecdotes leading to Mr. Hadfield becoming an astronaut, and the stories around his time on the ISS. Some of the stuff in between got a bit slow at times.As the title would indicate, this book is as much of a personal life philosophy book as it is a biography about an astronaut. It was some of the life philosophy stuff that got tiring after awhile. It's not that I disagree with his sentiments, but I feel like those things aren't as easy to apply to your life if you're not a highly successful individual like Mr. Hadfield has been.Overall I found the book pretty good. I'd have liked some more detail of his first two trips to space and a bit less about his personal philosophy on life, but it was an enjoyable enough listen."
28,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5556618-sophie,4,"This was a really interesting book because it’s part memoir and part advice book. A lot of the ways space travel and the ideal for astronauts can change was really informative, like what might be perfect at one point can be a trait that disqualifies people as astronauts now. If you're looking for a lot of information on his experience with space then you'll get some of that but it's more about his mindset and educational journey to space. Chris Hadfield had wanted to be an astronaut since watching the moon landing in 1969, and worked hard to become one, but he also found that being in space taught him how to think differently about Earth and how best to survive on Earth. And he gives a lot of interesting points of view. And part of that is how specific to astronauts have to think as astronauts, because so many of them don’t spend time in space or are even able to go to space, so they have to think about the work as having value in and of itself, and also be willing to be a small part of something that will eventually lead to a big something. He points out that if your only goal is to go to space, then it’s not the right career for you. But a lot of this advice can be applied to us as non space-going readers, too. As Chris says, the best thing to do is to figure out what you want to do in life and act like everything is training for that. And sometimes it might not work out, there were a lot of random things that could have happened that would have made it so that Chris never had been an astronaut, but his life’s script would still be interesting. This whole book felt like it is presenting itself as part hopeful, part realistic and cynical. One thing I found really interesting was his advice to basically sweat the small stuff, like to think of the worst possible scenario and prepare for that, because even if it ultimately doesn’t happen then at least you were prepared and ultimately still can get something out of having a new skillset or something. I also really liked the part about how you can make a negative contribution, a zero contribution, and a plus contribution, and the best thing to do is to try to have a zero because trying to make yourself a plus is a good way to make it a negative. Just be there and be helpful when necessary and don’t make a big deal out of it. I think that ultimately this book was really inspiring (even if at times it made me feel unaccomplished!) and made me want to go out and learn so many new things. I’m not sure how much of the book I’ll actually use to change how I live my life, but it certainly presented a new way of thinking. "

30,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,5,"Buckle up and make sure you’re wearing your g-suit, because this is one of those rare books that live up to all the hype. An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth comes with ridiculously high expectations: it has a bunch of awards, and everyone gives it such glowing reviews. So, naturally, I tempered my excitement. As anyone who has read my reviews knows, I love space and science fiction. I welcomed the opportunity to read a book written by someone who has actually been to space. But I was not prepared for how inspirational and genuine Chris Hadfield’s storytelling would be.I could quote a lot of this book in an effort to try to convince you it’s worth reading. I have underlined, annotated, and emphasized so many passages. Here’s one from the introduction:Throughout all this I never felt that I’d be a failure in life if I didn’t get to space. Since the odds of becoming an astronaut were nonexistent, I knew it would be pretty silly to hang my sense of self-worth on it. My attitude was more, “It’s probably not going to happen, but I should do things that keep me moving in the right direction, just in case—and I should be sure those things interest me, so that whatever happens, I’m happy.”Plenty of people dream of becoming astronauts. When Hadfield’s dream began at 9 years old, he also recognized that it was a long-shot. Canada didn’t yet have a space agency, and when it did, the selection process for astronauts was ridiculously competitive and often required a lot of luck. Then again, so much of life is like that. Hadfield’s philosophy, as articulated above, is level-headed and applicable to pretty much any aspirations: if you predicate all your self-worth on a mere possibility of the future; if you define success only by a single, perhaps unattainable goal, then you will spend a lot of your life unfulfilled and unhappy.I suppose, in retrospect, the book’s title should have forewarned me; nevertheless, I didn’t anticipate how much of Hadfield’s thinking is relevant to our everyday life. Much of what he espouses fits with philosophies of mindfulness and self-compassion, which are increasingly popular these days and are things I am striving for within my life.As a teacher, I keep coming back to how much of what Hadfield says applies to education too. He notes that the life of an astronaut is a life of constant learning, both in the traditional form of classrooms and tests as well as on-the-job experiences. There is no such thing as “knowing all there is to know” when you’re an astronaut; you’re constantly learning new things, training on new systems, and re-training on the old ones. The same goes for teaching, and indeed, I suspect it’s true for most careers. And Hadfield emphasizes that the process of learning is a communal effort:The debrief is a cultural staple at NASA, which makes this place a nightmare for people who aren’t fond of meetings. During a sim, the flight director or lead astronaut makes notes on major events, and afterward, kicks off the debrief by reviewing the highlights: what went well, what new things were learned, what was already known but needs to be re-emphasized. Then it’s a free-for-all. Everyone else dives right in, system by system, to dissect what went wrong or was handled poorly. All the people who are involved in the sim have a chance to comment on how things looked from their consoles…. It’s not a public flog: the goal is to build up collective wisdom.I love this idea of debriefing and want to use it in the classroom. I’ve recently gone gradeless, attempting instead to re-focus students’ attention on what really matters: the actual learning, the use of feedback and self-assessment to monitor and improve learning, and community in the classroom. Debriefs, or guided discussions, are nothing new to a classroom, of course, but Hadfield articulates the process here clearly and empathetically. Throughout the book, he points out that it’s possible to be helpful and to provide constructive criticism without tearing people down.Hadfield writes with humility despite being one of the few humans who have visited space. He chronicles the majesty and wonder of space flight with all the zeal one might expect of an astronaut. Reading his description of the nail-biting, g-force–inducing ascents and descents, with the miracle of life in microgravity in between, truly rekindles all the passion and enjoyment for stories of space travel that I have felt ever since I started watching Star Trek in my childhood. Hadfield also explains, in sometimes too-great detail, the mundane aspects of life in space, such as how he pees into a cup (for science) when weightless…. Suffice it to say, I don’t want to be an astronaut. And as much as we romanticize the career, it’s clear that the life of an astronaut is more waiting to be in space than actually being in space, and that life in space is not all it’s cracked up to be.The last few chapters of the book are as heartbreaking as they are honest and amazing. Hadfield recounts his third and last mission to space, sharing the feelings of the final re-entry and his subsequent retirement from the CSA. It’s bittersweet, and Hadfield doesn’t mince words as he shares some of his melancholy moments—but overall, the tone is one of enduring appreciation and pride. He has so much enthusiasm for his ongoing goals to educate and inspire passion for human space flight. We get a little blasé about pictures from space these days, I feel, just because the Internet makes it easy to disseminate them so quickly. Seeing the Earth from space in person must be such a different, jaw-dropping experience, though. Even having read his description of it, I cannot imagine what it must be like to gaze at the Earth from the Cupola of the ISS, knowing it’s the very last time you will ever see the planet in this way in person.Hadfield closes by reminding us to find satisfaction in the small things in life:If I’d defined success very narrowly, limiting it to peak, high-visibility experiences, I would have felt very unsuccessful and unhappy during those years. Life is just a lot better if you feel you’re having 10 wins a day rather than a win every 10 years or so.And just like that, An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth is a welcome tonic to the voices that encourage us to measure success in the currency of celebrity or wealth or visibility. We define what success means to us. I have no reservations recommending this book: it’s a great, interesting, uplifting read.

31,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3057525-sadie,3,"Chris Hadfield has become quite well known internationally, even to people not interested in all things space travel, for his version of Space Oddity filmed on board the ISS. Now, personally, I value a good Bowie homage, and this was certainly a very special one! But before Hadfield became some kind of icon in Canada (first Canadian ISS commander) and a musician in space, he was a small boy with a dream unlikely to ever in come true: Back in 1969, when Neil Armstrong made his first steps on the moon, little Chris decided to become an astronaut, even though Canada didn't have a national space agency, let alone a national space program back then. In this book, Chris tells the story from young Chris and his dream up to nowadays' Chris retiring from space traveling after three missions and almost half a year in space in total. The book is very entertaining, even though its structure felt a bit rough a times - it's a biographical account, yet it isn't told chronologically but in three large chapters roughly covering the pre-flight parts on earth (his private and career background, the selection progress, the years and years of training and learning stuff like Russian, doing small surgery in space and what not), the times in space and the time after. It wasn't confusing, just unusual.Commander Hadfield seems like a fun guy to be around with - his dedication and passion for his dream, his job shines through on every page - sometimes, it gave me vague hints of him being a overly competitive person, but well, if you're aiming to be an astronaut, I guess it comes with the job. Hanging loose while commanding the ISS might not be the best idea ever. Some parts were bordering repetitiveness and might've used a touch more editing - then again, it's part of this book's charme and its authenticity. A few paragraphs right at the end are dedicated to Hadfield's changed perspective of our earth and how we exploit it and its nature. The view from space made him humble in that regard and made him care more for our environment. I would've really enjoyed for him to elaborate on that aspect, but this wasn't a larger issue in this book. Guess I'll turn to Alexander Gerst then, who's some kind of the German Chris Hadfield, being the first German commander of the ISS and a very loud and active spokesperson on environmental issues.But after all, I'm whining on a high level here. I'm pretty sure that people who are really into space travel and all that, are going to love this. I mean, even me, who is usually scared of all the stuff that could happen in space, had a good time reading this. Besides being entertaining, this book is also educating. I gathered a lot of new insights, not only on how astronauts eat, ""shower"" and pee in zero gravity. I even watched a few more ISS vids to get an accompanying visual. Plus, I loved the underlying ""Let's just all be friends""-motto of the international ISS and all these people from so many countries working together far away from earth. Yes, this was a fun ride!"
32,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4110877-chrissy,5,"Full disclosure: I have a serious admiration-crush on Commander Hadfield, so I may be biased.I LOVED THIS BOOK. A non-linear autobiography spun as a sort of motivational handbook to living well, this book uses anecdotes-- the terrifying, the humorous, and the profound-- from an impressive career to illustrate some of the ways in which life as an astronaut can inform, and indeed improve, everyday life on earth. The writing is uncomplicated but never simple, the voice of humble intelligence with experience in communicating complicated ideas efficiently. Hadfield himself comes across as both ordinary and extraordinary, seasoned but wide-eyed, content but as determined as ever to contribute to the society that allowed him to fulfill his lifelong dream of space travel.The tenets of the philosophy Hadfield espouses are straightforward: (in my own words) work hard, work with passion, work with others, work for others, take pleasure in the little things, be prepared for anything, humble yourself, and learn, always. In these ways, Hadfield has managed to find happiness and maintain it over a lifetime of stress, long hours, travel, and endless learning, and even after his final stint in space was complete and his retirement nigh.There was a lot to love and enjoy over the course of these pages. Hadfield is a sharp, witty guy, and his memory for, and appreciation of, the little details gives his stories a sort of earnest magic that draws you in. The one thing that I think will stick with me is the notion of seeing life (and careers) laterally, with moments of importance, pride, and value in every single day, instead of as a ladder to climb. The latter, Hadfield argues, will leave one in the position of never being satisfied at any rung below the top one, where no human can remain even if they're one of the lucky few to ever reach it.I really recommend this book for anyone who wants to feel good about life, science, exploration, and the value of our tax dollars in supporting beautiful minds like this one."
33,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2576681-shakespeareandspice,4,"Quick review (apologies if there are any errors) -This book starts out sort of like a school girl’s diary and it was annoying at first, but I quickly warmed up to the narrator/author. Hadfield’s narration is excellent, very easy to take in and follow everything. He seems like a fairly nice guy that would always be open a conversation about anything. While I did have some doubts how he managed to handle his career and family life, he does mention that his wife was unbelievably supporting in everything he did and I was quite impressed at how they’ve stayed together for so long. Must have taken quite the toll on the Hadfield’s.The part I enjoyed the most while listening to this is when he discusses his time on the space station and all the processes and training that he had to go through. It’s incredibly fascinating to hear him bring everything down to a realistic level and just tell us upfront that being an astronaut is not anything like it’s been portrayed in the media. The sort of relationship astronauts have to form with each other, one of complete honesty, is nothing like I’ve ever heard and refreshing for a change.And lastly, of course, Hadfield’s time spent in space was really exciting to learn about. While his writing isn’t exactly mind-boggling, sometimes the simplest ideas that he puts out there are really touching. For example, when he discusses how even though he was far up above from Earth and his family, he never really felt the sort of loneliness another person living in a crowded city all alone might feel. He mentions that he could just look below and see 7 billion or so people and it wasn’t possible to feel alone then. This section, like many others, weren’t exactly elegantly worded but awe-inspiring nonetheless.A wonderful experience to read about and one I would recommend to anyone interested in the science of space exploration!"
34,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63778843-melissa-rose,5,"Ugh, I am truly struggling to write a review for this because I simply loved it too much. I have written and rewritten my thoughts at least half a dozen times. So, please bear with me while I try to articulate my exact feelings.First off, as I've already stated, I love this book! I'm always amazed at how the wisdom Chris has learned is applicable to my life. In fact, An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth has become one of my ‘go-to’ reads when my anxiety has got me in a funk; it always seems to pick me up and help me focus my perspective once again.What I really loved about this memoir (other than the parts about life in space) was that Hadfield focused a lot on the steps he took in order to be able to go to space; continuing on a theme of ‘always being prepared just in case.’Furthermore, what added to the audio experience was that it was narrated entirely by Hadfield, himself, which was incredible. I find his voice calming to listen to, and it was marvellous to be able to hear his story in his own voice.Overall, I truly hope that I was able to do An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth justice; I fear that it may not be my best review. However, I am and will always continue to be inspired by Chris Hadfield, and I highly recommend this book to other space junkies like myself."
35,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17290463-mcla,2,"Chris Hadfield is an all round awesome fellow. He knows more about going into space and coming back than I can ever begin to understand. This is an interesting autobiography of a very lucky and successful astronaut. What is it not is a guide to life on Earth.I started reading the book thinking that an astronaut would, having left the Earth and seen it as what it really is - a pale blue saucer in the vast emptiness of space, bring a unique perspective on human (and non-human) life on this planet. I was disappointed. This book doesn't offer anything new in that department. What it does offer (except for the admittedly interesting anecdotes about the life of astronauts), one can find in any number of books written by people who have never ventured higher than what a commercial aeroplane would take them.Would not recommend if you're looking for life-changing insights, for there are none."
36,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5147104-mary-beth,3,"I would have preferred to have more interesting factoids about space (did you know that you will grow an inch or two while up in the ISS for 5 months without gravity?) and actual descriptions of the experiments being done on the astronauts (instead of the generic statements about the importance of ""science""). Instead the book focused a lot on how accomplished Hadfield had to be to become an astronaut, and the rather trite life lessons he's learned during those experiences (he seems particularly proud of the phrase ""square astronaut, round hole,"" which he comes back to at multiple points throughout the book). At least he acknowledges several times that he was an absentee father since it seems like one has to be pretty self-centered with single-minded devotion to succeed as an astronaut."
37,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3760321-gauri,0,"I found myself dragging through this book, but I'm not sure why. However, I enjoyed learning about how astronauts train and work, and I appreciated the numerous lessons Hadfield imparts to the reader. I found it similar to Mike Massimino's book, in that both of them have valued their time on Earth more than their time in space. Both genuinely believe that the journey is what one should be proud of and enjoy, not the destination. Being in space was great, but solving problems and getting jobs done as an astronaut, CAPCOM, director, and pilot were the richest and most valuable experiences Hadfield had. The book was alright, but the author is a great man."
38,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46063738-bookhound-x1f43e,5,"This book was not what I expected (in a good way!). I had heard lots of reviews about the book, but I was curious what it really was like. Starting the book, I didn't have super high expectations, thinking that it'd be full of dry, boring space exploration facts and figures. But I sure was wrong!Chris Hadfield writes in such a way that it feels like you're having a conversation with him. And as he describes his career as an astronaut and life aboard the ISS (International Space Station), he writes with a fun sense of humour that makes this book such an enjoyable read. Definitely deserving of a 5 star rating! :) "

For some reason I had convinced myself that this could just depress me, but it didn't.We got a lot of information about what it actually means to be an astronaut and a lot of the training and work was super interesting.On top of that I liked his honesty in talking about his successes and ""failures"" (that is too strong a word, but can't think of another) and his attitude towards life and the importance of working hard and being prepared.So no depressing reaction whatsoever, just a nice reading experience."
41,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56529613-blueisthenewpink,5,"Usually, I’m not really into space and astronaut stuff but this is a highly enjoyable book. It’s as interesting and funny as Colonel Hadfield’s Twitter and Facebook updates, and YouTube videos. It is also very personal. After all, we follow his life from him watching the first men (Buzz Aldrin is the name of the second one, please remember that) step on the Moon to his retirement after being commander of the International Space Station. However, at times it seemed to be a bit repetitive. Maybe that is why I couldn’t read more than one chapter at a time, despite all the interesting stories being told.He described launch so vividly, I actually felt like I experienced it myself. Which makes me think about the repetitions. Maybe it was deliberate, to show the reader how uninteresting (and repetitive) the mundane reality of being an astronaut is. We are told, over and over again that an astronaut spends most of his time on Earth, and it is good, and important. Maybe he never leaves the planet which is okay. Of course, going to space is what everyone wishes for but even that is not heroic, and life after it is not boring at all. They are preparing for years, practicing every movement they will be making, they plan for the worst, study long and hard, and are humble servants of a greater purpose only. Towards the end, I started to wonder who he was trying to convince. Me or himself? For most of the book, I believed him but by the last chapter, I felt he was really labouring the point.Anyway, I think this is a wonderful path; from watching the first Moon landing on TV as a kid, through highly conscious career choices and hard work, taking part in the installation of a robotic arm that helped build the International Space Station (ISS) which he becomes the commander of in the end.It is full of great life lessons (they would make superb memes) and really interesting details, all told with a brilliant sense of humour. I was especially fascinated by the effects of being in space on the human body. From the fact they are wearing diapers at launch because it may take much longer than expected, through the nausea everyone experiences at first, to the results of living in zero gravity for months. Without the pull of gravitational force, their muscles weaken, of course. But also their hearts! Their hearts even shrink. Their spines, on the other hand, elongate. Coming back to Earth, then, after spending months floating in a peaceful, quiet environment with only a couple of other humans is like being a newborn, he says. After a rather tough ride, they are faced with all the noise, the people, the rush, and merciless gravity. “No wonder babies cry in protest when they’re born.” – says Hadfield.Oh, and he’s afraid of heights. The ex-commander of the ISS. Would you believe that?"
42,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2526638-claudia-turner,5,"This is the best space book I’ve read and possibly the best book of advice on living on earth that I’ve ever read. Forget self help books. If those are your thing just put them down and read this, because it’s full of wisdom and humility on every page for absolutely anyone, whether you’re a new astronaut or a new mom or a student or explorer. I would recommend this to anyone. For example, I wrote a book about my two months on bedrest in a hospital in 2016. “Notes on a Hospitalized Pregnant Woman” was about preeclampsia and the effects of a hard pregnancy and hours in a hospital room on the body and psyche. I didn’t include it in the book but there were months of rehabilitation where I had to really get a taste of what it was like to be an old fuddyduddy, from the sloshing stomach feeling when I ran again to weak limbs and vertigo. WELL this astronaut describes his return from five months on the ISS and I couldn’t help but think “I felt this exact same way”, and the whole book was like this, from keeping your ego in check to the power of “negative thinking” and appreciating every small detail and every so-called small event and responsibility in ones life. This is the zen of being an astronaut and the zen of being a human being. Read it.Ps. Side note: I want to add that the space program has accomplished- for science, medicine, the environment- what we could only dream of achieving on earth...through research for space and on the ISS, Hadfield points out how much invention and innovation has occurred with a program that many consider “too expensive” or obsolete. Even many liberals say this today and it is one of the most irritatingly ignorant things I’ve heard again and again, while billions are thrown into the military industrial complex, the actual cost of NASA programs is pennies compared to so many other expenditures people make on a daily basis, from weapons, to beer to fricken chewing gum.... Hadfield has a lot of detailed examples of all this and I’ll let you read for yourself and subsequently curse the fact that all astronauts rely solely on vintage Russian spacecraft to get to the ISS today."
43,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2615342-erin,5,"This book was literally life changing for me. Overall it is the story of a smart guy who works really hard and becomes an astronaut and goes into space three times. It's not set up in a self help format, and instead a fairly light, contemporary autobiography kind of way. Hadfield tells us how got to where he is today, which is by most standards a pretty impressive guy. But some of the principles he applied to his approach to life, primarily the concept of being a zero and being prepared have honestly actually changed the way I do a lot of things in my life. As a person who finds herself in many team situations with an overwhelming number of moving parts, the zero concept has helped me dramatically, not only in just being a hopefully decent member of my team but also in releasing a LOT of anxiety about performance, perfection, and expectations of control. And sweating the small stuff, preparing ""sims"" for myself when possible, has become an essential part of my life as someone who has to be in front of large groups of people on a regular basis. He also just talks about the wonder of space, and space travel, and the wonder of humanity. He's very positive, and in a genuine way. It was a helpful book to be reading in late January 2017. Hadfield also has an instagram that I suggest following if that's your deal. Dad jokes, awesome and nerdy pictures, and interesting space facts. He is your space dad and he is here to encourage you!"
44,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2691933-mlv,5,"I was one of those people that thought the space program took up an unreasonable amount of tax dollars despite my own interest in science...until I read this book. My favorite sections of this book aren't the entertaining descriptions of how you go about hygiene in a zero gravity environment, the fascinating description of the career path of an astronaut and the thousands of other scientists that make space travel possible, the insightful application of how to be a better human on earth, nor the suspenseful telling of unexpected complications and how the problems are solved...my favorite parts of this book are the casual observances that make you realize so many nations working together to make the ISS possible means there's hope here on Earth for equally meaningful cooperative efforts. I'm not going to deny it...after reading this book I spent a lot of time on youtube watching the videos the author made in space."

I don't know what it was about this book that really rubbed me the wrong way, but I felt myself actually getting annoyed at Mr. Hadfield as this progressed. This may be one of those books that's better as an audiobook because, at least in his lectures and such, he can be quite charismatic. I'm really disappointed because I'd wanted to read this book for so long, oh well.Not for me, but maybe you'll like it."
47,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17703155-melissa-chung,4,"I purchased this book ages ago, about 4 years ago now and I've been dying to read it. Yeah, Yeah....I hear you, if you were dying to read it why didn't you. Well as a lover of books (maybe some of you can relate), I tend to buy more books than I could ever read in a life time and that is something I'm going to have to work on (probably never....hey I'm being honest). As non-fiction books go, I found this one to be very informative. I pulled a lot of good quotes out of this memoir, things that really stood out to me. For example, ""Over the years, I've realized that in any new situation...you will almost certainly be viewed in one of three ways. As a minus one: actively harmful, someone who creates problems. Or as a zero: your impact is neutral and doesn't tip the balance one way or the other. Or you'll be seen as a plus one: someone who actively adds value...when I'm entering a new situation and don't yet have the lay of the land, I think about how to aim to be a zero and try to contribute in small ways without creating disruptions. If you really are a plus one, people will notice-...if you're not trying to rub their noses in your greatness."" There are a lot more of these kinds of quotes, like how not to be a bully. How to work well with others, etc. I found Chris Hadfield to be humble and brilliant. To have the drive to be an astronaut at nine years of age and have the gumption and drive to see that dream to fruition, is amazing. Yes, I didn't know if he would ever BE an astronaut, but he made damn sure he qualified at every turn. There is a lot to learn from this walk through of how Chris became an astronaut and all of it is interesting, inspiring and informative. I highly recommend this book if you like memoirs, are interested in space travel or are interested in astronauts. If you have seen Chris's youtube videos with CSA or his music video Space Oddity (which is actually how I found out about this guy) I would definitely pick up this book. So so good."
48,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47154315-ian,4,"Canada's Chris Hadfield rocketed to stardom (pun intended) with his advocacy of space exploration and his rendition of Bowie's Space Oddity created while commanding the International Space Station (ISS).His book gives us a glimpse into his biography and life of the modern astronaut, delivered with self-deprecating humor and folksy ""dad"" wisdom of how to apply the fighter-pilot-engineer-astronaut-philosophy of ""thinking of the next thing that can kill you"" to everyday life. Unlike many modern self-help books that prescribe not sweating the small stuff, Hadfield infers the opposite: take care of all the small details and everything should then work out. Given that I have an engineering background myself, I must admit to sharing much the same philosophy.The book is very accessible to the average reader, much like Hadfield himself, who in retirement continues to engage with the public on speaking tours, one of which my family and I recently saw in Vancouver. He gives inspiring lectures on not only the possibilities and benefits of space exploration for humanity in general but the possibilities of each person's human potential for a life well-lived, no matter what our chosen profession."
49,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1143969-julie,5,"Straight-up: I have the biggest crush on Chris Hadfield. My stomach did a giddy little flip when I got to shake his hand. He seems like such a great, witty, considerate, and down-to-earth (ha ha) guy, and most of all, he is so unbelievably inspiring that it's nauseating. I came out of one of his talks feeling, simultaneously, deeply anxious about my lack of Life Goal Passion, but also inspired to do better.(In particular, his advice on staying in shape is so beautifully simple: ""exercise, take the stairs, and don't eat stupid things."" Yes, it's simplistic esp. if you have a medical condition... but the thing is, I'M NOT EVEN DOING THAT BASIC THING AT THE MOMENT and need to kick my own ass into it, augh.)Anyway. Having read his mini-coffee-table book of photography, the next step was his sorta-autobiography, the cutely-named An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth: What Going to Space Taught Me About Ingenuity, Determination, and Being Prepared for Anything.This book does cover his life and education and career, from fighter pilot to test pilot to astronaut to commander of the ISS -- but more importantly and more than just an autobiography, it's about re-framing how you look at the world and your own life. Choosing to be humble and considerate, rather than an asshole. Appreciating the little things in life, and not being bitter about your current experiences possibly not measuring up to what you had in mind. Appreciating them for what they are. Embracing challenges because they help you grow. Preparing for challenges, sensibly and methodically; thinking about what the worst thing to happen might be, not as useless fatalistic fretting, but in order to prepare for and overcome it. I was frankly amazed to learn that he's afraid of heights: seriously, a fighter pilot/astronaut who's afraid of heights? Amazing. But he talks about how he faced those fears through childhood jumping out of hay lofts, and his father dangling him upside-down in an open-top plane.I specifically chose the audiobook because, for real, I just wanted to listen to him talk for like eight hours. He's not a professional reader and so his narration is a little stilted/awkward at times, but it lends a personal touch, and I feel like you can really hear the warmth when he's talking about the people he loves, friends he's lost in devastating shuttle crashes, the anger when he's asked silly questions, his embarrassment at his own mistakes. I was laughing hysterically when he was describing how to collect urine samples in space (spoiler alert: it is messy).I already feel like I'm going to reread the ebook at some point. Hadfield is a fucking inspiration: having watched the moon landing when he was nine years old, deciding at that moment that he wanted to be an astronaut, and then tirelessly spending the next 20+ years of his life preparing himself for that career, before Canada even had a space agency, when the job he wanted didn't even exist yet. But he did it anyway, and more, and still marched through life with the determination that he would not consider himself a failure if he didn't become an astronaut -- the point is that he was enjoying himself along the way, too. And rather than be sad or woeful that he's now retired, or view himself as being past his prime with all his hey-day behind him, he's reveling in the satisfaction of a job well-done and looking forward to the next challenge.I'm nowhere near as set in my career goals as Chris Hadfield -- I wish I had such a clear concept of What I Wanted To Do when I was only nine years old -- but there's still a lot of lessons to be learned from him, about humility, hard work, optimism, and taking care of yourself and the planet. Throughout the whole thing, I feel like he extols a sort of zen mindfulness, enhanced by his experiences in space; I liked hearing that whether they're religious or atheist, astronauts' experiences in space amplifies whatever belief system they already had. And they sorta can't help but be environmentalists after they return, an unexpected (and annoying to their walking companions) side-effect of astronauts being constantly stopping to pick up litter. Adorable.Plus, this intimate first-hand look into life in space -- and the painful rehabilitation afterwards, which no science fiction in my experience ever presented to me -- is fascinating, because I LOVE SPACE and never get tired of hearing more about it. He talks about that a bit, too, about how their most successful campaigning was through those everyday glimpses: people are interested in people, and seemingly-banal details like how you cut your hair in space, how you eat, etc.I love him & I love this book."
50,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10911644-paula-vince,4,"This retired astronaut describes some of his space missions in interesting detail, but the deeper purpose of his book is to share some hard-learned wisdom. Hadfield believes it has spilled over to help his life on earth run smoother, and hopes the same may apply for his readers. Some of the problem areas he highlighted have certainly struck a chord with me, helping me understand whey they've been problem areas. 1) Keeping your attitude on an even keel.The ratio of working hard on earth to launching out in space averages several years: a couple of days. Any sudden hitch may completely derail an astronaut's chance of joining a space mission. You must work with the knowledge that you may well be one of those who never go up at all, so it's best to make up your mind to feel good about the work you do during your long, unheralded, working, learning life on earth. As too many variables are out of your control, you might as well manage the only one you have any control over; your attitude.2) Aim to be a zero.He identifies just three types of people present on any space mission. Minus 1s are pains in the neck who make a shared experience miserable. Zeros are neutral, adding nothing either way. And Plus 1s are those who add something positive and good to everyone's benefit. Hadfield has noticed that although everyone wants to be a Plus 1, those who make too big an effort to prove themselves worthy of the title tend to be regarded as Minus 1s. The real Plus 1s tend to be quiet, get-on-with-the-job types who don't scramble for attention. His advice is that the best, round-about way to possibly become a Plus 1 is to simply aim to be a zero.3) Don't focus on what the world might call your proudest moments.If you take all the hype to heart and set the bar so high, you'll feel like a failure most of the time. He makes sure the medium and small moments that nobody knows about but him get the significance they deserve in his own mind. The challenge, he says, is to avoid being derailed by big, shiny moments that turn other people's heads. 'It's a given that today's star will be tomorrow's stagehand,' he says, meaning that the significance of your work shouldn't be determined by how visible it is to outsiders.Bursts of glory from big moments fade quickly and are eventually remembered only by the participants themselves, no matter who you are. You must accept that the spotlight will move on, or you'll either be hobbled by self-importance or fear nothing else you do will ever measure up, is Colonel Hadfield's advice. It's sad to be mired in the quicksand of bygone celebrity.He reminds us that most people applaud the wrong things anyway. They are impressed by dramatic, record-setting sprints rather than years of dogged perseverance. What really matters isn't the value someone else assigns to a task but how you personally feel while performing it. When you limit success to peak, high-visibility experiences, you're destined to feel unfulfilled. That's why Chris Hadfield urges us to change our own idea of success and lower the bar.Here's my favourite quote from the book.Life is a lot better if you feel you're having ten wins a day, rather than a win every ten years or so!  "
51,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12291273-alex,4,"You know, I actually didn't expect to like this book as much as I did. I'm generally into autobiographies because they're an interesting look into how people work and what makes them tick, but there was something in the first chapter that made me think I wouldn't finish this book. Chris Hadfield talks about knowing from a very young age that he wanted to be an astronaut and that he made a conscious decision to devote his energies to things that might make such a profession possible.""Oh, great,"" I thought. ""This book is going to be a trip through Chris Hadfield's youth as he studies and becomes a fighter pilot... le sigh."" Oh past Alex, how foolish and judgemental you were! Aren't you glad you pushed through the sum total of two pages to include this to actually get to the good stuff? Will you ever stop talking to yourself in second person? Let's read on and find out...There's a tiny amount of Chris Hadfield's past shared in this book, but for the most part it deals with his life as an astronaut, and it's extremely interesting. I have to admit I could probably read an entire book based off of his daily diary in space - goddamn that stuff is cool! - but overall I really liked this book. Little stories about his past and his rise to becoming one of Canada's first astronauts are peppered in between stories in space, both on the ISS and on the old US space shuttle. It also deals with a lot of his training, and very successfully debunks what I believe is quite a common myth: that astronauts are inherently different from regular people.I think the appeal of this book is that the author stays quite humble throughout. ""These are all the things I've done,"" he says, ""but here's all the ways I screwed up, and how I had to change my mindset to actually succeed as an astronaut."" If you've ever thought about leaving the planet, I think this should be required reading - it takes a lot of the mystery behind the space exploration programme and astronauts away and replaced it with an image of a collection of people who, yes, are very smart, but also spend a great deal of their lives preparing for relatively short bouts in space.I also want to recommend the audiobook, as it's narrated by Chris Hadfield himself and, while the audio is a little tinny sometimes, it's still a great listen. Now, I'm off to my bunk to binge-watch Chris Hadfield's YouTube clips taken while in space!"
52,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6594182-hajir-almahdi,5,"As a kid like all kids along making up stuff about how I was an alien, I thought the moon followed our car around and when my dad told me about the first man who ever walked on the moon I was so happy and connected to the stalker white ball. Of course I bragged about knowing Neil Armstrong and like any kid in my place would do I kept asking people who was the first man who walked on the moon. Afterwards I started imagining being an astronaut but that stopped after I decided to be Cat Woman. Now as an adult, I still think astronauts are the shit, but I assume like many of you never thought about what it takes to be one, I mean in the back of my mind I assumed they're just born into the profession.  Reading this book though gave me the kind of insight about what it takes and what you have to go through just to be on a list to go to space ( yup crazy overachievers).  Hadfield is easy going, humorous and has a way with words, and a collection of crazy stories and life experience that makes this a 5 stars read. “When you have some skills but don’t fully understand your environment, there is no way you can be a plus one. At best, you can be a zero. But a zero isn’t a bad thing to be. You’re competent enough not to create problems or make more work for everyone else. And you have to be competent, and prove to others that you are, before you can be extraordinary. There are no shortcuts, unfortunately.”What's a plus one? What's a zero? You have to read the book to make sense of that."
53,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,5,"Chris Hadfield is one of the few 'famous' people I would love to have a dinner with. In addition to being a hopeless space nut, I was also impressed by Colonel's humility, determination, drive, insight, and easy-going manner. His memoir not only offers countless exciting stories of space explorations, astronaut trainings, gruelling selection processes, but also showcases his ability to always live life to its fullest potential. Whether he is in charge of ISS, having drinks with his neighbours while in Russia, or supporting families of other astronauts, he never fails to come off as approachable, smart, and resourceful man. As a fellow Canadian, I salute him. The book is a great ""guide to life on Earth"", as many lessons Chris learned during his career, can be applied to every day life for the rest of us. Now I know that it's okay not to think positive all the time, as it is a sign you are just getting ready for whatever hurdles might be ahead. I've always been criticized for stressing too much, but there is a difference between getting prepared for the worst and sheer panic. It's how you handle the situation that makes all the difference. I wish I had even a tenth of self-discipline and confidence in my path that he does, and this book really makes me strive for it. I think this would be a great read for younger audience as well to give them a good direction in life. And just to make it clear, that dinner offer is still open... *wink wink*"
54,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6954135-kate,4,"Nice, light, feel-good book (even though it took me ages to finish ... has anyone else found their attention span completely shot now social media has dethroned everything else as entertainment?? *sigh*) I liked the second half (description of his command on ISS) much better than the first ... in fact, I will admit to being really disappointed in the first half of the book where I thought Cmdr Hadfield comes off as arrogant and self congratulatory. If I hadn't been familiar with his (and his son Evan's) social media work, I would have probably thought he was a jerk.Ultimately, I felt the book had lots of good, practical life and leadership observations and lessons. Although I thought the first half was a bit arrogant, he does articulate his failings along with his successes and describes the lessons he took from both. The second half of the book expands on the work he started on ""educating the masses"" with the social media campaign, bringing the awe and wonder of space travel to us commoners and making it real. IMO, this truly is the greatest accomplishment and one that has forever changed how many of us think and feel about investments in space programs. His enthusiasm for his work is palpable from start to finish, and he credits so much of his success to the commitment and support of his family."
55,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4776032-cher,3,"3 stars - It was good.So it turns out that I no longer have a dream of going into space. Thanks to Chris' interesting memoir I now realize space journeys are far more dangerous than previously imagined (with a high statistic of something going wrong every single time), daily life in outer space is grosser than I can handle, and even a short time away from mother Earth can wreak havoc on one's body and organs. Instead, I will armchair travel with Chris and other astronauts in the future through books and the Discovery channel. The memoir is written in an extremely approachable manner and Chris presents himself with a charming and humble personality. Often it felt as though the material had been simplified enough to be discussed with middle school or upper elementary school children, but I suppose otherwise I would not have understood much of what the author was conveying. Despite suspecting that, I found myself wishing that the dumbing down of the material was more subtle.-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: When you're the author of your own fate, you don't want to write a tragedy. Aside from anything else, the possibility of a sequel is nonexistent. First Sentence: The windows of a spaceship casually frame miracles."

I can't quite put my finger on it, but I think I was hoping for more insight on how the dynamics of his work ethic played out in family life. He touches on it in brief passages--perhaps it's too painful/personal to acknowledge the impact of continued absences? It's probably none of anyone's business but the Hadfields' own--but I couldn't help wondering, while he was repeating his ""work hard at being a zero"" schtick as an astronaut, how that actually played out when he really *was* at home. I'm not trying to criticize a clearly wonderfully gifted and driven man for pursuing his life's dream, and he clearly treasures his family--but I thought the ""guide to life on Earth"" would have benefited from a focus on those familial relationships, rather than the duties his family performed or functions they filled as his satellites.I'd really like to read a bio by his wife Helene!"
57,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50620706-alaina,4,"An interesting self help book.. even if I had no idea that's what is was going to be BEFORE I dove into it. Kind of saw a book with an interesting title and said - okay, let's do this.An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth will introduce you to Chris Hadfield. Without really knowing an astronaut, I thought it was pretty cool to read about his life. Before space and then after. I can honestly say that this guy is completely dedicated to his work. The way he described space was pretty freaking awesome and it definitely made me think of all the movies that were in space. Ya know.. like Armageddon, Apollo 13, Star Trek, Hidden Figures, and so on and so on. It was always interesting to see what space looked like (in a way) through movies. Since I will never be an astronaut at 28 years old.. because I don't even like flying. At all. It makes me sick. So my fake hopes and dreams of seeing space with my owns eyes.. has quickly died. Maybe I will eventually know someone who has done it or wants to.That being said, this was honestly interesting. Becoming an astronaut never seemed like a easy task for me. So I was glad to see what he went through in order to become one. It was a nice risk for me to take and definitely enjoyable."
58,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666003-silvana,4,"I am not familiar at all with Chris Hadfield before I read this memoir, though this book has been recommended to me for years. I am glad I finish it despite the earlier chapters were pretty dry. As I expected, once he went to space, everything becomes interesting. I spent an hour last night - switching between this book and watching the Canada Space Agency videos at YouTube where he sang, brushed his teeth and prepared to sleep in the ISS. Such a genial person.It is not often that I find a self-development book that's also a memoir. An astronaut, nonetheless. That makes this one pretty unique - I got all the tidbits on space exploration, a human interest story, but also advice on various things in life. Well, some might not very suitable for my needs - everyone's needs and environment require different approaches - but at least I got to think about the proposed approach. I absolutely loved the way he described that it is so much better to be a 'plus' in a team, the one who create and add value, who is ready to help for the sake of the team, because it will also help us at the end. Easier said than done when you sometimes feel you are the one doing all the heavy lifting. Then again, a positive result benefits everyone.The audio version is highly recommended so I added an extra 0.5 star."
59,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25552400-vira,5,"An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth is one of the best books I've read this year. Fun, intelligent and mind-opening, Chris Hadfield's autobiography is an inspiring read about dreams, goals, overcoming obstacles, thinking positive (and negative) and enjoying earthy things. And all things space, of course. You'll find out how astronauts sleep, eat, pee and work out at the International Space Station along with what happens before and after getting there. Read it, I guarantee you won't regret it."

Chris Hadfield replaced that blind admiration to the astronauts we had from our very childhood with the deep respect which may arise out of the strong empathy in me. He explained the tiny little details and intimate atmosphere of being an astronaut. On one hand, he described the technicality of his job, on the other hand, he reflected his inner world as a reflection of that technicality kingdom. The writing style was perfect - it never tired of me. I felt high-level connectedness with the narration. This book especially might be very useful for young people, students or persons who are on their early stage of the career because it motivates via the rooted wisdom of the experienced professional of his field. Overall, I totally recommend this book to everybody who simply wants to have an honest conversation because in its essence it feels like an interactive and honest conversation. "

Interspersed with numerous life lessons, this memoir is definitely a page turner. "
65,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4453896-jeffrey-sylvester,3,"“An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth” by Chris Hadfield was decent but less than expected. What enticed me to buy this book were Hadfield’s comments regarding divinity on George Stroumboulopoulos. During that interview, Stroum mockingly asks Hadfield whether he ever considers spirituality and how he deals with those who are spiritual, as if Hadfield is not spiritual, and as if human derived rationality is the end all, be all, of knowledge. To what I hope was Stroum’s ignorant surprise, Hadfield immediately countered that spirituality is among the forefront of topics astronauts consider and discuss on the International Space Station (ISS). Hadfield went on to explain that given the cultural diversity among astronauts, their beliefs are vastly diverse, and given how beliefs are what got them there, all beliefs are highly respected. Hadfield then described the surreal experience of spacewalk. The magnitude of viewing the majestic beauty of Earth on one side, while staring off into the infinite texture of possibility on the other, and the difficulty in presuming such madness could happen by chance. The inference being, divinity, however defined.I was hoping Hadfield would expand on this experience in his book and was sorely disappointed when he didn’t. This omission inspired me to search the internet for other comments he may have made in different forums to this end and what I found was likewise disappointing. Several orthodox religious groups have taken what Hadfield said on Stroum and have twisted it to suit their own political and narrow-minded purposes, a predictable disincentive for Hadfield to ever broach the topic in the first place, let alone elaborate on it further in printed word.  What I liked about the book were the explanations describing the evolution of the space-program, its cost-benefit as a public good, his informed views on the need for environmental stewardship, and the general challenges associated with space borne discovery. For example, I have always been curious as to why they shelved the shuttle in favor of the Soyuz and he explains this well. I also enjoyed the parallels he drew between the preparations required for New World discovery voyages and space voyages today. What I didn’t enjoy were the often excessive and redundant amounts of detail regarding his personal journey and the walkthrough of solving incessant mechanical blunders during his involvement with various space projects. I think for someone as into it as he is, this is likely exciting, but for a laymen like me it became dizzingly boring. One of the points he is trying to make with it is that astronauts and their teams must “sweat the small stuff” (details) or they run the risk of death and failed expeditions. The only problem is that this level of redundant detail comprises most of the chapters. Overall, I appreciate Hadfield’s attempt to relate the values and discipline required to becoming an astronaut to the lives of regular people but I felt his advice was fairly plebeian in this regard. When I buy an astronaut’s book, I am not looking for “Chicken Soup for the Soul”. I am looking for a revelatory view specific to their rare and privileged view of viewing Earth from space. And beyond the multitude of the intense earthly considerations an astronaut has to make in order to make it to and fro to the ISS, Hadfield’s book doesn’t provide this. It was informative with respect to the space program but otherwise not riveting. Nevertheless, it helped me better appreciate Hadfield as a dedicated Canadian icon, and we can never have enough of those. 3 stars for Hadfield!"
66,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14201634-juliette,3,"First of all, happy 390th birthday to Giovanni Cassini!I am a space geek. I'm still sad that I am not smart enough (or, as Colonel Hadfield would have said, didn't work hard enough) to work for NASA. So sad. But I love learning about the universe, and I'll never give up on learning about it.I picked up this book more for the ""Astronaut"" in the title than for the ""Guide to Life on Earth."" I admire Col. Hadfield very much for bringing scientific education to the under-educated public. Education is his passion, and a lot of this book is fed by his desire to teach laypeople about the various space agencies (and to justify where their tax dollars go).The public sees the spectacular finishes: the Moon landing, the landing of Curiosity on Mars, the technicolor Hubble calendars. It's facile to think that the lives of the people at the space agencies are just a string of glories. We don't see the long hours that the people at the agencies log in order to achieve their glories. If this book is about anything, it is about hard work and perseverance. Colonel Hadfield's hard work and perseverance, his wife's hard work and perseverance, and, he hopes, everyone's hard work and perseverance.The ""Guide"" portion of the book was not as interesting to me as Col. Hadfield's day-to-day life. I learned so many little details about training. (I didn't know that astronauts are required to learn Russian. Stop and think about it for a minute, and it makes sense, but it never occurred to me. I guess I thought of Soyuz as a connecting flight, no biggie. But, no, North American scientists and astronauts are in Russia for a very long time, and it makes sense to learn Russian because their neighbors and coworkers speak Russian.)The parts about learning to be a zero and climbing down the ladder were nice, but, if I'd wanted to learn that, I would have re-read The Gita.I really enjoyed the way that Col. Hadfield wrote about his wife, who seems like a wonderful woman (and her laughing wedding picture is beautiful). I think, if I were to marry, I would be over-the-moon joyful if my husband to think of me with the same humor and awe that is evident when Chris writes of Helene:A lot of people who meet us remark that it can't be easy being married to a highly driven, take-charge overachiever who views moving house as a sport, and I have to confess that is not -- being married to Helene has at times been difficult for me. (pp. 7-8)I have dedicated the book to Helene, as there is no one more deserving and beloved. (Acknowledgements)By the end of the book, I was in love with Helene Hadfield.If you read the book -- and I hope you do, despite my lackluster rating -- it's better to think of the book as a collection of essays rather than a full-fledged memoir. The chapters don't flow into one another. I think I would have given the book a four or five star rating if that thought had come to me earlier."

Insights into what made him strive to be who he is, all while being a great honest person the entire way.It is his career and life, put into words that truly work magically. You will go through different emotions throughout this book, with the eventual hope of giving you the ability to look inside yourself and be the right person you are supposed to be.

If you are willing, his experience's and outlook will be there to provide an example for all of us. This is the reason this book is really such a winner, it is a story about Chris, by Chris, but yet it is something that can touch us all in our own personal ways.

68,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583076-sue-smith,4,"This is a whirlwind look at the life and times of Colonel Chris Hadfield - starting from his first recollections on his aspirations to become an astronaut. His focus on the task is pretty incredible (I can't imagine what I would have accomplished if I'd kept that focused on my goals. Wait - do I have goals? Maybe that is my problem!). It's nice to see that you can go through your life and not have any doubts about what you're doing - or why you're doing it. I didn't pick that path that's for sure.Anyways, it was an interesting look at the space program and his wonderful mission completion that was brought to the attention of the world with the power of the internet and the help of his family to ensure it's successful launching. There were lots of great stories that only a few people will get to experience in their lifetime, but most will experience vicariously through stories such as this. Sounded fascinating truly but I really like terra ferma myself. I love to hear the stories but have no desire to get any higher into the air than what a jet liner will take me, so this was a great book to satisfy that. There wasn't much in the way of guidance to surviving on earth other than the usual tenets - work hard, support each other and focus, focus, focus. Oh - and the old philosophy of 'don't worry, be happy' - all things positive will lead to what you need and want. It's just hard to see that sometimes, so you need to have faith."
69,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6590000-bjoern-rochel,5,"This book was a recommendation of a friend. Definitely worth the read, for a whole variety of reasons. It gives you an insight of what it actually means to be an astronaut. You get a pretty good feel about their routines, their drill and their dedication to the one mission (bringing humanity forward). I had no idea how rigid and daunting the program is. After reading this book, I assume, most readers will look mildly amused at Hollywoods depiction of astronauts. Couldn't be more far off. Armageddon, anyone?Astronauts and the space program as a whole are in my opinion perfect examples of lifelong (super-)learners and knowledge communities. In that regard the book offered a lot of interesting ideas to me that are also applicable for the business world. Not sure how much in reality, but at least it's good to have an interesting role model to look up to.Some things I found in particular interesting:- The anti-specialisation in the skill-set of astronauts- Decision checklists and trees - Being the Zero- Up and downwards climbing of the career latter- Debrief and its implication for future training and simulationsSome final words regarding the writing style: Chris Hadfield seems to be a very humble being. You don't read that too often. He reminds me of the guy that recommended the book to me. Something a lot of us can learn from."
70,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15220884-justin-liew,5,"I read this book mainly because many intelligent, interesting people I know were over the moon about it. (haha). I hadn't paid much attention to Chris Hadfield when he was in the spotlight doing book signings, space music videos, and what not, so I didn't know what to expect. What I got was a humble, intelligent, down to earth (haha) account of a remarkable career and an even more remarkable human being. The book is part biography, part Guide to Life, and it balances the two themes well, giving pieces of story surrounded with simple messages and learnings. It was seriously motivating, and the simple tenets by which he lives his life should be things readers take to heart, as there would be more supportive spouses, team-centric co-workers, and people passionate about their interests. If Chris Hadfield can turn more young people onto science, nature and the wonder of the Universe, that is a good thing. If he can show people how to live a humble life and achieve your dreams, well that's an even better thing."
71,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8525332-andrew,4,"We thought the age of the superstar astronaut had passed, but humble Canadian Chris Hadfield has almost single-handedly made space exciting again. This will become our generation's guide to space exploration and the greatest travel memoir seen in some time.Hadfield's book testifies to both his skill as an astronaut and his genuine warmth and personableness. Tracing his ascent from dreamer, to fighter pilot, to commander of the International Space Station, Hadfield shares his story and much friendly advice about getting on on this planet of ours. The writing is decent, yet has a tone that grows on you. But the hundreds of behind-the-scenes vignettes about training and life in zero-gravity alone make this a worthwhile read.Follow me on Twitter: @Dr_A_Taubman"
72,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4136921-sookie,4,"This memoir reads out like a long conversation with a friend you haven't seen in decades. Hadfield very subtly doles out lessons in life without being too sanctimonious and write mind numbing deep allegories. He experiences his heartbreak and deals with it with dignity and poise. Its amazing how much he has achieved and how much his family worked as a unit to get him there. He never discredits his wife's unquestioned support and the sacrifices that came through the years, her efforts in raising their children and everything she did for the progress of his career. He had a dream and his entire family made him the person he is today - an astronaut and a really amazing guy.His attitude towards life is inspiring and quite simple. His simplicity is evident in his writing. Quite enjoyable memoir whose photographs are what made me look him up in the first place. "

But the tone was a bit stiff; a bit of a dad lecture, and I rolled my eyes just a tiny bit at the earnestness of it all. Nevertheless, kept us company as an audiobook the entire family enjoyed on a long road trip, and I will get a kick out of telling my nine year old that she has one more year to decide what her dream is, and then must spend every second of the rest of her life preparing to achieve it, or else.

Not only was it an absolutely fascinating look at the less-publicized aspects of space travel, but Hadfield's perspectives on perseverance and success are really quite insightful and valuable.

79,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,5,"The word ""inspirational"" gets tossed around a lot, but it's hard to read this and not feel inspired. The book starts a bit slow, focusing on Hadfield's early life and training, but the training gradually becomes more and more intense, and then next thing you know, he's on the launch pad, and the book, well, it takes off. Some of the highlights for me:- The training astronauts go through is extraordinary. They prepare for EVERYTHING, go through every contingency, debrief after every simulation (and especially every ""failure""), assemble everything they've learned across generations of astronauts into a ""flight rules"" book with detailed scenario walkthroughs, and practice these scenarios over and over and over again. They learn an incredible breadth of abilities, from flying, to physics, to chemistry, to biology, to wilderness survival, and so much more. And they do this for years, with only a faint hope of being one of the lucky few who is chosen to go to outer space and put these skills to use. I can't do it any justice; just read the book to get a sense of what it really takes to be an astronaut.- Reading this, you realize that, even if you've dreamt about being an astronaut your whole life, the truth is, you don't actually want to be an astronaut. The amount of training. The constant awareness of the high risks involved and very real chance of dying. The G forces and the very real chance of shitting yourself. The nausea your first days/weeks in space. The always puffy face and constant congestion. The total lack of privacy. The cramped quarters. The inability to properly shower or wash clothes. The intense stress and pressure to not screw up, waste years of effort, billions of dollars, and get people killed.- I love the part where Hadfield describes the preparation for launch. The trip to Baikonur. The quarantine. The parties. The backup crew on a separate bus. The traditions and superstitions, like watching specific movies, peeing on specific things, etc. Gearing up. Cramming into the shuttle / capsule. - The description of life aboard the ISS is even better. Learning what the day to day schedule is like, how they work with crews from other countries, how they eat (and what they eat), exercise (treadmills and vacuum-resistance machines), sleep (in private tubes!), and take care of hygiene and basic bodily needs (this sounds awful), the experiments they run, the views of earth from above, the amount of time it takes to prepare for a space walk, the maintenance they have to constantly do. The story of fixing the ammonia leak is intense!- The story of the insane re-entry procedure of the Soyuz is... something else. The crazy G forces, the ablative heat shield to resist air friction, the crazy crash at the end (with the specially molded seats that prevent your back from breaking on impact)... And then the months of recovery once you've returned from living in zero G's to life on earth (the constant weakness, nausea, foot pain, brittleness of bones, dizziness due to arteries/veins not working as well as they need to, etc). We take for granted what the body does to allow you to live in a gravity well.The writing in the book is a bit mechanical, for lack of a better term, and combined with the slow intro to the book, it's a little hard to get into, but trust me, it's worth sticking with it. The content here is amazing and it makes you appreciate what an accomplishment it is that we have been able to get humans into outer space (and back home!).As always, I've saved a few of my favorite quotes from the book:“If the only thing you really enjoyed was whipping around Earth in a spaceship, you’d hate being an astronaut. The ratio of prep time to time on orbit is many months: single day in space. You train for a few years, minimum, before you’re even assigned to a space mission; training for a specific mission then takes between two and four years, and is much more intensive and rigorous than general training. You practice tricky, repetitive tasks as well as highly challenging ones to the point of exhaustion, and you’re away from home more than half the time. If you don’t love the job, that time will not fly. Nor will the months after a flight, when you’re recovering, undergoing medical testing and debriefing on all kinds of technical and scientific details. Nor will the years of regular training between missions, when you’re recertifying and learning new skills, while helping other astronauts get ready for their flights. If you viewed training as a dreary chore, not only would you be unhappy every day, but your sense of self-worth and professional purpose would be shattered if you were scrubbed from a mission—or never got one.”“It’s almost comical that astronauts are stereotyped as daredevils and cowboys. As a rule, we’re highly methodical and detail-oriented. Our passion isn’t for thrills but for the grindstone, and pressing our noses to it. We have to: we’re responsible for equipment that has cost taxpayers many millions of dollars, and the best insurance policy we have on our lives is our own dedication to training. Studying, simulating, practicing until responses become automatic—astronauts don’t do all this only to fulfill NASA’s requirements. Training is something we do to reduce the odds that we’ll die. Sometimes, as with Challenger and Columbia, a vehicle fails and there’s absolutely nothing the crew can do. But sometimes there is. Astronauts have survived fires on the launch pad and in space, ballistic landings where the Soyuz has come back through the atmosphere like a rock hurled from space—even a collision that punctured a spacecraft and caused sudden depressurization. In a real crisis like that, a group hug isn’t going to save you. Your only hope is knowing exactly what to do and being able to do it calmly and quickly.”“If anything, I’m annoyingly upbeat, at least according to the experts (my family, of course). I tend to expect things will turn out well and they usually do. My optimism and confidence come not from feeling I’m luckier than other mortals, and they sure don’t come from visualizing victory. They’re the result of a lifetime spent visualizing defeat and figuring out how to prevent it.”“In zero gravity, there’s no need for a mattress or pillow; you already feel like you’re resting on a cloud, perfectly supported, so there’s no tossing and turning to find a more comfortable position.”“A lot of what happens to the human body in space is really similar to what happens during the aging process. In post-flight quarantine, in fact, Tom and I tottered around like two old duffers, getting a preview of what life might be like if we made it to 90. Our blood vessels had hardened; our cardiovascular systems had changed. We had shed calcium and minerals in space, so our bones were weaker; so were our muscles, because for 22 hours a day, they’d encountered no resistance whatsoever.”"
80,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth is a mixture of self-help and memoir. Hadfield simply takes some fairly prosaic lessons that he leaned in his efforts to become an astronaut (work hard, pay attention to detail, expect things to go wrong and be ready, train hard, et cetera. The sorts of things they teach you in the Boy Scouts) and then he bolts these concepts onto his various astronaut stories with varying levels of success. At it’s best this book is inspiring, but at it’s worst it can feel like an ex military type is giving you a lecture on being a team player (because that’s exactly what’s happening).The last 1/3 of the book was my favorite. This is where Hadfield lays off the improving lectures and gets into more detail about what life on the ISS is like. Ultimately, he is very likable and able to project a winning sense of humility while telling tales of his impressive accomplishments, and his book is as likable as he is."
81,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70879977-sonali,5,"Are you what a 9-year-old you envisioned yourself to be when you grew up? Well, Chris Hadfield dreamed of becoming an astronaut, and all these years later, he managed to achieve that dream. Back in 1969, for Hadfield to have such a dream was highly ridiculous because Canada didn't even have a space agency of their own! But that didn't stop him, and he talks all about it in this inspirational memoir.From having a little dream and working towards it to becoming the first Canadian astronaut to live aboard the International Space Station to becoming viral for his version of Bob Dylan's Space Oddity (IN SPACE!), Hadfield shares his life story.This book will bring the childlike wonder you had about space back in your eyes, it definitely did that for me. I was a space nerd growing up, and this book rekindled my love for space.Hadfield is so inspiring and optimistic, you'll wonder if this man is for real! But he is a realist as well. I reckon if you have trained all your life about the ways you can die in space, you start 'sweating the small stuff' but enjoy them, too. His advice on trying to become a zero (read to know what I'm talking about!) was the best part about the book.For me, the biggest takeaway from this memoir is that never stop working towards your dream. If you work hard and smart, you'll not only beat all the odds but end up with everything you had ever dreamed of. This book will inspire you, aspire you to be humble, and enjoy the little joys of life. Highly, highly recommended!PS please watch all of Hadfield's videos!"

Perhaps it was the short time span I read it over, but I found the book to be somewhat repetitive - past that, I have nothing bad to say. It was extremely eye opening to hear about the astronaut profession in extreme detail, and Hadfield shares so many incredible stories that had happened throughout his life. I also really respected that he including some of his failures and shortcomings in the text - although they were nothing extreme it certainly helped to humanize this Canadian hero."

This one, for example, left me with an entirely new understanding of what it really takes (and means) to be an astronaut (with a few lessons for life thrown in for good measure)."
85,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6548813-natalie-curiousreader,4,"Chris Hadfield's An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth is a combination of a memoir and something of a modern philosophical work. He blends his own experiences of training to and working as an astronaut with his observations on life, success, purpose, and more. Through looking at a personal journey in space exploration, he connects to the larger picture both to the people he's known and to the world at large. While the writing style can come off as 'self-help'ish in the way he frames his 'advice' and conclusions from personal experience, it's more I think an attempt to humanize astronauts who often end up being 'heroes' in people's minds; people who travel space, as some supernatural creature rather than a human of flesh and blood who worked really hard, and possibly was really lucky. But what I liked best about this book is that it's personal, it's funny, Hadfield shares a lot of anecdotes and he shares his own feelings about things like returning to earth after several months away. There's both I think a lot of genuineness and humor found in this book, which in my personal opinion lends itself well to inviting people into a subject they might not have explored before or otherwise. The book starts off with his becoming an astronaut; education, other work leading up to the job, training for space travels, etc. He moves on to preparations for launch, life up in space, and finishes with the adaption to life back on earth. The way the book is structured is great because it follows, in a much speeded up version of course, the trajectory of a trip to space and back. Peering inside the premises to see everything (and everyone!) necessary to make space travel happen, and facing some of the for me not thought of complications in a life without gravity, was just an utter delight of learning and entertainment rolled into one. The subject of toilet-related things up in space seems to be a crowd-pleaser kind of topic, unsurprisingly, but another example he gives is that crying is a complicated business without the tears actually falling down. Or showers. Or sweating. All activities dependent on drops falling is of course a whole different matter in an environment where everything floats. I really found Hadfield's personality throughout the book to be friendly and welcoming, lighthearted and fun while also acknowledging all the hard work (and money) gone into such an amazing thing as space travel and exploration, and especially the enormous team behind it. His own thoughts spread throughout the book, like the 'aim to be a zero' or 'sweat the small stuff', I also thought were no-nonsense and down to earth (!). While I tend to avoid self-help type books and writing, I didn't find Hadfield's approach annoying or preachy, which might be due to my similarity in thinking to the author. I don't think it's correct to say this book is a self-help book, it's first and foremost a memoir, second a sort of philosophical ramblings of an astronaut, but there are certainly things in the book that could be taken and applied to life generally. However it's always clearly connected both to Hadfield's experience as an astronaut, and to his plans going forward. For example, one thing I liked best was when he talks of the importance in defining your good moments or your happiness yourself. Otherwise, anything after 'gone to space' is failure. Not everyone will be in space of course, but he continues to say that if you only measure your life based on the 'big' moments, you're going to spend a lot of time not happy. Which is possibly very self-evident to some, but I know many that would benefit from taking this advice into account. All in all, a fantastic book that was highly enjoyable from page one to the last word, and that I would gladly both recommend and read again. "
86,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/321673-jamie-collins,3,"3.5 stars, a nice memoir from Hadfield. The first few chapters are perhaps a bit fluffy - a quick overview of how he achieved his lifelong goal of becoming an astronaut, along with some self-help advice - and I’d have been disappointed if the book had continued in that vein, but soon enough he goes into more detail about his career and his three spaceflights.It’s almost amusing to watch Hadfield try to humbly describe how he was the best at everything he ever tried and reached the pinnacle of his profession through hard work and meticulous preparation and the support of a great wife. The man has had, and is still having, a hell of a grand life.He provides interesting details about astronaut training, about his work as a capcom, his work in operations in Russia, and especially about his flights on the shuttle and the Soyuz, and his time on the ISS. In particular I learned some things I didn’t know about Russian customs surrounding space missions. (I had heard that the astronauts and cosmonauts pee on the rear tire of the bus that drops them off at their rocket before their flight, because Gagarin did so. I didn’t know that Russians view the opening of the hatch as the true start of an expedition, and that it’s unlucky to shake hands across the threshold.)I enjoyed his analysis of the difficulties that arise when astronauts, who are “without exception, extremely competitive” must adapt to working as a team, rather than pushing their way into a leadership role.Although he describes a couple of astronauts (no names) who were difficult to work with, he has nothing bad to say about NASA or the CSA. It’s a cheerful, upbeat book, just what you’d expect from Hadfield."
87,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6676926-jenna-falling-letters,4,"A great read! I picked up this book because I wanted to learn more from the man himself about what it's like to be an astronaut (admittedly also because I thought I should read the book before going to his signing...). I was not disappointed! Reading Hadfield's story made me really excited about space and space exploration, uncontainably excited - I felt absolutely exhilarated while reading about Hadfield's final ascent into space and I held my breath during the final days of his time up there, even though I knew what would happen. Reading this book before bed made it difficult to sleep. It's one to think ""Okay, so this guy has been in space, that's so cool"" and another to read his words and be totally astounded at the idea that yes, we can send people into space! It's really an incredible concept, one that I don't think will ever lose its ability to astonish. I was blown away by the amount of knowledge that astronauts must possess - I never really thought about that before, but when there's only three people up there and so many situations that could play out, you really do have to be prepared for anything and be ready to make split second decisions to ensure your own survival. I also enjoyed how Hadfield framed his 'life philosophies' within the context of his career with NASA. This book put a lot about space travel into perspective for me and makes me want to seek out other books by astronauts! Who knows if there will be any other ones as good as this though ;P"
88,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"I’ve been meaning to read this forever, after getting quite into the videos Chris Hadfield posted and the stuff he tweeted when he was on the International Space Station. This is both less glamorous than you’d imagine an astronaut’s book to be, and more practical in terms of actual advice about everyday life. There are details about NASA, about what it’s like to fly a plane or go into space, etc, but there’s also a lot about being a team player, communication with family, and all sorts of ordinary things that maybe you wouldn’t think an astronaut would talk about.Overall, Hadfield comes off as a down to earth (ha) and likeable guy, with a sense of humour about life and humility about his achievements, even though they’re pretty epic achievements. I found his book mostly interesting, although sometimes talking about bureaucracy was just bewilderingly frustrating — and why should he have exploratory surgery to prove that he doesn’t need exploratory surgery again? Aaargh, world, you are weird.It’s mostly not really about being an astronaut. It’s about loving your job, working hard, and trying to be a decent human being. The moments of wonder are there too, but this is mostly about the road taken to get there.Originally posted here."
89,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15984398-laurie,4,"To most people, being in space has got to be one of the coolest but most unimaginable things one can do. All we really envision that astronauts do while they are in space is float around doings flips and playing with water bubbles. I knew, of course, that they actually do lots of science experiments but I was unaware of how much time it takes in their day to do their jobs.This account of Hadfield's career as an astronaut was interesting, and he definitely had a stellar career since he went to space three times with the final time as a commander on the ISS for a few months. Although he was so successful in his profession, he comes across as humble and accessible. Mixed in with the narrative of his trips to space, Hadfield includes advice on things he learned and had to utilize in his daily life as an astronaut which anyone can use. These are things that we are told about in typical self-help books, but he relates them in a way that you really see how they are important are even in a job like his. One of the things that is so obvious throughout this book is that Chris Hadfield is one of the most motivated and driven people I've ever read about. He was a useful and willing cog in a very big corporate machine. Whether some of his advice would work in all professions or not, the lessons are also ones that can be used in one's daily life as well."

Chris Hadfield replaced that blind admiration to the astronauts we had from our very childhood with the deep respect which may arise out of the strong empathy in me. He explained the tiny little details and intimate atmosphere of being an astronaut. On one hand, he described the technicality of his job, on the other hand, he reflected his inner world as a reflection of that technicality kingdom. The writing style was perfect - it never tired of me. I felt high-level connectedness with the narration. This book especially might be very useful for young people, students or persons who are on their early stage of the career because it motivates via the rooted wisdom of the experienced professional of his field. Overall, I totally recommend this book to everybody who simply wants to have an honest conversation because in its essence it feels like an interactive and honest conversation. "

Interspersed with numerous life lessons, this memoir is definitely a page turner. "
95,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4453896-jeffrey-sylvester,3,"“An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth” by Chris Hadfield was decent but less than expected. What enticed me to buy this book were Hadfield’s comments regarding divinity on George Stroumboulopoulos. During that interview, Stroum mockingly asks Hadfield whether he ever considers spirituality and how he deals with those who are spiritual, as if Hadfield is not spiritual, and as if human derived rationality is the end all, be all, of knowledge. To what I hope was Stroum’s ignorant surprise, Hadfield immediately countered that spirituality is among the forefront of topics astronauts consider and discuss on the International Space Station (ISS). Hadfield went on to explain that given the cultural diversity among astronauts, their beliefs are vastly diverse, and given how beliefs are what got them there, all beliefs are highly respected. Hadfield then described the surreal experience of spacewalk. The magnitude of viewing the majestic beauty of Earth on one side, while staring off into the infinite texture of possibility on the other, and the difficulty in presuming such madness could happen by chance. The inference being, divinity, however defined.I was hoping Hadfield would expand on this experience in his book and was sorely disappointed when he didn’t. This omission inspired me to search the internet for other comments he may have made in different forums to this end and what I found was likewise disappointing. Several orthodox religious groups have taken what Hadfield said on Stroum and have twisted it to suit their own political and narrow-minded purposes, a predictable disincentive for Hadfield to ever broach the topic in the first place, let alone elaborate on it further in printed word.  What I liked about the book were the explanations describing the evolution of the space-program, its cost-benefit as a public good, his informed views on the need for environmental stewardship, and the general challenges associated with space borne discovery. For example, I have always been curious as to why they shelved the shuttle in favor of the Soyuz and he explains this well. I also enjoyed the parallels he drew between the preparations required for New World discovery voyages and space voyages today. What I didn’t enjoy were the often excessive and redundant amounts of detail regarding his personal journey and the walkthrough of solving incessant mechanical blunders during his involvement with various space projects. I think for someone as into it as he is, this is likely exciting, but for a laymen like me it became dizzingly boring. One of the points he is trying to make with it is that astronauts and their teams must “sweat the small stuff” (details) or they run the risk of death and failed expeditions. The only problem is that this level of redundant detail comprises most of the chapters. Overall, I appreciate Hadfield’s attempt to relate the values and discipline required to becoming an astronaut to the lives of regular people but I felt his advice was fairly plebeian in this regard. When I buy an astronaut’s book, I am not looking for “Chicken Soup for the Soul”. I am looking for a revelatory view specific to their rare and privileged view of viewing Earth from space. And beyond the multitude of the intense earthly considerations an astronaut has to make in order to make it to and fro to the ISS, Hadfield’s book doesn’t provide this. It was informative with respect to the space program but otherwise not riveting. Nevertheless, it helped me better appreciate Hadfield as a dedicated Canadian icon, and we can never have enough of those. 3 stars for Hadfield!"
96,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14201634-juliette,3,"First of all, happy 390th birthday to Giovanni Cassini!I am a space geek. I'm still sad that I am not smart enough (or, as Colonel Hadfield would have said, didn't work hard enough) to work for NASA. So sad. But I love learning about the universe, and I'll never give up on learning about it.I picked up this book more for the ""Astronaut"" in the title than for the ""Guide to Life on Earth."" I admire Col. Hadfield very much for bringing scientific education to the under-educated public. Education is his passion, and a lot of this book is fed by his desire to teach laypeople about the various space agencies (and to justify where their tax dollars go).The public sees the spectacular finishes: the Moon landing, the landing of Curiosity on Mars, the technicolor Hubble calendars. It's facile to think that the lives of the people at the space agencies are just a string of glories. We don't see the long hours that the people at the agencies log in order to achieve their glories. If this book is about anything, it is about hard work and perseverance. Colonel Hadfield's hard work and perseverance, his wife's hard work and perseverance, and, he hopes, everyone's hard work and perseverance.The ""Guide"" portion of the book was not as interesting to me as Col. Hadfield's day-to-day life. I learned so many little details about training. (I didn't know that astronauts are required to learn Russian. Stop and think about it for a minute, and it makes sense, but it never occurred to me. I guess I thought of Soyuz as a connecting flight, no biggie. But, no, North American scientists and astronauts are in Russia for a very long time, and it makes sense to learn Russian because their neighbors and coworkers speak Russian.)The parts about learning to be a zero and climbing down the ladder were nice, but, if I'd wanted to learn that, I would have re-read The Gita.I really enjoyed the way that Col. Hadfield wrote about his wife, who seems like a wonderful woman (and her laughing wedding picture is beautiful). I think, if I were to marry, I would be over-the-moon joyful if my husband to think of me with the same humor and awe that is evident when Chris writes of Helene:A lot of people who meet us remark that it can't be easy being married to a highly driven, take-charge overachiever who views moving house as a sport, and I have to confess that is not -- being married to Helene has at times been difficult for me. (pp. 7-8)I have dedicated the book to Helene, as there is no one more deserving and beloved. (Acknowledgements)By the end of the book, I was in love with Helene Hadfield.If you read the book -- and I hope you do, despite my lackluster rating -- it's better to think of the book as a collection of essays rather than a full-fledged memoir. The chapters don't flow into one another. I think I would have given the book a four or five star rating if that thought had come to me earlier."

98,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583076-sue-smith,4,"This is a whirlwind look at the life and times of Colonel Chris Hadfield - starting from his first recollections on his aspirations to become an astronaut. His focus on the task is pretty incredible (I can't imagine what I would have accomplished if I'd kept that focused on my goals. Wait - do I have goals? Maybe that is my problem!). It's nice to see that you can go through your life and not have any doubts about what you're doing - or why you're doing it. I didn't pick that path that's for sure.Anyways, it was an interesting look at the space program and his wonderful mission completion that was brought to the attention of the world with the power of the internet and the help of his family to ensure it's successful launching. There were lots of great stories that only a few people will get to experience in their lifetime, but most will experience vicariously through stories such as this. Sounded fascinating truly but I really like terra ferma myself. I love to hear the stories but have no desire to get any higher into the air than what a jet liner will take me, so this was a great book to satisfy that. There wasn't much in the way of guidance to surviving on earth other than the usual tenets - work hard, support each other and focus, focus, focus. Oh - and the old philosophy of 'don't worry, be happy' - all things positive will lead to what you need and want. It's just hard to see that sometimes, so you need to have faith."
99,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6590000-bjoern-rochel,5,"This book was a recommendation of a friend. Definitely worth the read, for a whole variety of reasons. It gives you an insight of what it actually means to be an astronaut. You get a pretty good feel about their routines, their drill and their dedication to the one mission (bringing humanity forward). I had no idea how rigid and daunting the program is. After reading this book, I assume, most readers will look mildly amused at Hollywoods depiction of astronauts. Couldn't be more far off. Armageddon, anyone?Astronauts and the space program as a whole are in my opinion perfect examples of lifelong (super-)learners and knowledge communities. In that regard the book offered a lot of interesting ideas to me that are also applicable for the business world. Not sure how much in reality, but at least it's good to have an interesting role model to look up to.Some things I found in particular interesting:- The anti-specialisation in the skill-set of astronauts- Decision checklists and trees - Being the Zero- Up and downwards climbing of the career latter- Debrief and its implication for future training and simulationsSome final words regarding the writing style: Chris Hadfield seems to be a very humble being. You don't read that too often. He reminds me of the guy that recommended the book to me. Something a lot of us can learn from."
100,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15220884-justin-liew,5,"I read this book mainly because many intelligent, interesting people I know were over the moon about it. (haha). I hadn't paid much attention to Chris Hadfield when he was in the spotlight doing book signings, space music videos, and what not, so I didn't know what to expect. What I got was a humble, intelligent, down to earth (haha) account of a remarkable career and an even more remarkable human being. The book is part biography, part Guide to Life, and it balances the two themes well, giving pieces of story surrounded with simple messages and learnings. It was seriously motivating, and the simple tenets by which he lives his life should be things readers take to heart, as there would be more supportive spouses, team-centric co-workers, and people passionate about their interests. If Chris Hadfield can turn more young people onto science, nature and the wonder of the Universe, that is a good thing. If he can show people how to live a humble life and achieve your dreams, well that's an even better thing."
101,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8525332-andrew,4,"We thought the age of the superstar astronaut had passed, but humble Canadian Chris Hadfield has almost single-handedly made space exciting again. This will become our generation's guide to space exploration and the greatest travel memoir seen in some time.Hadfield's book testifies to both his skill as an astronaut and his genuine warmth and personableness. Tracing his ascent from dreamer, to fighter pilot, to commander of the International Space Station, Hadfield shares his story and much friendly advice about getting on on this planet of ours. The writing is decent, yet has a tone that grows on you. But the hundreds of behind-the-scenes vignettes about training and life in zero-gravity alone make this a worthwhile read.Follow me on Twitter: @Dr_A_Taubman"
102,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4136921-sookie,4,"This memoir reads out like a long conversation with a friend you haven't seen in decades. Hadfield very subtly doles out lessons in life without being too sanctimonious and write mind numbing deep allegories. He experiences his heartbreak and deals with it with dignity and poise. Its amazing how much he has achieved and how much his family worked as a unit to get him there. He never discredits his wife's unquestioned support and the sacrifices that came through the years, her efforts in raising their children and everything she did for the progress of his career. He had a dream and his entire family made him the person he is today - an astronaut and a really amazing guy.His attitude towards life is inspiring and quite simple. His simplicity is evident in his writing. Quite enjoyable memoir whose photographs are what made me look him up in the first place. "

But the tone was a bit stiff; a bit of a dad lecture, and I rolled my eyes just a tiny bit at the earnestness of it all. Nevertheless, kept us company as an audiobook the entire family enjoyed on a long road trip, and I will get a kick out of telling my nine year old that she has one more year to decide what her dream is, and then must spend every second of the rest of her life preparing to achieve it, or else.

Not only was it an absolutely fascinating look at the less-publicized aspects of space travel, but Hadfield's perspectives on perseverance and success are really quite insightful and valuable.

108,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57158143-bibliovoracious,5,"Yep, the hype's all true. An excellent book, with memorable insights into life on the orbiting ISS and into what it's like to be a massive over-achiever."
109,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,5,"The word ""inspirational"" gets tossed around a lot, but it's hard to read this and not feel inspired. The book starts a bit slow, focusing on Hadfield's early life and training, but the training gradually becomes more and more intense, and then next thing you know, he's on the launch pad, and the book, well, it takes off. Some of the highlights for me:- The training astronauts go through is extraordinary. They prepare for EVERYTHING, go through every contingency, debrief after every simulation (and especially every ""failure""), assemble everything they've learned across generations of astronauts into a ""flight rules"" book with detailed scenario walkthroughs, and practice these scenarios over and over and over again. They learn an incredible breadth of abilities, from flying, to physics, to chemistry, to biology, to wilderness survival, and so much more. And they do this for years, with only a faint hope of being one of the lucky few who is chosen to go to outer space and put these skills to use. I can't do it any justice; just read the book to get a sense of what it really takes to be an astronaut.- Reading this, you realize that, even if you've dreamt about being an astronaut your whole life, the truth is, you don't actually want to be an astronaut. The amount of training. The constant awareness of the high risks involved and very real chance of dying. The G forces and the very real chance of shitting yourself. The nausea your first days/weeks in space. The always puffy face and constant congestion. The total lack of privacy. The cramped quarters. The inability to properly shower or wash clothes. The intense stress and pressure to not screw up, waste years of effort, billions of dollars, and get people killed.- I love the part where Hadfield describes the preparation for launch. The trip to Baikonur. The quarantine. The parties. The backup crew on a separate bus. The traditions and superstitions, like watching specific movies, peeing on specific things, etc. Gearing up. Cramming into the shuttle / capsule. - The description of life aboard the ISS is even better. Learning what the day to day schedule is like, how they work with crews from other countries, how they eat (and what they eat), exercise (treadmills and vacuum-resistance machines), sleep (in private tubes!), and take care of hygiene and basic bodily needs (this sounds awful), the experiments they run, the views of earth from above, the amount of time it takes to prepare for a space walk, the maintenance they have to constantly do. The story of fixing the ammonia leak is intense!- The story of the insane re-entry procedure of the Soyuz is... something else. The crazy G forces, the ablative heat shield to resist air friction, the crazy crash at the end (with the specially molded seats that prevent your back from breaking on impact)... And then the months of recovery once you've returned from living in zero G's to life on earth (the constant weakness, nausea, foot pain, brittleness of bones, dizziness due to arteries/veins not working as well as they need to, etc). We take for granted what the body does to allow you to live in a gravity well.The writing in the book is a bit mechanical, for lack of a better term, and combined with the slow intro to the book, it's a little hard to get into, but trust me, it's worth sticking with it. The content here is amazing and it makes you appreciate what an accomplishment it is that we have been able to get humans into outer space (and back home!).As always, I've saved a few of my favorite quotes from the book:“If the only thing you really enjoyed was whipping around Earth in a spaceship, you’d hate being an astronaut. The ratio of prep time to time on orbit is many months: single day in space. You train for a few years, minimum, before you’re even assigned to a space mission; training for a specific mission then takes between two and four years, and is much more intensive and rigorous than general training. You practice tricky, repetitive tasks as well as highly challenging ones to the point of exhaustion, and you’re away from home more than half the time. If you don’t love the job, that time will not fly. Nor will the months after a flight, when you’re recovering, undergoing medical testing and debriefing on all kinds of technical and scientific details. Nor will the years of regular training between missions, when you’re recertifying and learning new skills, while helping other astronauts get ready for their flights. If you viewed training as a dreary chore, not only would you be unhappy every day, but your sense of self-worth and professional purpose would be shattered if you were scrubbed from a mission—or never got one.”“It’s almost comical that astronauts are stereotyped as daredevils and cowboys. As a rule, we’re highly methodical and detail-oriented. Our passion isn’t for thrills but for the grindstone, and pressing our noses to it. We have to: we’re responsible for equipment that has cost taxpayers many millions of dollars, and the best insurance policy we have on our lives is our own dedication to training. Studying, simulating, practicing until responses become automatic—astronauts don’t do all this only to fulfill NASA’s requirements. Training is something we do to reduce the odds that we’ll die. Sometimes, as with Challenger and Columbia, a vehicle fails and there’s absolutely nothing the crew can do. But sometimes there is. Astronauts have survived fires on the launch pad and in space, ballistic landings where the Soyuz has come back through the atmosphere like a rock hurled from space—even a collision that punctured a spacecraft and caused sudden depressurization. In a real crisis like that, a group hug isn’t going to save you. Your only hope is knowing exactly what to do and being able to do it calmly and quickly.”“If anything, I’m annoyingly upbeat, at least according to the experts (my family, of course). I tend to expect things will turn out well and they usually do. My optimism and confidence come not from feeling I’m luckier than other mortals, and they sure don’t come from visualizing victory. They’re the result of a lifetime spent visualizing defeat and figuring out how to prevent it.”“In zero gravity, there’s no need for a mattress or pillow; you already feel like you’re resting on a cloud, perfectly supported, so there’s no tossing and turning to find a more comfortable position.”“A lot of what happens to the human body in space is really similar to what happens during the aging process. In post-flight quarantine, in fact, Tom and I tottered around like two old duffers, getting a preview of what life might be like if we made it to 90. Our blood vessels had hardened; our cardiovascular systems had changed. We had shed calcium and minerals in space, so our bones were weaker; so were our muscles, because for 22 hours a day, they’d encountered no resistance whatsoever.”"
110,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth is a mixture of self-help and memoir. Hadfield simply takes some fairly prosaic lessons that he leaned in his efforts to become an astronaut (work hard, pay attention to detail, expect things to go wrong and be ready, train hard, et cetera. The sorts of things they teach you in the Boy Scouts) and then he bolts these concepts onto his various astronaut stories with varying levels of success. At it’s best this book is inspiring, but at it’s worst it can feel like an ex military type is giving you a lecture on being a team player (because that’s exactly what’s happening).The last 1/3 of the book was my favorite. This is where Hadfield lays off the improving lectures and gets into more detail about what life on the ISS is like. Ultimately, he is very likable and able to project a winning sense of humility while telling tales of his impressive accomplishments, and his book is as likable as he is."
111,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70879977-sonali,5,"Are you what a 9-year-old you envisioned yourself to be when you grew up? Well, Chris Hadfield dreamed of becoming an astronaut, and all these years later, he managed to achieve that dream. Back in 1969, for Hadfield to have such a dream was highly ridiculous because Canada didn't even have a space agency of their own! But that didn't stop him, and he talks all about it in this inspirational memoir.From having a little dream and working towards it to becoming the first Canadian astronaut to live aboard the International Space Station to becoming viral for his version of Bob Dylan's Space Oddity (IN SPACE!), Hadfield shares his life story.This book will bring the childlike wonder you had about space back in your eyes, it definitely did that for me. I was a space nerd growing up, and this book rekindled my love for space.Hadfield is so inspiring and optimistic, you'll wonder if this man is for real! But he is a realist as well. I reckon if you have trained all your life about the ways you can die in space, you start 'sweating the small stuff' but enjoy them, too. His advice on trying to become a zero (read to know what I'm talking about!) was the best part about the book.For me, the biggest takeaway from this memoir is that never stop working towards your dream. If you work hard and smart, you'll not only beat all the odds but end up with everything you had ever dreamed of. This book will inspire you, aspire you to be humble, and enjoy the little joys of life. Highly, highly recommended!PS please watch all of Hadfield's videos!"

Perhaps it was the short time span I read it over, but I found the book to be somewhat repetitive - past that, I have nothing bad to say. It was extremely eye opening to hear about the astronaut profession in extreme detail, and Hadfield shares so many incredible stories that had happened throughout his life. I also really respected that he including some of his failures and shortcomings in the text - although they were nothing extreme it certainly helped to humanize this Canadian hero."

This one, for example, left me with an entirely new understanding of what it really takes (and means) to be an astronaut (with a few lessons for life thrown in for good measure)."
115,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6548813-natalie-curiousreader,4,"Chris Hadfield's An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth is a combination of a memoir and something of a modern philosophical work. He blends his own experiences of training to and working as an astronaut with his observations on life, success, purpose, and more. Through looking at a personal journey in space exploration, he connects to the larger picture both to the people he's known and to the world at large. While the writing style can come off as 'self-help'ish in the way he frames his 'advice' and conclusions from personal experience, it's more I think an attempt to humanize astronauts who often end up being 'heroes' in people's minds; people who travel space, as some supernatural creature rather than a human of flesh and blood who worked really hard, and possibly was really lucky. But what I liked best about this book is that it's personal, it's funny, Hadfield shares a lot of anecdotes and he shares his own feelings about things like returning to earth after several months away. There's both I think a lot of genuineness and humor found in this book, which in my personal opinion lends itself well to inviting people into a subject they might not have explored before or otherwise. The book starts off with his becoming an astronaut; education, other work leading up to the job, training for space travels, etc. He moves on to preparations for launch, life up in space, and finishes with the adaption to life back on earth. The way the book is structured is great because it follows, in a much speeded up version of course, the trajectory of a trip to space and back. Peering inside the premises to see everything (and everyone!) necessary to make space travel happen, and facing some of the for me not thought of complications in a life without gravity, was just an utter delight of learning and entertainment rolled into one. The subject of toilet-related things up in space seems to be a crowd-pleaser kind of topic, unsurprisingly, but another example he gives is that crying is a complicated business without the tears actually falling down. Or showers. Or sweating. All activities dependent on drops falling is of course a whole different matter in an environment where everything floats. I really found Hadfield's personality throughout the book to be friendly and welcoming, lighthearted and fun while also acknowledging all the hard work (and money) gone into such an amazing thing as space travel and exploration, and especially the enormous team behind it. His own thoughts spread throughout the book, like the 'aim to be a zero' or 'sweat the small stuff', I also thought were no-nonsense and down to earth (!). While I tend to avoid self-help type books and writing, I didn't find Hadfield's approach annoying or preachy, which might be due to my similarity in thinking to the author. I don't think it's correct to say this book is a self-help book, it's first and foremost a memoir, second a sort of philosophical ramblings of an astronaut, but there are certainly things in the book that could be taken and applied to life generally. However it's always clearly connected both to Hadfield's experience as an astronaut, and to his plans going forward. For example, one thing I liked best was when he talks of the importance in defining your good moments or your happiness yourself. Otherwise, anything after 'gone to space' is failure. Not everyone will be in space of course, but he continues to say that if you only measure your life based on the 'big' moments, you're going to spend a lot of time not happy. Which is possibly very self-evident to some, but I know many that would benefit from taking this advice into account. All in all, a fantastic book that was highly enjoyable from page one to the last word, and that I would gladly both recommend and read again. "
116,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/321673-jamie-collins,3,"3.5 stars, a nice memoir from Hadfield. The first few chapters are perhaps a bit fluffy - a quick overview of how he achieved his lifelong goal of becoming an astronaut, along with some self-help advice - and I’d have been disappointed if the book had continued in that vein, but soon enough he goes into more detail about his career and his three spaceflights.It’s almost amusing to watch Hadfield try to humbly describe how he was the best at everything he ever tried and reached the pinnacle of his profession through hard work and meticulous preparation and the support of a great wife. The man has had, and is still having, a hell of a grand life.He provides interesting details about astronaut training, about his work as a capcom, his work in operations in Russia, and especially about his flights on the shuttle and the Soyuz, and his time on the ISS. In particular I learned some things I didn’t know about Russian customs surrounding space missions. (I had heard that the astronauts and cosmonauts pee on the rear tire of the bus that drops them off at their rocket before their flight, because Gagarin did so. I didn’t know that Russians view the opening of the hatch as the true start of an expedition, and that it’s unlucky to shake hands across the threshold.)I enjoyed his analysis of the difficulties that arise when astronauts, who are “without exception, extremely competitive” must adapt to working as a team, rather than pushing their way into a leadership role.Although he describes a couple of astronauts (no names) who were difficult to work with, he has nothing bad to say about NASA or the CSA. It’s a cheerful, upbeat book, just what you’d expect from Hadfield."
117,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6676926-jenna-falling-letters,4,"A great read! I picked up this book because I wanted to learn more from the man himself about what it's like to be an astronaut (admittedly also because I thought I should read the book before going to his signing...). I was not disappointed! Reading Hadfield's story made me really excited about space and space exploration, uncontainably excited - I felt absolutely exhilarated while reading about Hadfield's final ascent into space and I held my breath during the final days of his time up there, even though I knew what would happen. Reading this book before bed made it difficult to sleep. It's one to think ""Okay, so this guy has been in space, that's so cool"" and another to read his words and be totally astounded at the idea that yes, we can send people into space! It's really an incredible concept, one that I don't think will ever lose its ability to astonish. I was blown away by the amount of knowledge that astronauts must possess - I never really thought about that before, but when there's only three people up there and so many situations that could play out, you really do have to be prepared for anything and be ready to make split second decisions to ensure your own survival. I also enjoyed how Hadfield framed his 'life philosophies' within the context of his career with NASA. This book put a lot about space travel into perspective for me and makes me want to seek out other books by astronauts! Who knows if there will be any other ones as good as this though ;P"
118,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"I’ve been meaning to read this forever, after getting quite into the videos Chris Hadfield posted and the stuff he tweeted when he was on the International Space Station. This is both less glamorous than you’d imagine an astronaut’s book to be, and more practical in terms of actual advice about everyday life. There are details about NASA, about what it’s like to fly a plane or go into space, etc, but there’s also a lot about being a team player, communication with family, and all sorts of ordinary things that maybe you wouldn’t think an astronaut would talk about.Overall, Hadfield comes off as a down to earth (ha) and likeable guy, with a sense of humour about life and humility about his achievements, even though they’re pretty epic achievements. I found his book mostly interesting, although sometimes talking about bureaucracy was just bewilderingly frustrating — and why should he have exploratory surgery to prove that he doesn’t need exploratory surgery again? Aaargh, world, you are weird.It’s mostly not really about being an astronaut. It’s about loving your job, working hard, and trying to be a decent human being. The moments of wonder are there too, but this is mostly about the road taken to get there.Originally posted here."
119,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15984398-laurie,4,"To most people, being in space has got to be one of the coolest but most unimaginable things one can do. All we really envision that astronauts do while they are in space is float around doings flips and playing with water bubbles. I knew, of course, that they actually do lots of science experiments but I was unaware of how much time it takes in their day to do their jobs.This account of Hadfield's career as an astronaut was interesting, and he definitely had a stellar career since he went to space three times with the final time as a commander on the ISS for a few months. Although he was so successful in his profession, he comes across as humble and accessible. Mixed in with the narrative of his trips to space, Hadfield includes advice on things he learned and had to utilize in his daily life as an astronaut which anyone can use. These are things that we are told about in typical self-help books, but he relates them in a way that you really see how they are important are even in a job like his. One of the things that is so obvious throughout this book is that Chris Hadfield is one of the most motivated and driven people I've ever read about. He was a useful and willing cog in a very big corporate machine. Whether some of his advice would work in all professions or not, the lessons are also ones that can be used in one's daily life as well."

Love the way he sees the world and explains his point of view and I thinks lot of people could benefit from it in their professional lives instead of going to self help and productivity type media every time they hit a hurdle - I know I'll try to !
121,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79761705-lea,5,I finally finished this one and now I really need to write down all the quotes I loved. What a fantastic read at such a demanding time in my life. 
122,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40473382-ibrahim-niftiyev,5,"Finally, I finished this book and I am very happy that after a while I was able to read something really interesting and high quality. Chris Hadfield replaced that blind admiration to the astronauts we had from our very childhood with the deep respect which may arise out of the strong empathy in me. He explained the tiny little details and intimate atmosphere of being an astronaut. On one hand, he described the technicality of his job, on the other hand, he reflected his inner world as a reflection of that technicality kingdom. The writing style was perfect - it never tired of me. I felt high-level connectedness with the narration. This book especially might be very useful for young people, students or persons who are on their early stage of the career because it motivates via the rooted wisdom of the experienced professional of his field. Overall, I totally recommend this book to everybody who simply wants to have an honest conversation because in its essence it feels like an interactive and honest conversation. "
123,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1439381-maj,5,This book filled me with joy.I seriously consider reading it again straight away!
124,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55590750-neeti,5,"A memorable and immensely interesting insight into the Space program and the life of an astronaut.You'd be surprised to to see that a vast majority of an astronaut's life unfolds on earth and not in space :) I love that Hadfield comes across as refreshingly modest and grounded. Interspersed with numerous life lessons, this memoir is definitely a page turner. "
125,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4453896-jeffrey-sylvester,3,"“An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth” by Chris Hadfield was decent but less than expected. What enticed me to buy this book were Hadfield’s comments regarding divinity on George Stroumboulopoulos. During that interview, Stroum mockingly asks Hadfield whether he ever considers spirituality and how he deals with those who are spiritual, as if Hadfield is not spiritual, and as if human derived rationality is the end all, be all, of knowledge. To what I hope was Stroum’s ignorant surprise, Hadfield immediately countered that spirituality is among the forefront of topics astronauts consider and discuss on the International Space Station (ISS). Hadfield went on to explain that given the cultural diversity among astronauts, their beliefs are vastly diverse, and given how beliefs are what got them there, all beliefs are highly respected. Hadfield then described the surreal experience of spacewalk. The magnitude of viewing the majestic beauty of Earth on one side, while staring off into the infinite texture of possibility on the other, and the difficulty in presuming such madness could happen by chance. The inference being, divinity, however defined.I was hoping Hadfield would expand on this experience in his book and was sorely disappointed when he didn’t. This omission inspired me to search the internet for other comments he may have made in different forums to this end and what I found was likewise disappointing. Several orthodox religious groups have taken what Hadfield said on Stroum and have twisted it to suit their own political and narrow-minded purposes, a predictable disincentive for Hadfield to ever broach the topic in the first place, let alone elaborate on it further in printed word.  What I liked about the book were the explanations describing the evolution of the space-program, its cost-benefit as a public good, his informed views on the need for environmental stewardship, and the general challenges associated with space borne discovery. For example, I have always been curious as to why they shelved the shuttle in favor of the Soyuz and he explains this well. I also enjoyed the parallels he drew between the preparations required for New World discovery voyages and space voyages today. What I didn’t enjoy were the often excessive and redundant amounts of detail regarding his personal journey and the walkthrough of solving incessant mechanical blunders during his involvement with various space projects. I think for someone as into it as he is, this is likely exciting, but for a laymen like me it became dizzingly boring. One of the points he is trying to make with it is that astronauts and their teams must “sweat the small stuff” (details) or they run the risk of death and failed expeditions. The only problem is that this level of redundant detail comprises most of the chapters. Overall, I appreciate Hadfield’s attempt to relate the values and discipline required to becoming an astronaut to the lives of regular people but I felt his advice was fairly plebeian in this regard. When I buy an astronaut’s book, I am not looking for “Chicken Soup for the Soul”. I am looking for a revelatory view specific to their rare and privileged view of viewing Earth from space. And beyond the multitude of the intense earthly considerations an astronaut has to make in order to make it to and fro to the ISS, Hadfield’s book doesn’t provide this. It was informative with respect to the space program but otherwise not riveting. Nevertheless, it helped me better appreciate Hadfield as a dedicated Canadian icon, and we can never have enough of those. 3 stars for Hadfield!"
126,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14201634-juliette,3,"First of all, happy 390th birthday to Giovanni Cassini!I am a space geek. I'm still sad that I am not smart enough (or, as Colonel Hadfield would have said, didn't work hard enough) to work for NASA. So sad. But I love learning about the universe, and I'll never give up on learning about it.I picked up this book more for the ""Astronaut"" in the title than for the ""Guide to Life on Earth."" I admire Col. Hadfield very much for bringing scientific education to the under-educated public. Education is his passion, and a lot of this book is fed by his desire to teach laypeople about the various space agencies (and to justify where their tax dollars go).The public sees the spectacular finishes: the Moon landing, the landing of Curiosity on Mars, the technicolor Hubble calendars. It's facile to think that the lives of the people at the space agencies are just a string of glories. We don't see the long hours that the people at the agencies log in order to achieve their glories. If this book is about anything, it is about hard work and perseverance. Colonel Hadfield's hard work and perseverance, his wife's hard work and perseverance, and, he hopes, everyone's hard work and perseverance.The ""Guide"" portion of the book was not as interesting to me as Col. Hadfield's day-to-day life. I learned so many little details about training. (I didn't know that astronauts are required to learn Russian. Stop and think about it for a minute, and it makes sense, but it never occurred to me. I guess I thought of Soyuz as a connecting flight, no biggie. But, no, North American scientists and astronauts are in Russia for a very long time, and it makes sense to learn Russian because their neighbors and coworkers speak Russian.)The parts about learning to be a zero and climbing down the ladder were nice, but, if I'd wanted to learn that, I would have re-read The Gita.I really enjoyed the way that Col. Hadfield wrote about his wife, who seems like a wonderful woman (and her laughing wedding picture is beautiful). I think, if I were to marry, I would be over-the-moon joyful if my husband to think of me with the same humor and awe that is evident when Chris writes of Helene:A lot of people who meet us remark that it can't be easy being married to a highly driven, take-charge overachiever who views moving house as a sport, and I have to confess that is not -- being married to Helene has at times been difficult for me. (pp. 7-8)I have dedicated the book to Helene, as there is no one more deserving and beloved. (Acknowledgements)By the end of the book, I was in love with Helene Hadfield.If you read the book -- and I hope you do, despite my lackluster rating -- it's better to think of the book as a collection of essays rather than a full-fledged memoir. The chapters don't flow into one another. I think I would have given the book a four or five star rating if that thought had come to me earlier."

Insights into what made him strive to be who he is, all while being a great honest person the entire way.It is his career and life, put into words that truly work magically. You will go through different emotions throughout this book, with the eventual hope of giving you the ability to look inside yourself and be the right person you are supposed to be.

If you are willing, his experience's and outlook will be there to provide an example for all of us. This is the reason this book is really such a winner, it is a story about Chris, by Chris, but yet it is something that can touch us all in our own personal ways.

128,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583076-sue-smith,4,"This is a whirlwind look at the life and times of Colonel Chris Hadfield - starting from his first recollections on his aspirations to become an astronaut. His focus on the task is pretty incredible (I can't imagine what I would have accomplished if I'd kept that focused on my goals. Wait - do I have goals? Maybe that is my problem!). It's nice to see that you can go through your life and not have any doubts about what you're doing - or why you're doing it. I didn't pick that path that's for sure.Anyways, it was an interesting look at the space program and his wonderful mission completion that was brought to the attention of the world with the power of the internet and the help of his family to ensure it's successful launching. There were lots of great stories that only a few people will get to experience in their lifetime, but most will experience vicariously through stories such as this. Sounded fascinating truly but I really like terra ferma myself. I love to hear the stories but have no desire to get any higher into the air than what a jet liner will take me, so this was a great book to satisfy that. There wasn't much in the way of guidance to surviving on earth other than the usual tenets - work hard, support each other and focus, focus, focus. Oh - and the old philosophy of 'don't worry, be happy' - all things positive will lead to what you need and want. It's just hard to see that sometimes, so you need to have faith."
129,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6590000-bjoern-rochel,5,"This book was a recommendation of a friend. Definitely worth the read, for a whole variety of reasons. It gives you an insight of what it actually means to be an astronaut. You get a pretty good feel about their routines, their drill and their dedication to the one mission (bringing humanity forward). I had no idea how rigid and daunting the program is. After reading this book, I assume, most readers will look mildly amused at Hollywoods depiction of astronauts. Couldn't be more far off. Armageddon, anyone?Astronauts and the space program as a whole are in my opinion perfect examples of lifelong (super-)learners and knowledge communities. In that regard the book offered a lot of interesting ideas to me that are also applicable for the business world. Not sure how much in reality, but at least it's good to have an interesting role model to look up to.Some things I found in particular interesting:- The anti-specialisation in the skill-set of astronauts- Decision checklists and trees - Being the Zero- Up and downwards climbing of the career latter- Debrief and its implication for future training and simulationsSome final words regarding the writing style: Chris Hadfield seems to be a very humble being. You don't read that too often. He reminds me of the guy that recommended the book to me. Something a lot of us can learn from."
130,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15220884-justin-liew,5,"I read this book mainly because many intelligent, interesting people I know were over the moon about it. (haha). I hadn't paid much attention to Chris Hadfield when he was in the spotlight doing book signings, space music videos, and what not, so I didn't know what to expect. What I got was a humble, intelligent, down to earth (haha) account of a remarkable career and an even more remarkable human being. The book is part biography, part Guide to Life, and it balances the two themes well, giving pieces of story surrounded with simple messages and learnings. It was seriously motivating, and the simple tenets by which he lives his life should be things readers take to heart, as there would be more supportive spouses, team-centric co-workers, and people passionate about their interests. If Chris Hadfield can turn more young people onto science, nature and the wonder of the Universe, that is a good thing. If he can show people how to live a humble life and achieve your dreams, well that's an even better thing."
131,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8525332-andrew,4,"We thought the age of the superstar astronaut had passed, but humble Canadian Chris Hadfield has almost single-handedly made space exciting again. This will become our generation's guide to space exploration and the greatest travel memoir seen in some time.Hadfield's book testifies to both his skill as an astronaut and his genuine warmth and personableness. Tracing his ascent from dreamer, to fighter pilot, to commander of the International Space Station, Hadfield shares his story and much friendly advice about getting on on this planet of ours. The writing is decent, yet has a tone that grows on you. But the hundreds of behind-the-scenes vignettes about training and life in zero-gravity alone make this a worthwhile read.Follow me on Twitter: @Dr_A_Taubman"
132,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4136921-sookie,4,"This memoir reads out like a long conversation with a friend you haven't seen in decades. Hadfield very subtly doles out lessons in life without being too sanctimonious and write mind numbing deep allegories. He experiences his heartbreak and deals with it with dignity and poise. Its amazing how much he has achieved and how much his family worked as a unit to get him there. He never discredits his wife's unquestioned support and the sacrifices that came through the years, her efforts in raising their children and everything she did for the progress of his career. He had a dream and his entire family made him the person he is today - an astronaut and a really amazing guy.His attitude towards life is inspiring and quite simple. His simplicity is evident in his writing. Quite enjoyable memoir whose photographs are what made me look him up in the first place. "

But the tone was a bit stiff; a bit of a dad lecture, and I rolled my eyes just a tiny bit at the earnestness of it all. Nevertheless, kept us company as an audiobook the entire family enjoyed on a long road trip, and I will get a kick out of telling my nine year old that she has one more year to decide what her dream is, and then must spend every second of the rest of her life preparing to achieve it, or else.

Not only was it an absolutely fascinating look at the less-publicized aspects of space travel, but Hadfield's perspectives on perseverance and success are really quite insightful and valuable.

139,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,5,"The word ""inspirational"" gets tossed around a lot, but it's hard to read this and not feel inspired. The book starts a bit slow, focusing on Hadfield's early life and training, but the training gradually becomes more and more intense, and then next thing you know, he's on the launch pad, and the book, well, it takes off. Some of the highlights for me:- The training astronauts go through is extraordinary. They prepare for EVERYTHING, go through every contingency, debrief after every simulation (and especially every ""failure""), assemble everything they've learned across generations of astronauts into a ""flight rules"" book with detailed scenario walkthroughs, and practice these scenarios over and over and over again. They learn an incredible breadth of abilities, from flying, to physics, to chemistry, to biology, to wilderness survival, and so much more. And they do this for years, with only a faint hope of being one of the lucky few who is chosen to go to outer space and put these skills to use. I can't do it any justice; just read the book to get a sense of what it really takes to be an astronaut.- Reading this, you realize that, even if you've dreamt about being an astronaut your whole life, the truth is, you don't actually want to be an astronaut. The amount of training. The constant awareness of the high risks involved and very real chance of dying. The G forces and the very real chance of shitting yourself. The nausea your first days/weeks in space. The always puffy face and constant congestion. The total lack of privacy. The cramped quarters. The inability to properly shower or wash clothes. The intense stress and pressure to not screw up, waste years of effort, billions of dollars, and get people killed.- I love the part where Hadfield describes the preparation for launch. The trip to Baikonur. The quarantine. The parties. The backup crew on a separate bus. The traditions and superstitions, like watching specific movies, peeing on specific things, etc. Gearing up. Cramming into the shuttle / capsule. - The description of life aboard the ISS is even better. Learning what the day to day schedule is like, how they work with crews from other countries, how they eat (and what they eat), exercise (treadmills and vacuum-resistance machines), sleep (in private tubes!), and take care of hygiene and basic bodily needs (this sounds awful), the experiments they run, the views of earth from above, the amount of time it takes to prepare for a space walk, the maintenance they have to constantly do. The story of fixing the ammonia leak is intense!- The story of the insane re-entry procedure of the Soyuz is... something else. The crazy G forces, the ablative heat shield to resist air friction, the crazy crash at the end (with the specially molded seats that prevent your back from breaking on impact)... And then the months of recovery once you've returned from living in zero G's to life on earth (the constant weakness, nausea, foot pain, brittleness of bones, dizziness due to arteries/veins not working as well as they need to, etc). We take for granted what the body does to allow you to live in a gravity well.The writing in the book is a bit mechanical, for lack of a better term, and combined with the slow intro to the book, it's a little hard to get into, but trust me, it's worth sticking with it. The content here is amazing and it makes you appreciate what an accomplishment it is that we have been able to get humans into outer space (and back home!).As always, I've saved a few of my favorite quotes from the book:“If the only thing you really enjoyed was whipping around Earth in a spaceship, you’d hate being an astronaut. The ratio of prep time to time on orbit is many months: single day in space. You train for a few years, minimum, before you’re even assigned to a space mission; training for a specific mission then takes between two and four years, and is much more intensive and rigorous than general training. You practice tricky, repetitive tasks as well as highly challenging ones to the point of exhaustion, and you’re away from home more than half the time. If you don’t love the job, that time will not fly. Nor will the months after a flight, when you’re recovering, undergoing medical testing and debriefing on all kinds of technical and scientific details. Nor will the years of regular training between missions, when you’re recertifying and learning new skills, while helping other astronauts get ready for their flights. If you viewed training as a dreary chore, not only would you be unhappy every day, but your sense of self-worth and professional purpose would be shattered if you were scrubbed from a mission—or never got one.”“It’s almost comical that astronauts are stereotyped as daredevils and cowboys. As a rule, we’re highly methodical and detail-oriented. Our passion isn’t for thrills but for the grindstone, and pressing our noses to it. We have to: we’re responsible for equipment that has cost taxpayers many millions of dollars, and the best insurance policy we have on our lives is our own dedication to training. Studying, simulating, practicing until responses become automatic—astronauts don’t do all this only to fulfill NASA’s requirements. Training is something we do to reduce the odds that we’ll die. Sometimes, as with Challenger and Columbia, a vehicle fails and there’s absolutely nothing the crew can do. But sometimes there is. Astronauts have survived fires on the launch pad and in space, ballistic landings where the Soyuz has come back through the atmosphere like a rock hurled from space—even a collision that punctured a spacecraft and caused sudden depressurization. In a real crisis like that, a group hug isn’t going to save you. Your only hope is knowing exactly what to do and being able to do it calmly and quickly.”“If anything, I’m annoyingly upbeat, at least according to the experts (my family, of course). I tend to expect things will turn out well and they usually do. My optimism and confidence come not from feeling I’m luckier than other mortals, and they sure don’t come from visualizing victory. They’re the result of a lifetime spent visualizing defeat and figuring out how to prevent it.”“In zero gravity, there’s no need for a mattress or pillow; you already feel like you’re resting on a cloud, perfectly supported, so there’s no tossing and turning to find a more comfortable position.”“A lot of what happens to the human body in space is really similar to what happens during the aging process. In post-flight quarantine, in fact, Tom and I tottered around like two old duffers, getting a preview of what life might be like if we made it to 90. Our blood vessels had hardened; our cardiovascular systems had changed. We had shed calcium and minerals in space, so our bones were weaker; so were our muscles, because for 22 hours a day, they’d encountered no resistance whatsoever.”"
140,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth is a mixture of self-help and memoir. Hadfield simply takes some fairly prosaic lessons that he leaned in his efforts to become an astronaut (work hard, pay attention to detail, expect things to go wrong and be ready, train hard, et cetera. The sorts of things they teach you in the Boy Scouts) and then he bolts these concepts onto his various astronaut stories with varying levels of success. At it’s best this book is inspiring, but at it’s worst it can feel like an ex military type is giving you a lecture on being a team player (because that’s exactly what’s happening).The last 1/3 of the book was my favorite. This is where Hadfield lays off the improving lectures and gets into more detail about what life on the ISS is like. Ultimately, he is very likable and able to project a winning sense of humility while telling tales of his impressive accomplishments, and his book is as likable as he is."
141,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70879977-sonali,5,"Are you what a 9-year-old you envisioned yourself to be when you grew up? Well, Chris Hadfield dreamed of becoming an astronaut, and all these years later, he managed to achieve that dream. Back in 1969, for Hadfield to have such a dream was highly ridiculous because Canada didn't even have a space agency of their own! But that didn't stop him, and he talks all about it in this inspirational memoir.From having a little dream and working towards it to becoming the first Canadian astronaut to live aboard the International Space Station to becoming viral for his version of Bob Dylan's Space Oddity (IN SPACE!), Hadfield shares his life story.This book will bring the childlike wonder you had about space back in your eyes, it definitely did that for me. I was a space nerd growing up, and this book rekindled my love for space.Hadfield is so inspiring and optimistic, you'll wonder if this man is for real! But he is a realist as well. I reckon if you have trained all your life about the ways you can die in space, you start 'sweating the small stuff' but enjoy them, too. His advice on trying to become a zero (read to know what I'm talking about!) was the best part about the book.For me, the biggest takeaway from this memoir is that never stop working towards your dream. If you work hard and smart, you'll not only beat all the odds but end up with everything you had ever dreamed of. This book will inspire you, aspire you to be humble, and enjoy the little joys of life. Highly, highly recommended!PS please watch all of Hadfield's videos!"

Perhaps it was the short time span I read it over, but I found the book to be somewhat repetitive - past that, I have nothing bad to say. It was extremely eye opening to hear about the astronaut profession in extreme detail, and Hadfield shares so many incredible stories that had happened throughout his life. I also really respected that he including some of his failures and shortcomings in the text - although they were nothing extreme it certainly helped to humanize this Canadian hero."

This one, for example, left me with an entirely new understanding of what it really takes (and means) to be an astronaut (with a few lessons for life thrown in for good measure)."
145,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6548813-natalie-curiousreader,4,"Chris Hadfield's An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth is a combination of a memoir and something of a modern philosophical work. He blends his own experiences of training to and working as an astronaut with his observations on life, success, purpose, and more. Through looking at a personal journey in space exploration, he connects to the larger picture both to the people he's known and to the world at large. While the writing style can come off as 'self-help'ish in the way he frames his 'advice' and conclusions from personal experience, it's more I think an attempt to humanize astronauts who often end up being 'heroes' in people's minds; people who travel space, as some supernatural creature rather than a human of flesh and blood who worked really hard, and possibly was really lucky. But what I liked best about this book is that it's personal, it's funny, Hadfield shares a lot of anecdotes and he shares his own feelings about things like returning to earth after several months away. There's both I think a lot of genuineness and humor found in this book, which in my personal opinion lends itself well to inviting people into a subject they might not have explored before or otherwise. The book starts off with his becoming an astronaut; education, other work leading up to the job, training for space travels, etc. He moves on to preparations for launch, life up in space, and finishes with the adaption to life back on earth. The way the book is structured is great because it follows, in a much speeded up version of course, the trajectory of a trip to space and back. Peering inside the premises to see everything (and everyone!) necessary to make space travel happen, and facing some of the for me not thought of complications in a life without gravity, was just an utter delight of learning and entertainment rolled into one. The subject of toilet-related things up in space seems to be a crowd-pleaser kind of topic, unsurprisingly, but another example he gives is that crying is a complicated business without the tears actually falling down. Or showers. Or sweating. All activities dependent on drops falling is of course a whole different matter in an environment where everything floats. I really found Hadfield's personality throughout the book to be friendly and welcoming, lighthearted and fun while also acknowledging all the hard work (and money) gone into such an amazing thing as space travel and exploration, and especially the enormous team behind it. His own thoughts spread throughout the book, like the 'aim to be a zero' or 'sweat the small stuff', I also thought were no-nonsense and down to earth (!). While I tend to avoid self-help type books and writing, I didn't find Hadfield's approach annoying or preachy, which might be due to my similarity in thinking to the author. I don't think it's correct to say this book is a self-help book, it's first and foremost a memoir, second a sort of philosophical ramblings of an astronaut, but there are certainly things in the book that could be taken and applied to life generally. However it's always clearly connected both to Hadfield's experience as an astronaut, and to his plans going forward. For example, one thing I liked best was when he talks of the importance in defining your good moments or your happiness yourself. Otherwise, anything after 'gone to space' is failure. Not everyone will be in space of course, but he continues to say that if you only measure your life based on the 'big' moments, you're going to spend a lot of time not happy. Which is possibly very self-evident to some, but I know many that would benefit from taking this advice into account. All in all, a fantastic book that was highly enjoyable from page one to the last word, and that I would gladly both recommend and read again. "
146,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/321673-jamie-collins,3,"3.5 stars, a nice memoir from Hadfield. The first few chapters are perhaps a bit fluffy - a quick overview of how he achieved his lifelong goal of becoming an astronaut, along with some self-help advice - and I’d have been disappointed if the book had continued in that vein, but soon enough he goes into more detail about his career and his three spaceflights.It’s almost amusing to watch Hadfield try to humbly describe how he was the best at everything he ever tried and reached the pinnacle of his profession through hard work and meticulous preparation and the support of a great wife. The man has had, and is still having, a hell of a grand life.He provides interesting details about astronaut training, about his work as a capcom, his work in operations in Russia, and especially about his flights on the shuttle and the Soyuz, and his time on the ISS. In particular I learned some things I didn’t know about Russian customs surrounding space missions. (I had heard that the astronauts and cosmonauts pee on the rear tire of the bus that drops them off at their rocket before their flight, because Gagarin did so. I didn’t know that Russians view the opening of the hatch as the true start of an expedition, and that it’s unlucky to shake hands across the threshold.)I enjoyed his analysis of the difficulties that arise when astronauts, who are “without exception, extremely competitive” must adapt to working as a team, rather than pushing their way into a leadership role.Although he describes a couple of astronauts (no names) who were difficult to work with, he has nothing bad to say about NASA or the CSA. It’s a cheerful, upbeat book, just what you’d expect from Hadfield."
147,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6676926-jenna-falling-letters,4,"A great read! I picked up this book because I wanted to learn more from the man himself about what it's like to be an astronaut (admittedly also because I thought I should read the book before going to his signing...). I was not disappointed! Reading Hadfield's story made me really excited about space and space exploration, uncontainably excited - I felt absolutely exhilarated while reading about Hadfield's final ascent into space and I held my breath during the final days of his time up there, even though I knew what would happen. Reading this book before bed made it difficult to sleep. It's one to think ""Okay, so this guy has been in space, that's so cool"" and another to read his words and be totally astounded at the idea that yes, we can send people into space! It's really an incredible concept, one that I don't think will ever lose its ability to astonish. I was blown away by the amount of knowledge that astronauts must possess - I never really thought about that before, but when there's only three people up there and so many situations that could play out, you really do have to be prepared for anything and be ready to make split second decisions to ensure your own survival. I also enjoyed how Hadfield framed his 'life philosophies' within the context of his career with NASA. This book put a lot about space travel into perspective for me and makes me want to seek out other books by astronauts! Who knows if there will be any other ones as good as this though ;P"
148,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"I’ve been meaning to read this forever, after getting quite into the videos Chris Hadfield posted and the stuff he tweeted when he was on the International Space Station. This is both less glamorous than you’d imagine an astronaut’s book to be, and more practical in terms of actual advice about everyday life. There are details about NASA, about what it’s like to fly a plane or go into space, etc, but there’s also a lot about being a team player, communication with family, and all sorts of ordinary things that maybe you wouldn’t think an astronaut would talk about.Overall, Hadfield comes off as a down to earth (ha) and likeable guy, with a sense of humour about life and humility about his achievements, even though they’re pretty epic achievements. I found his book mostly interesting, although sometimes talking about bureaucracy was just bewilderingly frustrating — and why should he have exploratory surgery to prove that he doesn’t need exploratory surgery again? Aaargh, world, you are weird.It’s mostly not really about being an astronaut. It’s about loving your job, working hard, and trying to be a decent human being. The moments of wonder are there too, but this is mostly about the road taken to get there.Originally posted here."
149,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15984398-laurie,4,"To most people, being in space has got to be one of the coolest but most unimaginable things one can do. All we really envision that astronauts do while they are in space is float around doings flips and playing with water bubbles. I knew, of course, that they actually do lots of science experiments but I was unaware of how much time it takes in their day to do their jobs.This account of Hadfield's career as an astronaut was interesting, and he definitely had a stellar career since he went to space three times with the final time as a commander on the ISS for a few months. Although he was so successful in his profession, he comes across as humble and accessible. Mixed in with the narrative of his trips to space, Hadfield includes advice on things he learned and had to utilize in his daily life as an astronaut which anyone can use. These are things that we are told about in typical self-help books, but he relates them in a way that you really see how they are important are even in a job like his. One of the things that is so obvious throughout this book is that Chris Hadfield is one of the most motivated and driven people I've ever read about. He was a useful and willing cog in a very big corporate machine. Whether some of his advice would work in all professions or not, the lessons are also ones that can be used in one's daily life as well."
150,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71727522-anastasia,5,Loved it. Love the way he sees the world and explains his point of view and I thinks lot of people could benefit from it in their professional lives instead of going to self help and productivity type media every time they hit a hurdle - I know I'll try to !
151,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79761705-lea,5,I finally finished this one and now I really need to write down all the quotes I loved. What a fantastic read at such a demanding time in my life. 
152,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40473382-ibrahim-niftiyev,5,"Finally, I finished this book and I am very happy that after a while I was able to read something really interesting and high quality. Chris Hadfield replaced that blind admiration to the astronauts we had from our very childhood with the deep respect which may arise out of the strong empathy in me. He explained the tiny little details and intimate atmosphere of being an astronaut. On one hand, he described the technicality of his job, on the other hand, he reflected his inner world as a reflection of that technicality kingdom. The writing style was perfect - it never tired of me. I felt high-level connectedness with the narration. This book especially might be very useful for young people, students or persons who are on their early stage of the career because it motivates via the rooted wisdom of the experienced professional of his field. Overall, I totally recommend this book to everybody who simply wants to have an honest conversation because in its essence it feels like an interactive and honest conversation. "
153,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1439381-maj,5,This book filled me with joy.I seriously consider reading it again straight away!
154,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55590750-neeti,5,"A memorable and immensely interesting insight into the Space program and the life of an astronaut.You'd be surprised to to see that a vast majority of an astronaut's life unfolds on earth and not in space :) I love that Hadfield comes across as refreshingly modest and grounded. Interspersed with numerous life lessons, this memoir is definitely a page turner. "
155,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4453896-jeffrey-sylvester,3,"“An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth” by Chris Hadfield was decent but less than expected. What enticed me to buy this book were Hadfield’s comments regarding divinity on George Stroumboulopoulos. During that interview, Stroum mockingly asks Hadfield whether he ever considers spirituality and how he deals with those who are spiritual, as if Hadfield is not spiritual, and as if human derived rationality is the end all, be all, of knowledge. To what I hope was Stroum’s ignorant surprise, Hadfield immediately countered that spirituality is among the forefront of topics astronauts consider and discuss on the International Space Station (ISS). Hadfield went on to explain that given the cultural diversity among astronauts, their beliefs are vastly diverse, and given how beliefs are what got them there, all beliefs are highly respected. Hadfield then described the surreal experience of spacewalk. The magnitude of viewing the majestic beauty of Earth on one side, while staring off into the infinite texture of possibility on the other, and the difficulty in presuming such madness could happen by chance. The inference being, divinity, however defined.I was hoping Hadfield would expand on this experience in his book and was sorely disappointed when he didn’t. This omission inspired me to search the internet for other comments he may have made in different forums to this end and what I found was likewise disappointing. Several orthodox religious groups have taken what Hadfield said on Stroum and have twisted it to suit their own political and narrow-minded purposes, a predictable disincentive for Hadfield to ever broach the topic in the first place, let alone elaborate on it further in printed word.  What I liked about the book were the explanations describing the evolution of the space-program, its cost-benefit as a public good, his informed views on the need for environmental stewardship, and the general challenges associated with space borne discovery. For example, I have always been curious as to why they shelved the shuttle in favor of the Soyuz and he explains this well. I also enjoyed the parallels he drew between the preparations required for New World discovery voyages and space voyages today. What I didn’t enjoy were the often excessive and redundant amounts of detail regarding his personal journey and the walkthrough of solving incessant mechanical blunders during his involvement with various space projects. I think for someone as into it as he is, this is likely exciting, but for a laymen like me it became dizzingly boring. One of the points he is trying to make with it is that astronauts and their teams must “sweat the small stuff” (details) or they run the risk of death and failed expeditions. The only problem is that this level of redundant detail comprises most of the chapters. Overall, I appreciate Hadfield’s attempt to relate the values and discipline required to becoming an astronaut to the lives of regular people but I felt his advice was fairly plebeian in this regard. When I buy an astronaut’s book, I am not looking for “Chicken Soup for the Soul”. I am looking for a revelatory view specific to their rare and privileged view of viewing Earth from space. And beyond the multitude of the intense earthly considerations an astronaut has to make in order to make it to and fro to the ISS, Hadfield’s book doesn’t provide this. It was informative with respect to the space program but otherwise not riveting. Nevertheless, it helped me better appreciate Hadfield as a dedicated Canadian icon, and we can never have enough of those. 3 stars for Hadfield!"
156,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14201634-juliette,3,"First of all, happy 390th birthday to Giovanni Cassini!I am a space geek. I'm still sad that I am not smart enough (or, as Colonel Hadfield would have said, didn't work hard enough) to work for NASA. So sad. But I love learning about the universe, and I'll never give up on learning about it.I picked up this book more for the ""Astronaut"" in the title than for the ""Guide to Life on Earth."" I admire Col. Hadfield very much for bringing scientific education to the under-educated public. Education is his passion, and a lot of this book is fed by his desire to teach laypeople about the various space agencies (and to justify where their tax dollars go).The public sees the spectacular finishes: the Moon landing, the landing of Curiosity on Mars, the technicolor Hubble calendars. It's facile to think that the lives of the people at the space agencies are just a string of glories. We don't see the long hours that the people at the agencies log in order to achieve their glories. If this book is about anything, it is about hard work and perseverance. Colonel Hadfield's hard work and perseverance, his wife's hard work and perseverance, and, he hopes, everyone's hard work and perseverance.The ""Guide"" portion of the book was not as interesting to me as Col. Hadfield's day-to-day life. I learned so many little details about training. (I didn't know that astronauts are required to learn Russian. Stop and think about it for a minute, and it makes sense, but it never occurred to me. I guess I thought of Soyuz as a connecting flight, no biggie. But, no, North American scientists and astronauts are in Russia for a very long time, and it makes sense to learn Russian because their neighbors and coworkers speak Russian.)The parts about learning to be a zero and climbing down the ladder were nice, but, if I'd wanted to learn that, I would have re-read The Gita.I really enjoyed the way that Col. Hadfield wrote about his wife, who seems like a wonderful woman (and her laughing wedding picture is beautiful). I think, if I were to marry, I would be over-the-moon joyful if my husband to think of me with the same humor and awe that is evident when Chris writes of Helene:A lot of people who meet us remark that it can't be easy being married to a highly driven, take-charge overachiever who views moving house as a sport, and I have to confess that is not -- being married to Helene has at times been difficult for me. (pp. 7-8)I have dedicated the book to Helene, as there is no one more deserving and beloved. (Acknowledgements)By the end of the book, I was in love with Helene Hadfield.If you read the book -- and I hope you do, despite my lackluster rating -- it's better to think of the book as a collection of essays rather than a full-fledged memoir. The chapters don't flow into one another. I think I would have given the book a four or five star rating if that thought had come to me earlier."

Insights into what made him strive to be who he is, all while being a great honest person the entire way.It is his career and life, put into words that truly work magically. You will go through different emotions throughout this book, with the eventual hope of giving you the ability to look inside yourself and be the right person you are supposed to be.

If you are willing, his experience's and outlook will be there to provide an example for all of us. This is the reason this book is really such a winner, it is a story about Chris, by Chris, but yet it is something that can touch us all in our own personal ways.

158,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583076-sue-smith,4,"This is a whirlwind look at the life and times of Colonel Chris Hadfield - starting from his first recollections on his aspirations to become an astronaut. His focus on the task is pretty incredible (I can't imagine what I would have accomplished if I'd kept that focused on my goals. Wait - do I have goals? Maybe that is my problem!). It's nice to see that you can go through your life and not have any doubts about what you're doing - or why you're doing it. I didn't pick that path that's for sure.Anyways, it was an interesting look at the space program and his wonderful mission completion that was brought to the attention of the world with the power of the internet and the help of his family to ensure it's successful launching. There were lots of great stories that only a few people will get to experience in their lifetime, but most will experience vicariously through stories such as this. Sounded fascinating truly but I really like terra ferma myself. I love to hear the stories but have no desire to get any higher into the air than what a jet liner will take me, so this was a great book to satisfy that. There wasn't much in the way of guidance to surviving on earth other than the usual tenets - work hard, support each other and focus, focus, focus. Oh - and the old philosophy of 'don't worry, be happy' - all things positive will lead to what you need and want. It's just hard to see that sometimes, so you need to have faith."
159,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6590000-bjoern-rochel,5,"This book was a recommendation of a friend. Definitely worth the read, for a whole variety of reasons. It gives you an insight of what it actually means to be an astronaut. You get a pretty good feel about their routines, their drill and their dedication to the one mission (bringing humanity forward). I had no idea how rigid and daunting the program is. After reading this book, I assume, most readers will look mildly amused at Hollywoods depiction of astronauts. Couldn't be more far off. Armageddon, anyone?Astronauts and the space program as a whole are in my opinion perfect examples of lifelong (super-)learners and knowledge communities. In that regard the book offered a lot of interesting ideas to me that are also applicable for the business world. Not sure how much in reality, but at least it's good to have an interesting role model to look up to.Some things I found in particular interesting:- The anti-specialisation in the skill-set of astronauts- Decision checklists and trees - Being the Zero- Up and downwards climbing of the career latter- Debrief and its implication for future training and simulationsSome final words regarding the writing style: Chris Hadfield seems to be a very humble being. You don't read that too often. He reminds me of the guy that recommended the book to me. Something a lot of us can learn from."
160,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15220884-justin-liew,5,"I read this book mainly because many intelligent, interesting people I know were over the moon about it. (haha). I hadn't paid much attention to Chris Hadfield when he was in the spotlight doing book signings, space music videos, and what not, so I didn't know what to expect. What I got was a humble, intelligent, down to earth (haha) account of a remarkable career and an even more remarkable human being. The book is part biography, part Guide to Life, and it balances the two themes well, giving pieces of story surrounded with simple messages and learnings. It was seriously motivating, and the simple tenets by which he lives his life should be things readers take to heart, as there would be more supportive spouses, team-centric co-workers, and people passionate about their interests. If Chris Hadfield can turn more young people onto science, nature and the wonder of the Universe, that is a good thing. If he can show people how to live a humble life and achieve your dreams, well that's an even better thing."
161,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8525332-andrew,4,"We thought the age of the superstar astronaut had passed, but humble Canadian Chris Hadfield has almost single-handedly made space exciting again. This will become our generation's guide to space exploration and the greatest travel memoir seen in some time.Hadfield's book testifies to both his skill as an astronaut and his genuine warmth and personableness. Tracing his ascent from dreamer, to fighter pilot, to commander of the International Space Station, Hadfield shares his story and much friendly advice about getting on on this planet of ours. The writing is decent, yet has a tone that grows on you. But the hundreds of behind-the-scenes vignettes about training and life in zero-gravity alone make this a worthwhile read.Follow me on Twitter: @Dr_A_Taubman"
162,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4136921-sookie,4,"This memoir reads out like a long conversation with a friend you haven't seen in decades. Hadfield very subtly doles out lessons in life without being too sanctimonious and write mind numbing deep allegories. He experiences his heartbreak and deals with it with dignity and poise. Its amazing how much he has achieved and how much his family worked as a unit to get him there. He never discredits his wife's unquestioned support and the sacrifices that came through the years, her efforts in raising their children and everything she did for the progress of his career. He had a dream and his entire family made him the person he is today - an astronaut and a really amazing guy.His attitude towards life is inspiring and quite simple. His simplicity is evident in his writing. Quite enjoyable memoir whose photographs are what made me look him up in the first place. "

But the tone was a bit stiff; a bit of a dad lecture, and I rolled my eyes just a tiny bit at the earnestness of it all. Nevertheless, kept us company as an audiobook the entire family enjoyed on a long road trip, and I will get a kick out of telling my nine year old that she has one more year to decide what her dream is, and then must spend every second of the rest of her life preparing to achieve it, or else.

169,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,5,"The word ""inspirational"" gets tossed around a lot, but it's hard to read this and not feel inspired. The book starts a bit slow, focusing on Hadfield's early life and training, but the training gradually becomes more and more intense, and then next thing you know, he's on the launch pad, and the book, well, it takes off. Some of the highlights for me:- The training astronauts go through is extraordinary. They prepare for EVERYTHING, go through every contingency, debrief after every simulation (and especially every ""failure""), assemble everything they've learned across generations of astronauts into a ""flight rules"" book with detailed scenario walkthroughs, and practice these scenarios over and over and over again. They learn an incredible breadth of abilities, from flying, to physics, to chemistry, to biology, to wilderness survival, and so much more. And they do this for years, with only a faint hope of being one of the lucky few who is chosen to go to outer space and put these skills to use. I can't do it any justice; just read the book to get a sense of what it really takes to be an astronaut.- Reading this, you realize that, even if you've dreamt about being an astronaut your whole life, the truth is, you don't actually want to be an astronaut. The amount of training. The constant awareness of the high risks involved and very real chance of dying. The G forces and the very real chance of shitting yourself. The nausea your first days/weeks in space. The always puffy face and constant congestion. The total lack of privacy. The cramped quarters. The inability to properly shower or wash clothes. The intense stress and pressure to not screw up, waste years of effort, billions of dollars, and get people killed.- I love the part where Hadfield describes the preparation for launch. The trip to Baikonur. The quarantine. The parties. The backup crew on a separate bus. The traditions and superstitions, like watching specific movies, peeing on specific things, etc. Gearing up. Cramming into the shuttle / capsule. - The description of life aboard the ISS is even better. Learning what the day to day schedule is like, how they work with crews from other countries, how they eat (and what they eat), exercise (treadmills and vacuum-resistance machines), sleep (in private tubes!), and take care of hygiene and basic bodily needs (this sounds awful), the experiments they run, the views of earth from above, the amount of time it takes to prepare for a space walk, the maintenance they have to constantly do. The story of fixing the ammonia leak is intense!- The story of the insane re-entry procedure of the Soyuz is... something else. The crazy G forces, the ablative heat shield to resist air friction, the crazy crash at the end (with the specially molded seats that prevent your back from breaking on impact)... And then the months of recovery once you've returned from living in zero G's to life on earth (the constant weakness, nausea, foot pain, brittleness of bones, dizziness due to arteries/veins not working as well as they need to, etc). We take for granted what the body does to allow you to live in a gravity well.The writing in the book is a bit mechanical, for lack of a better term, and combined with the slow intro to the book, it's a little hard to get into, but trust me, it's worth sticking with it. The content here is amazing and it makes you appreciate what an accomplishment it is that we have been able to get humans into outer space (and back home!).As always, I've saved a few of my favorite quotes from the book:“If the only thing you really enjoyed was whipping around Earth in a spaceship, you’d hate being an astronaut. The ratio of prep time to time on orbit is many months: single day in space. You train for a few years, minimum, before you’re even assigned to a space mission; training for a specific mission then takes between two and four years, and is much more intensive and rigorous than general training. You practice tricky, repetitive tasks as well as highly challenging ones to the point of exhaustion, and you’re away from home more than half the time. If you don’t love the job, that time will not fly. Nor will the months after a flight, when you’re recovering, undergoing medical testing and debriefing on all kinds of technical and scientific details. Nor will the years of regular training between missions, when you’re recertifying and learning new skills, while helping other astronauts get ready for their flights. If you viewed training as a dreary chore, not only would you be unhappy every day, but your sense of self-worth and professional purpose would be shattered if you were scrubbed from a mission—or never got one.”“It’s almost comical that astronauts are stereotyped as daredevils and cowboys. As a rule, we’re highly methodical and detail-oriented. Our passion isn’t for thrills but for the grindstone, and pressing our noses to it. We have to: we’re responsible for equipment that has cost taxpayers many millions of dollars, and the best insurance policy we have on our lives is our own dedication to training. Studying, simulating, practicing until responses become automatic—astronauts don’t do all this only to fulfill NASA’s requirements. Training is something we do to reduce the odds that we’ll die. Sometimes, as with Challenger and Columbia, a vehicle fails and there’s absolutely nothing the crew can do. But sometimes there is. Astronauts have survived fires on the launch pad and in space, ballistic landings where the Soyuz has come back through the atmosphere like a rock hurled from space—even a collision that punctured a spacecraft and caused sudden depressurization. In a real crisis like that, a group hug isn’t going to save you. Your only hope is knowing exactly what to do and being able to do it calmly and quickly.”“If anything, I’m annoyingly upbeat, at least according to the experts (my family, of course). I tend to expect things will turn out well and they usually do. My optimism and confidence come not from feeling I’m luckier than other mortals, and they sure don’t come from visualizing victory. They’re the result of a lifetime spent visualizing defeat and figuring out how to prevent it.”“In zero gravity, there’s no need for a mattress or pillow; you already feel like you’re resting on a cloud, perfectly supported, so there’s no tossing and turning to find a more comfortable position.”“A lot of what happens to the human body in space is really similar to what happens during the aging process. In post-flight quarantine, in fact, Tom and I tottered around like two old duffers, getting a preview of what life might be like if we made it to 90. Our blood vessels had hardened; our cardiovascular systems had changed. We had shed calcium and minerals in space, so our bones were weaker; so were our muscles, because for 22 hours a day, they’d encountered no resistance whatsoever.”"
170,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth is a mixture of self-help and memoir. Hadfield simply takes some fairly prosaic lessons that he leaned in his efforts to become an astronaut (work hard, pay attention to detail, expect things to go wrong and be ready, train hard, et cetera. The sorts of things they teach you in the Boy Scouts) and then he bolts these concepts onto his various astronaut stories with varying levels of success. At it’s best this book is inspiring, but at it’s worst it can feel like an ex military type is giving you a lecture on being a team player (because that’s exactly what’s happening).The last 1/3 of the book was my favorite. This is where Hadfield lays off the improving lectures and gets into more detail about what life on the ISS is like. Ultimately, he is very likable and able to project a winning sense of humility while telling tales of his impressive accomplishments, and his book is as likable as he is."

Well, Chris Hadfield dreamed of becoming an astronaut, and all these years later, he managed to achieve that dream. Back in 1969, for Hadfield to have such a dream was highly ridiculous because Canada didn't even have a space agency of their own! But that didn't stop him, and he talks all about it in this inspirational memoir.From having a little dream and working towards it to becoming the first Canadian astronaut to live aboard the International Space Station to becoming viral for his version of Bob Dylan's Space Oddity (IN SPACE!), Hadfield shares his life story.This book will bring the childlike wonder you had about space back in your eyes, it definitely did that for me. I was a space nerd growing up, and this book rekindled my love for space.Hadfield is so inspiring and optimistic, you'll wonder if this man is for real! But he is a realist as well. I reckon if you have trained all your life about the ways you can die in space, you start 'sweating the small stuff' but enjoy them, too. His advice on trying to become a zero (read to know what I'm talking about!) was the best part about the book.For me, the biggest takeaway from this memoir is that never stop working towards your dream. If you work hard and smart, you'll not only beat all the odds but end up with everything you had ever dreamed of. This book will inspire you, aspire you to be humble, and enjoy the little joys of life. Highly, highly recommended!PS please watch all of Hadfield's videos!"

Perhaps it was the short time span I read it over, but I found the book to be somewhat repetitive - past that, I have nothing bad to say. It was extremely eye opening to hear about the astronaut profession in extreme detail, and Hadfield shares so many incredible stories that had happened throughout his life. I also really respected that he including some of his failures and shortcomings in the text - although they were nothing extreme it certainly helped to humanize this Canadian hero."

This one, for example, left me with an entirely new understanding of what it really takes (and means) to be an astronaut (with a few lessons for life thrown in for good measure)."
175,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6548813-natalie-curiousreader,4,"Chris Hadfield's An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth is a combination of a memoir and something of a modern philosophical work. He blends his own experiences of training to and working as an astronaut with his observations on life, success, purpose, and more. Through looking at a personal journey in space exploration, he connects to the larger picture both to the people he's known and to the world at large. While the writing style can come off as 'self-help'ish in the way he frames his 'advice' and conclusions from personal experience, it's more I think an attempt to humanize astronauts who often end up being 'heroes' in people's minds; people who travel space, as some supernatural creature rather than a human of flesh and blood who worked really hard, and possibly was really lucky. But what I liked best about this book is that it's personal, it's funny, Hadfield shares a lot of anecdotes and he shares his own feelings about things like returning to earth after several months away. There's both I think a lot of genuineness and humor found in this book, which in my personal opinion lends itself well to inviting people into a subject they might not have explored before or otherwise. The book starts off with his becoming an astronaut; education, other work leading up to the job, training for space travels, etc. He moves on to preparations for launch, life up in space, and finishes with the adaption to life back on earth. The way the book is structured is great because it follows, in a much speeded up version of course, the trajectory of a trip to space and back. Peering inside the premises to see everything (and everyone!) necessary to make space travel happen, and facing some of the for me not thought of complications in a life without gravity, was just an utter delight of learning and entertainment rolled into one. The subject of toilet-related things up in space seems to be a crowd-pleaser kind of topic, unsurprisingly, but another example he gives is that crying is a complicated business without the tears actually falling down. Or showers. Or sweating. All activities dependent on drops falling is of course a whole different matter in an environment where everything floats. I really found Hadfield's personality throughout the book to be friendly and welcoming, lighthearted and fun while also acknowledging all the hard work (and money) gone into such an amazing thing as space travel and exploration, and especially the enormous team behind it. His own thoughts spread throughout the book, like the 'aim to be a zero' or 'sweat the small stuff', I also thought were no-nonsense and down to earth (!). While I tend to avoid self-help type books and writing, I didn't find Hadfield's approach annoying or preachy, which might be due to my similarity in thinking to the author. I don't think it's correct to say this book is a self-help book, it's first and foremost a memoir, second a sort of philosophical ramblings of an astronaut, but there are certainly things in the book that could be taken and applied to life generally. However it's always clearly connected both to Hadfield's experience as an astronaut, and to his plans going forward. For example, one thing I liked best was when he talks of the importance in defining your good moments or your happiness yourself. Otherwise, anything after 'gone to space' is failure. Not everyone will be in space of course, but he continues to say that if you only measure your life based on the 'big' moments, you're going to spend a lot of time not happy. Which is possibly very self-evident to some, but I know many that would benefit from taking this advice into account. All in all, a fantastic book that was highly enjoyable from page one to the last word, and that I would gladly both recommend and read again. "
176,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/321673-jamie-collins,3,"3.5 stars, a nice memoir from Hadfield. The first few chapters are perhaps a bit fluffy - a quick overview of how he achieved his lifelong goal of becoming an astronaut, along with some self-help advice - and I’d have been disappointed if the book had continued in that vein, but soon enough he goes into more detail about his career and his three spaceflights.It’s almost amusing to watch Hadfield try to humbly describe how he was the best at everything he ever tried and reached the pinnacle of his profession through hard work and meticulous preparation and the support of a great wife. The man has had, and is still having, a hell of a grand life.He provides interesting details about astronaut training, about his work as a capcom, his work in operations in Russia, and especially about his flights on the shuttle and the Soyuz, and his time on the ISS. In particular I learned some things I didn’t know about Russian customs surrounding space missions. (I had heard that the astronauts and cosmonauts pee on the rear tire of the bus that drops them off at their rocket before their flight, because Gagarin did so. I didn’t know that Russians view the opening of the hatch as the true start of an expedition, and that it’s unlucky to shake hands across the threshold.)I enjoyed his analysis of the difficulties that arise when astronauts, who are “without exception, extremely competitive” must adapt to working as a team, rather than pushing their way into a leadership role.Although he describes a couple of astronauts (no names) who were difficult to work with, he has nothing bad to say about NASA or the CSA. It’s a cheerful, upbeat book, just what you’d expect from Hadfield."
177,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6676926-jenna-falling-letters,4,"A great read! I picked up this book because I wanted to learn more from the man himself about what it's like to be an astronaut (admittedly also because I thought I should read the book before going to his signing...). I was not disappointed! Reading Hadfield's story made me really excited about space and space exploration, uncontainably excited - I felt absolutely exhilarated while reading about Hadfield's final ascent into space and I held my breath during the final days of his time up there, even though I knew what would happen. Reading this book before bed made it difficult to sleep. It's one to think ""Okay, so this guy has been in space, that's so cool"" and another to read his words and be totally astounded at the idea that yes, we can send people into space! It's really an incredible concept, one that I don't think will ever lose its ability to astonish. I was blown away by the amount of knowledge that astronauts must possess - I never really thought about that before, but when there's only three people up there and so many situations that could play out, you really do have to be prepared for anything and be ready to make split second decisions to ensure your own survival. I also enjoyed how Hadfield framed his 'life philosophies' within the context of his career with NASA. This book put a lot about space travel into perspective for me and makes me want to seek out other books by astronauts! Who knows if there will be any other ones as good as this though ;P"
178,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"I’ve been meaning to read this forever, after getting quite into the videos Chris Hadfield posted and the stuff he tweeted when he was on the International Space Station. This is both less glamorous than you’d imagine an astronaut’s book to be, and more practical in terms of actual advice about everyday life. There are details about NASA, about what it’s like to fly a plane or go into space, etc, but there’s also a lot about being a team player, communication with family, and all sorts of ordinary things that maybe you wouldn’t think an astronaut would talk about.Overall, Hadfield comes off as a down to earth (ha) and likeable guy, with a sense of humour about life and humility about his achievements, even though they’re pretty epic achievements. I found his book mostly interesting, although sometimes talking about bureaucracy was just bewilderingly frustrating — and why should he have exploratory surgery to prove that he doesn’t need exploratory surgery again? Aaargh, world, you are weird.It’s mostly not really about being an astronaut. It’s about loving your job, working hard, and trying to be a decent human being. The moments of wonder are there too, but this is mostly about the road taken to get there.Originally posted here."
179,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15984398-laurie,4,"To most people, being in space has got to be one of the coolest but most unimaginable things one can do. All we really envision that astronauts do while they are in space is float around doings flips and playing with water bubbles. I knew, of course, that they actually do lots of science experiments but I was unaware of how much time it takes in their day to do their jobs.This account of Hadfield's career as an astronaut was interesting, and he definitely had a stellar career since he went to space three times with the final time as a commander on the ISS for a few months. Although he was so successful in his profession, he comes across as humble and accessible. Mixed in with the narrative of his trips to space, Hadfield includes advice on things he learned and had to utilize in his daily life as an astronaut which anyone can use. These are things that we are told about in typical self-help books, but he relates them in a way that you really see how they are important are even in a job like his. One of the things that is so obvious throughout this book is that Chris Hadfield is one of the most motivated and driven people I've ever read about. He was a useful and willing cog in a very big corporate machine. Whether some of his advice would work in all professions or not, the lessons are also ones that can be used in one's daily life as well."

Chris Hadfield replaced that blind admiration to the astronauts we had from our very childhood with the deep respect which may arise out of the strong empathy in me. He explained the tiny little details and intimate atmosphere of being an astronaut. On one hand, he described the technicality of his job, on the other hand, he reflected his inner world as a reflection of that technicality kingdom. The writing style was perfect - it never tired of me. I felt high-level connectedness with the narration. This book especially might be very useful for young people, students or persons who are on their early stage of the career because it motivates via the rooted wisdom of the experienced professional of his field. Overall, I totally recommend this book to everybody who simply wants to have an honest conversation because in its essence it feels like an interactive and honest conversation. "

Interspersed with numerous life lessons, this memoir is definitely a page turner. "
185,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4453896-jeffrey-sylvester,3,"“An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth” by Chris Hadfield was decent but less than expected. What enticed me to buy this book were Hadfield’s comments regarding divinity on George Stroumboulopoulos. During that interview, Stroum mockingly asks Hadfield whether he ever considers spirituality and how he deals with those who are spiritual, as if Hadfield is not spiritual, and as if human derived rationality is the end all, be all, of knowledge. To what I hope was Stroum’s ignorant surprise, Hadfield immediately countered that spirituality is among the forefront of topics astronauts consider and discuss on the International Space Station (ISS). Hadfield went on to explain that given the cultural diversity among astronauts, their beliefs are vastly diverse, and given how beliefs are what got them there, all beliefs are highly respected. Hadfield then described the surreal experience of spacewalk. The magnitude of viewing the majestic beauty of Earth on one side, while staring off into the infinite texture of possibility on the other, and the difficulty in presuming such madness could happen by chance. The inference being, divinity, however defined.I was hoping Hadfield would expand on this experience in his book and was sorely disappointed when he didn’t. This omission inspired me to search the internet for other comments he may have made in different forums to this end and what I found was likewise disappointing. Several orthodox religious groups have taken what Hadfield said on Stroum and have twisted it to suit their own political and narrow-minded purposes, a predictable disincentive for Hadfield to ever broach the topic in the first place, let alone elaborate on it further in printed word.  What I liked about the book were the explanations describing the evolution of the space-program, its cost-benefit as a public good, his informed views on the need for environmental stewardship, and the general challenges associated with space borne discovery. For example, I have always been curious as to why they shelved the shuttle in favor of the Soyuz and he explains this well. I also enjoyed the parallels he drew between the preparations required for New World discovery voyages and space voyages today. What I didn’t enjoy were the often excessive and redundant amounts of detail regarding his personal journey and the walkthrough of solving incessant mechanical blunders during his involvement with various space projects. I think for someone as into it as he is, this is likely exciting, but for a laymen like me it became dizzingly boring. One of the points he is trying to make with it is that astronauts and their teams must “sweat the small stuff” (details) or they run the risk of death and failed expeditions. The only problem is that this level of redundant detail comprises most of the chapters. Overall, I appreciate Hadfield’s attempt to relate the values and discipline required to becoming an astronaut to the lives of regular people but I felt his advice was fairly plebeian in this regard. When I buy an astronaut’s book, I am not looking for “Chicken Soup for the Soul”. I am looking for a revelatory view specific to their rare and privileged view of viewing Earth from space. And beyond the multitude of the intense earthly considerations an astronaut has to make in order to make it to and fro to the ISS, Hadfield’s book doesn’t provide this. It was informative with respect to the space program but otherwise not riveting. Nevertheless, it helped me better appreciate Hadfield as a dedicated Canadian icon, and we can never have enough of those. 3 stars for Hadfield!"
186,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14201634-juliette,3,"First of all, happy 390th birthday to Giovanni Cassini!I am a space geek. I'm still sad that I am not smart enough (or, as Colonel Hadfield would have said, didn't work hard enough) to work for NASA. So sad. But I love learning about the universe, and I'll never give up on learning about it.I picked up this book more for the ""Astronaut"" in the title than for the ""Guide to Life on Earth."" I admire Col. Hadfield very much for bringing scientific education to the under-educated public. Education is his passion, and a lot of this book is fed by his desire to teach laypeople about the various space agencies (and to justify where their tax dollars go).The public sees the spectacular finishes: the Moon landing, the landing of Curiosity on Mars, the technicolor Hubble calendars. It's facile to think that the lives of the people at the space agencies are just a string of glories. We don't see the long hours that the people at the agencies log in order to achieve their glories. If this book is about anything, it is about hard work and perseverance. Colonel Hadfield's hard work and perseverance, his wife's hard work and perseverance, and, he hopes, everyone's hard work and perseverance.The ""Guide"" portion of the book was not as interesting to me as Col. Hadfield's day-to-day life. I learned so many little details about training. (I didn't know that astronauts are required to learn Russian. Stop and think about it for a minute, and it makes sense, but it never occurred to me. I guess I thought of Soyuz as a connecting flight, no biggie. But, no, North American scientists and astronauts are in Russia for a very long time, and it makes sense to learn Russian because their neighbors and coworkers speak Russian.)The parts about learning to be a zero and climbing down the ladder were nice, but, if I'd wanted to learn that, I would have re-read The Gita.I really enjoyed the way that Col. Hadfield wrote about his wife, who seems like a wonderful woman (and her laughing wedding picture is beautiful). I think, if I were to marry, I would be over-the-moon joyful if my husband to think of me with the same humor and awe that is evident when Chris writes of Helene:A lot of people who meet us remark that it can't be easy being married to a highly driven, take-charge overachiever who views moving house as a sport, and I have to confess that is not -- being married to Helene has at times been difficult for me. (pp. 7-8)I have dedicated the book to Helene, as there is no one more deserving and beloved. (Acknowledgements)By the end of the book, I was in love with Helene Hadfield.If you read the book -- and I hope you do, despite my lackluster rating -- it's better to think of the book as a collection of essays rather than a full-fledged memoir. The chapters don't flow into one another. I think I would have given the book a four or five star rating if that thought had come to me earlier."

188,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583076-sue-smith,4,"This is a whirlwind look at the life and times of Colonel Chris Hadfield - starting from his first recollections on his aspirations to become an astronaut. His focus on the task is pretty incredible (I can't imagine what I would have accomplished if I'd kept that focused on my goals. Wait - do I have goals? Maybe that is my problem!). It's nice to see that you can go through your life and not have any doubts about what you're doing - or why you're doing it. I didn't pick that path that's for sure.Anyways, it was an interesting look at the space program and his wonderful mission completion that was brought to the attention of the world with the power of the internet and the help of his family to ensure it's successful launching. There were lots of great stories that only a few people will get to experience in their lifetime, but most will experience vicariously through stories such as this. Sounded fascinating truly but I really like terra ferma myself. I love to hear the stories but have no desire to get any higher into the air than what a jet liner will take me, so this was a great book to satisfy that. There wasn't much in the way of guidance to surviving on earth other than the usual tenets - work hard, support each other and focus, focus, focus. Oh - and the old philosophy of 'don't worry, be happy' - all things positive will lead to what you need and want. It's just hard to see that sometimes, so you need to have faith."
189,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6590000-bjoern-rochel,5,"This book was a recommendation of a friend. Definitely worth the read, for a whole variety of reasons. It gives you an insight of what it actually means to be an astronaut. You get a pretty good feel about their routines, their drill and their dedication to the one mission (bringing humanity forward). I had no idea how rigid and daunting the program is. After reading this book, I assume, most readers will look mildly amused at Hollywoods depiction of astronauts. Couldn't be more far off. Armageddon, anyone?Astronauts and the space program as a whole are in my opinion perfect examples of lifelong (super-)learners and knowledge communities. In that regard the book offered a lot of interesting ideas to me that are also applicable for the business world. Not sure how much in reality, but at least it's good to have an interesting role model to look up to.Some things I found in particular interesting:- The anti-specialisation in the skill-set of astronauts- Decision checklists and trees - Being the Zero- Up and downwards climbing of the career latter- Debrief and its implication for future training and simulationsSome final words regarding the writing style: Chris Hadfield seems to be a very humble being. You don't read that too often. He reminds me of the guy that recommended the book to me. Something a lot of us can learn from."
190,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15220884-justin-liew,5,"I read this book mainly because many intelligent, interesting people I know were over the moon about it. (haha). I hadn't paid much attention to Chris Hadfield when he was in the spotlight doing book signings, space music videos, and what not, so I didn't know what to expect. What I got was a humble, intelligent, down to earth (haha) account of a remarkable career and an even more remarkable human being. The book is part biography, part Guide to Life, and it balances the two themes well, giving pieces of story surrounded with simple messages and learnings. It was seriously motivating, and the simple tenets by which he lives his life should be things readers take to heart, as there would be more supportive spouses, team-centric co-workers, and people passionate about their interests. If Chris Hadfield can turn more young people onto science, nature and the wonder of the Universe, that is a good thing. If he can show people how to live a humble life and achieve your dreams, well that's an even better thing."

Tracing his ascent from dreamer, to fighter pilot, to commander of the International Space Station, Hadfield shares his story and much friendly advice about getting on on this planet of ours.

Hadfield very subtly doles out lessons in life without being too sanctimonious and write mind numbing deep allegories. He experiences his heartbreak and deals with it with dignity and poise. Its amazing how much he has achieved and how much his family worked as a unit to get him there. He never discredits his wife's unquestioned support and the sacrifices that came through the years, her efforts in raising their children and everything she did for the progress of his career. He had a dream and his entire family made him the person he is today - an astronaut and a really amazing guy.His attitude towards life is inspiring and quite simple.

Nevertheless, kept us company as an audiobook the entire family enjoyed on a long road trip, and I will get a kick out of telling my nine year old that she has one more year to decide what her dream is, and then must spend every second of the rest of her life preparing to achieve it, or else.

199,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,5,"The word ""inspirational"" gets tossed around a lot, but it's hard to read this and not feel inspired. The book starts a bit slow, focusing on Hadfield's early life and training, but the training gradually becomes more and more intense, and then next thing you know, he's on the launch pad, and the book, well, it takes off. Some of the highlights for me:- The training astronauts go through is extraordinary. They prepare for EVERYTHING, go through every contingency, debrief after every simulation (and especially every ""failure""), assemble everything they've learned across generations of astronauts into a ""flight rules"" book with detailed scenario walkthroughs, and practice these scenarios over and over and over again. They learn an incredible breadth of abilities, from flying, to physics, to chemistry, to biology, to wilderness survival, and so much more. And they do this for years, with only a faint hope of being one of the lucky few who is chosen to go to outer space and put these skills to use. I can't do it any justice; just read the book to get a sense of what it really takes to be an astronaut.- Reading this, you realize that, even if you've dreamt about being an astronaut your whole life, the truth is, you don't actually want to be an astronaut. The amount of training. The constant awareness of the high risks involved and very real chance of dying. The G forces and the very real chance of shitting yourself. The nausea your first days/weeks in space. The always puffy face and constant congestion. The total lack of privacy. The cramped quarters. The inability to properly shower or wash clothes. The intense stress and pressure to not screw up, waste years of effort, billions of dollars, and get people killed.- I love the part where Hadfield describes the preparation for launch. The trip to Baikonur. The quarantine. The parties. The backup crew on a separate bus. The traditions and superstitions, like watching specific movies, peeing on specific things, etc. Gearing up. Cramming into the shuttle / capsule. - The description of life aboard the ISS is even better. Learning what the day to day schedule is like, how they work with crews from other countries, how they eat (and what they eat), exercise (treadmills and vacuum-resistance machines), sleep (in private tubes!), and take care of hygiene and basic bodily needs (this sounds awful), the experiments they run, the views of earth from above, the amount of time it takes to prepare for a space walk, the maintenance they have to constantly do. The story of fixing the ammonia leak is intense!- The story of the insane re-entry procedure of the Soyuz is... something else. The crazy G forces, the ablative heat shield to resist air friction, the crazy crash at the end (with the specially molded seats that prevent your back from breaking on impact)... And then the months of recovery once you've returned from living in zero G's to life on earth (the constant weakness, nausea, foot pain, brittleness of bones, dizziness due to arteries/veins not working as well as they need to, etc). We take for granted what the body does to allow you to live in a gravity well.The writing in the book is a bit mechanical, for lack of a better term, and combined with the slow intro to the book, it's a little hard to get into, but trust me, it's worth sticking with it. The content here is amazing and it makes you appreciate what an accomplishment it is that we have been able to get humans into outer space (and back home!).As always, I've saved a few of my favorite quotes from the book:“If the only thing you really enjoyed was whipping around Earth in a spaceship, you’d hate being an astronaut. The ratio of prep time to time on orbit is many months: single day in space. You train for a few years, minimum, before you’re even assigned to a space mission; training for a specific mission then takes between two and four years, and is much more intensive and rigorous than general training. You practice tricky, repetitive tasks as well as highly challenging ones to the point of exhaustion, and you’re away from home more than half the time. If you don’t love the job, that time will not fly. Nor will the months after a flight, when you’re recovering, undergoing medical testing and debriefing on all kinds of technical and scientific details. Nor will the years of regular training between missions, when you’re recertifying and learning new skills, while helping other astronauts get ready for their flights. If you viewed training as a dreary chore, not only would you be unhappy every day, but your sense of self-worth and professional purpose would be shattered if you were scrubbed from a mission—or never got one.”“It’s almost comical that astronauts are stereotyped as daredevils and cowboys. As a rule, we’re highly methodical and detail-oriented. Our passion isn’t for thrills but for the grindstone, and pressing our noses to it. We have to: we’re responsible for equipment that has cost taxpayers many millions of dollars, and the best insurance policy we have on our lives is our own dedication to training. Studying, simulating, practicing until responses become automatic—astronauts don’t do all this only to fulfill NASA’s requirements. Training is something we do to reduce the odds that we’ll die. Sometimes, as with Challenger and Columbia, a vehicle fails and there’s absolutely nothing the crew can do. But sometimes there is. Astronauts have survived fires on the launch pad and in space, ballistic landings where the Soyuz has come back through the atmosphere like a rock hurled from space—even a collision that punctured a spacecraft and caused sudden depressurization. In a real crisis like that, a group hug isn’t going to save you. Your only hope is knowing exactly what to do and being able to do it calmly and quickly.”“If anything, I’m annoyingly upbeat, at least according to the experts (my family, of course). I tend to expect things will turn out well and they usually do. My optimism and confidence come not from feeling I’m luckier than other mortals, and they sure don’t come from visualizing victory. They’re the result of a lifetime spent visualizing defeat and figuring out how to prevent it.”“In zero gravity, there’s no need for a mattress or pillow; you already feel like you’re resting on a cloud, perfectly supported, so there’s no tossing and turning to find a more comfortable position.”“A lot of what happens to the human body in space is really similar to what happens during the aging process. In post-flight quarantine, in fact, Tom and I tottered around like two old duffers, getting a preview of what life might be like if we made it to 90. Our blood vessels had hardened; our cardiovascular systems had changed. We had shed calcium and minerals in space, so our bones were weaker; so were our muscles, because for 22 hours a day, they’d encountered no resistance whatsoever.”"
200,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth is a mixture of self-help and memoir. Hadfield simply takes some fairly prosaic lessons that he leaned in his efforts to become an astronaut (work hard, pay attention to detail, expect things to go wrong and be ready, train hard, et cetera. The sorts of things they teach you in the Boy Scouts) and then he bolts these concepts onto his various astronaut stories with varying levels of success. At it’s best this book is inspiring, but at it’s worst it can feel like an ex military type is giving you a lecture on being a team player (because that’s exactly what’s happening).The last 1/3 of the book was my favorite. This is where Hadfield lays off the improving lectures and gets into more detail about what life on the ISS is like. Ultimately, he is very likable and able to project a winning sense of humility while telling tales of his impressive accomplishments, and his book is as likable as he is."
201,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70879977-sonali,5,"Are you what a 9-year-old you envisioned yourself to be when you grew up? Well, Chris Hadfield dreamed of becoming an astronaut, and all these years later, he managed to achieve that dream. Back in 1969, for Hadfield to have such a dream was highly ridiculous because Canada didn't even have a space agency of their own! But that didn't stop him, and he talks all about it in this inspirational memoir.From having a little dream and working towards it to becoming the first Canadian astronaut to live aboard the International Space Station to becoming viral for his version of Bob Dylan's Space Oddity (IN SPACE!), Hadfield shares his life story.This book will bring the childlike wonder you had about space back in your eyes, it definitely did that for me. I was a space nerd growing up, and this book rekindled my love for space.Hadfield is so inspiring and optimistic, you'll wonder if this man is for real! But he is a realist as well. I reckon if you have trained all your life about the ways you can die in space, you start 'sweating the small stuff' but enjoy them, too. His advice on trying to become a zero (read to know what I'm talking about!) was the best part about the book.For me, the biggest takeaway from this memoir is that never stop working towards your dream. If you work hard and smart, you'll not only beat all the odds but end up with everything you had ever dreamed of. This book will inspire you, aspire you to be humble, and enjoy the little joys of life. Highly, highly recommended!PS please watch all of Hadfield's videos!"

Perhaps it was the short time span I read it over, but I found the book to be somewhat repetitive - past that, I have nothing bad to say. It was extremely eye opening to hear about the astronaut profession in extreme detail, and Hadfield shares so many incredible stories that had happened throughout his life. I also really respected that he including some of his failures and shortcomings in the text - although they were nothing extreme it certainly helped to humanize this Canadian hero."

This one, for example, left me with an entirely new understanding of what it really takes (and means) to be an astronaut (with a few lessons for life thrown in for good measure)."
205,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6548813-natalie-curiousreader,4,"Chris Hadfield's An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth is a combination of a memoir and something of a modern philosophical work. He blends his own experiences of training to and working as an astronaut with his observations on life, success, purpose, and more. Through looking at a personal journey in space exploration, he connects to the larger picture both to the people he's known and to the world at large. While the writing style can come off as 'self-help'ish in the way he frames his 'advice' and conclusions from personal experience, it's more I think an attempt to humanize astronauts who often end up being 'heroes' in people's minds; people who travel space, as some supernatural creature rather than a human of flesh and blood who worked really hard, and possibly was really lucky. But what I liked best about this book is that it's personal, it's funny, Hadfield shares a lot of anecdotes and he shares his own feelings about things like returning to earth after several months away. There's both I think a lot of genuineness and humor found in this book, which in my personal opinion lends itself well to inviting people into a subject they might not have explored before or otherwise. The book starts off with his becoming an astronaut; education, other work leading up to the job, training for space travels, etc. He moves on to preparations for launch, life up in space, and finishes with the adaption to life back on earth. The way the book is structured is great because it follows, in a much speeded up version of course, the trajectory of a trip to space and back. Peering inside the premises to see everything (and everyone!) necessary to make space travel happen, and facing some of the for me not thought of complications in a life without gravity, was just an utter delight of learning and entertainment rolled into one. The subject of toilet-related things up in space seems to be a crowd-pleaser kind of topic, unsurprisingly, but another example he gives is that crying is a complicated business without the tears actually falling down. Or showers. Or sweating. All activities dependent on drops falling is of course a whole different matter in an environment where everything floats. I really found Hadfield's personality throughout the book to be friendly and welcoming, lighthearted and fun while also acknowledging all the hard work (and money) gone into such an amazing thing as space travel and exploration, and especially the enormous team behind it. His own thoughts spread throughout the book, like the 'aim to be a zero' or 'sweat the small stuff', I also thought were no-nonsense and down to earth (!). While I tend to avoid self-help type books and writing, I didn't find Hadfield's approach annoying or preachy, which might be due to my similarity in thinking to the author. I don't think it's correct to say this book is a self-help book, it's first and foremost a memoir, second a sort of philosophical ramblings of an astronaut, but there are certainly things in the book that could be taken and applied to life generally. However it's always clearly connected both to Hadfield's experience as an astronaut, and to his plans going forward. For example, one thing I liked best was when he talks of the importance in defining your good moments or your happiness yourself. Otherwise, anything after 'gone to space' is failure. Not everyone will be in space of course, but he continues to say that if you only measure your life based on the 'big' moments, you're going to spend a lot of time not happy. Which is possibly very self-evident to some, but I know many that would benefit from taking this advice into account. All in all, a fantastic book that was highly enjoyable from page one to the last word, and that I would gladly both recommend and read again. "
206,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/321673-jamie-collins,3,"3.5 stars, a nice memoir from Hadfield. The first few chapters are perhaps a bit fluffy - a quick overview of how he achieved his lifelong goal of becoming an astronaut, along with some self-help advice - and I’d have been disappointed if the book had continued in that vein, but soon enough he goes into more detail about his career and his three spaceflights.It’s almost amusing to watch Hadfield try to humbly describe how he was the best at everything he ever tried and reached the pinnacle of his profession through hard work and meticulous preparation and the support of a great wife. The man has had, and is still having, a hell of a grand life.He provides interesting details about astronaut training, about his work as a capcom, his work in operations in Russia, and especially about his flights on the shuttle and the Soyuz, and his time on the ISS. In particular I learned some things I didn’t know about Russian customs surrounding space missions. (I had heard that the astronauts and cosmonauts pee on the rear tire of the bus that drops them off at their rocket before their flight, because Gagarin did so. I didn’t know that Russians view the opening of the hatch as the true start of an expedition, and that it’s unlucky to shake hands across the threshold.)I enjoyed his analysis of the difficulties that arise when astronauts, who are “without exception, extremely competitive” must adapt to working as a team, rather than pushing their way into a leadership role.Although he describes a couple of astronauts (no names) who were difficult to work with, he has nothing bad to say about NASA or the CSA. It’s a cheerful, upbeat book, just what you’d expect from Hadfield."
207,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6676926-jenna-falling-letters,4,"A great read! I picked up this book because I wanted to learn more from the man himself about what it's like to be an astronaut (admittedly also because I thought I should read the book before going to his signing...). I was not disappointed! Reading Hadfield's story made me really excited about space and space exploration, uncontainably excited - I felt absolutely exhilarated while reading about Hadfield's final ascent into space and I held my breath during the final days of his time up there, even though I knew what would happen. Reading this book before bed made it difficult to sleep. It's one to think ""Okay, so this guy has been in space, that's so cool"" and another to read his words and be totally astounded at the idea that yes, we can send people into space! It's really an incredible concept, one that I don't think will ever lose its ability to astonish. I was blown away by the amount of knowledge that astronauts must possess - I never really thought about that before, but when there's only three people up there and so many situations that could play out, you really do have to be prepared for anything and be ready to make split second decisions to ensure your own survival. I also enjoyed how Hadfield framed his 'life philosophies' within the context of his career with NASA. This book put a lot about space travel into perspective for me and makes me want to seek out other books by astronauts! Who knows if there will be any other ones as good as this though ;P"
208,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"I’ve been meaning to read this forever, after getting quite into the videos Chris Hadfield posted and the stuff he tweeted when he was on the International Space Station. This is both less glamorous than you’d imagine an astronaut’s book to be, and more practical in terms of actual advice about everyday life. There are details about NASA, about what it’s like to fly a plane or go into space, etc, but there’s also a lot about being a team player, communication with family, and all sorts of ordinary things that maybe you wouldn’t think an astronaut would talk about.Overall, Hadfield comes off as a down to earth (ha) and likeable guy, with a sense of humour about life and humility about his achievements, even though they’re pretty epic achievements. I found his book mostly interesting, although sometimes talking about bureaucracy was just bewilderingly frustrating — and why should he have exploratory surgery to prove that he doesn’t need exploratory surgery again? Aaargh, world, you are weird.It’s mostly not really about being an astronaut. It’s about loving your job, working hard, and trying to be a decent human being. The moments of wonder are there too, but this is mostly about the road taken to get there.Originally posted here."
209,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15984398-laurie,4,"To most people, being in space has got to be one of the coolest but most unimaginable things one can do. All we really envision that astronauts do while they are in space is float around doings flips and playing with water bubbles. I knew, of course, that they actually do lots of science experiments but I was unaware of how much time it takes in their day to do their jobs.This account of Hadfield's career as an astronaut was interesting, and he definitely had a stellar career since he went to space three times with the final time as a commander on the ISS for a few months. Although he was so successful in his profession, he comes across as humble and accessible. Mixed in with the narrative of his trips to space, Hadfield includes advice on things he learned and had to utilize in his daily life as an astronaut which anyone can use. These are things that we are told about in typical self-help books, but he relates them in a way that you really see how they are important are even in a job like his. One of the things that is so obvious throughout this book is that Chris Hadfield is one of the most motivated and driven people I've ever read about. He was a useful and willing cog in a very big corporate machine. Whether some of his advice would work in all professions or not, the lessons are also ones that can be used in one's daily life as well."

Chris Hadfield replaced that blind admiration to the astronauts we had from our very childhood with the deep respect which may arise out of the strong empathy in me. He explained the tiny little details and intimate atmosphere of being an astronaut. On one hand, he described the technicality of his job, on the other hand, he reflected his inner world as a reflection of that technicality kingdom. The writing style was perfect - it never tired of me. I felt high-level connectedness with the narration. This book especially might be very useful for young people, students or persons who are on their early stage of the career because it motivates via the rooted wisdom of the experienced professional of his field. Overall, I totally recommend this book to everybody who simply wants to have an honest conversation because in its essence it feels like an interactive and honest conversation. "

Interspersed with numerous life lessons, this memoir is definitely a page turner. "
215,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4453896-jeffrey-sylvester,3,"“An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth” by Chris Hadfield was decent but less than expected. What enticed me to buy this book were Hadfield’s comments regarding divinity on George Stroumboulopoulos. During that interview, Stroum mockingly asks Hadfield whether he ever considers spirituality and how he deals with those who are spiritual, as if Hadfield is not spiritual, and as if human derived rationality is the end all, be all, of knowledge. To what I hope was Stroum’s ignorant surprise, Hadfield immediately countered that spirituality is among the forefront of topics astronauts consider and discuss on the International Space Station (ISS). Hadfield went on to explain that given the cultural diversity among astronauts, their beliefs are vastly diverse, and given how beliefs are what got them there, all beliefs are highly respected. Hadfield then described the surreal experience of spacewalk. The magnitude of viewing the majestic beauty of Earth on one side, while staring off into the infinite texture of possibility on the other, and the difficulty in presuming such madness could happen by chance. The inference being, divinity, however defined.I was hoping Hadfield would expand on this experience in his book and was sorely disappointed when he didn’t. This omission inspired me to search the internet for other comments he may have made in different forums to this end and what I found was likewise disappointing. Several orthodox religious groups have taken what Hadfield said on Stroum and have twisted it to suit their own political and narrow-minded purposes, a predictable disincentive for Hadfield to ever broach the topic in the first place, let alone elaborate on it further in printed word.  What I liked about the book were the explanations describing the evolution of the space-program, its cost-benefit as a public good, his informed views on the need for environmental stewardship, and the general challenges associated with space borne discovery. For example, I have always been curious as to why they shelved the shuttle in favor of the Soyuz and he explains this well. I also enjoyed the parallels he drew between the preparations required for New World discovery voyages and space voyages today. What I didn’t enjoy were the often excessive and redundant amounts of detail regarding his personal journey and the walkthrough of solving incessant mechanical blunders during his involvement with various space projects. I think for someone as into it as he is, this is likely exciting, but for a laymen like me it became dizzingly boring. One of the points he is trying to make with it is that astronauts and their teams must “sweat the small stuff” (details) or they run the risk of death and failed expeditions. The only problem is that this level of redundant detail comprises most of the chapters. Overall, I appreciate Hadfield’s attempt to relate the values and discipline required to becoming an astronaut to the lives of regular people but I felt his advice was fairly plebeian in this regard. When I buy an astronaut’s book, I am not looking for “Chicken Soup for the Soul”. I am looking for a revelatory view specific to their rare and privileged view of viewing Earth from space. And beyond the multitude of the intense earthly considerations an astronaut has to make in order to make it to and fro to the ISS, Hadfield’s book doesn’t provide this. It was informative with respect to the space program but otherwise not riveting. Nevertheless, it helped me better appreciate Hadfield as a dedicated Canadian icon, and we can never have enough of those. 3 stars for Hadfield!"
216,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14201634-juliette,3,"First of all, happy 390th birthday to Giovanni Cassini!I am a space geek. I'm still sad that I am not smart enough (or, as Colonel Hadfield would have said, didn't work hard enough) to work for NASA. So sad. But I love learning about the universe, and I'll never give up on learning about it.I picked up this book more for the ""Astronaut"" in the title than for the ""Guide to Life on Earth."" I admire Col. Hadfield very much for bringing scientific education to the under-educated public. Education is his passion, and a lot of this book is fed by his desire to teach laypeople about the various space agencies (and to justify where their tax dollars go).The public sees the spectacular finishes: the Moon landing, the landing of Curiosity on Mars, the technicolor Hubble calendars. It's facile to think that the lives of the people at the space agencies are just a string of glories. We don't see the long hours that the people at the agencies log in order to achieve their glories. If this book is about anything, it is about hard work and perseverance. Colonel Hadfield's hard work and perseverance, his wife's hard work and perseverance, and, he hopes, everyone's hard work and perseverance.The ""Guide"" portion of the book was not as interesting to me as Col. Hadfield's day-to-day life. I learned so many little details about training. (I didn't know that astronauts are required to learn Russian. Stop and think about it for a minute, and it makes sense, but it never occurred to me. I guess I thought of Soyuz as a connecting flight, no biggie. But, no, North American scientists and astronauts are in Russia for a very long time, and it makes sense to learn Russian because their neighbors and coworkers speak Russian.)The parts about learning to be a zero and climbing down the ladder were nice, but, if I'd wanted to learn that, I would have re-read The Gita.I really enjoyed the way that Col. Hadfield wrote about his wife, who seems like a wonderful woman (and her laughing wedding picture is beautiful). I think, if I were to marry, I would be over-the-moon joyful if my husband to think of me with the same humor and awe that is evident when Chris writes of Helene:A lot of people who meet us remark that it can't be easy being married to a highly driven, take-charge overachiever who views moving house as a sport, and I have to confess that is not -- being married to Helene has at times been difficult for me. (pp. 7-8)I have dedicated the book to Helene, as there is no one more deserving and beloved. (Acknowledgements)By the end of the book, I was in love with Helene Hadfield.If you read the book -- and I hope you do, despite my lackluster rating -- it's better to think of the book as a collection of essays rather than a full-fledged memoir. The chapters don't flow into one another. I think I would have given the book a four or five star rating if that thought had come to me earlier."

218,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583076-sue-smith,4,"This is a whirlwind look at the life and times of Colonel Chris Hadfield - starting from his first recollections on his aspirations to become an astronaut. His focus on the task is pretty incredible (I can't imagine what I would have accomplished if I'd kept that focused on my goals. Wait - do I have goals? Maybe that is my problem!). It's nice to see that you can go through your life and not have any doubts about what you're doing - or why you're doing it. I didn't pick that path that's for sure.Anyways, it was an interesting look at the space program and his wonderful mission completion that was brought to the attention of the world with the power of the internet and the help of his family to ensure it's successful launching. There were lots of great stories that only a few people will get to experience in their lifetime, but most will experience vicariously through stories such as this. Sounded fascinating truly but I really like terra ferma myself. I love to hear the stories but have no desire to get any higher into the air than what a jet liner will take me, so this was a great book to satisfy that. There wasn't much in the way of guidance to surviving on earth other than the usual tenets - work hard, support each other and focus, focus, focus. Oh - and the old philosophy of 'don't worry, be happy' - all things positive will lead to what you need and want. It's just hard to see that sometimes, so you need to have faith."
219,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6590000-bjoern-rochel,5,"This book was a recommendation of a friend. Definitely worth the read, for a whole variety of reasons. It gives you an insight of what it actually means to be an astronaut. You get a pretty good feel about their routines, their drill and their dedication to the one mission (bringing humanity forward). I had no idea how rigid and daunting the program is. After reading this book, I assume, most readers will look mildly amused at Hollywoods depiction of astronauts. Couldn't be more far off. Armageddon, anyone?Astronauts and the space program as a whole are in my opinion perfect examples of lifelong (super-)learners and knowledge communities. In that regard the book offered a lot of interesting ideas to me that are also applicable for the business world. Not sure how much in reality, but at least it's good to have an interesting role model to look up to.Some things I found in particular interesting:- The anti-specialisation in the skill-set of astronauts- Decision checklists and trees - Being the Zero- Up and downwards climbing of the career latter- Debrief and its implication for future training and simulationsSome final words regarding the writing style: Chris Hadfield seems to be a very humble being. You don't read that too often. He reminds me of the guy that recommended the book to me. Something a lot of us can learn from."

I hadn't paid much attention to Chris Hadfield when he was in the spotlight doing book signings, space music videos, and what not, so I didn't know what to expect. What I got was a humble, intelligent, down to earth (haha) account of a remarkable career and an even more remarkable human being. The book is part biography, part Guide to Life, and it balances the two themes well, giving pieces of story surrounded with simple messages and learnings. It was seriously motivating, and the simple tenets by which he lives his life should be things readers take to heart, as there would be more supportive spouses, team-centric co-workers, and people passionate about their interests. If Chris Hadfield can turn more young people onto science, nature and the wonder of the Universe, that is a good thing. If he can show people how to live a humble life and achieve your dreams, well that's an even better thing."

This will become our generation's guide to space exploration and the greatest travel memoir seen in some time.Hadfield's book testifies to both his skill as an astronaut and his genuine warmth and personableness. Tracing his ascent from dreamer, to fighter pilot, to commander of the International Space Station, Hadfield shares his story and much friendly advice about getting on on this planet of ours. The writing is decent, yet has a tone that grows on you. But the hundreds of behind-the-scenes vignettes about training and life in zero-gravity alone make this a worthwhile read.Follow me on Twitter: @Dr_A_Taubman"
222,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4136921-sookie,4,"This memoir reads out like a long conversation with a friend you haven't seen in decades. Hadfield very subtly doles out lessons in life without being too sanctimonious and write mind numbing deep allegories. He experiences his heartbreak and deals with it with dignity and poise. Its amazing how much he has achieved and how much his family worked as a unit to get him there. He never discredits his wife's unquestioned support and the sacrifices that came through the years, her efforts in raising their children and everything she did for the progress of his career. He had a dream and his entire family made him the person he is today - an astronaut and a really amazing guy.His attitude towards life is inspiring and quite simple. His simplicity is evident in his writing. Quite enjoyable memoir whose photographs are what made me look him up in the first place. "

But the tone was a bit stiff; a bit of a dad lecture, and I rolled my eyes just a tiny bit at the earnestness of it all. Nevertheless, kept us company as an audiobook the entire family enjoyed on a long road trip, and I will get a kick out of telling my nine year old that she has one more year to decide what her dream is, and then must spend every second of the rest of her life preparing to achieve it, or else.

It wasn't actually a bad book--very inspirational--but I had to read it for class so that kinda ruined it for me.But still a good book. :)

Not only was it an absolutely fascinating look at the less-publicized aspects of space travel, but Hadfield's perspectives on perseverance and success are really quite insightful and valuable. I want all of my middle schoolers to read this!"

229,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,5,"The word ""inspirational"" gets tossed around a lot, but it's hard to read this and not feel inspired. The book starts a bit slow, focusing on Hadfield's early life and training, but the training gradually becomes more and more intense, and then next thing you know, he's on the launch pad, and the book, well, it takes off. Some of the highlights for me:- The training astronauts go through is extraordinary. They prepare for EVERYTHING, go through every contingency, debrief after every simulation (and especially every ""failure""), assemble everything they've learned across generations of astronauts into a ""flight rules"" book with detailed scenario walkthroughs, and practice these scenarios over and over and over again. They learn an incredible breadth of abilities, from flying, to physics, to chemistry, to biology, to wilderness survival, and so much more. And they do this for years, with only a faint hope of being one of the lucky few who is chosen to go to outer space and put these skills to use. I can't do it any justice; just read the book to get a sense of what it really takes to be an astronaut.- Reading this, you realize that, even if you've dreamt about being an astronaut your whole life, the truth is, you don't actually want to be an astronaut. The amount of training. The constant awareness of the high risks involved and very real chance of dying. The G forces and the very real chance of shitting yourself. The nausea your first days/weeks in space. The always puffy face and constant congestion. The total lack of privacy. The cramped quarters. The inability to properly shower or wash clothes. The intense stress and pressure to not screw up, waste years of effort, billions of dollars, and get people killed.- I love the part where Hadfield describes the preparation for launch. The trip to Baikonur. The quarantine. The parties. The backup crew on a separate bus. The traditions and superstitions, like watching specific movies, peeing on specific things, etc. Gearing up. Cramming into the shuttle / capsule. - The description of life aboard the ISS is even better. Learning what the day to day schedule is like, how they work with crews from other countries, how they eat (and what they eat), exercise (treadmills and vacuum-resistance machines), sleep (in private tubes!), and take care of hygiene and basic bodily needs (this sounds awful), the experiments they run, the views of earth from above, the amount of time it takes to prepare for a space walk, the maintenance they have to constantly do. The story of fixing the ammonia leak is intense!- The story of the insane re-entry procedure of the Soyuz is... something else. The crazy G forces, the ablative heat shield to resist air friction, the crazy crash at the end (with the specially molded seats that prevent your back from breaking on impact)... And then the months of recovery once you've returned from living in zero G's to life on earth (the constant weakness, nausea, foot pain, brittleness of bones, dizziness due to arteries/veins not working as well as they need to, etc). We take for granted what the body does to allow you to live in a gravity well.The writing in the book is a bit mechanical, for lack of a better term, and combined with the slow intro to the book, it's a little hard to get into, but trust me, it's worth sticking with it. The content here is amazing and it makes you appreciate what an accomplishment it is that we have been able to get humans into outer space (and back home!).As always, I've saved a few of my favorite quotes from the book:“If the only thing you really enjoyed was whipping around Earth in a spaceship, you’d hate being an astronaut. The ratio of prep time to time on orbit is many months: single day in space. You train for a few years, minimum, before you’re even assigned to a space mission; training for a specific mission then takes between two and four years, and is much more intensive and rigorous than general training. You practice tricky, repetitive tasks as well as highly challenging ones to the point of exhaustion, and you’re away from home more than half the time. If you don’t love the job, that time will not fly. Nor will the months after a flight, when you’re recovering, undergoing medical testing and debriefing on all kinds of technical and scientific details. Nor will the years of regular training between missions, when you’re recertifying and learning new skills, while helping other astronauts get ready for their flights. If you viewed training as a dreary chore, not only would you be unhappy every day, but your sense of self-worth and professional purpose would be shattered if you were scrubbed from a mission—or never got one.”“It’s almost comical that astronauts are stereotyped as daredevils and cowboys. As a rule, we’re highly methodical and detail-oriented. Our passion isn’t for thrills but for the grindstone, and pressing our noses to it. We have to: we’re responsible for equipment that has cost taxpayers many millions of dollars, and the best insurance policy we have on our lives is our own dedication to training. Studying, simulating, practicing until responses become automatic—astronauts don’t do all this only to fulfill NASA’s requirements. Training is something we do to reduce the odds that we’ll die. Sometimes, as with Challenger and Columbia, a vehicle fails and there’s absolutely nothing the crew can do. But sometimes there is. Astronauts have survived fires on the launch pad and in space, ballistic landings where the Soyuz has come back through the atmosphere like a rock hurled from space—even a collision that punctured a spacecraft and caused sudden depressurization. In a real crisis like that, a group hug isn’t going to save you. Your only hope is knowing exactly what to do and being able to do it calmly and quickly.”“If anything, I’m annoyingly upbeat, at least according to the experts (my family, of course). I tend to expect things will turn out well and they usually do. My optimism and confidence come not from feeling I’m luckier than other mortals, and they sure don’t come from visualizing victory. They’re the result of a lifetime spent visualizing defeat and figuring out how to prevent it.”“In zero gravity, there’s no need for a mattress or pillow; you already feel like you’re resting on a cloud, perfectly supported, so there’s no tossing and turning to find a more comfortable position.”“A lot of what happens to the human body in space is really similar to what happens during the aging process. In post-flight quarantine, in fact, Tom and I tottered around like two old duffers, getting a preview of what life might be like if we made it to 90. Our blood vessels had hardened; our cardiovascular systems had changed. We had shed calcium and minerals in space, so our bones were weaker; so were our muscles, because for 22 hours a day, they’d encountered no resistance whatsoever.”"
230,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth is a mixture of self-help and memoir. Hadfield simply takes some fairly prosaic lessons that he leaned in his efforts to become an astronaut (work hard, pay attention to detail, expect things to go wrong and be ready, train hard, et cetera. The sorts of things they teach you in the Boy Scouts) and then he bolts these concepts onto his various astronaut stories with varying levels of success. At it’s best this book is inspiring, but at it’s worst it can feel like an ex military type is giving you a lecture on being a team player (because that’s exactly what’s happening).The last 1/3 of the book was my favorite. This is where Hadfield lays off the improving lectures and gets into more detail about what life on the ISS is like. Ultimately, he is very likable and able to project a winning sense of humility while telling tales of his impressive accomplishments, and his book is as likable as he is."

Well, Chris Hadfield dreamed of becoming an astronaut, and all these years later, he managed to achieve that dream. Back in 1969, for Hadfield to have such a dream was highly ridiculous because Canada didn't even have a space agency of their own! But that didn't stop him, and he talks all about it in this inspirational memoir.From having a little dream and working towards it to becoming the first Canadian astronaut to live aboard the International Space Station to becoming viral for his version of Bob Dylan's Space Oddity (IN SPACE!), Hadfield shares his life story.This book will bring the childlike wonder you had about space back in your eyes, it definitely did that for me. I was a space nerd growing up, and this book rekindled my love for space.Hadfield is so inspiring and optimistic, you'll wonder if this man is for real! But he is a realist as well. I reckon if you have trained all your life about the ways you can die in space, you start 'sweating the small stuff' but enjoy them, too. His advice on trying to become a zero (read to know what I'm talking about!) was the best part about the book.For me, the biggest takeaway from this memoir is that never stop working towards your dream. If you work hard and smart, you'll not only beat all the odds but end up with everything you had ever dreamed of. This book will inspire you, aspire you to be humble, and enjoy the little joys of life. Highly, highly recommended!PS please watch all of Hadfield's videos!"

Perhaps it was the short time span I read it over, but I found the book to be somewhat repetitive - past that, I have nothing bad to say. It was extremely eye opening to hear about the astronaut profession in extreme detail, and Hadfield shares so many incredible stories that had happened throughout his life. I also really respected that he including some of his failures and shortcomings in the text - although they were nothing extreme it certainly helped to humanize this Canadian hero."

This one, for example, left me with an entirely new understanding of what it really takes (and means) to be an astronaut (with a few lessons for life thrown in for good measure)."
235,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6548813-natalie-curiousreader,4,"Chris Hadfield's An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth is a combination of a memoir and something of a modern philosophical work. He blends his own experiences of training to and working as an astronaut with his observations on life, success, purpose, and more. Through looking at a personal journey in space exploration, he connects to the larger picture both to the people he's known and to the world at large. While the writing style can come off as 'self-help'ish in the way he frames his 'advice' and conclusions from personal experience, it's more I think an attempt to humanize astronauts who often end up being 'heroes' in people's minds; people who travel space, as some supernatural creature rather than a human of flesh and blood who worked really hard, and possibly was really lucky. But what I liked best about this book is that it's personal, it's funny, Hadfield shares a lot of anecdotes and he shares his own feelings about things like returning to earth after several months away. There's both I think a lot of genuineness and humor found in this book, which in my personal opinion lends itself well to inviting people into a subject they might not have explored before or otherwise. The book starts off with his becoming an astronaut; education, other work leading up to the job, training for space travels, etc. He moves on to preparations for launch, life up in space, and finishes with the adaption to life back on earth. The way the book is structured is great because it follows, in a much speeded up version of course, the trajectory of a trip to space and back. Peering inside the premises to see everything (and everyone!) necessary to make space travel happen, and facing some of the for me not thought of complications in a life without gravity, was just an utter delight of learning and entertainment rolled into one. The subject of toilet-related things up in space seems to be a crowd-pleaser kind of topic, unsurprisingly, but another example he gives is that crying is a complicated business without the tears actually falling down. Or showers. Or sweating. All activities dependent on drops falling is of course a whole different matter in an environment where everything floats. I really found Hadfield's personality throughout the book to be friendly and welcoming, lighthearted and fun while also acknowledging all the hard work (and money) gone into such an amazing thing as space travel and exploration, and especially the enormous team behind it. His own thoughts spread throughout the book, like the 'aim to be a zero' or 'sweat the small stuff', I also thought were no-nonsense and down to earth (!). While I tend to avoid self-help type books and writing, I didn't find Hadfield's approach annoying or preachy, which might be due to my similarity in thinking to the author. I don't think it's correct to say this book is a self-help book, it's first and foremost a memoir, second a sort of philosophical ramblings of an astronaut, but there are certainly things in the book that could be taken and applied to life generally. However it's always clearly connected both to Hadfield's experience as an astronaut, and to his plans going forward. For example, one thing I liked best was when he talks of the importance in defining your good moments or your happiness yourself. Otherwise, anything after 'gone to space' is failure. Not everyone will be in space of course, but he continues to say that if you only measure your life based on the 'big' moments, you're going to spend a lot of time not happy. Which is possibly very self-evident to some, but I know many that would benefit from taking this advice into account. All in all, a fantastic book that was highly enjoyable from page one to the last word, and that I would gladly both recommend and read again. "
236,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/321673-jamie-collins,3,"3.5 stars, a nice memoir from Hadfield. The first few chapters are perhaps a bit fluffy - a quick overview of how he achieved his lifelong goal of becoming an astronaut, along with some self-help advice - and I’d have been disappointed if the book had continued in that vein, but soon enough he goes into more detail about his career and his three spaceflights.It’s almost amusing to watch Hadfield try to humbly describe how he was the best at everything he ever tried and reached the pinnacle of his profession through hard work and meticulous preparation and the support of a great wife. The man has had, and is still having, a hell of a grand life.He provides interesting details about astronaut training, about his work as a capcom, his work in operations in Russia, and especially about his flights on the shuttle and the Soyuz, and his time on the ISS. In particular I learned some things I didn’t know about Russian customs surrounding space missions. (I had heard that the astronauts and cosmonauts pee on the rear tire of the bus that drops them off at their rocket before their flight, because Gagarin did so. I didn’t know that Russians view the opening of the hatch as the true start of an expedition, and that it’s unlucky to shake hands across the threshold.)I enjoyed his analysis of the difficulties that arise when astronauts, who are “without exception, extremely competitive” must adapt to working as a team, rather than pushing their way into a leadership role.Although he describes a couple of astronauts (no names) who were difficult to work with, he has nothing bad to say about NASA or the CSA. It’s a cheerful, upbeat book, just what you’d expect from Hadfield."
237,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6676926-jenna-falling-letters,4,"A great read! I picked up this book because I wanted to learn more from the man himself about what it's like to be an astronaut (admittedly also because I thought I should read the book before going to his signing...). I was not disappointed! Reading Hadfield's story made me really excited about space and space exploration, uncontainably excited - I felt absolutely exhilarated while reading about Hadfield's final ascent into space and I held my breath during the final days of his time up there, even though I knew what would happen. Reading this book before bed made it difficult to sleep. It's one to think ""Okay, so this guy has been in space, that's so cool"" and another to read his words and be totally astounded at the idea that yes, we can send people into space! It's really an incredible concept, one that I don't think will ever lose its ability to astonish. I was blown away by the amount of knowledge that astronauts must possess - I never really thought about that before, but when there's only three people up there and so many situations that could play out, you really do have to be prepared for anything and be ready to make split second decisions to ensure your own survival. I also enjoyed how Hadfield framed his 'life philosophies' within the context of his career with NASA. This book put a lot about space travel into perspective for me and makes me want to seek out other books by astronauts! Who knows if there will be any other ones as good as this though ;P"
238,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"I’ve been meaning to read this forever, after getting quite into the videos Chris Hadfield posted and the stuff he tweeted when he was on the International Space Station. This is both less glamorous than you’d imagine an astronaut’s book to be, and more practical in terms of actual advice about everyday life. There are details about NASA, about what it’s like to fly a plane or go into space, etc, but there’s also a lot about being a team player, communication with family, and all sorts of ordinary things that maybe you wouldn’t think an astronaut would talk about.Overall, Hadfield comes off as a down to earth (ha) and likeable guy, with a sense of humour about life and humility about his achievements, even though they’re pretty epic achievements. I found his book mostly interesting, although sometimes talking about bureaucracy was just bewilderingly frustrating — and why should he have exploratory surgery to prove that he doesn’t need exploratory surgery again? Aaargh, world, you are weird.It’s mostly not really about being an astronaut. It’s about loving your job, working hard, and trying to be a decent human being. The moments of wonder are there too, but this is mostly about the road taken to get there.Originally posted here."
239,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15984398-laurie,4,"To most people, being in space has got to be one of the coolest but most unimaginable things one can do. All we really envision that astronauts do while they are in space is float around doings flips and playing with water bubbles. I knew, of course, that they actually do lots of science experiments but I was unaware of how much time it takes in their day to do their jobs.This account of Hadfield's career as an astronaut was interesting, and he definitely had a stellar career since he went to space three times with the final time as a commander on the ISS for a few months. Although he was so successful in his profession, he comes across as humble and accessible. Mixed in with the narrative of his trips to space, Hadfield includes advice on things he learned and had to utilize in his daily life as an astronaut which anyone can use. These are things that we are told about in typical self-help books, but he relates them in a way that you really see how they are important are even in a job like his. One of the things that is so obvious throughout this book is that Chris Hadfield is one of the most motivated and driven people I've ever read about. He was a useful and willing cog in a very big corporate machine. Whether some of his advice would work in all professions or not, the lessons are also ones that can be used in one's daily life as well."

Chris Hadfield replaced that blind admiration to the astronauts we had from our very childhood with the deep respect which may arise out of the strong empathy in me. He explained the tiny little details and intimate atmosphere of being an astronaut. On one hand, he described the technicality of his job, on the other hand, he reflected his inner world as a reflection of that technicality kingdom. The writing style was perfect - it never tired of me. I felt high-level connectedness with the narration. This book especially might be very useful for young people, students or persons who are on their early stage of the career because it motivates via the rooted wisdom of the experienced professional of his field. Overall, I totally recommend this book to everybody who simply wants to have an honest conversation because in its essence it feels like an interactive and honest conversation. "

Interspersed with numerous life lessons, this memoir is definitely a page turner. "
245,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4453896-jeffrey-sylvester,3,"“An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth” by Chris Hadfield was decent but less than expected. What enticed me to buy this book were Hadfield’s comments regarding divinity on George Stroumboulopoulos. During that interview, Stroum mockingly asks Hadfield whether he ever considers spirituality and how he deals with those who are spiritual, as if Hadfield is not spiritual, and as if human derived rationality is the end all, be all, of knowledge. To what I hope was Stroum’s ignorant surprise, Hadfield immediately countered that spirituality is among the forefront of topics astronauts consider and discuss on the International Space Station (ISS). Hadfield went on to explain that given the cultural diversity among astronauts, their beliefs are vastly diverse, and given how beliefs are what got them there, all beliefs are highly respected. Hadfield then described the surreal experience of spacewalk. The magnitude of viewing the majestic beauty of Earth on one side, while staring off into the infinite texture of possibility on the other, and the difficulty in presuming such madness could happen by chance. The inference being, divinity, however defined.I was hoping Hadfield would expand on this experience in his book and was sorely disappointed when he didn’t. This omission inspired me to search the internet for other comments he may have made in different forums to this end and what I found was likewise disappointing. Several orthodox religious groups have taken what Hadfield said on Stroum and have twisted it to suit their own political and narrow-minded purposes, a predictable disincentive for Hadfield to ever broach the topic in the first place, let alone elaborate on it further in printed word.  What I liked about the book were the explanations describing the evolution of the space-program, its cost-benefit as a public good, his informed views on the need for environmental stewardship, and the general challenges associated with space borne discovery. For example, I have always been curious as to why they shelved the shuttle in favor of the Soyuz and he explains this well. I also enjoyed the parallels he drew between the preparations required for New World discovery voyages and space voyages today. What I didn’t enjoy were the often excessive and redundant amounts of detail regarding his personal journey and the walkthrough of solving incessant mechanical blunders during his involvement with various space projects. I think for someone as into it as he is, this is likely exciting, but for a laymen like me it became dizzingly boring. One of the points he is trying to make with it is that astronauts and their teams must “sweat the small stuff” (details) or they run the risk of death and failed expeditions. The only problem is that this level of redundant detail comprises most of the chapters. Overall, I appreciate Hadfield’s attempt to relate the values and discipline required to becoming an astronaut to the lives of regular people but I felt his advice was fairly plebeian in this regard. When I buy an astronaut’s book, I am not looking for “Chicken Soup for the Soul”. I am looking for a revelatory view specific to their rare and privileged view of viewing Earth from space. And beyond the multitude of the intense earthly considerations an astronaut has to make in order to make it to and fro to the ISS, Hadfield’s book doesn’t provide this. It was informative with respect to the space program but otherwise not riveting. Nevertheless, it helped me better appreciate Hadfield as a dedicated Canadian icon, and we can never have enough of those. 3 stars for Hadfield!"
246,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14201634-juliette,3,"First of all, happy 390th birthday to Giovanni Cassini!I am a space geek. I'm still sad that I am not smart enough (or, as Colonel Hadfield would have said, didn't work hard enough) to work for NASA. So sad. But I love learning about the universe, and I'll never give up on learning about it.I picked up this book more for the ""Astronaut"" in the title than for the ""Guide to Life on Earth."" I admire Col. Hadfield very much for bringing scientific education to the under-educated public. Education is his passion, and a lot of this book is fed by his desire to teach laypeople about the various space agencies (and to justify where their tax dollars go).The public sees the spectacular finishes: the Moon landing, the landing of Curiosity on Mars, the technicolor Hubble calendars. It's facile to think that the lives of the people at the space agencies are just a string of glories. We don't see the long hours that the people at the agencies log in order to achieve their glories. If this book is about anything, it is about hard work and perseverance. Colonel Hadfield's hard work and perseverance, his wife's hard work and perseverance, and, he hopes, everyone's hard work and perseverance.The ""Guide"" portion of the book was not as interesting to me as Col. Hadfield's day-to-day life. I learned so many little details about training. (I didn't know that astronauts are required to learn Russian. Stop and think about it for a minute, and it makes sense, but it never occurred to me. I guess I thought of Soyuz as a connecting flight, no biggie. But, no, North American scientists and astronauts are in Russia for a very long time, and it makes sense to learn Russian because their neighbors and coworkers speak Russian.)The parts about learning to be a zero and climbing down the ladder were nice, but, if I'd wanted to learn that, I would have re-read The Gita.I really enjoyed the way that Col. Hadfield wrote about his wife, who seems like a wonderful woman (and her laughing wedding picture is beautiful). I think, if I were to marry, I would be over-the-moon joyful if my husband to think of me with the same humor and awe that is evident when Chris writes of Helene:A lot of people who meet us remark that it can't be easy being married to a highly driven, take-charge overachiever who views moving house as a sport, and I have to confess that is not -- being married to Helene has at times been difficult for me. (pp. 7-8)I have dedicated the book to Helene, as there is no one more deserving and beloved. (Acknowledgements)By the end of the book, I was in love with Helene Hadfield.If you read the book -- and I hope you do, despite my lackluster rating -- it's better to think of the book as a collection of essays rather than a full-fledged memoir. The chapters don't flow into one another. I think I would have given the book a four or five star rating if that thought had come to me earlier."

248,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583076-sue-smith,4,"This is a whirlwind look at the life and times of Colonel Chris Hadfield - starting from his first recollections on his aspirations to become an astronaut. His focus on the task is pretty incredible (I can't imagine what I would have accomplished if I'd kept that focused on my goals. Wait - do I have goals? Maybe that is my problem!). It's nice to see that you can go through your life and not have any doubts about what you're doing - or why you're doing it. I didn't pick that path that's for sure.Anyways, it was an interesting look at the space program and his wonderful mission completion that was brought to the attention of the world with the power of the internet and the help of his family to ensure it's successful launching. There were lots of great stories that only a few people will get to experience in their lifetime, but most will experience vicariously through stories such as this. Sounded fascinating truly but I really like terra ferma myself. I love to hear the stories but have no desire to get any higher into the air than what a jet liner will take me, so this was a great book to satisfy that. There wasn't much in the way of guidance to surviving on earth other than the usual tenets - work hard, support each other and focus, focus, focus. Oh - and the old philosophy of 'don't worry, be happy' - all things positive will lead to what you need and want. It's just hard to see that sometimes, so you need to have faith."
249,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6590000-bjoern-rochel,5,"This book was a recommendation of a friend. Definitely worth the read, for a whole variety of reasons. It gives you an insight of what it actually means to be an astronaut. You get a pretty good feel about their routines, their drill and their dedication to the one mission (bringing humanity forward). I had no idea how rigid and daunting the program is. After reading this book, I assume, most readers will look mildly amused at Hollywoods depiction of astronauts. Couldn't be more far off. Armageddon, anyone?Astronauts and the space program as a whole are in my opinion perfect examples of lifelong (super-)learners and knowledge communities. In that regard the book offered a lot of interesting ideas to me that are also applicable for the business world. Not sure how much in reality, but at least it's good to have an interesting role model to look up to.Some things I found in particular interesting:- The anti-specialisation in the skill-set of astronauts- Decision checklists and trees - Being the Zero- Up and downwards climbing of the career latter- Debrief and its implication for future training and simulationsSome final words regarding the writing style: Chris Hadfield seems to be a very humble being. You don't read that too often. He reminds me of the guy that recommended the book to me. Something a lot of us can learn from."
250,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15220884-justin-liew,5,"I read this book mainly because many intelligent, interesting people I know were over the moon about it. (haha). I hadn't paid much attention to Chris Hadfield when he was in the spotlight doing book signings, space music videos, and what not, so I didn't know what to expect. What I got was a humble, intelligent, down to earth (haha) account of a remarkable career and an even more remarkable human being. The book is part biography, part Guide to Life, and it balances the two themes well, giving pieces of story surrounded with simple messages and learnings. It was seriously motivating, and the simple tenets by which he lives his life should be things readers take to heart, as there would be more supportive spouses, team-centric co-workers, and people passionate about their interests. If Chris Hadfield can turn more young people onto science, nature and the wonder of the Universe, that is a good thing. If he can show people how to live a humble life and achieve your dreams, well that's an even better thing."
251,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8525332-andrew,4,"We thought the age of the superstar astronaut had passed, but humble Canadian Chris Hadfield has almost single-handedly made space exciting again. This will become our generation's guide to space exploration and the greatest travel memoir seen in some time.Hadfield's book testifies to both his skill as an astronaut and his genuine warmth and personableness. Tracing his ascent from dreamer, to fighter pilot, to commander of the International Space Station, Hadfield shares his story and much friendly advice about getting on on this planet of ours. The writing is decent, yet has a tone that grows on you. But the hundreds of behind-the-scenes vignettes about training and life in zero-gravity alone make this a worthwhile read.Follow me on Twitter: @Dr_A_Taubman"
252,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4136921-sookie,4,"This memoir reads out like a long conversation with a friend you haven't seen in decades. Hadfield very subtly doles out lessons in life without being too sanctimonious and write mind numbing deep allegories. He experiences his heartbreak and deals with it with dignity and poise. Its amazing how much he has achieved and how much his family worked as a unit to get him there. He never discredits his wife's unquestioned support and the sacrifices that came through the years, her efforts in raising their children and everything she did for the progress of his career. He had a dream and his entire family made him the person he is today - an astronaut and a really amazing guy.His attitude towards life is inspiring and quite simple. His simplicity is evident in his writing. Quite enjoyable memoir whose photographs are what made me look him up in the first place. "
253,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8996584-karen-green,4,"3.5Colonel Hadfield is a national treasure, and deserves all the recognition for his achievements that he gets. But the tone was a bit stiff; a bit of a dad lecture, and I rolled my eyes just a tiny bit at the earnestness of it all. Nevertheless, kept us company as an audiobook the entire family enjoyed on a long road trip, and I will get a kick out of telling my nine year old that she has one more year to decide what her dream is, and then must spend every second of the rest of her life preparing to achieve it, or else.

It wasn't actually a bad book--very inspirational--but I had to read it for class so that kinda ruined it for me.But still a good book. :)
257,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2672243-shel,4,"I loved this. Not only was it an absolutely fascinating look at the less-publicized aspects of space travel, but Hadfield's perspectives on perseverance and success are really quite insightful and valuable. I want all of my middle schoolers to read this!"
258,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57158143-bibliovoracious,5,"Yep, the hype's all true. An excellent book, with memorable insights into life on the orbiting ISS and into what it's like to be a massive over-achiever."
259,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,5,"The word ""inspirational"" gets tossed around a lot, but it's hard to read this and not feel inspired. The book starts a bit slow, focusing on Hadfield's early life and training, but the training gradually becomes more and more intense, and then next thing you know, he's on the launch pad, and the book, well, it takes off. Some of the highlights for me:- The training astronauts go through is extraordinary. They prepare for EVERYTHING, go through every contingency, debrief after every simulation (and especially every ""failure""), assemble everything they've learned across generations of astronauts into a ""flight rules"" book with detailed scenario walkthroughs, and practice these scenarios over and over and over again. They learn an incredible breadth of abilities, from flying, to physics, to chemistry, to biology, to wilderness survival, and so much more. And they do this for years, with only a faint hope of being one of the lucky few who is chosen to go to outer space and put these skills to use. I can't do it any justice; just read the book to get a sense of what it really takes to be an astronaut.- Reading this, you realize that, even if you've dreamt about being an astronaut your whole life, the truth is, you don't actually want to be an astronaut. The amount of training. The constant awareness of the high risks involved and very real chance of dying. The G forces and the very real chance of shitting yourself. The nausea your first days/weeks in space. The always puffy face and constant congestion. The total lack of privacy. The cramped quarters. The inability to properly shower or wash clothes. The intense stress and pressure to not screw up, waste years of effort, billions of dollars, and get people killed.- I love the part where Hadfield describes the preparation for launch. The trip to Baikonur. The quarantine. The parties. The backup crew on a separate bus. The traditions and superstitions, like watching specific movies, peeing on specific things, etc. Gearing up. Cramming into the shuttle / capsule. - The description of life aboard the ISS is even better. Learning what the day to day schedule is like, how they work with crews from other countries, how they eat (and what they eat), exercise (treadmills and vacuum-resistance machines), sleep (in private tubes!), and take care of hygiene and basic bodily needs (this sounds awful), the experiments they run, the views of earth from above, the amount of time it takes to prepare for a space walk, the maintenance they have to constantly do. The story of fixing the ammonia leak is intense!- The story of the insane re-entry procedure of the Soyuz is... something else. The crazy G forces, the ablative heat shield to resist air friction, the crazy crash at the end (with the specially molded seats that prevent your back from breaking on impact)... And then the months of recovery once you've returned from living in zero G's to life on earth (the constant weakness, nausea, foot pain, brittleness of bones, dizziness due to arteries/veins not working as well as they need to, etc). We take for granted what the body does to allow you to live in a gravity well.The writing in the book is a bit mechanical, for lack of a better term, and combined with the slow intro to the book, it's a little hard to get into, but trust me, it's worth sticking with it. The content here is amazing and it makes you appreciate what an accomplishment it is that we have been able to get humans into outer space (and back home!).As always, I've saved a few of my favorite quotes from the book:“If the only thing you really enjoyed was whipping around Earth in a spaceship, you’d hate being an astronaut. The ratio of prep time to time on orbit is many months: single day in space. You train for a few years, minimum, before you’re even assigned to a space mission; training for a specific mission then takes between two and four years, and is much more intensive and rigorous than general training. You practice tricky, repetitive tasks as well as highly challenging ones to the point of exhaustion, and you’re away from home more than half the time. If you don’t love the job, that time will not fly. Nor will the months after a flight, when you’re recovering, undergoing medical testing and debriefing on all kinds of technical and scientific details. Nor will the years of regular training between missions, when you’re recertifying and learning new skills, while helping other astronauts get ready for their flights. If you viewed training as a dreary chore, not only would you be unhappy every day, but your sense of self-worth and professional purpose would be shattered if you were scrubbed from a mission—or never got one.”“It’s almost comical that astronauts are stereotyped as daredevils and cowboys. As a rule, we’re highly methodical and detail-oriented. Our passion isn’t for thrills but for the grindstone, and pressing our noses to it. We have to: we’re responsible for equipment that has cost taxpayers many millions of dollars, and the best insurance policy we have on our lives is our own dedication to training. Studying, simulating, practicing until responses become automatic—astronauts don’t do all this only to fulfill NASA’s requirements. Training is something we do to reduce the odds that we’ll die. Sometimes, as with Challenger and Columbia, a vehicle fails and there’s absolutely nothing the crew can do. But sometimes there is. Astronauts have survived fires on the launch pad and in space, ballistic landings where the Soyuz has come back through the atmosphere like a rock hurled from space—even a collision that punctured a spacecraft and caused sudden depressurization. In a real crisis like that, a group hug isn’t going to save you. Your only hope is knowing exactly what to do and being able to do it calmly and quickly.”“If anything, I’m annoyingly upbeat, at least according to the experts (my family, of course). I tend to expect things will turn out well and they usually do. My optimism and confidence come not from feeling I’m luckier than other mortals, and they sure don’t come from visualizing victory. They’re the result of a lifetime spent visualizing defeat and figuring out how to prevent it.”“In zero gravity, there’s no need for a mattress or pillow; you already feel like you’re resting on a cloud, perfectly supported, so there’s no tossing and turning to find a more comfortable position.”“A lot of what happens to the human body in space is really similar to what happens during the aging process. In post-flight quarantine, in fact, Tom and I tottered around like two old duffers, getting a preview of what life might be like if we made it to 90. Our blood vessels had hardened; our cardiovascular systems had changed. We had shed calcium and minerals in space, so our bones were weaker; so were our muscles, because for 22 hours a day, they’d encountered no resistance whatsoever.”"
260,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth is a mixture of self-help and memoir. Hadfield simply takes some fairly prosaic lessons that he leaned in his efforts to become an astronaut (work hard, pay attention to detail, expect things to go wrong and be ready, train hard, et cetera. The sorts of things they teach you in the Boy Scouts) and then he bolts these concepts onto his various astronaut stories with varying levels of success. At it’s best this book is inspiring, but at it’s worst it can feel like an ex military type is giving you a lecture on being a team player (because that’s exactly what’s happening).The last 1/3 of the book was my favorite. This is where Hadfield lays off the improving lectures and gets into more detail about what life on the ISS is like. Ultimately, he is very likable and able to project a winning sense of humility while telling tales of his impressive accomplishments, and his book is as likable as he is."
261,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70879977-sonali,5,"Are you what a 9-year-old you envisioned yourself to be when you grew up? Well, Chris Hadfield dreamed of becoming an astronaut, and all these years later, he managed to achieve that dream. Back in 1969, for Hadfield to have such a dream was highly ridiculous because Canada didn't even have a space agency of their own! But that didn't stop him, and he talks all about it in this inspirational memoir.From having a little dream and working towards it to becoming the first Canadian astronaut to live aboard the International Space Station to becoming viral for his version of Bob Dylan's Space Oddity (IN SPACE!), Hadfield shares his life story.This book will bring the childlike wonder you had about space back in your eyes, it definitely did that for me. I was a space nerd growing up, and this book rekindled my love for space.Hadfield is so inspiring and optimistic, you'll wonder if this man is for real! But he is a realist as well. I reckon if you have trained all your life about the ways you can die in space, you start 'sweating the small stuff' but enjoy them, too. His advice on trying to become a zero (read to know what I'm talking about!) was the best part about the book.For me, the biggest takeaway from this memoir is that never stop working towards your dream. If you work hard and smart, you'll not only beat all the odds but end up with everything you had ever dreamed of. This book will inspire you, aspire you to be humble, and enjoy the little joys of life. Highly, highly recommended!PS please watch all of Hadfield's videos!"

Perhaps it was the short time span I read it over, but I found the book to be somewhat repetitive - past that, I have nothing bad to say. It was extremely eye opening to hear about the astronaut profession in extreme detail, and Hadfield shares so many incredible stories that had happened throughout his life. I also really respected that he including some of his failures and shortcomings in the text - although they were nothing extreme it certainly helped to humanize this Canadian hero."

This one, for example, left me with an entirely new understanding of what it really takes (and means) to be an astronaut (with a few lessons for life thrown in for good measure)."
265,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6548813-natalie-curiousreader,4,"Chris Hadfield's An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth is a combination of a memoir and something of a modern philosophical work. He blends his own experiences of training to and working as an astronaut with his observations on life, success, purpose, and more. Through looking at a personal journey in space exploration, he connects to the larger picture both to the people he's known and to the world at large. While the writing style can come off as 'self-help'ish in the way he frames his 'advice' and conclusions from personal experience, it's more I think an attempt to humanize astronauts who often end up being 'heroes' in people's minds; people who travel space, as some supernatural creature rather than a human of flesh and blood who worked really hard, and possibly was really lucky. But what I liked best about this book is that it's personal, it's funny, Hadfield shares a lot of anecdotes and he shares his own feelings about things like returning to earth after several months away. There's both I think a lot of genuineness and humor found in this book, which in my personal opinion lends itself well to inviting people into a subject they might not have explored before or otherwise. The book starts off with his becoming an astronaut; education, other work leading up to the job, training for space travels, etc. He moves on to preparations for launch, life up in space, and finishes with the adaption to life back on earth. The way the book is structured is great because it follows, in a much speeded up version of course, the trajectory of a trip to space and back. Peering inside the premises to see everything (and everyone!) necessary to make space travel happen, and facing some of the for me not thought of complications in a life without gravity, was just an utter delight of learning and entertainment rolled into one. The subject of toilet-related things up in space seems to be a crowd-pleaser kind of topic, unsurprisingly, but another example he gives is that crying is a complicated business without the tears actually falling down. Or showers. Or sweating. All activities dependent on drops falling is of course a whole different matter in an environment where everything floats. I really found Hadfield's personality throughout the book to be friendly and welcoming, lighthearted and fun while also acknowledging all the hard work (and money) gone into such an amazing thing as space travel and exploration, and especially the enormous team behind it. His own thoughts spread throughout the book, like the 'aim to be a zero' or 'sweat the small stuff', I also thought were no-nonsense and down to earth (!). While I tend to avoid self-help type books and writing, I didn't find Hadfield's approach annoying or preachy, which might be due to my similarity in thinking to the author. I don't think it's correct to say this book is a self-help book, it's first and foremost a memoir, second a sort of philosophical ramblings of an astronaut, but there are certainly things in the book that could be taken and applied to life generally. However it's always clearly connected both to Hadfield's experience as an astronaut, and to his plans going forward. For example, one thing I liked best was when he talks of the importance in defining your good moments or your happiness yourself. Otherwise, anything after 'gone to space' is failure. Not everyone will be in space of course, but he continues to say that if you only measure your life based on the 'big' moments, you're going to spend a lot of time not happy. Which is possibly very self-evident to some, but I know many that would benefit from taking this advice into account. All in all, a fantastic book that was highly enjoyable from page one to the last word, and that I would gladly both recommend and read again. "
266,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/321673-jamie-collins,3,"3.5 stars, a nice memoir from Hadfield. The first few chapters are perhaps a bit fluffy - a quick overview of how he achieved his lifelong goal of becoming an astronaut, along with some self-help advice - and I’d have been disappointed if the book had continued in that vein, but soon enough he goes into more detail about his career and his three spaceflights.It’s almost amusing to watch Hadfield try to humbly describe how he was the best at everything he ever tried and reached the pinnacle of his profession through hard work and meticulous preparation and the support of a great wife. The man has had, and is still having, a hell of a grand life.He provides interesting details about astronaut training, about his work as a capcom, his work in operations in Russia, and especially about his flights on the shuttle and the Soyuz, and his time on the ISS. In particular I learned some things I didn’t know about Russian customs surrounding space missions. (I had heard that the astronauts and cosmonauts pee on the rear tire of the bus that drops them off at their rocket before their flight, because Gagarin did so. I didn’t know that Russians view the opening of the hatch as the true start of an expedition, and that it’s unlucky to shake hands across the threshold.)I enjoyed his analysis of the difficulties that arise when astronauts, who are “without exception, extremely competitive” must adapt to working as a team, rather than pushing their way into a leadership role.Although he describes a couple of astronauts (no names) who were difficult to work with, he has nothing bad to say about NASA or the CSA. It’s a cheerful, upbeat book, just what you’d expect from Hadfield."
267,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6676926-jenna-falling-letters,4,"A great read! I picked up this book because I wanted to learn more from the man himself about what it's like to be an astronaut (admittedly also because I thought I should read the book before going to his signing...). I was not disappointed! Reading Hadfield's story made me really excited about space and space exploration, uncontainably excited - I felt absolutely exhilarated while reading about Hadfield's final ascent into space and I held my breath during the final days of his time up there, even though I knew what would happen. Reading this book before bed made it difficult to sleep. It's one to think ""Okay, so this guy has been in space, that's so cool"" and another to read his words and be totally astounded at the idea that yes, we can send people into space! It's really an incredible concept, one that I don't think will ever lose its ability to astonish. I was blown away by the amount of knowledge that astronauts must possess - I never really thought about that before, but when there's only three people up there and so many situations that could play out, you really do have to be prepared for anything and be ready to make split second decisions to ensure your own survival. I also enjoyed how Hadfield framed his 'life philosophies' within the context of his career with NASA. This book put a lot about space travel into perspective for me and makes me want to seek out other books by astronauts! Who knows if there will be any other ones as good as this though ;P"
268,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"I’ve been meaning to read this forever, after getting quite into the videos Chris Hadfield posted and the stuff he tweeted when he was on the International Space Station. This is both less glamorous than you’d imagine an astronaut’s book to be, and more practical in terms of actual advice about everyday life. There are details about NASA, about what it’s like to fly a plane or go into space, etc, but there’s also a lot about being a team player, communication with family, and all sorts of ordinary things that maybe you wouldn’t think an astronaut would talk about.Overall, Hadfield comes off as a down to earth (ha) and likeable guy, with a sense of humour about life and humility about his achievements, even though they’re pretty epic achievements. I found his book mostly interesting, although sometimes talking about bureaucracy was just bewilderingly frustrating — and why should he have exploratory surgery to prove that he doesn’t need exploratory surgery again? Aaargh, world, you are weird.It’s mostly not really about being an astronaut. It’s about loving your job, working hard, and trying to be a decent human being. The moments of wonder are there too, but this is mostly about the road taken to get there.Originally posted here."
269,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15984398-laurie,4,"To most people, being in space has got to be one of the coolest but most unimaginable things one can do. All we really envision that astronauts do while they are in space is float around doings flips and playing with water bubbles. I knew, of course, that they actually do lots of science experiments but I was unaware of how much time it takes in their day to do their jobs.This account of Hadfield's career as an astronaut was interesting, and he definitely had a stellar career since he went to space three times with the final time as a commander on the ISS for a few months. Although he was so successful in his profession, he comes across as humble and accessible. Mixed in with the narrative of his trips to space, Hadfield includes advice on things he learned and had to utilize in his daily life as an astronaut which anyone can use. These are things that we are told about in typical self-help books, but he relates them in a way that you really see how they are important are even in a job like his. One of the things that is so obvious throughout this book is that Chris Hadfield is one of the most motivated and driven people I've ever read about. He was a useful and willing cog in a very big corporate machine. Whether some of his advice would work in all professions or not, the lessons are also ones that can be used in one's daily life as well."

271,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79761705-lea,5,I finally finished this one and now I really need to write down all the quotes I loved. What a fantastic read at such a demanding time in my life. 
272,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40473382-ibrahim-niftiyev,5,"Finally, I finished this book and I am very happy that after a while I was able to read something really interesting and high quality. Chris Hadfield replaced that blind admiration to the astronauts we had from our very childhood with the deep respect which may arise out of the strong empathy in me. He explained the tiny little details and intimate atmosphere of being an astronaut. On one hand, he described the technicality of his job, on the other hand, he reflected his inner world as a reflection of that technicality kingdom. The writing style was perfect - it never tired of me. I felt high-level connectedness with the narration. This book especially might be very useful for young people, students or persons who are on their early stage of the career because it motivates via the rooted wisdom of the experienced professional of his field. Overall, I totally recommend this book to everybody who simply wants to have an honest conversation because in its essence it feels like an interactive and honest conversation. "
273,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1439381-maj,5,This book filled me with joy.I seriously consider reading it again straight away!
274,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55590750-neeti,5,"A memorable and immensely interesting insight into the Space program and the life of an astronaut.You'd be surprised to to see that a vast majority of an astronaut's life unfolds on earth and not in space :) I love that Hadfield comes across as refreshingly modest and grounded. Interspersed with numerous life lessons, this memoir is definitely a page turner. "
275,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4453896-jeffrey-sylvester,3,"“An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth” by Chris Hadfield was decent but less than expected. What enticed me to buy this book were Hadfield’s comments regarding divinity on George Stroumboulopoulos. During that interview, Stroum mockingly asks Hadfield whether he ever considers spirituality and how he deals with those who are spiritual, as if Hadfield is not spiritual, and as if human derived rationality is the end all, be all, of knowledge. To what I hope was Stroum’s ignorant surprise, Hadfield immediately countered that spirituality is among the forefront of topics astronauts consider and discuss on the International Space Station (ISS). Hadfield went on to explain that given the cultural diversity among astronauts, their beliefs are vastly diverse, and given how beliefs are what got them there, all beliefs are highly respected. Hadfield then described the surreal experience of spacewalk. The magnitude of viewing the majestic beauty of Earth on one side, while staring off into the infinite texture of possibility on the other, and the difficulty in presuming such madness could happen by chance. The inference being, divinity, however defined.I was hoping Hadfield would expand on this experience in his book and was sorely disappointed when he didn’t. This omission inspired me to search the internet for other comments he may have made in different forums to this end and what I found was likewise disappointing. Several orthodox religious groups have taken what Hadfield said on Stroum and have twisted it to suit their own political and narrow-minded purposes, a predictable disincentive for Hadfield to ever broach the topic in the first place, let alone elaborate on it further in printed word.  What I liked about the book were the explanations describing the evolution of the space-program, its cost-benefit as a public good, his informed views on the need for environmental stewardship, and the general challenges associated with space borne discovery. For example, I have always been curious as to why they shelved the shuttle in favor of the Soyuz and he explains this well. I also enjoyed the parallels he drew between the preparations required for New World discovery voyages and space voyages today. What I didn’t enjoy were the often excessive and redundant amounts of detail regarding his personal journey and the walkthrough of solving incessant mechanical blunders during his involvement with various space projects. I think for someone as into it as he is, this is likely exciting, but for a laymen like me it became dizzingly boring. One of the points he is trying to make with it is that astronauts and their teams must “sweat the small stuff” (details) or they run the risk of death and failed expeditions. The only problem is that this level of redundant detail comprises most of the chapters. Overall, I appreciate Hadfield’s attempt to relate the values and discipline required to becoming an astronaut to the lives of regular people but I felt his advice was fairly plebeian in this regard. When I buy an astronaut’s book, I am not looking for “Chicken Soup for the Soul”. I am looking for a revelatory view specific to their rare and privileged view of viewing Earth from space. And beyond the multitude of the intense earthly considerations an astronaut has to make in order to make it to and fro to the ISS, Hadfield’s book doesn’t provide this. It was informative with respect to the space program but otherwise not riveting. Nevertheless, it helped me better appreciate Hadfield as a dedicated Canadian icon, and we can never have enough of those. 3 stars for Hadfield!"
276,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14201634-juliette,3,"First of all, happy 390th birthday to Giovanni Cassini!I am a space geek. I'm still sad that I am not smart enough (or, as Colonel Hadfield would have said, didn't work hard enough) to work for NASA. So sad. But I love learning about the universe, and I'll never give up on learning about it.I picked up this book more for the ""Astronaut"" in the title than for the ""Guide to Life on Earth."" I admire Col. Hadfield very much for bringing scientific education to the under-educated public. Education is his passion, and a lot of this book is fed by his desire to teach laypeople about the various space agencies (and to justify where their tax dollars go).The public sees the spectacular finishes: the Moon landing, the landing of Curiosity on Mars, the technicolor Hubble calendars. It's facile to think that the lives of the people at the space agencies are just a string of glories. We don't see the long hours that the people at the agencies log in order to achieve their glories. If this book is about anything, it is about hard work and perseverance. Colonel Hadfield's hard work and perseverance, his wife's hard work and perseverance, and, he hopes, everyone's hard work and perseverance.The ""Guide"" portion of the book was not as interesting to me as Col. Hadfield's day-to-day life. I learned so many little details about training. (I didn't know that astronauts are required to learn Russian. Stop and think about it for a minute, and it makes sense, but it never occurred to me. I guess I thought of Soyuz as a connecting flight, no biggie. But, no, North American scientists and astronauts are in Russia for a very long time, and it makes sense to learn Russian because their neighbors and coworkers speak Russian.)The parts about learning to be a zero and climbing down the ladder were nice, but, if I'd wanted to learn that, I would have re-read The Gita.I really enjoyed the way that Col. Hadfield wrote about his wife, who seems like a wonderful woman (and her laughing wedding picture is beautiful). I think, if I were to marry, I would be over-the-moon joyful if my husband to think of me with the same humor and awe that is evident when Chris writes of Helene:A lot of people who meet us remark that it can't be easy being married to a highly driven, take-charge overachiever who views moving house as a sport, and I have to confess that is not -- being married to Helene has at times been difficult for me. (pp. 7-8)I have dedicated the book to Helene, as there is no one more deserving and beloved. (Acknowledgements)By the end of the book, I was in love with Helene Hadfield.If you read the book -- and I hope you do, despite my lackluster rating -- it's better to think of the book as a collection of essays rather than a full-fledged memoir. The chapters don't flow into one another. I think I would have given the book a four or five star rating if that thought had come to me earlier."

This book by Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield is everything you would think the man we have all seen on youtube and the news, could skillfully put together. Insights into what made him strive to be who he is, all while being a great honest person the entire way.It is his career and life, put into words that truly work magically. You will go through different emotions throughout this book, with the eventual hope of giving you the ability to look inside yourself and be the right person you are supposed to be. I think it has been said before, but it must be repeated; This novel stumbles past a simple memoir and into being an amazing 'self-help' book for those willing to understand we all can become Chris Hadfield's in a sense. If you are willing, his experience's and outlook will be there to provide an example for all of us. This is the reason this book is really such a winner, it is a story about Chris, by Chris, but yet it is something that can touch us all in our own personal ways. Hopefully it finds the part of you that knows we can all do amazing things, if we come at it with a positive attitude and the understanding that failure is only a stepping stone.A great read for all ages and all people from every walk of life.""...one of the most important lessons I've learned as an astronaut: to value the wisdom of humility..."" -pg. 282"
278,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583076-sue-smith,4,"This is a whirlwind look at the life and times of Colonel Chris Hadfield - starting from his first recollections on his aspirations to become an astronaut. His focus on the task is pretty incredible (I can't imagine what I would have accomplished if I'd kept that focused on my goals. Wait - do I have goals? Maybe that is my problem!). It's nice to see that you can go through your life and not have any doubts about what you're doing - or why you're doing it. I didn't pick that path that's for sure.Anyways, it was an interesting look at the space program and his wonderful mission completion that was brought to the attention of the world with the power of the internet and the help of his family to ensure it's successful launching. There were lots of great stories that only a few people will get to experience in their lifetime, but most will experience vicariously through stories such as this. Sounded fascinating truly but I really like terra ferma myself. I love to hear the stories but have no desire to get any higher into the air than what a jet liner will take me, so this was a great book to satisfy that. There wasn't much in the way of guidance to surviving on earth other than the usual tenets - work hard, support each other and focus, focus, focus. Oh - and the old philosophy of 'don't worry, be happy' - all things positive will lead to what you need and want. It's just hard to see that sometimes, so you need to have faith."
279,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6590000-bjoern-rochel,5,"This book was a recommendation of a friend. Definitely worth the read, for a whole variety of reasons. It gives you an insight of what it actually means to be an astronaut. You get a pretty good feel about their routines, their drill and their dedication to the one mission (bringing humanity forward). I had no idea how rigid and daunting the program is. After reading this book, I assume, most readers will look mildly amused at Hollywoods depiction of astronauts. Couldn't be more far off. Armageddon, anyone?Astronauts and the space program as a whole are in my opinion perfect examples of lifelong (super-)learners and knowledge communities. In that regard the book offered a lot of interesting ideas to me that are also applicable for the business world. Not sure how much in reality, but at least it's good to have an interesting role model to look up to.Some things I found in particular interesting:- The anti-specialisation in the skill-set of astronauts- Decision checklists and trees - Being the Zero- Up and downwards climbing of the career latter- Debrief and its implication for future training and simulationsSome final words regarding the writing style: Chris Hadfield seems to be a very humble being. You don't read that too often. He reminds me of the guy that recommended the book to me. Something a lot of us can learn from."
280,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15220884-justin-liew,5,"I read this book mainly because many intelligent, interesting people I know were over the moon about it. (haha). I hadn't paid much attention to Chris Hadfield when he was in the spotlight doing book signings, space music videos, and what not, so I didn't know what to expect. What I got was a humble, intelligent, down to earth (haha) account of a remarkable career and an even more remarkable human being. The book is part biography, part Guide to Life, and it balances the two themes well, giving pieces of story surrounded with simple messages and learnings. It was seriously motivating, and the simple tenets by which he lives his life should be things readers take to heart, as there would be more supportive spouses, team-centric co-workers, and people passionate about their interests. If Chris Hadfield can turn more young people onto science, nature and the wonder of the Universe, that is a good thing. If he can show people how to live a humble life and achieve your dreams, well that's an even better thing."
281,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8525332-andrew,4,"We thought the age of the superstar astronaut had passed, but humble Canadian Chris Hadfield has almost single-handedly made space exciting again. This will become our generation's guide to space exploration and the greatest travel memoir seen in some time.Hadfield's book testifies to both his skill as an astronaut and his genuine warmth and personableness. Tracing his ascent from dreamer, to fighter pilot, to commander of the International Space Station, Hadfield shares his story and much friendly advice about getting on on this planet of ours. The writing is decent, yet has a tone that grows on you. But the hundreds of behind-the-scenes vignettes about training and life in zero-gravity alone make this a worthwhile read.Follow me on Twitter: @Dr_A_Taubman"
282,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4136921-sookie,4,"This memoir reads out like a long conversation with a friend you haven't seen in decades. Hadfield very subtly doles out lessons in life without being too sanctimonious and write mind numbing deep allegories. He experiences his heartbreak and deals with it with dignity and poise. Its amazing how much he has achieved and how much his family worked as a unit to get him there. He never discredits his wife's unquestioned support and the sacrifices that came through the years, her efforts in raising their children and everything she did for the progress of his career. He had a dream and his entire family made him the person he is today - an astronaut and a really amazing guy.His attitude towards life is inspiring and quite simple. His simplicity is evident in his writing. Quite enjoyable memoir whose photographs are what made me look him up in the first place. "
283,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8996584-karen-green,4,"3.5Colonel Hadfield is a national treasure, and deserves all the recognition for his achievements that he gets. But the tone was a bit stiff; a bit of a dad lecture, and I rolled my eyes just a tiny bit at the earnestness of it all. Nevertheless, kept us company as an audiobook the entire family enjoyed on a long road trip, and I will get a kick out of telling my nine year old that she has one more year to decide what her dream is, and then must spend every second of the rest of her life preparing to achieve it, or else.

Hadfield has a gift for telling stories in a way that incorporates the upbeat, childlike sense of discovery so present in all his videos from the ISS. I read most of this book with a big smile on my face. Highly recommended. To everyone."

But if I spent my career preparing for every possible impending-death scenario like Chris Hadfield has, maybe I would worry a little less.

286,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21110625-silanur,3,Okay so I know I didn't read the last twenty pages but I'm just going to mark this as read because I'm too lazy to go back and get it and read it. It wasn't actually a bad book--very inspirational--but I had to read it for class so that kinda ruined it for me.But still a good book. :)
287,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2672243-shel,4,"I loved this. Not only was it an absolutely fascinating look at the less-publicized aspects of space travel, but Hadfield's perspectives on perseverance and success are really quite insightful and valuable. I want all of my middle schoolers to read this!"
288,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57158143-bibliovoracious,5,"Yep, the hype's all true. An excellent book, with memorable insights into life on the orbiting ISS and into what it's like to be a massive over-achiever."
289,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,5,"The word ""inspirational"" gets tossed around a lot, but it's hard to read this and not feel inspired. The book starts a bit slow, focusing on Hadfield's early life and training, but the training gradually becomes more and more intense, and then next thing you know, he's on the launch pad, and the book, well, it takes off. Some of the highlights for me:- The training astronauts go through is extraordinary. They prepare for EVERYTHING, go through every contingency, debrief after every simulation (and especially every ""failure""), assemble everything they've learned across generations of astronauts into a ""flight rules"" book with detailed scenario walkthroughs, and practice these scenarios over and over and over again. They learn an incredible breadth of abilities, from flying, to physics, to chemistry, to biology, to wilderness survival, and so much more. And they do this for years, with only a faint hope of being one of the lucky few who is chosen to go to outer space and put these skills to use. I can't do it any justice; just read the book to get a sense of what it really takes to be an astronaut.- Reading this, you realize that, even if you've dreamt about being an astronaut your whole life, the truth is, you don't actually want to be an astronaut. The amount of training. The constant awareness of the high risks involved and very real chance of dying. The G forces and the very real chance of shitting yourself. The nausea your first days/weeks in space. The always puffy face and constant congestion. The total lack of privacy. The cramped quarters. The inability to properly shower or wash clothes. The intense stress and pressure to not screw up, waste years of effort, billions of dollars, and get people killed.- I love the part where Hadfield describes the preparation for launch. The trip to Baikonur. The quarantine. The parties. The backup crew on a separate bus. The traditions and superstitions, like watching specific movies, peeing on specific things, etc. Gearing up. Cramming into the shuttle / capsule. - The description of life aboard the ISS is even better. Learning what the day to day schedule is like, how they work with crews from other countries, how they eat (and what they eat), exercise (treadmills and vacuum-resistance machines), sleep (in private tubes!), and take care of hygiene and basic bodily needs (this sounds awful), the experiments they run, the views of earth from above, the amount of time it takes to prepare for a space walk, the maintenance they have to constantly do. The story of fixing the ammonia leak is intense!- The story of the insane re-entry procedure of the Soyuz is... something else. The crazy G forces, the ablative heat shield to resist air friction, the crazy crash at the end (with the specially molded seats that prevent your back from breaking on impact)... And then the months of recovery once you've returned from living in zero G's to life on earth (the constant weakness, nausea, foot pain, brittleness of bones, dizziness due to arteries/veins not working as well as they need to, etc). We take for granted what the body does to allow you to live in a gravity well.The writing in the book is a bit mechanical, for lack of a better term, and combined with the slow intro to the book, it's a little hard to get into, but trust me, it's worth sticking with it. The content here is amazing and it makes you appreciate what an accomplishment it is that we have been able to get humans into outer space (and back home!).As always, I've saved a few of my favorite quotes from the book:“If the only thing you really enjoyed was whipping around Earth in a spaceship, you’d hate being an astronaut. The ratio of prep time to time on orbit is many months: single day in space. You train for a few years, minimum, before you’re even assigned to a space mission; training for a specific mission then takes between two and four years, and is much more intensive and rigorous than general training. You practice tricky, repetitive tasks as well as highly challenging ones to the point of exhaustion, and you’re away from home more than half the time. If you don’t love the job, that time will not fly. Nor will the months after a flight, when you’re recovering, undergoing medical testing and debriefing on all kinds of technical and scientific details. Nor will the years of regular training between missions, when you’re recertifying and learning new skills, while helping other astronauts get ready for their flights. If you viewed training as a dreary chore, not only would you be unhappy every day, but your sense of self-worth and professional purpose would be shattered if you were scrubbed from a mission—or never got one.”“It’s almost comical that astronauts are stereotyped as daredevils and cowboys. As a rule, we’re highly methodical and detail-oriented. Our passion isn’t for thrills but for the grindstone, and pressing our noses to it. We have to: we’re responsible for equipment that has cost taxpayers many millions of dollars, and the best insurance policy we have on our lives is our own dedication to training. Studying, simulating, practicing until responses become automatic—astronauts don’t do all this only to fulfill NASA’s requirements. Training is something we do to reduce the odds that we’ll die. Sometimes, as with Challenger and Columbia, a vehicle fails and there’s absolutely nothing the crew can do. But sometimes there is. Astronauts have survived fires on the launch pad and in space, ballistic landings where the Soyuz has come back through the atmosphere like a rock hurled from space—even a collision that punctured a spacecraft and caused sudden depressurization. In a real crisis like that, a group hug isn’t going to save you. Your only hope is knowing exactly what to do and being able to do it calmly and quickly.”“If anything, I’m annoyingly upbeat, at least according to the experts (my family, of course). I tend to expect things will turn out well and they usually do. My optimism and confidence come not from feeling I’m luckier than other mortals, and they sure don’t come from visualizing victory. They’re the result of a lifetime spent visualizing defeat and figuring out how to prevent it.”“In zero gravity, there’s no need for a mattress or pillow; you already feel like you’re resting on a cloud, perfectly supported, so there’s no tossing and turning to find a more comfortable position.”“A lot of what happens to the human body in space is really similar to what happens during the aging process. In post-flight quarantine, in fact, Tom and I tottered around like two old duffers, getting a preview of what life might be like if we made it to 90. Our blood vessels had hardened; our cardiovascular systems had changed. We had shed calcium and minerals in space, so our bones were weaker; so were our muscles, because for 22 hours a day, they’d encountered no resistance whatsoever.”"
290,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth is a mixture of self-help and memoir. Hadfield simply takes some fairly prosaic lessons that he leaned in his efforts to become an astronaut (work hard, pay attention to detail, expect things to go wrong and be ready, train hard, et cetera. The sorts of things they teach you in the Boy Scouts) and then he bolts these concepts onto his various astronaut stories with varying levels of success. At it’s best this book is inspiring, but at it’s worst it can feel like an ex military type is giving you a lecture on being a team player (because that’s exactly what’s happening).The last 1/3 of the book was my favorite. This is where Hadfield lays off the improving lectures and gets into more detail about what life on the ISS is like. Ultimately, he is very likable and able to project a winning sense of humility while telling tales of his impressive accomplishments, and his book is as likable as he is."
291,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70879977-sonali,5,"Are you what a 9-year-old you envisioned yourself to be when you grew up? Well, Chris Hadfield dreamed of becoming an astronaut, and all these years later, he managed to achieve that dream. Back in 1969, for Hadfield to have such a dream was highly ridiculous because Canada didn't even have a space agency of their own! But that didn't stop him, and he talks all about it in this inspirational memoir.From having a little dream and working towards it to becoming the first Canadian astronaut to live aboard the International Space Station to becoming viral for his version of Bob Dylan's Space Oddity (IN SPACE!), Hadfield shares his life story.This book will bring the childlike wonder you had about space back in your eyes, it definitely did that for me. I was a space nerd growing up, and this book rekindled my love for space.Hadfield is so inspiring and optimistic, you'll wonder if this man is for real! But he is a realist as well. I reckon if you have trained all your life about the ways you can die in space, you start 'sweating the small stuff' but enjoy them, too. His advice on trying to become a zero (read to know what I'm talking about!) was the best part about the book.For me, the biggest takeaway from this memoir is that never stop working towards your dream. If you work hard and smart, you'll not only beat all the odds but end up with everything you had ever dreamed of. This book will inspire you, aspire you to be humble, and enjoy the little joys of life. Highly, highly recommended!PS please watch all of Hadfield's videos!"

Perhaps it was the short time span I read it over, but I found the book to be somewhat repetitive - past that, I have nothing bad to say. It was extremely eye opening to hear about the astronaut profession in extreme detail, and Hadfield shares so many incredible stories that had happened throughout his life. I also really respected that he including some of his failures and shortcomings in the text - although they were nothing extreme it certainly helped to humanize this Canadian hero."

This one, for example, left me with an entirely new understanding of what it really takes (and means) to be an astronaut (with a few lessons for life thrown in for good measure)."
295,0316253014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6548813-natalie-curiousreader,4,"Chris Hadfield's An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth is a combination of a memoir and something of a modern philosophical work. He blends his own experiences of training to and working as an astronaut with his observations on life, success, purpose, and more. Through looking at a personal journey in space exploration, he connects to the larger picture both to the people he's known and to the world at large. While the writing style can come off as 'self-help'ish in the way he frames his 'advice' and conclusions from personal experience, it's more I think an attempt to humanize astronauts who often end up being 'heroes' in people's minds; people who travel space, as some supernatural creature rather than a human of flesh and blood who worked really hard, and possibly was really lucky. But what I liked best about this book is that it's personal, it's funny, Hadfield shares a lot of anecdotes and he shares his own feelings about things like returning to earth after several months away. There's both I think a lot of genuineness and humor found in this book, which in my personal opinion lends itself well to inviting people into a subject they might not have explored before or otherwise. The book starts off with his becoming an astronaut; education, other work leading up to the job, training for space travels, etc. He moves on to preparations for launch, life up in space, and finishes with the adaption to life back on earth. The way the book is structured is great because it follows, in a much speeded up version of course, the trajectory of a trip to space and back. Peering inside the premises to see everything (and everyone!) necessary to make space travel happen, and facing some of the for me not thought of complications in a life without gravity, was just an utter delight of learning and entertainment rolled into one. The subject of toilet-related things up in space seems to be a crowd-pleaser kind of topic, unsurprisingly, but another example he gives is that crying is a complicated business without the tears actually falling down. Or showers. Or sweating. All activities dependent on drops falling is of course a whole different matter in an environment where everything floats. I really found Hadfield's personality throughout the book to be friendly and welcoming, lighthearted and fun while also acknowledging all the hard work (and money) gone into such an amazing thing as space travel and exploration, and especially the enormous team behind it. His own thoughts spread throughout the book, like the 'aim to be a zero' or 'sweat the small stuff', I also thought were no-nonsense and down to earth (!). While I tend to avoid self-help type books and writing, I didn't find Hadfield's approach annoying or preachy, which might be due to my similarity in thinking to the author. I don't think it's correct to say this book is a self-help book, it's first and foremost a memoir, second a sort of philosophical ramblings of an astronaut, but there are certainly things in the book that could be taken and applied to life generally. However it's always clearly connected both to Hadfield's experience as an astronaut, and to his plans going forward. For example, one thing I liked best was when he talks of the importance in defining your good moments or your happiness yourself. Otherwise, anything after 'gone to space' is failure. Not everyone will be in space of course, but he continues to say that if you only measure your life based on the 'big' moments, you're going to spend a lot of time not happy. Which is possibly very self-evident to some, but I know many that would benefit from taking this advice into account. All in all, a fantastic book that was highly enjoyable from page one to the last word, and that I would gladly both recommend and read again. "

The first few chapters are perhaps a bit fluffy - a quick overview of how he achieved his lifelong goal of becoming an astronaut, along with some self-help advice - and I’d have been disappointed if the book had continued in that vein, but soon enough he goes into more detail about his career and his three spaceflights.It’s almost amusing to watch Hadfield try to humbly describe how he was the best at everything he ever tried and reached the pinnacle of his profession through hard work and meticulous preparation and the support of a great wife. The man has had, and is still having, a hell of a grand life.He provides interesting details about astronaut training, about his work as a capcom, his work in operations in Russia, and especially about his flights on the shuttle and the Soyuz, and his time on the ISS. In particular I learned some things I didn’t know about Russian customs surrounding space missions. (I had heard that the astronauts and cosmonauts pee on the rear tire of the bus that drops them off at their rocket before their flight, because Gagarin did so. I didn’t know that Russians view the opening of the hatch as the true start of an expedition, and that it’s unlucky to shake hands across the threshold.)I enjoyed his analysis of the difficulties that arise when astronauts, who are “without exception, extremely competitive” must adapt to working as a team, rather than pushing their way into a leadership role.Although he describes a couple of astronauts (no names) who were difficult to work with, he has nothing bad to say about NASA or the CSA. It’s a cheerful, upbeat book, just what you’d expect from Hadfield."

I picked up this book because I wanted to learn more from the man himself about what it's like to be an astronaut (admittedly also because I thought I should read the book before going to his signing...). I was not disappointed! Reading Hadfield's story made me really excited about space and space exploration, uncontainably excited - I felt absolutely exhilarated while reading about Hadfield's final ascent into space and I held my breath during the final days of his time up there, even though I knew what would happen. Reading this book before bed made it difficult to sleep. It's one to think ""Okay, so this guy has been in space, that's so cool"" and another to read his words and be totally astounded at the idea that yes, we can send people into space! It's really an incredible concept, one that I don't think will ever lose its ability to astonish. I was blown away by the amount of knowledge that astronauts must possess - I never really thought about that before, but when there's only three people up there and so many situations that could play out, you really do have to be prepared for anything and be ready to make split second decisions to ensure your own survival. I also enjoyed how Hadfield framed his 'life philosophies' within the context of his career with NASA. This book put a lot about space travel into perspective for me and makes me want to seek out other books by astronauts! Who knows if there will be any other ones as good as this though ;P"

This is both less glamorous than you’d imagine an astronaut’s book to be, and more practical in terms of actual advice about everyday life. There are details about NASA, about what it’s like to fly a plane or go into space, etc, but there’s also a lot about being a team player, communication with family, and all sorts of ordinary things that maybe you wouldn’t think an astronaut would talk about.Overall, Hadfield comes off as a down to earth (ha) and likeable guy, with a sense of humour about life and humility about his achievements, even though they’re pretty epic achievements. I found his book mostly interesting, although sometimes talking about bureaucracy was just bewilderingly frustrating — and why should he have exploratory surgery to prove that he doesn’t need exploratory surgery again? Aaargh, world, you are weird.It’s mostly not really about being an astronaut. It’s about loving your job, working hard, and trying to be a decent human being. The moments of wonder are there too, but this is mostly about the road taken to get there.Originally posted here."

All we really envision that astronauts do while they are in space is float around doings flips and playing with water bubbles. I knew, of course, that they actually do lots of science experiments but I was unaware of how much time it takes in their day to do their jobs.This account of Hadfield's career as an astronaut was interesting, and he definitely had a stellar career since he went to space three times with the final time as a commander on the ISS for a few months. Although he was so successful in his profession, he comes across as humble and accessible. Mixed in with the narrative of his trips to space, Hadfield includes advice on things he learned and had to utilize in his daily life as an astronaut which anyone can use. These are things that we are told about in typical self-help books, but he relates them in a way that you really see how they are important are even in a job like his. One of the things that is so obvious throughout this book is that Chris Hadfield is one of the most motivated and driven people I've ever read about. He was a useful and willing cog in a very big corporate machine. Whether some of his advice would work in all professions or not, the lessons are also ones that can be used in one's daily life as well."
