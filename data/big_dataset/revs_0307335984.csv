0,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5272365-wilson,3,"I'm giving this three stars because what's there is pretty good, for what it is. But it's a grudging rating, for the book has one glaring, unforgivable fault.The idea of this book is that it's meant to be a beginner's introduction to the underlying concepts of electricity: how it works and what's going on, as well as interesting stories surrounding the discoveries of those concepts.And to that extent, it succeeds.Purists will be upset by this book because it uses the device of lies to children to get a lot of the ideas across; that is, it simplifies - sometimes grossly simplifies - concepts, sometimes even mischaracterizing them, in order to be able to make the information more understandable to people entirely new to the ideas.But this book isn't meant for purists. If you already have a reasonably good understanding of how electricity works, skip this book - it isn't for you. It's meant for people who are just beginning to get it; for them, it works.However (and here we come to the glaring flaw I mentioned), this book contains a sin of omission: there is Not. One. Mention of Nicola Tesla. In the section on Edison, no mention of his and Tesla's very public battle over whether the electric grid should be using direct current (Edison) or alternating current (Tesla), and why Tesla won (because he was right!).In the bit about Marconi, he ignores the fact that many of Marconi's patents - based on the work of Tesla, among others - were overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1943 (6 years after Marconi's death).Given that much of the book is interesting stories about the scientists who discovered the properties of electricity and wrote its stories, it's curious - not to mention disquieting - that the Edison/Tesla conflict, at the very least (since it deals with an aspect of the electrical system that is still very important to us today) would be ignored."
1,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3209499-judy-mann,1,Look I have to say that this book was way off the mark.The author lost allhis credibility as soon as I checked the index and saw that there was not asingle reference to Tesla. Not ONE. That's like writing the history of Christianityand forgetting to mention Jesus Christ.Had it not been for Nicola Tesla the whole world would still be running off a battery. Tesla was brilliant and this guy neglects to mention him????? No. As soon as I saw that- I knew he was going to glorify Edison.That's the way it works. You dismiss Tesla- you lie about Edison You make him into a great man when in fact Edison stole most of his ideas from Tesla.I should've stopped reading the book right then and there.To me it was allworthless propaganda.Edison was a crook. Period. All he did was discover the use of tungstenso that light bulbs could last longer. That's it.If you have any knowledge of electricity- don't read this book.It'll make you sick with disgust.JM
2,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/992639-melanie,1,"I listened to this as an audio book.Seriously, I hated this book, I only listened to it because it kept me from falling asleep while commuting. Actually, the anger I sometimes felt while listening worked pretty effectively for that. This book is intended for someone who has absolutely no understanding of science at all and has never even thought about what electricity might be. In that case, why would they start now? Perhaps I was especially disappointed because I had just listened to Eistein, His Life and Times, which was quite good. That book explained Einstein's admittedly difficult concepts in a way that was comprehensible to non-scientists (I think) without insulting their intelligence. This book simplified electricity and its behavior to such a level that is is not enlightening AT ALL and will make you sound like an idiot if you repeat any of it.Just for good measure, the reader had an annoying, raspy voice."
3,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3265556-converse,2,"Although clearly written, this book contains a number of factual mistakes on biographical matters which seem to result from the author's desire to heighten the contrast between the good guys and the bad guys. In particular Samuel Morse was not an incompetent artist, even if in many other ways he was not my idea of an admirable human being. "
4,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5745485-christopher,2,"I'm a dummy when it comes to science, but even this felt lightweight to me. After reading a biography of Tesla, I wanted to know all about the development of electricity. Those beginning days of electricity feel more like magic than science. The idea of being able to harness weird sparky hot lightning stuff that comes out of the sky but also lives in pretty much everything... that's pretty cool. But this book makes it feel commonplace.Rather than go into the science, this book wants to tell a story: the narrative of how electricity became integral to our world. And that's a good goal for a book to have, but it was just so blah. The narrative arc was cut up piecemeal so there wasn't a sense of this led to this which led to this. Instead, the feeling is that there was a scientist who did this thing and then there was another scientist who did this other, unrelated thing.Anyway, skip this book. It's just nothing special."
5,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2830966-rhonda-sarantis,5,"I'm crazy about this book. Listened to it on the way to California, and then listened to it again with Peter! First of all, it explains electricity in simple terms so I understood it. Second of all, he introduces you to each advance--telegraph, telephone, light bulb, etc., all the way to computers--by acquainting you with the person responsible for the discovery. Finally, when I thought the book was through and I was completely satisfied, he launches into how electricity makes our bodies work! So enLIGHTening, and the Creator's hand is evident throughout."
6,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3027543-stephen-dorneman,4,"Serviceable survey of how mankind's insight into electricity and its uses has advanced through the years, although much more time is spent on the personalities behind the discoveries and inventions than on explaining the physics and chemistry behind those events. Extensive recommendations for additional reading of source materials included, if you want to do the work yourself and go beyond the text. More like 3 1/2 stars than 4. Recommended, but only assuming the reader knows what they're going to get (and not get) going in. "
7,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,3,"David Bodanis is truly great at writing the history of science. Even if I am well familiar with various histories, somehow he grabs my attention immediately, my dopamine neurons start going crazy, and I remained hooked for the entire book. I love the way he tells a history. The one exception to his exceptional writing is that he wrote an entire book about electricity -- in the universe, in the world, and in the animal body-- without mentioning Tesla!! Edison received his due, as did so many others. How can anyone write a history of the discovery of electricity without discussing Tesla? It could be that awareness of Tesla's contribution was not as understood in 2004, when this book was published, as it is now. regardless of why, any book on electricity that leaves out Tesla cannot receive more than 3 stars. The rest of the book is 5 stars all the way. ​Beautiful histories of how humans discovered waves, which were all around us but unseen. Bodanis' history of Faraday was exquisite. Volts should be called Faradays and Bodanis will tell you why. I only wish he had given the same treatment to Tesla that he gave to Faraday. Bodanis examined electricity in the universe as it pulls opposite charged atoms together, creating wonderful reactions. When discussing the electricity in the brain, he begun the section with a beautiful image of stars exploding out the elements that would eventually help each brain mount a response. Excellent writing all around! "
8,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21513400-waqar-saleem,5,"This book charts the history of electricity from its discovery to the current day. It shows how, along the way, the understanding of the nature of electricity grew from a stream of electrons gushing through a wire to the current perception of it. For each stage, Bodanis, the author, gives amusing accounts of the lives and motivations of the scientists involved, how they furthered contemporary understanding, the related inventions and their impact on society at the time.Bodanis' style is humorous and the book unfolds like a well-developed fiction plot, always keeping the reader itching to find out what happens next. It is no textbook, and written for a general audience. As such, no previous physics background is necessary. However, in keeping the book accessible to a larger public, Bodanis skips quickly over details, so those who do have some background and want to gain an insight into the discoveries might be left a little frustrated.All in all, it is an enjoyable book which keeps you hooked from start to finish like a fiction novel. There is hardly any kind of reader to whom I would not recommend it!"
9,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7094406-rohan,2,This book was short and informative to a point until when I realized there was no mention of Tesla in a book that talks about Electricity. It was surprising because Author mentions Edison and his discoveries. He talks about a lot of important figures from the history but fails to mention the contribution of Quantum Theory (and people associated with them) in understanding electricity. An average piece of work at best. 
10,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6102247-william,2,"Look, isn't electricity important for modern life and interesting. And here are a few anecdotes about it. That's the whole point of this book, so I have just saved you from having to read it. You're welcome."
11,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695057-d,4,"Excellent overview of all things electrical - from the telegraph to the human brain. We learn more about the inventors we thought we knew and discover the inventors who inspired them. Throughout it all, there are enough heroes and villains for several books."
12,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/569096-myke,3,The personal accounts really undulated from interesting to stone cold boring. I probably would have liked a little more science at the expense of some of the personal stuff. 
13,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99881305-guy-rintoul,4,"David Bodanis' book wins convincing plaudits from Bill Bryson, The Observer, The Sunday Times and The Economist to name but a few - and for good reason. Electric Universe is a fascinating look at electricity in all its forms, effortlessly mixing biography, science, history and humour.The book is divided into five sections, chronologically detailing the progress of human understanding from 1830 to the present. First, 'Wires' deals with the discovery of electricity, and the first tentative steps of inventions such as the telegraph. Bodanis takes a fascinating look at the way new forms of electric communication changes the world, making it a smaller, more interconnected place. 'Waves' then looks at the increasingly deeper understanding of the way in which electricity worked, covering topics such as electromagnetic fields. The way in which these waves were then put to use are studied in the 'Wave Machines' section, including fascinating biographies of key players in the invention of radar.Moving away from the discovery and initial uses of electricity to the more contemporary age, the second-to-last section covers Turing's work on computers during the war and his vision for the future, the realisation of the power of silicon, the invention of the transistor and the path to the modern computer world. And finally, 'The Brain and Beyond' looks at the discovery of and science behind the way in which our bodies work, effortlessly and clearly explaining the way in which we are vast, wet computers, with electric charges controlling everything from our nerves to our memory.Of all these sections, I found two in particular - 'Wave Machines' and 'The Brain and Beyond' particularly fascinating, though more from personal preference and interest rather than any literary reason. In addition to the invention of radar, the former covers a diverse range of people and experiences, discusses the science behind the technology, and touches on the morality (or otherwise) of the way in which technology was used during the Second World War. The latter, 'The Brain and Beyond', is incredibly thought-provoking, illustrating just how miraculous the human body and its inner workings are.To find any serious flaw with Bodanis' book is difficult. Only two things sprang out at me, and are the sole reason for my dropping the rating a little. The first is that chapter 6, which looks at Hertz's gradual increase in the understanding of electricity, has a slightly cobbled-together feel about it. Composed of excerpts from his diary, I can see Bodanis' point that his own words easily convey his progress in the field. However, page after page of quotes, cut and pasted with little linkage between excerpts, makes for rather bland and disjointed reading.The second, more of a niggle than a flaw, is that Bodanis includes an excellent appendix detailing further information on points he makes throughout the book, referenced by page number. While it was interesting to reference back to each page and then read the extra information, some linkage the other way would have been appreciated. While I understand that the appendix was doubtless a solution to excessive footnotes, an indication in the main body of the text when further information was available would have allowed for a more flowing reference between the main body of the literature and the array of facts and references at the back.As a complete package, however, the book is absolutely excellent. Well written, covering an enormous array of time, inventions, uses of electricity, people, human understanding and technologies, Bodanis has done an outstanding job, well deserving of the Aventis Prize for Science Books which it was awarded. It's few and far between that a book manages to balance simplicity with detail, coherence with complex science, man with machine, and fact with imagination. Absolutely worth a read, I'd recommend without hesitation Electric Universe to anyone who wants a great overview of the history of electricity.[Written 2008]"
14,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85753449-pritam-chattopadhyay,4,"In the foreword to his book ‘Electric Universe: How Electricity Switched on the Modern World’ David Bodanis writes: As the Victorian era dawned, that was still most of our knowledge: two metals, when positioned near each other, could sometimes produce a sparking current within a wire connecting them. It seemed a weak, merely curious phenomenon. But it was the first useful door into a world that had been sealed and hidden. He continues: “In this book I show what has happened in the two centuries since humankind opened that door, which took a mere two centuries.The first part looks at the Victorian researchers who had only a few tenuous glimpses of electricity, yet created devices never before imagined. There were telephones and telegraphs and lightbulbs; roller coasters and fast streetcars—and ever more electric motors powering them all. There was even an electrical fax machine operating efficiently in France in 1859—before the American Civil War.The world started to change. The new wave of electrical technologies helped lead to the modern corporation and to votes for women, to suburbs stretching far from cities, and tabloid newspapers, and, influenced by crisp telegraph messages, to a new Hemingway-style prose. One exuberant telephone executive apparently remarked that Americans had become the first people who would interrupt sex to take a phone call.”This narrative includes information on a fascinating cast of characters, including Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, Michael Faraday, Alessandro Volta, Samuel Morse, Alan Turing, James Clerk Maxwell, and Cyrus West Field. The author says: “The stories along the way are as much about religion, love, and cheating as they are about impersonal science or technology. They take us from Hamburg cellars during a World War II firestorm to the mind of Alan Turing, brilliant computer inventor, hounded by the authorities of the very country he’d saved; from the slum-born Michael Faraday, slurred by his contemporaries because of his religious faith (yet who used his faith to become the first to see electric forces weaving invisibly through space); to a pampered artist, Samuel Morse, who eagerly ran for mayor of New York on a platform of persecuting Catholics, and who learned more about how telegraphs operate than he ever cared to admit, from a frontiersman who couldn’t believe anyone would wish to patent such an obvious idea.”And there’s Graham bell: “There’s an exuberant twenty-something immigrant to America, Alexander Bell, desperate to capture the love of a deaf teenage student, and there’s the forty-something Robert Watson Watt, desperate to escape from a boring marriage and the tedium of 1930s Slough. There’s Otto Loewi, who wakes up one Easter eve realizing he has solved the problem of how electricity works in our body, yet in the morning, agonizingly, can’t read the scrawled explanations he jotted beside his bed during the night; there’s the boy from rural Scotland, James Clerk Maxwell, who was treated as a fool for years by bullies at his elementary school, yet who became the nineteenth century’s greatest scientific theorist, able to envision the inner structure of the universe in a way that scientists of a later era would realize was profoundly true. All of these stories illuminate how the immense force of electricity was gradually seen: how it was led out from its hidden domain—and what we, imperfect humans, have made of the enhanced powers it has granted.”Bodanis’s history of the science of electricity is a journey of discovery, as it vividly describes the work of the many scientists and pioneers who unlocked and applied electricity’s invisible secrets. This is a must-read book for any average teen ager – and adult alike. Bodanis’s book makes electricity clear both as a force of nature and as an integral part of modern society. "
15,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68271236-ethan-hulbert,5,"When I read Electric Universe by David Bodanis, I was surprised the whole way through at how new and good it was. I picked it up at one of my favorite bookstores in Chicago, Market Fresh Books in Little Italy, second-hand.I’m a guy who’s read a lot of popular accounts on the developments of science, and know all the progress of quantum physics and relativity real well at this point. Those stories are more common. I’d never read a full popular account on the history and development of electricity, though, and how it changed the world in so many ways. But I’m sure glad I did.I have to say, while I think all science-progress-history-etc stories are pretty interesting from a humanist standpoint, I didn’t expect electricity’s story to be this interesting. It was really… shocking, you might say, how huge of an effect it’s had through the years. Not something I’ve ever really consciously thought about before, for some reason. But it truly changed the world in every way.This book wasn’t just great because of those histories, though. It was great because of the storytelling. I was amazed by how well David Bodanis could weave such an interesting and mesmerizing thread through these scientist’s adventures throughout the centuries, and to say that it kept my attention is an understatement. It was a real page-turner.I almost wonder if the history was diluted a bit just for the sake of the stories, but there was so much fact backing up most of it that I’d doubt it. I believe that Mr. Bodanis’ great tone and voice as a writer just helped that much.It’s hard to choose my favorite part, but I think the story I enjoyed most from Electric Universe was how the invention of radar turned the tide of battle one way and another in World War II. First for the Allies, then the Axis, then back to the Allies after secret raids I’d never heard about before. I enjoy some good WWII history, so WWII history + experimental science is just great.I’d definitely recommend this book. Thrilling from front to back, and I even stayed up late to keep reading it. Learned a lot of great facts from it too, and even loaned it to my mother – she liked it too. Definitely check this book out if you get a chance."
16,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Readable account, surprising but not ""shocking""The focus on the story of electricity here is on the scientists and inventors involved in its development and how electricity has changed our lives. It begins with ""Wires"" (title of the first part of the book) to ""Waves"" (Part II) through computers and finally to ""The Brain and Beyond"" in Part V.This is not a technical book on how electricity works, instead Bodanis, who is also the author of E=MC2: A Biography of the World's Most Famous Equation (2000), which I highly recommend, concentrates on how electricity was discovered and how it came to be understood and how it was applied to do useful work. He begins with Joseph Henry who invented the telegraph only to have its value stolen from him by Samuel Morse who knew enough to get a patent. From there Bodanis goes to Alexander Graham Bell who managed to invent the telephone partly to win the hand of his true love, Mabel Hubbard whose social and economic station was at the time much above his. Then comes Thomas Edison, who is not an entirely charming figure, and surprisingly enough was very hard of hearing, but was amazing persistent--which he needed to be to find exactly the right material to burn inside the near vacuum of the light bulb. And then comes J.J. Thomson who discovered the electron.Once the electron is discovered, the way electricity works seems to be understood, but then along comes electromagnetic waves, invisible force fields that led to radar, radio, television, computers and Global Positioning Systems. Bodanis spends some time with Alan Turing of World War II code-breaking fame who developed the idea of a ""Universal Machine"" that could calculate step-by-step (almost, I think) anything. Interesting is the development of the idea and usefulness of a semi-conductor.Bodanis finishes with ""wet electricity,"" the electricity based on sodium ions that works within living beings. There are thirty pages of notes, a Guide to Further Reading, and an index. Bodanis's style is eminently readable with just a touch of the sardonic. He allows the personalities to come to life and he makes the science seem facile. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
17,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56465653-wisdom-zelda,5,"On Podcasts and ElectricityAs we were driving home from piano lessons one day, my mother (with my siblings’ eager consent) decided to play a podcast about the history of light, from candle wax to light bulb fixtures. The podcast cast a spell on us. As we were listening to the acknowledgments, a name of a certain book caught my mother’s ear. This book was afterwards given to me to read, and truly, the book is as interesting as the podcast itself.Electric Universe, by David Bodanis, is a book on the history of electricity. This book tells of the many inventions that were created using the powers of electricity. Bodanis, a master science writer, explains many concepts in a clear-cut way as he describes this electric history.Every chapter in Electric Universe reveals a new intriguing and informative fact. I looked forward to every word, and there are not very many books that can make the reader do that! Certainly, before I read Electric Universe I didn’t know that a telegram cable had been spread across the Atlantic Ocean, or that Alexander Graham Bell had mostly been motivated to work so the aurally impaired could communicate too. Now I have a delicious amount of interesting information stored in my head to munch on.Bodanis has a clear, straightforward style that makes many topics easy to understand. Thanks to this book, I finally understood that electricity should not be represented in the cartoonish little-ball style, but as a wave. I also learned how cocaine and anesthetics work as I read about the effects of sodium ions in nerves, . Because of Bodanis’s transparent style, I understood many things.Electric Universe is an excellent book because of its lucidity and interesting facts. I would recommend it to anyone who hasn’t the faintest idea about how electricity works, and especially to anyone who likes podcasts about electricity.

18,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,5,"This book could have been titled ""The Deceptive and Dishonest World of Scientists"" or ""Intrigue in the Lab"".If you are not that into science and prefer the stories behind the people and the history of discoveries, this is your book! David Bodanis gives us the ""National Enquirer"" version of electricity by going into the stealing of discoveries, the grandstanding by scientists, the resistance to new ideas, and the ""accidental discoveries"" that are often more important than organized research.There are a number of people that are left out in this book. It has been pointed out by others that Tesla but there are many more that Bodanis didn't include. Electrical force was known and used ancient Arabic, Egyptian, and Roman cultures and scientists way before Ben Franklin was credited with discovering it (can you say always credit older, white men). That said, this book does a great job of telling not only what electricity is and why it is so important to us, it also gives a great overview of the stumbling way discoveries happen and how the timing has had a major impact on the history of the human race.This book doesn't limit itself to manufactured items like light bulbs and computers but also delves into how electricity is used to run animal bodies and how it lets us think and remember. There is a great deal of material covered in this book and the author livens up what could be a dull lecture by interspersing interesting ""behind the scenes"" information. After the book is ""finished"", Bodanis includes a number of interesting and lengthy appendixes with even more information - both historic and scientific.If you are looking for a hard science textbook, this is not the book for you. However, if you like to learn science without falling asleep with the book on your lap, you will definitely find Electric Universe worth reading."
19,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17525671-andy-m,4,"Bodanis begins with Volta's discovery of electricity and the development of many inventions dependent on it. It's incomplete, which a reader would expect for a book of this length pertaining to events and personalities spanning over three and a half centuries.A reader unfamiliar with the topic must start at the shallow end, and Electric Universe was just right for its technical explanations. I've read the reviews of other readers who challenge Bodanis's explanations as errant. I'm not expert enough to affirm or refute these readers' reviews.I felt that the explanation of the explosion of rock and roll music was unnecessarily hasty, and here was an instance where I disagreed. Bodanis claims that the transistor, as used in the transistor radio, was responsible for the rapid diffusion of the music of the mid-twentieth century. This is partly true, but it ignores something huge. The truth is that rock and roll actually kept vacuum tube amplification alive longer than it would have survived otherwise. Many musicians of other genres were interested in transistors because the transistor amplifiers removed the perceived problem of distortion. Rock and roll harnessed distortion because its kind of harmonics are not normally heard with acoustic instruments. Transistor amplifiers merely increase the volume of the instrument or the vocals, but tube amplifiers most audibly change the quality of the tone. (Tubes are not purer than transistors in sound at all.)The book made the nearly unpardonable crime of leaving out Tesla, but this can be forgiven in a book that is so readable."
20,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33253444-richard-mellinger,5,"If you want to learn about electricity and magnetism, read a textbook. That's not what this book is for. Instead, this is a wonderful introduction to some of the people behind the major discoveries and developments involving electricity. You'll learn a little bit about some of the science on a very surface level, but the point of this book is to bring to life the people involved and, that, I think it does very well.There are always going to be a few key people missing (some more about Tesla would have been nice) but for those Bodanis chose to talk about, he does a phenomenal job. I particularly liked the section on Alexander Graham Bell posed as an adorable love story.I read this hoping to get some fun, personal anecdotes to add color and humanize the lectures in my electricity and magnetism class, and I definitely got that. Well done, interesting, and worth a read."
21,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86382497-william-trammell,2,"The book certainly manages to hit many of the high points in the history of electricity and electronics. Unfortunately, it fails to provide much detail about any single person or idea. The book does include an extensive ""Guide to Further Reading"" and numerous notes for those who like more details. Annoyingly, the notes aren't referenced in the main text so you're forced to read in parallel through the main portion of the book as well as the ""Notes"" chapter if you want the full story. In the end, I suppose my own expectations got the better of me: I was hoping for an in-depth history of electricity, perhaps along the lines of Richard Rhodes Pulitzer Prize-winning ""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"", rather than a entertaining afternoon read..."

I did really enjoy the history of how various inventors made their discoveries, but the author assumes that his readers have a lot more knowledge then they may have. Very frankly, he is not very good at explaining how electrons work and seems happy to envelope the topic in a cloak of mystery, rather than giving the reader a good explanation, although in a few places he does a good job in getting across his point, like in his explanation of what a volt is.I found the notes in the back of the book interesting, but even as a science teacher, I would not want to spend that much time looking up the sources."

Mr. Bodanis did touch upon the impact of Thomas Alva Edison in electrifying the nation and the world, but I felt that ""The Last Days of Night"" handled it better. My rough criterion for non-fiction books is whether I'd really like to purchase the book itself (as I am reading from the public library) to have as a return-to reference. ""Electric Universe"" does not make that cut."
24,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48504717-srikantadatta-tagadur,3,Electricity has become an inseparable part of our life. We are so dependent on it that we can’t even imagine a world without electricity in our dreams. This book narrates the story of electricity right from the very beginning and how it transformed the world we live in today. The author has put in a lot of effort in narrating the technical aspects in layman terms. I was slightly disappointed when the book didn’t speak much about Nikola Tesla as he is one of the pioneers in the field. Other than this I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book. It’s a must read for anyone who is curious to know and understand how electricity has become the driving force of our planet.
25,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42960500-candace-dorn,4,"The discussion about electricity in our brains was a pleasant surprise. The author went into anatomical detail about methods that the body converts molecules into electricity used by neurons. You can tell that the author is inspired by the billions of years of evolution that has perfected this method, and the author emphasizes how it trumphs any electric generation created by man. It was a great way to end a book on such fascinating subject."
26,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57383407-alan,4,"This book was a fair read, but he never mentioned Tesla. I liked the history of the radar. Not sure what else to say about this book. One interesting thing is that when I visited the Henry Ford Museum there was hardly any mention of Tesla in the whole museum, but there is a lot on Edison. I believe that Tesla has been pretty much ignored in the past, but recently he seems to be getting the credit he is due. "
27,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67036621-rosalee-grande,0,History of ElectricityAn excellent book that describes electricity and its functions. In many ways the author bridges chemistry with electrical operation . The book has a chapter on the brain and the way it can identify and detect items. Read this chapter as it opens and solves many of the questions we all want to know pertaining to the neural connections in our brain. This book should be a must read for students for students interested in the field of electricity.

I would not suggest this for anyone that is looking for the meat and potatoes of understanding electricity, but more for someone that would like to understand more about the people that helped create our modern understanding and use of it.All in all it was an entertaining read and I would suggest it."
29,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69165942-denis-laesker,4,"This book certainly helped me understand the physics of electricity while providing a good historical account on the topic. Nevertheless, I believe the author should have mentioned some content on Nikola Tesla, and more on Mr. Franklin, Mr. Ohm, Mr. Amp, and Mr. Watt. Just one simple observation: In boolean algebra, the ""+"" (plus sign) is used to represent an ""OR"" operation. Therefore, T + F = T (or 1 + 0 = 1) as opposed to F (as described in the book). "

Despite having spent a large portion of my professional carrier on the subject, this book helped me understand a few new things about electricity. More specifically, how our bodies work. The rest, was just pure physics fun. This is not a book for everyone. Physics students or those who love the quantitative side of nature must read it. "
54,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2108958-david,4,"Quite enjoyed the way that the author showed how we stumbled across all of the principles that we take for granted today. It took many years for things like telegraph, electricity, radio, radar to be discovered and mass produced. There was lots of dead end research and lucky breaks along the way to piece together how electrons and magnets rule our modern world. It certainly wasn't clear to me from my university physics classes that the early researchers had so little idea of what they were dealing with. Just what were those electrons, how can you measure them, how can you harness them for good (and evil too) ?? Just why do we call them volts, amps and watts ? A bit of interesting `dark' background to Samuel Morse and Alan Turing too.This is no mere physics book. It links together the luminaries of the field in a way that makes for a book almost like a novel.I'm really getting into these sorts of factoid type entertaining reads. So many trivium to fill my wee head !"
55,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2970946-eva,3,"Overall the book covers the history of understanding and development of electricity with stories and different events. I gave it three stars, because it could be written more detailed. I miss more clear explanation on how things work (telegraph, telephone, computer, etc). Therefore half of the time spent on reading this book, was used up for getting some of the background and very basics in physics, electricity, etc. Which I actually don't mind, because I enlightened quite some topics I never cared or know before.A big big disadvantage: there is not a single reference to Nikola Tesla. This is just dumb. Without him our world would be still running on batteries. From this point of view Bodanis disappointed me.I also think the book could be written way way better.Plus no real science discussed.

I found the information interesting, but I could defnintely tell information was missing. Even at the end the narrator talks about the story starting with Volta, but in this abridged version it didn't. It definitely felt as if there were other gaps in the story of electricity. Also, the author changed his approach in a few of the stories. The first two stories start out kind of mysterious, the story on Hertz is told almost entirely from his own diary and other documents. The end of the chapter on computers sounds like the conclusion to the entire book, but it's not.Still, in spite of all its flaws, I would still recommned. In fact, I'm looking for an unabrided text to read the missing parts. I'm pretty sure they cut out entire stories, but I also suspect that there was some internal editing within the stories as there occasionally seemed to be gaps in the narrative. "
57,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2829718-ben,4,"It seems most of the negative reviews around this book focus on the lack of scientific details or things that were missed out. I fnd this strange because the book never claims to be an indepth explanation of the principles of electricity, but rather its history and the human stories behind each important discovery, and it does this very well. I particularly enjoyed the chapters about Alan Turing, the development of radar, and found the story of Alexander Graham Bell and his wife incredibly moving. The writing style is easy to read and digest and rattles along nicely. It doesn't get bogged down in the science but has enough knowledge behind it to present what it does well and intrigued me enough to make we want to read more on various subjects in greater depth. As an introduction to the subject it's a great place to start, or if science isn't your thing then there's enough of a human element packed with romance, subterfuge and adventure to appeal to the majority of readers."

Turing laid down the theories that paved the way for the creation of the modern computer and the idea of artificial intelligence. His contribution was made well before the invention of the transistor. He was also a leading cryptographer credited with breaking the German Enigma machine and helping to save Britain from catastrophe in WWII. Despite his monumental contributions, he was shunned for being homosexual which ultimately lead to his suicide at age 41. One of the greatest minds of the 20th century. "

Despite having spent a large portion of my professional carrier on the subject, this book helped me understand a few new things about electricity. More specifically, how our bodies work. The rest, was just pure physics fun. This is not a book for everyone. Physics students or those who love the quantitative side of nature must read it. "
114,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2108958-david,4,"Quite enjoyed the way that the author showed how we stumbled across all of the principles that we take for granted today. It took many years for things like telegraph, electricity, radio, radar to be discovered and mass produced. There was lots of dead end research and lucky breaks along the way to piece together how electrons and magnets rule our modern world. It certainly wasn't clear to me from my university physics classes that the early researchers had so little idea of what they were dealing with. Just what were those electrons, how can you measure them, how can you harness them for good (and evil too) ?? Just why do we call them volts, amps and watts ? A bit of interesting `dark' background to Samuel Morse and Alan Turing too.This is no mere physics book. It links together the luminaries of the field in a way that makes for a book almost like a novel.I'm really getting into these sorts of factoid type entertaining reads. So many trivium to fill my wee head !"
115,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2970946-eva,3,"Overall the book covers the history of understanding and development of electricity with stories and different events. I gave it three stars, because it could be written more detailed. I miss more clear explanation on how things work (telegraph, telephone, computer, etc). Therefore half of the time spent on reading this book, was used up for getting some of the background and very basics in physics, electricity, etc. Which I actually don't mind, because I enlightened quite some topics I never cared or know before.A big big disadvantage: there is not a single reference to Nikola Tesla. This is just dumb. Without him our world would be still running on batteries. From this point of view Bodanis disappointed me.I also think the book could be written way way better.Plus no real science discussed. (As I said I had to support my curiosity with other sources).I would recommend it to a younger readers."
116,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2297370-tom-rowe,3,"I got about halfway through this book before I discovered that it was abridged. I found the information interesting, but I could defnintely tell information was missing. Even at the end the narrator talks about the story starting with Volta, but in this abridged version it didn't. It definitely felt as if there were other gaps in the story of electricity. Also, the author changed his approach in a few of the stories. The first two stories start out kind of mysterious, the story on Hertz is told almost entirely from his own diary and other documents. The end of the chapter on computers sounds like the conclusion to the entire book, but it's not.Still, in spite of all its flaws, I would still recommned. In fact, I'm looking for an unabrided text to read the missing parts. I'm pretty sure they cut out entire stories, but I also suspect that there was some internal editing within the stories as there occasionally seemed to be gaps in the narrative. "
117,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2829718-ben,4,"It seems most of the negative reviews around this book focus on the lack of scientific details or things that were missed out. I fnd this strange because the book never claims to be an indepth explanation of the principles of electricity, but rather its history and the human stories behind each important discovery, and it does this very well. I particularly enjoyed the chapters about Alan Turing, the development of radar, and found the story of Alexander Graham Bell and his wife incredibly moving. The writing style is easy to read and digest and rattles along nicely. It doesn't get bogged down in the science but has enough knowledge behind it to present what it does well and intrigued me enough to make we want to read more on various subjects in greater depth. As an introduction to the subject it's a great place to start, or if science isn't your thing then there's enough of a human element packed with romance, subterfuge and adventure to appeal to the majority of readers."
118,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/286828-davis,2,"I picked this up because of the author's other book on Einstein's equation, E=MC2. This one was not as interesting. But he does briefly cover the life of Alan Turing who is considered the father of computer science. Turing laid down the theories that paved the way for the creation of the modern computer and the idea of artificial intelligence. His contribution was made well before the invention of the transistor. He was also a leading cryptographer credited with breaking the German Enigma machine and helping to save Britain from catastrophe in WWII. Despite his monumental contributions, he was shunned for being homosexual which ultimately lead to his suicide at age 41. One of the greatest minds of the 20th century. "
119,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/163039-kevin-hanks,4,"Very interesting book on the history of our study and understanding of electricity. The author did a very convincing job of explaining how much of our lives is influenced and even governed by the flow of electrons from one place to the next (hence the title). It was a bit sluggish at times, but had enough historical facts and anecdotes to tie in the concepts and keep me interested.I've been aware lately as I've read several books about the history of some scientific principle, that the history of any topic is really the history of the people involved. Who discovered what, who was jealous of this person, who rigidly held on to their own perceptions, who developed a new technique for this, that, or the other etc. It's helped me to understand that science really is irrelevant to us unless it somehow affects people. The study of science is really the study of people."
120,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27043508-joseph,5,"I had no idea of how electricity had covered so many aspects of our life.

I particularly enjoyed the chapters about Alan Turing, the development of radar, and found the story of Alexander Graham Bell and his wife incredibly moving. The writing style is easy to read and digest and rattles along nicely. It doesn't get bogged down in the science but has enough knowledge behind it to present what it does well and intrigued me enough to make we want to read more on various subjects in greater depth. As an introduction to the subject it's a great place to start, or if science isn't your thing then there's enough of a human element packed with romance, subterfuge and adventure to appeal to the majority of readers."

Turing laid down the theories that paved the way for the creation of the modern computer and the idea of artificial intelligence. His contribution was made well before the invention of the transistor. He was also a leading cryptographer credited with breaking the German Enigma machine and helping to save Britain from catastrophe in WWII.

It certainly wasn't clear to me from my university physics classes that the early researchers had so little idea of what they were dealing with. Just what were those electrons, how can you measure them, how can you harness them for good (and evil too) ?? Just why do we call them volts, amps and watts ?

241,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20273193-maya-gopalakrishnan,3,The book was a bit of disappointment as the science was actually limited and most explanations doing nothing to clear things. That plunging your hand into a warm bucket improves your fine motor skills by improving sodium condition in nerves is just frank ridiculous. Lot of tid bits on the scientists involved. Overall definitely average.

Here I assumed that I was taking a break from history to get into some science and instead I’m reading about the history of notorious inventors. It’s simple read, interesting, and really for people who want to review some key scientists that contributed to our understand of electricity today. I was surprised by the lack of Tesla as he was preached almost religiously in university. It was overall it was fairly enjoyable. "
248,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81651835-porter,4,This book was so interesting. A perfect mix of accurate and not overreaching historical context with a detailed description of the science involved. Excellent description of electrical phenomena and its practical applications.

262,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14206977-malaika,4,informative and enjoyable

Despite having spent a large portion of my professional carrier on the subject, this book helped me understand a few new things about electricity. More specifically, how our bodies work. The rest, was just pure physics fun. This is not a book for everyone. Physics students or those who love the quantitative side of nature must read it. "
264,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2108958-david,4,"Quite enjoyed the way that the author showed how we stumbled across all of the principles that we take for granted today. It took many years for things like telegraph, electricity, radio, radar to be discovered and mass produced. There was lots of dead end research and lucky breaks along the way to piece together how electrons and magnets rule our modern world. It certainly wasn't clear to me from my university physics classes that the early researchers had so little idea of what they were dealing with. Just what were those electrons, how can you measure them, how can you harness them for good (and evil too) ?? Just why do we call them volts, amps and watts ? A bit of interesting `dark' background to Samuel Morse and Alan Turing too.This is no mere physics book. It links together the luminaries of the field in a way that makes for a book almost like a novel.I'm really getting into these sorts of factoid type entertaining reads. So many trivium to fill my wee head !"
265,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2970946-eva,3,"Overall the book covers the history of understanding and development of electricity with stories and different events. I gave it three stars, because it could be written more detailed. I miss more clear explanation on how things work (telegraph, telephone, computer, etc). Therefore half of the time spent on reading this book, was used up for getting some of the background and very basics in physics, electricity, etc. Which I actually don't mind, because I enlightened quite some topics I never cared or know before.A big big disadvantage: there is not a single reference to Nikola Tesla. This is just dumb. Without him our world would be still running on batteries. From this point of view Bodanis disappointed me.I also think the book could be written way way better.Plus no real science discussed. (As I said I had to support my curiosity with other sources).I would recommend it to a younger readers."
266,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2297370-tom-rowe,3,"I got about halfway through this book before I discovered that it was abridged. I found the information interesting, but I could defnintely tell information was missing. Even at the end the narrator talks about the story starting with Volta, but in this abridged version it didn't. It definitely felt as if there were other gaps in the story of electricity. Also, the author changed his approach in a few of the stories. The first two stories start out kind of mysterious, the story on Hertz is told almost entirely from his own diary and other documents. The end of the chapter on computers sounds like the conclusion to the entire book, but it's not.Still, in spite of all its flaws, I would still recommned. In fact, I'm looking for an unabrided text to read the missing parts. I'm pretty sure they cut out entire stories, but I also suspect that there was some internal editing within the stories as there occasionally seemed to be gaps in the narrative. "
267,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2829718-ben,4,"It seems most of the negative reviews around this book focus on the lack of scientific details or things that were missed out. I fnd this strange because the book never claims to be an indepth explanation of the principles of electricity, but rather its history and the human stories behind each important discovery, and it does this very well. I particularly enjoyed the chapters about Alan Turing, the development of radar, and found the story of Alexander Graham Bell and his wife incredibly moving. The writing style is easy to read and digest and rattles along nicely. It doesn't get bogged down in the science but has enough knowledge behind it to present what it does well and intrigued me enough to make we want to read more on various subjects in greater depth. As an introduction to the subject it's a great place to start, or if science isn't your thing then there's enough of a human element packed with romance, subterfuge and adventure to appeal to the majority of readers."
268,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/286828-davis,2,"I picked this up because of the author's other book on Einstein's equation, E=MC2. This one was not as interesting. But he does briefly cover the life of Alan Turing who is considered the father of computer science. Turing laid down the theories that paved the way for the creation of the modern computer and the idea of artificial intelligence. His contribution was made well before the invention of the transistor. He was also a leading cryptographer credited with breaking the German Enigma machine and helping to save Britain from catastrophe in WWII. Despite his monumental contributions, he was shunned for being homosexual which ultimately lead to his suicide at age 41. One of the greatest minds of the 20th century. "
269,0307335984,http://goodreads.com/user/show/163039-kevin-hanks,4,"Very interesting book on the history of our study and understanding of electricity. The author did a very convincing job of explaining how much of our lives is influenced and even governed by the flow of electrons from one place to the next (hence the title). It was a bit sluggish at times, but had enough historical facts and anecdotes to tie in the concepts and keep me interested.I've been aware lately as I've read several books about the history of some scientific principle, that the history of any topic is really the history of the people involved. Who discovered what, who was jealous of this person, who rigidly held on to their own perceptions, who developed a new technique for this, that, or the other etc. It's helped me to understand that science really is irrelevant to us unless it somehow affects people.
