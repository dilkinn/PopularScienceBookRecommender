As a student, realizing that my biology books were of little help explaining chimpanzee behavior, I picked up a copy of Machiavelli’s The Prince. It offered an insightful, unadorned account of human behavior based on real-life observations of the Borgias, the Medici, and the popes. The book put me in the right frame of mind to write about ape politics at the zoo. 
----------------------------------------
We know our own inner states imperfectly and often mislead both ourselves and those around us. We’re masters of fake happiness, suppressed fear, and misguided love. This is why I’m pleased to work with nonlinguistic creatures. I’m forced to guess their feelings, but at least they never lead me astray by what they tell me about themselves.
 Jan van Hoof - image from Utrechtse Bilologen Vereniging Jan van Hoof was two months shy of eighty years old and Mama was one month shy of fifty nine when they said their goodbyes. They had known each other for forty years. She’d been sleeping a lot, had lost considerable weight, which was not surprising for one of the world’s oldest zoo chimpanzees, but she finally wakes up, spots Jan, and beams with a smile far wider than any human could produce. She bleats out a high-pitched call of greeting while reaching up for Jan’s head, pats the back of his neck and strokes his hair, pulling him closer. It is a moving moment that most of us might struggle to get through without releasing at least one or two tears of recognition. And why not? There are many more ties that bind us than there are those that divide us. And with this tearful scene we are delivered to a key question. Just how different are humans from apes, from animals, in terms of our emotional lives?Mama - image from Royal Burgers ZooIn 1980, the Dutch-born author learned that a favorite chimpanzee alpha had been murdered by two male rivals in the colony. It became a life-changing event for him. He was about to move to the USA and continue his study of apes, but he realized that there was far too much that was not known about the roles of cooperation, reconciliation, pro-social behavior, and fairness in the animals’ relationships. He redirected his life studies toward gaining a better understanding of such long-neglected areas of animal behavioral research. Frans de Waal - image from wikipediaFranciscus Bernardus Maria ""Frans"" de Waal is now a world-renowned primatologist and social psychologist who has broken much new ground in our understanding of animal psychology and emotion. Competition was always studied in his field, but de Waal was the first to establish intentional deception, conflict resolution, and a non-human basis for empathy and morality. A serious scientist, whose popular writing has brought his theories to a wide readership, his list of awards and recognitions would fill the page. His most recent book is Are We Smart Enough To Know How Smart Animals Are? Hopefully, enough of us are. The question here is whether we are perceptive enough to be able to recognize and appreciate animal emotions.Mama, the long-time matriarch of the Burgers Zoo chimpanzee colony, with her daughter Moniek. At the time of this photo Mama was at the height of her power – Image and text from the bookThis is not a book about Mama, although her story does illustrate de Waal’s point. Many researchers appear to have an irresistible impulse to portray animals as entirely separate from people. De Waal is interested in showing us that there is far less difference than human exceptionalists would like to think. Are we really so different? There have been many lines scientists have drawn that supposedly separate humans from animals, that separate us from our biological roots. Once it was claimed that humans are different because we use tools. That lasted until researchers discovered that diverse sorts of creatures also use tools. Brain size? Number of neurons? Nope, nope. More recently, a difference-maker has been claimed in our experiencing of emotions, portraying animals as virtually mechanical. Anyone with cats, dogs, or most other sorts of pets can assure you that our companion animals do indeed have emotions. As do, apparently other animals as well. Now there is research to back up what is obvious to many of us. 
The anthropomorphism argument [that we merely project our emotions onto the animals being studied] is rooted in human exceptionalism. It reflects the desire to set humans apart and deny our animality. To do so remains customary in the humanities and much of the social sciences, which thrive on the notion that the human mind is somehow our own invention…Modern neuroscience makes it impossible to maintain a sharp human-animal dualism.
 Bonobos are huggers - Image by Jutta Hof – taken from de Waal’s FBAnd if we are not so different, then what might be our common roots? How did our emotions, and how we behave come to be? And by we I am not limiting that to people. The work portrayed here raises many questions, about the origin of some characteristics of human beings, about animals having a sense of time, about the nutritional needs of hunter-gatherers, the role of neuron-count in consciousness, a definition of consciousness, the role of individualism and socialization in species survival, the impact of affection in early life on development, [ok, take a breath] 
We have trouble imagining fairness as an evolved trait partly due to how we depict nature. Using evocative phrases such as “survival of the fittest” and “nature red in tooth and claw,” we stress nature’s cruelty, leaving no room for fairness, only the right of the strongest. In the meantime, we forget that animals often depend on each other and survive through cooperation. In fact, they struggle far more against their environment or against hunger and disease than against each other.
 Orangutan mother holding juvenile - image by Max Block – taken from de Waal’s FB[Rested now? Ok, back to it]…whether humans are alone in having free will, the impact of increasing inequality on longevity. Is there a human instinct for war? Do animals laugh or smile? Can animals commit murder? What is the relationship between intellect and emotion? What does it mean to be an alpha male? And where did our notion of that term originate? What is the relationship between emotions and free will? The difference between feelings and emotions? I could go on, but you get the picture.
The idea that we can achieve optimal sociality only by subduing human biology is antiquated. It doesn’t fit with what we know about hunter-gatherers, other primates, or modern neuroscience. It also promotes a sequential view—first we had human biology, then we got civilization—whereas in reality the two have always gone hand in hand.
Grooming bonobo - image by Jutta Hof – taken from de Waal’s FBThere is an entire chapter on smiling and laughter, (yes, they do) which is a real revelation regarding what the source of humor might be. 
We may not be in full control of our emotions, but we aren’t their slaves either. This is why you should never say “my emotions took over” as an excuse for something stupid you did, because you let your emotions take over. Getting emotional has a voluntary side. You let yourself fall in love with the wrong person, you let yourself hate certain others, you allowed greed to cloud your judgment or imagination to feed your jealousy. Emotions are never just emotions, and they are never fully automated. Perhaps the greatest misunderstanding about emotions is that they are the opposite of cognition. We have translated the dualism between body and mind into one between emotion and intelligence, but the two actually go together and cannot operate without each other.
What has been learned from the lessons discussed here can be used to improve not only how we treat animals that are housed in zoos, and used in research, but in how livestock can be treated more humanely, reinforcing the work of researchers in this field, such Temple Grandin.Baby Love - image by Jutta Maue Kay – taken from de Waal’s FBDe Waal is a first-rate writer, bringing to his books an engaging style, and an ability to make complex subjects accessible to the average reader. He even exposes, on occasion, a sense of humor, which is always welcome in popular science writing. De Waal makes a strong case that our emotions not only do not separate us from other beings, but show our deep connection to them. He shows how emotions+intellect is a formula that has been very successful for the survival of many species, and offers a far more flexible approach to solving new problems than rigid instinctual responses ever could. He gives us good reason to recognize our shared inheritance, our fellowship and sisterhood with a vast array of earth’s creatures, and in so doing, offers us tools to better understand our behavior as a species, and the behavior of non-human living things all around us. It is an intellectual whirlwind, with many new ideas flying around. Plenty there to grab and inspect. Mama’s Last Hug should be the beginning of a new widespread appreciation for our own social, emotional and psychological roots, and empathy for the experience of others. Embrace it. 
I will only rarely refer to other species as “other animals” or “non-human animals.” For simplicity’s sake, I will mostly call them just “animals,” even though for me, as a biologist, nothing is more self-evident than that we are part of the same kingdom. We are animals. Since I don’t look at our species as emotionally much different from other mammals, and in fact would be hard-pressed to pinpoint uniquely human emotions, we had better pay careful attention to the emotional background we share with our fellow travelers on this planet.  - Frans De WaalGorillas live in family groups with a dominant silverback male and several females and offspring.

1,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"It´s interesting, if one gets a score of over 90 percent or even, let´s just say, hm 98,8 percent, the person would say that this is close to absolute. No matter if it is a test, a comparison or whatever. But as soon as it goes like ""You know, those missing 1,2 percent are the difference between you and a sh$§trhowing chimpanzee, the person goes like WTF and so on. So, as I always say, we are naked apes and each emotional and brain reaction that is explored in monkeys gives deep insights into our collective and individual nature. The knowledge could lead to a better social design from international organizations to small villages with just a hand full of houses. Checklists are great, so let´s put monkeys vs humans on a kind of partner finding match list with the same interest. Violent without reason against the own people which harms the whole society? Check. Manipulate and lie around anything that comes just a mile close so some sexy time? Done. The tendency to despotism, genocide and determination wars? Getting closer to a full match. Same emotional reactions concerning love, fear, hate, etc? Got it, monkey owned. Excuse me, but could someone please explain the difference to me again? I mean, even the throwing sh$3 thing seems to be matching, be it verbally or in some rare cases, ahem.Both the neurological and social development are so closely related that the functioning systems kept growing inside our heads and got probably a little bit modified regarding impulse control, subtleness and intelligence, but nature didn´t change much in this running system. Take away food, shelter and punishment and we are again where we were millions of years ago, extremely dangerous group raiders with an integrated attitude to madness. This is especially funny, because there are no lesser intelligent animals, especially biological very similar mammals, that have the same rate of lunatics that naturally occur because something like a human brain can´t be constructed or civilized without some damage. When there are millions of rabbits, deer, mice or cows, their behavioral anomalies are so few compared to when one puts a few million people together in one place.One implication is, that like bonobos and chimpanzees, human society has different attitudes depending on the social structure. And as both humans and monkeys keep evolving, many new variants may grow out of the few concepts with the main difference that humans could form an environment for many experiments and plentiful family and social structures instead of the few monocultures we see today. With each acceptable ideology, that doesn´t include harming, discriminating or erasing other groups, many experiments would be possible with volunteer groups of environmentalists, futurists, etc. that want to try out something new. How to prevent them from going the way of sects and extremists might be a tricky topic, but at least the indoctrinated way of how to live would fall apart.A huge misuse of anthropomorphism has been the tendency to think that we great humans should project our superior properties onto other, ""lower"" animals instead of considering that it might be that many animals are much smarter, complex and emotional than we thought or wanted to think. Just because human communication got overcomplicated with language, mimics and stuff that doesn´t mean that communications that are based on smell, varying sounds or just hormones aren´t as good, effective and a sign of higher intelligence instead of just instincts, as thought for a long time. With the help of neuroscience and biological markers, the truth can be shown. Tragically, the bad and wrong science of the past was used to discriminate animals and other humans that were both deemed inferior.The work is primarily focused on apes, but let´s think about other animals, for instance, pigs, cows and chicken or, if they are on the dinner table and the imagination is too irritating, dolphins, octopi, crows, well, anything that has the intelligence and/ or social life to feel. And here comes the cornucopia of ethical, philosophical and sociological questions regarding both our connection to and behavior regarding many animals. Let´s say a scientist would find out or has already found out a long time ago that especially the tortured animals in the meat factories have not just more complex feelings and higher intelligence than supposed but understand the whole context of their situation at each moment.The work of this outstanding author should be read and spread by everybody, because it opens new, interdisciplinary fields of both natural sciences and humanities and leads to a better understanding of both real and human nature and could help to stop repeating the construction errors and behaving like aggressive alpha males after a few million years of a wild, human adolescence and become adult and wise instead.Finally, let´s try a self-test that is prooving all theories right. Look, I made this funny, for the sake of your mental sanity censored, list of emotions that would completely control me with full intensity if I wouldn´t be such a highly developed, smart super-duper alpha predator (meditation and mindfulness really help a tiny little bit): bored, stressed, happy, hungry, evil, scared, tired, excited, hungry again, dishonest, sensitive,...A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real-life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categor...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categor..."
2,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s,4,"Animal emotions. Human emotions. Can they, in any way share commanalties? The author makes a convincing and illuminating arguement, that yes they can, and they can also tell us much about ourselves. He shares the relationship between various chimp behaviors, the emotions they have and how they are shown in various situations. While most of the book cover this group, their are also sections on birds, horses and even comparisons of human behavior, notably Trump and Spicer, that directly correlates to the animal world.My favorite parts were the Bonobos, who he calls the hippies of the chimp world. They would rather make love, not war. Plus, a rarity in that it is a female who has the most power. Also enjoyed the bits of humor scattered throughout, such as when the author notes, that chimps are very familiar with each other's derrieres. Parts are sad, such as Mama's passing, but it is also informative and enjoyable. Our human makeup, emotionally, so closely tied to many other animals should make us kinder to those animals who share our environment, or so I hope. Understanding should bring kindness and empathy, which by the way are other emotions we share. Good book, wonderful delivery and I enjoyed the narrator L. J. Ganser."
3,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,2,"Two or three stars--which represents best how I react to this book? Is the book good or is it OK? As a whole, it feels more OK than good--so two stars it will be. I will explain why I react in this way.I have trouble with how the book is told, and I am not referring in any way to the narration of the audiobook. It is not the central content concerning animals’ emotions that is the stumbling block for me. I am certain that animals do have emotions and the similarity between human and animal emotions is striking. The information provided on this topic is interesting. When the book sticks to the topic it is good. Too often it gets off track.I must start at the end—it is in this way easiest to explain what I observe. The audiobook ends with a short summation of what the author intended with his book. The author speaks to us directly; we hear his voice, his words. It is not the audiobook’s narrator that reads the afterword of the audiobook. The words Waal uses are completely different from the language used in the book. He proposes his ideas in a quiet and understated manner. The tone of the book, the language used there, has the air of being modern and hip, cool, amicable and convivial. It is the language so often used in books of popular science. The language employed in the book compared to the language in the afterword are is as different as night and day! I cannot help but wonder if revisions have been made to the author’s writing. The language of the afterword is what I prefer.There are other problems related to how the book is told. The prologue does not explain how the book is set up, and it is too detailed. The chapter and subchapter titles are not informative; they give little guidance as to what will follow. Here are five title examples— The Yuck Factor, Pride and Prejudice, Murder, Power, Emotions Are Like Organs. The content of each chapter flows without pause from subject to subject, mixing anecdotes, theorizing and citings of scientific experiments. What the experiments show are stated as given facts with little said concerning chosen methods or procedures. The chapters end abruptly; they lack a final paragraph that summarizes the conclusions that should be drawn. There are statements made that I questioned, one example being that animals instinctively know what they can and cannot eat. My dog certainly doesn’t—he eats spoiled meat from carcasses and then vomits it up! Often, I felt the need to question what is said; background information is inadequate. Topics sometimes are simply dropped in midair. Much can be interpreted in alternate ways. Too much theorizing and quibbling over semantics. One example--over and over again the author insists on distinguishing between emotions and feelings. The author states that the first are shown and arise physically from our bodies, while the second are spoken of and are a product of language. What we say can be deceptive; to achieve our goals, we do not always say what we truly think. Then at the end, it is stated that the two, emotions and feelings, are very close! So why all the fuss about stressing the difference? This is a topic returned to many times throughout the book, each time I felt uncomfortable because what is said is too theoretical, built on a construct, diffuse, quite simply unclear! I felt the author was playing with words. What I do like is when theorizing is put aside and we are told interesting tidbits about animal behavior, their emotions and intellect. This is what I was looking for in the book. Animals do have emotions and numerous examples are spoken of. The differences among bonobos, chimpanzees, orangutans and some monkeys are fascinating. There is information here I had not heard before. Elephants, birds, cats and dogs, horses, mice and fish--a wide assortment of animals are discussed. In the text, the author expresses frequently his personal point of view and stresses often what he has done, in a tone so very different from his words in the afterword. On closing the book, I was jarred at the incongruity between the afterword and all that had preceded it.I have no proof of this, but the book seems to me to have been revised by another person than the author. Has somebody else gotten involved? Have sections been added to enhance the popularity of the book? The book spreads out over popular themes, into philosophy, politics and even Trump! Vegetarianism, zoos and the proper and fair treatment of animals in general are additional themes. There is very little about Mama, the matriarchal chimpanzee of the title. She’s there on the cover to pull at your heartstrings.The audiobook is narrated by L.J. Ganser. His narration I have given three stars. He reads at times a bit too fast. I need time to consider that which is stated. I do not automatically swallow what I am being told. There is nothing wrong with Ganser’s narration, but I would recommend reading the paper book. With the paper format it is easier to stop and think. I don’t regret reading this for the facts it provides about animals, but how it is told gave me trouble. A book viewed by me as OK is OK, not bad! ******************Mama's Last Hug: Animal Emotions and What They Tell Us about Ourselves 2 stars*Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? 3 stars Both by Frans de WaalRelated books which could be of interest: *Beyond Words: What Animals Think and Feel 4 stars*Mind of the Raven: Investigations and Adventures with Wolf-Birds 4 stars*The Genius of Dogs: How Dogs Are Smarter than You Think 4 stars*Wesley the Owl: The Remarkable Love Story of an Owl and His Girl 5 stars*Two Owls At Eton 5 stars*Alex & Me: How a Scientist and a Parrot Discovered a Hidden World of Animal Intelligence—and Formed a Deep Bond in the Process 3 stars *Love, Life, and Elephants: An African Love Story 3 stars"
4,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39088701-arianna,5,"Frans de Waal’s latest book, Mama’s Last Hug: Animal and Human Emotions, is a survey of various emotions — what they are, when they arise, and how they are identified — in both animals and humans. Each chapter covers a different set of emotions or concepts related to them, such as emotional intelligence and sentience, described with a plentiful assortment of de Waal’s firsthand anecdotes from his decades studying primates as well as summaries of other scientific publications. In short, he asserts (and with much credible evidence) that not only do animals have rich emotional lives, but they very much parallel that of humans. Anyone who has a pet at home perhaps will shrug at why this is such a big deal. Like other people who own pets, I’m no stranger to describing the behavior of my cats in emotional terms: they become mopey and depressed when my suitcases come out and they know I’m going to be gone for a while; when I come home from work or a trip they’re ecstatic to see me; they get frustrated when their food or water dish has been empty too long; etc. This is just what the average person tends to do, and we don’t think twice about it. The thing is, scientific reasoning has discredited this for ages as anthropomorphism (and the topic gets a nice overview early on in Mama’s Last Hug), which has long been the “silly foolish thing” humans do that’s just plain nonsense. As Frans de Waal and other scientists have worked hard to prove over the years this is actually not the case. Hard, irrefutable, scientific evidence is now coming out to show that we humans are not on a magnificent pedestal above the rest of the animal kingdom after all. Advances in neuroscience and a growing awareness of and accounting for once-ignored variables in experimental data (like social animals being tested in isolation versus in a social environment, or the very distinct differences in rat behavior when lab technicians are male or female) have only shown that we humans are far more similar to the rest of the animals than we are dissimilar. Turns out, we humans aren’t actually bad at correctly assessing the emotional states of animals, either.Personally, I devoured this book as quickly as I could. I’ve highlighted so many passages, and discussed the stories and conclusions with anyone that will listen. I’ve always been endlessly fascinated with where scientists are going with their studies of emotions, and usually find myself skimming some psychology publications just for fun. In fact, I even participated in research myself — partly to see how experiments were run, partly to get a free MRI of my brain (why not?). But I always come away from it all a bit perplexed by the over-reliance on linguistics. A brain scan and one’s body language/facial expressions will always depict what one’s emotions are regardless of what they may say to the contrary. Furthermore, humans simply have a tendency to not understand their own emotions, or at the very least struggle to communicate them in a way that’s fully understood from one person to the next, if they aren’t outright lying about what their emotions are. Language is an abstraction over the more complicated mess contained within. Sure, I can tell you something made me “sad” with my fancy human language skills, but do you really know what I experience if you can’t see my expressions or behavior? Mama’s Last Hug has made me think rather deeply about what really does differentiate us from the other animals on our planet. I’ve never questioned if animals are actually clever, or if they have emotions (and by extension feelings), but I didn’t quite realize just how tremendously much we share until finishing this book. When I look at my species, I see our differences from the other species on this planet in our artistic works and creative endeavors. But in uniquely human traits, I also see a dark side: an endless appetite for destruction and a capacity for doubting, questioning, and ultimately ignoring our own emotions as if they were somehow not an intricate part of us. The capability for empathy and self-sacrifice isn’t uniquely human; instead, it is a life-preserving tendency shared amongst most if not all animals. There is life-giving, life-preserving wisdom in what we’ve long considered primitive or basic, and it stares right back at us when we slow down long enough to really see our animal cousins and what they innately know and do that we so readily resist. I couldn’t recommend Mama’s Last Hug: Animal and Human Emotions by Frans de Waal enough. From the wonderful stories of observed animal emotions, to the thoughtfulness spurred regarding how we treat animals and how we think about ourselves, there’s a lot of to be gained from reading this book. It was delightful to read and I am looking forward to reading Frans de Waal’s prior works as well!*** I received an advance reading copy from the publisher, W. W. Norton ***"
5,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27456036-barbara,5,"Frans DeWaal is a primatologist who has studied animal emotions for decades. This fascinating book explores the rich emotional lives of animals. Relating observations and laboratory experiments we are told of emotions found not only in primates, but rats, moles, and fish. Due to a lack of language in these groups (at least a language humans understand), science has been skeptical about the existence of emotions. They can't tell us when they are sad, joyful, envious. They, unlike humans, cannot lie about what they are experiencing. De Waal also believes that reluctance to accept their emotions may stem from an unwillingness to grant complex emotions to lower life forms. After all, isn't that what makes us superior? Thankfully, science is changing and that will trickle down to the general public. We should respect all life. We should care about their habitats and their handling and quality of life if used for consumption. Some progress is being made, but we have a long way still to go.DeWaal is not just extremely knowledgeable and passionate about his subject, but he is an engaging writer. I highly recommend this book.""We tend to underestimate the emotions that organize our lives and institutions, but they are at the core of everything we do and are. The desire to control others is a driving force behind many social processes and imposes structure on primate societies. From Trump and Clinton's quest to lead the nation to bonobo mothers who come to blows over their sons, the power motive is pervasive and plain to see. It has led to some of our highest achievements under inspiring leaders, but it also has a disturbing track record of violence, including the political assassinations to which our own species is no stranger. Emotions can be good, bad, and ugly, which is as true for animals as it is for us."""
6,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Frans de Waal is one of that generation of biologists who, when starting in their field, had to struggle with an intellectual climate more or less opposed on principle to thinking about the inner lives or emotions of animals. Like Jane Goodall (who violated norms by naming, rather than numbering, the chimpanzees she was observing), he was somewhat of a revolutionary for advocating the patently obvious position that humans are not the only mammals to have emotions and distinct personalities. But then, in the mid-20th century, even research in the emotions of humans was somewhat suspect, as the more extreme Behaviorists considered anything other than behavior to be improper for scientific consideration.Fortunately, times have changed, but de Waal is still a bit angry about it. Not that his writing is, by and large, ranty or angry (if I may engage in a bit of speculation about his internal mental state for a moment). But, from time to time he does get just a tiny bit curmudgeonly about the fact that he had to spend a good bit of his early career battling the intellectual headwinds that hit anyone who thought that non-human animals thought, and more importantly felt.Which is a bit odd, because not only is this common knowledge which any farmer, veterinarian, or pet owner could have told you, but it is also very much in line with the Copernican Principle. This is the pattern (not as precise as a scientific law, more a rule of thumb) that scientific progress tends to move in the direction of ""You Are Not So Special, Humanity"". Earth is not the center of the Universe. Neither is the Sun. Humans came about long after the universe had been going, and we are related to every other living thing on earth, some of whom are relatively close relations. It is predictable from the Copernican Principle that just about anything that humans can do (language, toolmaking, feeling emotions) has antecedents in other species.There are a few times when I was a bit skeptical of his arguments, if not of his conclusions. For example, he makes reference to the now famous ""pencil held in your teeth makes you find things to be funnier because it forces you into a smile"" study, without acknowledging that there has been quite a bit of trouble in replications of this finding. Now it may be that this result will be upheld upon closer study, but given all the attention paid to replication in the social sciences in recent years, you would think that it would at least be acknowledged that there was a question.Still, there is clearly a lot in common between human emotions and those of other mammals, and perhaps even in some cases non-mammalian species. The ""Mama"" of the title refers to a chimpanzee matriarch, who managed to retain her alpha female status for many years largely by deftly managing the emotions of herself and others in her troop. Very late in her life, she was visited by Jan van Hooff, an (also elderly) researcher who supervised de Waal's dissertation decades before. The video accumulated several million views (you can see it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INa-o... ). The reason is that the emotional content is not difficult to interpret; the chimpanzee is surprised, and enthusiastic, about seeing the familiar human face. Chimpanzees are far stronger than humans, and unless you have raised one from infancy it is dangerous to be near one without some form of protection from mood swings. If we are told that this was the first ever time that they had met without bars in between, even though they had been interacting for forty years, it certainly adds something to our understanding of the event, but I think even without this knowledge the emotional content of the chimpanzee's reaction is pretty clear.One could, of course, come up with some sort of explanation of the various physical acts that did not mention the word ""emotion"" or any related concept. You could also probably come up with an explanation of why the planets move across the sky in the way they do, without referencing the fact that they and the Earth are all in orbit around the Sun. But, the simplest explanation by far is that they feel many of the same emotions that humans do, and so for the same reason that (well before we had rocketry enough to literally prove it) we accepted Copernicus' heliocentric model, we should probably assume that mammals have emotions unless there is some advantage (in predictive power) in assuming otherwise.If I have any criticism of this book, it would be that much of the same ground was covered in his previous book, ""Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?"" But, it is still a good read, and the overlap is not so complete as to make reading this book superfluous.I have to say, also, that I found de Waal's sketches and drawings to be charming. More scientists should attempt to draw; it's a humanizing touch. Also, their knowledge (some of it subconscious) of which features matter most, can at times make their drawings more informative than a photograph.All told, a worthy, if imperfect, book on a topic that anyone with emotions can learn from."
7,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33921897-kusaimamekirai,5," I recently went to the zoo at the behest of a friend of mine (I hadn’t been to a proper zoo since I was a child) and was reminded why I hadn’t been in such a long time. Animals in small enclosures, appearing listless with nothing to stimulate them, was for me the opposite of entertaining. It was profoundly moving but not perhaps in the sense that my acquaintance might have wished. Particularly disturbing to me was seeing the macaques, gorillas, chimpanzees, and other primates. When my friend sensed that I was not happy to see them despite my love of bonobos and chimpanzees in particular, I explained how sad it was to see these profoundly social animals with intricate friendship and family bonds be isolated by themselves in a small cage.  In “Mama’s Last Hug”, Frans De Waal doesn’t go deeply into how zoos are problematic (he does briefly touch on it) but he does ask and defend the question as to whether primates in particular are capable of emotions. If you’ve read De Waal before you are probably familiar with his answer but here he uses his and others research as well as entertaining and fascinating anecdotes to answer that he believes they do.  He gives wonderful examples of a wide variety of facial expressions that correlate with our own (our facial structures are remarkably similar), how primates feel and show shame, bargain amongst themselves and others (he cites macaques at a temple of Bali who often steal particular items such as cell phones from tourists. Rather than run away with them, the monkeys sit a safe distance away until the tourists hands over a sufficient amount of food, at which point the monkey will put down the valuables and walk away with its bounty). In his perhaps most touching story, De Waal recounts the story of Mama, a female chimp who was the alpha female for decades at the colony De Waal supervised in Holland. As she became sick and near death, one of the staff members who had been with her for years went into her cage to say goodbye (a quite dangerous thing to do and one that he freely admitted later he would never do with any other chimp). Mama on seeing and clearly remembering their relationship over the years, gave him a long hug as if to say goodbye that can been seen on Youtube (highly recommended you have some kleenex handy). Was she aware of her impending death? Maybe. Maybe not. But even the most hardened cynic would have to admit that there was at a bare minimum recognition on her part and more likely warmth that we as humans like to assign solely to ourselves.  Why do so many scientists still refuse to acknowledge that beings other than humans are capable of complex emotions? Is it that it would complicate experimentation on them? Make eating them extremely problematic? We do not know for sure. De Waal writes we cannot ask animals directly what they are feeling. This is undoubtedly true. And yet through simple observation it is increasingly difficult to deny they are feeling something intensely recognizable and universal to all living beings. "
8,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46311769-katie-long,3,"An engaging examination of primate emotions (though, de Waal carefully distinguishes these from feelings) and social constructs and what they teach us about human emotions and interactions. Every now and then it seems his analogies oversimplify human reactions (ex. he compared Bonobo female reproductive jealousy to the majority of women who chose Obama over the McCain/Palin ticket, which of course disregards the many, MANY other reasons that a woman might choose to support Obama over Palin, and fails to account for the broad female support of other young female politicians like AOC and Ayanna Pressley). I suppose these analogies are meant to be illustrative and not intended to be sole reason a person reacts the way they do, but that one especially was off putting."

While I understand what he is trying to accomplish, his wording comes off as sexist. An example, from Chapter 1:While a young woman’s bosom gradually expands, often aided by push-up bras and padding, she, too, becomes a magnet of male attention. She learns the power of cleavage, which gives her clout she’s never enjoyed before, while also opening her up to jealousy and nasty comments from other women. This complex period in a girl’s life, with its massive emotional upheavals and insecurities, reflects the same interplay between power, sex, and rivalry that adolescent female apes also go through.(and, a few paragraphs later)Young women are both more available and more valuable because of the reproductive life that lies in front of them. Hence women’s eternal quest to look young via hair-dyeing, makeup, implants, facelifts, and so on.I can't say I agree. Many young women don't want this attention, nor do they they use their bodies to leverage power with men. Makeup and beauty treatments are not always about looking younger or attracting a mate, either. Ugh. Point made, but rather poorly. "
10,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2613351-linda-robinson,5,"Educational, entertaining, enlightening, evidentiary. de Waal is devoted to his subject both intellectually and emotionally, and once you've read the book, you might believe (as I do) that that's the same fidelity. It took me all of the book to grasp that emotions are not feelings, and it's taken the behaviorist, psychologist, biologist schools decades to sort it as well. We (and this we perhaps has an arrow pointed at American studies for the perpetuation of this misconception) accept that animals are lower on the evolutionary ladder than the venerated us. Humans talk. And talk and talk. Other sentient beings don't. Not to us, which disqualifies them from apex status. But then we aren't all that great at observing without being told what to see. For this reason alone, I've never been sure that homo sapiens earned its pedestal-topping roost. Fierce listening, as my friend says, is what we need more. Observation and listening are conjacent.de Waal sorts sentience into tiers, and you will be fascinated by the way he sticks this knowledge so you won't soon forget. All the old saws about the reasons animals are so far below us don't hold water. Or air either. Do orangutans plan ahead? Are chimpanzees empathetic? Do dolphins remember? Does a rat like being tickled? Does a community of primates understand death? How do battling chimps achieve accord? Do alpha females seek revenge?The answers are all here for those who wish to observe and listen. This is a joyful book. I wish you as pleasant an experience."
11,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45873498-jackie,5,I won this in a Goodreads giveaway. What a wonderful book! I enjoyed it and would highly recommend it! 
12,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7701175-alison,2,"I wanted to like this, I really did. De Waal is such a nice guy, and such a thoughtful writer, and a brilliant primate scientist. But Mama's Last Hug is not, IMHO, de Waal at his best. While I agree with the vast majority of the arguments he puts about the role of emotion and the social interactions that largely drive them, I found it increasingly difficult to abide the generalisations and exaggerations that pepper de Waal's approach to studies that are not his own. Consistently, de Waal makes a grand statement (e.g. ""the idea that behavior is invariably self-serving has died an inglorious death. Science has confirmed that cooperation is our species’s first and foremost inclination, at least with members of the in-group"") and then provides a single example or study as evidence (in this case, one pop science book published in 2011). Now, to be clear, I *agree* with de Waal on cooperation, absolutely - and I would love to be able to say scientific consensus now exists on this issue. But I don't think it does - and certainly what is cited here is not enough for me to feel comfortable quoting de Waal, no matter how much I want to.I don't so much agree with de Waal on his insistence of sharp, biological gendered differences in humans, and it is a topic in which I am reasonably well read. I would have liked to engage more with de Waal on this - most primates show sharp social differential by gender, and given the importance recognises in culture in primates, this discussion about how culture plays a role, inextricably entwined with biology (primates biology changes in line with the assumption of social roles), but instead de Waal relies on discredited studies, generalisations and eventually absurd statements like: ""Modern female heads of state have all been postmenopausal, such as Golda Meir, Indira Gandhi, and Margaret Thatcher."" (Jacinda Ardern and Benazir Bhutto, both of whom gave birth in office, would find this puzzling). This then justifies the eaually ridiculous: ""While being attractive and good-looking is great for men (think of John F. Kennedy or Justin Trudeau), it doesn’t work out equally well for women. This is related to how sexual competition interacts with an electorate that is half male and half female. Attractive women, especially those of childbearing age, are perceived as rivals by other women, which makes it hard for them to get their vote. When John McCain ran against Barack Obama in 2008, he selected a relatively young woman, Sarah Palin, as his running mate. Men in the media regarded it as a brilliant move, calling Palin “hot” and a “MIL F,” but no one seemed to realize how much male enthusiasm might harm Palin’s standing among women. Obama barely won the male vote (49 to 48 percent), but he ran away with the female vote (56 to 43 percent)."" I could point out that gendered voting patterns have consistently run along party lines in the USA, but I'm getting tired, and frankly take little joy in poking at a scholar whose work has been so justifiably influential in his own field. Suffice to say when I started rigourously checking the references, I found many statements supported by scant research, and would shelve more as opinion than science.De Waal has transformed our views on Bonobos, and I do hope his future publications return to stronger ground."
13,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,4,"Animal Emotions Early ethologists studied animal behavior to understand a shared motivation. Their experimental setup was elegant and objective, but the underlying motivation for animal behavior was ignored. For example, fear and anger, and the animal reactions to it were carefully examined and conclusions were drawn. The prevailing assumption in these studies were that animals had instincts that gave inborn actions triggered by a situation. Behavioral biologists have changed this approach because the instincts are inflexible, and they have started to look from the point of emotions which allow flexibility. They prime body and mind, but do not dictate any specific course of actions. Emotions are neither invisible nor impossible to study; they can be measured. Levels of biomolecules associated with emotional experiences, from the “cuddle hormone” oxytocin to the stress hormone cortisol, can easily be determined. The hormones are virtually identical across the board; from humans to birds to invertebrates.The artificial intelligence (AI) recognize the importance of emotions. AI with emotions would interact with humans with empathy and human-like emotions, and hopefully do not destroy mankind when they become too powerful. It is expected to facilitate engagement and working together for common good. In this book, the author, a well-known primatologist proposes that animals experience emotions in the same way as humans do. Emotions infuse everything that inspire cognition and drives all animals and humans. By examining emotions, this book puts these vivid of mental experiences in evolutionary context, revealing how their richness, power and utility stretch across species and back into the history of animal kingdom."
14,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30276417-nancy-mills,4,"I loved this book, although I found it very similar to another of Frans de Waal's books, Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?, which deals with animal intelligence while this one deals with emotions. As the author points out, the two are intertwined. Apparently the fact that other animals have feelings and emotions very similar to our own comes as a surprise to many people, including scientists. I, like the author, think it's obvious that they do, as would anyone who had any kind of close relationship with a dog, horse, primate or bird. The author gives solid evidence of sentience in fish, and the intelligence of octopuses is well documented. So, while I enjoyed this book immensely, loved the anecdotes this seasoned primatologist colorfully presents, and found his views regarding our treatment of other living things logically flawless, the whole point of the book is, to me, blindingly obvious. Unfortunately, this is evidently not true for much of the human race, which is very disturbing. If it's because they lack the opportunity for close relationships with animals, perhaps reading this book will encourage us to get to know our fellow earthlings. If it's just that many people are numb nuts and lack what we cavalierly term ""humanity,"" the only answer is for our society as a whole to change its attitude and customs, so that mistreatment of animals will be unacceptable, even if certain cretins don't get it. "
15,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5817790-steve,5,"Wonderfully written book about animal emotions. The main focus is on apes, but lots about other animals as well. He has a good way of labeling some things as not quite facts but as well-supported scientific conjectures."
16,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108604-christine,5,"“Mama’s Last Hug” was a surprising treasure that I stumbled across and am so happy to have read! To motivate me to read more this year I found a quirky themed reading competition and one of the themes was a book that won or was nominated for an award this year. I found an article talking about recent book award winners and what caught my eye was the winner for the PEN/E.O. Wilson Literary Science award for 2020. “Mama’s Last Hug” is about animal emotions and is a nonfiction topic I have never read or thought about. I like science books about topics I can relate to for work or personal development (biology, nutrition, biochemistry, human psychology, ecology and nature, public health) and for some reason I never read much about animals at all. But regarding this book- I thoroughly enjoyed Frans de Waal’s perspective on how he viewed the emotions of animals while so many others in science deny it. I would like to hear even more stories about his findings as a primatologist. He has many great little stories about different chimpanzees he’s worked with that are interwoven in the text. It didn’t feel like reading a dry science textbook but rather a fun collection of facts mixed with personal experiences. I was hooked from the beginning after the first story — which the book is titled after (“Mama” was a famous chimpanzee). This quick read discusses various emotions in animals and to me it’s illogical to think animals would be so completely different from us; just because we can’t understand their form of communication or reasoning (whether auditory/“language”-based or through biochemical information) doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. And that’s just one tiny part of the discussion on intelligence and emotion- de Waal digs deep into many examples of how humans mimic animal behavior (not vice versa) and offers proof that animals must certainly feel the same kinds of ways that we do. Because if one believes in evolution it only makes sense that we had to have learned our own behaviors and emotional responses from somewhere, right?My favorite quote that I think sums it up quite nicely: “The possibility that animals experience emotions the way we do makes many hard-nosed scientists feel queasy, partly because animals never report any feelings, and partly because the existence of feelings presupposes a level of consciousness that these scientists are unwilling to grant animals. But considering how much animals act like us, share our physiological reactions, have the same facial expressions, and possess the same sort of brains, wouldn’t it be strange indeed if their internal experiences were radically different?”It would be totally strange, indeed. Can’t wait to read more!"
17,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80471724-mike-schoonderwoerd,4,"The second Frans de Waal I read, after our inner ape. Long chapters with great subjects makes the book very pleasant to read per chapter. Good thorough knowledge on all sorts of emotions on a vary of animals builds a good foundation."
18,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63095317-laura,5,"I won an ARC of Mama’s Last Hug in a Goodreads giveaway and I am so glad I did! I laughed, I cried and laughed again. Incredibly informative , I ended up using an entire highlighter on this book. It’s an absolutely fascinating view on human and animal emotions and the big question “do animals have feelings?”. My first thought whenever I hear someone ask that is ‘they’ve never had a pet before’, as I think most of us dog (and/or cat) people have a hard time believing that anyone could believe animals don’t have feelings. But this delves deep into the difference between emotions and feelings and our tendency as humans to anthropomorphize. When your dog gives you a “guilty” look after peeing on the carpet is he feeling guilt or is he just sucking up because he knows you’re angry? Why are humans the only animals to blush? Why do humans have a white sclera around their eyes when most mammals have little to no white in theirs? These are just a fraction of the fascinating questions that will be discussed in this awesome book on a subject we could all stand to learn more about. Who knows, maybe if we all read more books like this we would have more respect for other species (and perhaps even our own)! "
19,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91326071-zo,4,"“Mama’s Last Hug” is not, in fact, a reference to familial bonding, and I’m actually grateful for that. The compassion any species shows for individuals related to them seems to me as close to common sense as one can get, if you’re to believe a common sense exists, but apparent love for others that not only don’t share genes, but are not even of the same species, was an enlightening topic for me. It’s hard to believe that true altruism could have evolved through natural selection given how counterproductive it can appear to be for one person’s survival, but it’s harder for me to discount what De Waal has shown in his studies and in this book. I do question some of his statements, but the only time I really took issue with his approach was at the change of subject into animal rights. I certainly don’t disagree activism for such things is important and justifiable, but despite what De Waal argued as his defense, I do see a disconnect between advocating plant based eating and acknowledging primates like us couldn’t have evolved as we did if not for meat consumption, as well as keeping animals for experimentation, which would make him an enemy of many animal rights movements. Overall, though, this part was short, and the rest of what I learned was phenomenal."
20,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1200016-bentley,3,"Good book dealing with animal emotions. For those of us who have animals in our lives, it is not surprising that animals are able to express human emotions and do that regularly. Mama, the animal of the book's title, was the matriarch of the chimpanzee colony at Burgers Zoo in Arnhem, the Netherlands who exerted a great deal of influence over her tribe. The author developed a long term relationship with the ape over decades and his studies formed the basis for this heart warming book. Sometimes pedantic in a few spots; while other parts of the book (if you are interested in animals and their innate abilities) are so revealing as to how very much animals are attuned to humans and have many of the same emotional connections and feelings. The book shows the connectivity of all of the species on Earth and the depths of those emotional threads. A worthwhile read of a New York Times bestseller."
21,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62793003-cody-mccoy,5,"I bought this book because I loved Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are. In that book, de Waal covered massive ground in our understanding of animal intelligence. He is a true expert and I LOVED that book.This book, a companion book about emotions, was also compelling, easy to read, and fascinating. I thought it was not quite as outstanding as the previous book, partly because this book focused almost exclusively on primates and partly because there was more of a window into de Waal’s opinions. I know for some readers that will be a big plus, and in some cases I deeply appreciated his opinions (eg, in the final chapters about animal agriculture and ethics). In other cases, I felt his opinions took away from the otherwise fascinating and positive tone of the book (eg, if he was too negative about a rival theory). That being said, he has truly revolutionised how we think about animal emotions despite extreme obstacles - he is absolutely entitled to have opinions!All in all, I strongly recommend this book to people interested in the obvious emotional similarities between man and other animals."
22,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/829466-sara,4,"The stronger story in the book was in its title. The story of Mama the chimpanzee and her last human encounters before her death. Very sweet!This book focuses on the range of animal emotions, which is a topic that is not new to the author and thus not 100% original (to me as a reader of his books). I still enjoyed reading the book because I always enjoy Frans de Waal's books. He is a very engaging writer. de Waal goes around the animal kingdom hitting the varied emotional lives of animals. I was a little annoyed at a few inconsistencies in his writing. He voluntarily brings up vegetarianism (as he should), but mentions his own actions, which do not match his own findings. For example, he talks about not eating ""mammalian meat"" in his home, dismissing poultry. This is in spite of the fact that there is actually MORE research supporting the intellectual ability of chickens than cows (and this doesn't even include the fact that in the USA chickens aren't protected by the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act). Okay, HUGE props to Frans de Waal though for one particular moment in the book (and this probably upped my rating): mocking the 'live forever without a body' futuristic knuckleheads. He simply pointed out that you can hardly remove your intellect and thoughts from emotions and poo pooed that dumb idea. So I give him a virtual high five for that. And even though he's written about it before, it's still interesting to reminisce on how stubborn scientists were in giving animals emotional depth. I was pretty much guaranteed to enjoy this book, because I love ethology. But if you are newer to the field, haven't read much about it, and you love animals, you will enjoy it even more. "

If you love animals and want a deeper understanding of our planet mates, this will give it to you. If you are interested in increasing your emotional intelligence, this is a fascinating guide. Frank de Waal is a master observer, scientist and storyteller. Mama’s Last Hug is an exquisitely delivered perspective filled with enlightening wisdom emerging from the truth that we are all creatures, equal and unique, on this amazing Earth. Highly recommended! And if you love this book, you may want to check out Animal Wisdom Word Search: Yoga for the Brain.“Emotion-based reactions have this gigantic advantage over reflex-like behavior: they pass through a filter of experience and learning known as appraisal.” Consider this and that “Getting emotional has a voluntary side...Perhaps the greatest misunderstanding about emotions is that they are the opposite of cognition. We have translated the dualism between body and mind into one between emotion and intelligence, but the two actually go together and cannot operas without each other.”I won a Goodreads giveaway advance reading copy and thoroughly enjoyed it."
24,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,5,"Why do we assume that animals lack emotions and feelings? Frans de Waal argues persuasively that animals have emotions similar to our own and that there is a good probability that they also have feelings. I had not realized prior to reading this book how similar the human physiology of emotions is to that of animals. We share neurotransmitter systems, hormonal systems, and complex neurological routines. DeWaal is a primatologist who has spent his career studying primate behavior. He’s also an engaging storyteller who shares accounts of his relationships with particular chimpanzees he has come to know well. For this reason alone, this book is well worth reading. But he also has a higher purpose: to convince us that we have more in common with animals than most scientists think. He offers compelling evidence to support his thesis, including peer reviewed research and his own experiences. "

I also know that they are able to read the feelings of other species, especially us humans. It was quite educational to see how this has been documented over the years in numerous species - not only those that have been domesticated, or widely observed in lab settings such as mice and monkeys, but even fish!Because of the academic feel of the book, it wasn't a quick read, but one that I wanted to finish because the anecdotes in it were so interesting. I also felt an affinity to the author since he has done a lot of his research here in the Atlanta area where I live."
27,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1390765-diane,5,"For some 40 years the author has studied animal behavior and emotions. In his latest book, Mama's Last Hug were are introduced to a Mama, a 59 year old matriarch chimp who was dying. Mama and biologist Jan van Hooff had formed a bond over the years so he decided to visit her for one last time before her death. Mama's keen facial recognition and happiness at seeing Jan's face resulted in smiles, and her patting his neck repeatedly in a hug, much as we'd see in human to human interactions. The interaction between Mama and Jan were filmed and went viral evidencing that humans are not the only ones capable of expressing emotion.After Mama's death, her adopted daughter Geisha stood vigil and would not leave Mama even for food, demonstrating the animals are also capable of grieving. Grieving in animals does require an attachment so when a pet dies, others animals may not appear to miss the deceased unless they were bonded. This is true of cats, dogs and even elephants as well.Another chimp has lost her babies several times over due to insufficient lactation. When her babies, failing to thrive, had died, the chimp went into a severe depression, screaming, refusing food and rubbing eyes with its fists.There was such a wealth of information in this book. Well researched, moving and even funny at times; there are even some illustrations throughout the book. The subjects researched were not just chimps and bonobos but, birds, rats, dogs, horses and elephants as well. I was fascinated by this book and found myself reading it very slowing, so that this one would stick with me for sometime. Animal lovers should give this one a try.4.5/5 stars"
28,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2587533-alarie,5,"I can’t fathom why anyone wouldn’t be fascinated by this book, though a few might be insulted by the comparisons of certain alpha apes to their favorite politicians. De Waal claims that improved measures from MRIs and such are making it ridiculous for scientists to claim that only humans grieve, feel jealousy and empathy, and can plan for the future. I was already impressed by the language and computer training being given to Bonobos in labs, but I’m more impressed with them now. Their social structure is less violent, more cooperative than that of chimpanzees or of our own society. Plus I’d never seen a photo of how upright Bonobos stand. They look like they walked off the set from Planet of the Apes. Because De Waal is a primate scientist, most of the book looked at primate behavior, but where relevant to a point about facial expressions, laughter, sense of fair play, etc., he brought in examples from other species.My favorite anecdote was about macaques at some Balinese temples who steal eyeglasses, jewelry, and small articles of clothing from tourists. Signs warn the tourists to put away and guard these items, but the tourists think it’s a joke. Goodbye watch, glasses, baseball cap, flip flop! The macaques only scamper a few yards away, where the humans can see their belongings and offer to buy them back with a trade of food. No mere peanut. They want a whole bag of crackers to leave the goods behind. The primatologists say that the monkeys have learned which items will likely bring a higher trading value, too."

This description can hardly fit anyone better than it does Frans de Waal who observed and studied primates all his career. Better still, he writes beautifully and his passion and reason both penetrate the pages of this book.Impressively, for a life-long scientist, he writes well and uses anecdotes as well as evidence to convey a story: something sorely lacking in much of the scientific writing. Mama's last hug is an emotional account of, well, emotions... those in animals as well as how they similar or different to us.De Waal is a pioneer of the study of animal emotions (which he distinguishes vigorously throughout the book from feelings) which they express and that make them behave in certain ways. Those who are too hung on human exceptionalism and an anthropocentric view of the world might find it unsettling.But he uses his sceince and experience to call for a more ethical approach to our fellow animals, not only primates, but all of them who are, as he ascerts, conscious and self-aware. This couples well with the work of Peter Singer on Animal Liberation, one comes to it from the side of science although de Waal certainly doesn't go as far in his ethical conclusions on personhood for example, and the other approaches it from a philosophical lens. Both are worth reading."

The author delivers a wonderful and convincing document revealing the rich emotional life of animals, especially in the primates he has studied closely for over thirty years. He makes poignantly the point that for too long, it has been declared that animals do not have emotions: they do not experience pain, fear, disgust, joy etc. Now, fortunately, research into the emotions of animals is ongoing and expanding. He gives a voice to animals that makes it extremely difficult for any human to deny that they experience emotions, noting that it may perhaps only be the fact that they cannot speak for themselves that has enabled this denial for so long. Highly recommended. "

A little bittersweet, because it felt like a summing up of a career and possible good-bye from an amazing scientist who has contributed so much to our understanding and appreciation of the creatures we share the planet with.

38,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/932702-jodi,4,"I am an animal lover so of course when I heard about this book, I wanted to read it. I've been around too many animals to not believe that animals think, experience pain, and have emotions. My current dog, Leo is the most empathetic creative I have ever encountered - if I'm sad or upset, he gets right in my face with a look in his face that seems to be asking ""What is wrong? Are you ok, Mom?"" Sure my statement is not scientific but my dog is thinking and responding with emotion to me when he does that. My other dog Annie uses her charms and has a ""smile"" that she uses to get what she wants. Sure it is not a smile in the way a human smiles, but she knows that expression gets her what she wants and she uses it. She also gets scared and hides if there is yelling in the house - she picks up on the tension and wants to get away from it. Annie also plans and thinks ahead to get the things she wants - she has learned from experience she can get what she wants from Leo if she waits for the perfect moment. She watches him from a distance and then swoops in to grab it when he looks away for a moment. She then has her ""hiding spot"" and leaves a bewildered Leo behind. She has perfected this move down to a science so I know she is using past experience to know when to grab and knows the best hiding place in the house to stay out of reach of the humans. Leo is also 11 years old and going blind so he can't really chase her! I could go on for hours about my dogs' thinking, and feelings for a longI think I would have enjoyed being an animal researcher but it wasn't the path I followed. It was fun to read about Frans De Waal's experiences in the lab and zoos around the world. I don't really know much about bonobos but I think they are now my favorite primates - peaceful and social creatures! I like Waal's comment that humans on our bad days are as violent as chimps but on our good days are as nice and sensitive as bonobos. Pretty true!I found the grape and cucumber experiment with capuchin monkey's interesting. They were happy receiving cucumbers and didn't complain until one was given grapes. Suddenly, the other one refused to eat the cucumber which was fine just a minute ago. I see this parallel to humans - we always want what others have and become dissatisfied with what we loved until we saw something else we perceive as better. Also, his comments about working for a social aspect keeps us in check sometimes from climbing ahead too in life - we will ""share"" to keep social peace.Interesting read but only 4 stars because it was ""dry"" at time. However, this is supposed to be a scholarly book and not necessarily meant for entertainment."
39,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30202842-paul-spence,5,"We humans like to think we are something special, that we have qualities no other animal possesses. Many people believe that our emotions are among the things that make us human. Primatologist Frans De Waal used to go along with this prevailing belief, but he has spent many years studying our closest relatives, and he says “More and more I believe that all the emotions we are familiar with can be found one way or another in all mammals, and that the variation is only in the details, elaborations, applications, and intensity.” In Mama’s Last Hug he makes his case for this position, and the result is both fascinating and convincing.De Waal says that modern emotion research puts too much stress on language, and that is part of the problem. We humans don’t use language to recognize and respond to emotions of other humans in our daily lives; we observe; and DeWaal uses observation as his scientific tool to argue engagingly, but also convincingly, in favor of a rich emotional life for animals other than humans.He won me over in Chapter 1 with a description of a moving reunion between Mama, a 59-year-old chimpanzee who was on her deathbed, and 80-year-old Jan van Hooff, who had been De Waal’s dissertation advisor and who had worked with Mama for many years. If you are skeptical of De Waal’s description, the reunion video is available on YouTube, and to me there is no doubt about Mama’s genuine joy at seeing her old friend.If DeWaal’s wonderful anecdotes do not convince you, consider his credentials. How often do you read a book by an IgNobel Prize winner? For those of you not familiar with the Ig Nobel prizes, they have been awarded annually since 1991 (on the Harvard campus but not by Harvard) to ""honor achievements that first make people laugh, and then make them think."" The paper that won the Ig Nobel for De Waal was called “Faces and Behinds”, and it was a study in which his team learned that apes have a “whole-body” image of familiar individuals and could even pick out individuals they knew from pictures of that ape’s derriere. My first reaction, of course, was to laugh, but then I had to recognize that this was clever work that tells me something rather impressive about apes.I had more laughs, some more sad moments, and a lot of thoughtful moments throughout the book. Do read it; I am confident that you will come away with a greater feeling of kinship with all the creatures, great and small."
40,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"The title of this latest work on primate-human emotion and cognition comes from the final act of a matriarchal chimpanzee whom the author, Frans de Waal, had studied at great length. This initial image which was also captured in viral social media videos is a deft distillation of many of this book's main points.For much of the 20th century it was taboo among primatologists, evolutionary biologists, and psychologists to speak of, ""animal emotion,"" given that they were viewed as not capable of producing anything recognizable as such. However, as studies became more rigorous, methods became more advanced, and data was accumulated; the notion that there is some sort of barrier between what we recognize as our own cognitive function and emotional actions/representations and those of the animal kingdom began to break down, perhaps most potently in the study of our closest evolutionary cousins: chimpanzees and bonobos. The discussion here has great implication for a number of issues including that of free will, sentience, the importance or non-importance of language in emotional development, updating our notion of instinct, and most interestingly for me the genuine origins of consciousness (again, a word thrown around as if it were uniquely human by the very same people who cannot tell you in any specific sense what it is). There are some missteps here including a dismissal of the work of Paul Bloom that doesn't seem to have been based on the substance of his actual argument in the work discussed, a vast reductionist take on some work of Pinker that again doesn't actually address his point or his data, and an unnecessary but thankfully brief discussion of Rawls' Theory of Justice.This is a book with big concepts, a bold commitment to updating our understanding of previously taboo ideas, and a big heart for the primates with whom Frans de Waal has worked all his life. Beautiful reading across a variety of subjects based on a wealth of data, great stuff! "
41,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76073867-amy-clarke,2,"A surprisingly polemical book about animal emotions and how they relate to human emotions. It is clear from the beginning that Frans de Waal has a bone to pick: he wants us to understand that emotions are not unique to humans, but something shared across the animal kingdom. Whilst I agree with this argument, I grew tired of de Waal's tone towards other scientists in his field. It's very clear he is frustrated at scientists who disagree with this, and he did little to hide it.Moreover, I could really have done without him extrapolating behaviour seen in female chimps to humans. Apparently de Waal's experience observing Bonobo chimps has qualified him to come to the conclusion that Sarah Palin's attractiveness served as a disadvantage to her during the vice presidential campaign, because of the jealousy she would have aroused in women. Moreover, the reason that female heads of state tend to be older is because post-menopausal women are less of a threat to other women. I am not sure how he came to this conclusion (particularly because there is not a single citation for this section), and it also seems to ignore the fact that most male heads of state are also rather old (the two male contenders in this year's presidential election are in their 70s). Surprisingly, the book was published after Jacinda Ardern became Prime Minister of New Zealand, but I imagine including her would not have fit his narrative.Overall, I got the impression that this book should have just been a long read on a news site. The chapters blurred into one, and de Waal grew repetitive. When a non-fiction book becomes meandering, it probably means the author should have made it shorter. And in all honesty, I think reading the blurb of this book is enough."
42,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,5,"This is definitely my current frontrunner for science book of the year and possibly overall book of the year.De Waal gives us a generous mix of true biology-based social psychology and much more, with discussions on things like selfhood veering into philosophy, even.I won't do a long review, with so many others here, but just a summary of his top points:Rejects ethology as being based on old behaviorist black box ideas. Says still too prevalent in America.Differentiates between emotion (more a Humean type “passion” in his view) and feeling, as emotion sieved through filters of consciousness and updated perception.Animal emotions and feelings both largely parallel humans. Can be complex.Animals, on feelings and reactions to them, have self-control like people.Seems to believe in something like what I would call “evolutionary psychology done right,” or “the evolutionary basis of human social psychology,” versus what is called evolutionary psychology and is generally a pseudoscientific pile of crap. At one point, he totally totally skewers Steve Pinker for claiming primitives are warlike and need to learn from moderns, re his book about the decrease of violence. Also says Hobbes et al got it wrong.Related? Notes that “warfare” on anything close to what we know it as today didn’t arise until the beginning of civilization, which of course ties to the beginnings of private property and other things.Also, without being explicit, like me, seems to tie degree of emotional expressiveness ability to degree of intelligence.Rejects much of traditional ideas of ""instinct,"" at least in animals we could call sentient."
43,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7125076-rachel,5,"Amazing book! I very much liked the author's previous book Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? I liked this one even better. It is easier to read and well organized, and it makes his points effectively. The main point is yes, animals do have emotions, which appear in many cases to be similar to ours. He makes a distinction between emotions and feelings; feelings are physical sensations that are associated with emotions. Many animals, especially mammals and birds, but also ones that we think of as lesser, appear to have both. He also gives compelling evidence that animals not only have emotions, they think, plan, have motivations, and weigh choices to make decisions, all in similar ways to humans. We are animals, after all, and closely related to the primates who are prominent in the book. We do great injustices when we assume we are better than, and matter more than, other animals (and other people whom we consider inferior, but I digress).The book is arranged by the type of emotion: happiness, empathy, guilt, the drive to power, etc. Each chapter has observations of animal behavior, and studies, and theories, and history that includes theories that were once established ""wisdom"" but are now disproved. (De Waal has done, and is doing here, his part in disproving those.) The final chapters, ""Emotional Intelligence"" and ""Sentience,"" come to conclusions and ask more questions. I hope both the scientific community and the human culture come around to de Waal's point of view on the subject and start showing more concern for the well-being of animals. I look forward to seeing further advances in this field."
44,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260945-anna,3,"Mama’s Last Hug is an exploration of animal emotion by one of the world’s most recognized and experienced primatologists. While I don’t really consider myself to be an animal (read: pet) person, I started this book in the spirit of being open minded to what the author’s experience and insight could teach me about organisms incorrectly considered to be less sentient or expressive than ourselves. The book is a fitting introduction to the topic and discusses multiple kinds of primates and other species, though perhaps the author’s gentle and common sense approach to his arguments neutralizes some of the impact. In other words, while I will continue to reduce meat consumption and buy sustainable, cruelty-free products where possible, I won’t be immediately be going vegan due to a sudden hyper-empathy with other species. Still, it provides encouragement to empathize with others and promote a kinder world for those organisms with whom we can not yet directly communicate yet share precious resources and experiences.(Physical Distancing Read #6)"
45,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1915261-scott-lupo,5,"A captivating and enthralling book about the emotional lives of animals. Frans de Waal has spent nearly his entire life with chimpanzees and other great apes. His previous works have mostly focused on intelligence. This book is about emotions in animals and whether they exist and if/how they compare to the human experience of emotions. Drawing on his own experience, studies, thoughtful experiments, logic, and philosophy, de Waal brings the reader a comprehensive argument in favor of animals (mostly mammals) having emotions and possibly sentience/consciousness. Several times throughout the book he makes it clear the difference between emotions and feelings. Emotions are displays while feelings are internal. Emotions are the manifestations of feelings. In his view, it would be impossible to know for sure what an animal is feeling but we can measure their emotions and make inferences based on our own experience of those emotions. Behaviorists would balk at the notion of including emotions when studying animals, believing they are basically all automatons that act based on instincts and behavior only. De Waal does an excellent job of disabusing this notion and is persuasive in his argument that being an automaton would keep the animal from adapting to its environment and die. Yet, we know species have existed for millennia. Instead, life can only exist with emotions. It is a natural part of who we and the animal kingdom are; it is hard coded into our existence. So why study animals as if they don't have emotions? Luckily, much of the science is changing and today's scientists are much more open to the concept of animal emotions. Of course, if you are a pet owner you already know this through anecdotal experience. Now science is catching up and solidifying the notion of animal emotions. "
46,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117548223-katrien,4,"Frans de Waal is for sure an extremely enthousiast primatologue - you can almost feel his love and Passion for these close primates of ours; Which makes the book an extremely pleasant and interesting reading. According to Frans de Waal, there would be no reason at all to believe humans emotion are that much greater and richer as the ones of chimpanzees or other animals - an idea still many scientists hold on to. The lives in the animal kingdom would be as complex and thrilling as the lives of any of us. I did not agree with all the points he made - and to my mind his arguments are not always that elaborated.Nevertheless, Mama's Last Hug is a must read for anyone interested in emotions. It gives the reader an insight and an understanding of animal emotions - from jealousy to compassion. I can promise you will not look at your cat ever the same way again."
47,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/746637-sally,4,"An important book, though I got bogged down in the middle and took a long time to finish it, a problem I didn't have with the two earlier books in this ""series."" Perhaps moral behavior/selflessness and intelligence are easier to demonstrate with scientific experiments than are emotions so he felt the need to be especially thorough in his presentation, emotion by emotion. Perhaps this area is one more of his scientific colleagues are unwilling to acknowledge as shared with animals. Perhaps acknowledging that animals experience emotions as humans do would be more likely to force a reexamination of the ways we treat animals that economic players and scientific researchers, among others, would find inconvenient. 3-1/2 stars."
48,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1882501-ginny,5,"As a child, we went to the zoo often. Being one of 7 kids in our family, we could run around and act like monkeys and not get into trouble. From early on, all of us loved going to the ape and chimpanzee house where we were fascinated at how similar they were to us and would stand and watch then forever. This beautiful book explains and confirms that what we thought as children actually is true- animals are more like us than we think. Through extensive research the author tells us that we don’t have a single organ that other animals don’t have and the same is true for emotions. The book begins with the death of Mama, a chimp matriarch who formed a bond with biologist Jan van Hooff. When they meet for the last time it was captured on film. Read this book and google and watch their last hug. Loved them both."
49,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87165204-david-solis,5,"WHAT A READ. I've always been fascinated on the primal instincts that still exist in humans. Frans de Waal takes the narrative of themes like morality and instinct and draws very distinct lines yet articulates very straight-forward convergences between man and ape, and even man to other mammals. Whether it's discovering the intricacies of why we shake hands, why we reconcile, why men puff up their chests and even why criminals behave in ways they do, de Waal expertly gives example after example of mammalian instincts that exist in us which we still have ingrained in our psychologies from millennia-old reflexes and mechanisms.

I should have liked this book more than I did - a mix of animal facts, memoir-ish anecdotes from the author's career, and even quite a bit of moral philosophy. These things are all really up my alley but for some reason the writing was hard to get into. I found my brain drifting off fairly often even though the content was quite interesting. I can't put my finger on it. It really felt like a slog to finish. I would possibly try one of De Waal's other books to see if maybe it was just an editing issue, or if that's just his usual writing. When the library opens again, that is."

Here his focus is on primates and provides substantial evidence that they have feelings and emotions akin to our own. A powerful recognition of empathic behavior in many other animals as well. Proving once more that if humans could dial down our ego, we could see the world as ever more fascinating than previously thought."

From why we, humas, wave our hand as a greeting to how animals are actually aware of the future. I took my time reading it enjoying every last page and will definitely go back to re-read.Frans de Waal captures fussy readers. I don't enjoy books that are filled with theory and dry numbers and thankfully this book is not that at all. He shares description of studies and experiments in a very approachable language. He even added his own drawings to make it easier to imagine.The chapter on animal sentinence was the highlight of the book. There is a silence surrounding animal emotions and motivation of animal behavior in the scientific world and the reasons are shocking yet very in line with the nature of humans.5/5, incredible read"

57,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94750490-charlotte,2,"When de Waal sticks to what he knows as a primatologist and psychologist he has some excellent insights on animal emotions and how even today humans try to deny their existence in animals. The chapter on sentience in particular is eye opening. However, when de Waal ventures into sociology and other fields he is way off the mark. He makes some odd, and frankly, sexist comments about women and treats them as if they are facts rather than opinions. If you can get past this, it's worth a read."

We humans don’t use language to recognize and respond to emotions of other humans in our daily lives; we observe; and DeWaal uses observation as his scientific tool to argue engagingly, but also convincingly, in favor of a rich emotional life for animals other than humans.He won me over in Chapter 1 with a description of a moving reunion between Mama, a 59-year-old chimpanzee who was on her deathbed, and 80-year-old Jan van Hooff, who had been De Waal’s dissertation advisor and who had worked with Mama for many years. If you are skeptical of De Waal’s description, the reunion video is available on YouTube, and to me there is no doubt about Mama’s genuine joy at seeing her old friend.If DeWaal’s wonderful anecdotes do not convince you, consider his credentials. How often do you read a book by an IgNobel Prize winner? For those of you not familiar with the Ig Nobel prizes, they have been awarded annually since 1991 (on the Harvard campus but not by Harvard) to ""honor achievements that first make people laugh, and then make them think."" The paper that won the Ig Nobel for De Waal was called “Faces and Behinds”, and it was a study in which his team learned that apes have a “whole-body” image of familiar individuals and could even pick out individuals they knew from pictures of that ape’s derriere. My first reaction, of course, was to laugh, but then I had to recognize that this was clever work that tells me something rather impressive about apes.I had more laughs, some more sad moments, and a lot of thoughtful moments throughout the book. Do read it; I am confident that you will come away with a greater feeling of kinship with all the creatures, great and small."

This initial image which was also captured in viral social media videos is a deft distillation of many of this book's main points.For much of the 20th century it was taboo among primatologists, evolutionary biologists, and psychologists to speak of, ""animal emotion,"" given that they were viewed as not capable of producing anything recognizable as such. However, as studies became more rigorous, methods became more advanced, and data was accumulated; the notion that there is some sort of barrier between what we recognize as our own cognitive function and emotional actions/representations and those of the animal kingdom began to break down, perhaps most potently in the study of our closest evolutionary cousins: chimpanzees and bonobos. The discussion here has great implication for a number of issues including that of free will, sentience, the importance or non-importance of language in emotional development, updating our notion of instinct, and most interestingly for me the genuine origins of consciousness (again, a word thrown around as if it were uniquely human by the very same people who cannot tell you in any specific sense what it is). There are some missteps here including a dismissal of the work of Paul Bloom that doesn't seem to have been based on the substance of his actual argument in the work discussed, a vast reductionist take on some work of Pinker that again doesn't actually address his point or his data, and an unnecessary but thankfully brief discussion of Rawls' Theory of Justice.This is a book with big concepts, a bold commitment to updating our understanding of previously taboo ideas, and a big heart for the primates with whom Frans de Waal has worked all his life.

71,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76073867-amy-clarke,2,"A surprisingly polemical book about animal emotions and how they relate to human emotions. It is clear from the beginning that Frans de Waal has a bone to pick: he wants us to understand that emotions are not unique to humans, but something shared across the animal kingdom. Whilst I agree with this argument, I grew tired of de Waal's tone towards other scientists in his field. It's very clear he is frustrated at scientists who disagree with this, and he did little to hide it.Moreover, I could really have done without him extrapolating behaviour seen in female chimps to humans. Apparently de Waal's experience observing Bonobo chimps has qualified him to come to the conclusion that Sarah Palin's attractiveness served as a disadvantage to her during the vice presidential campaign, because of the jealousy she would have aroused in women. Moreover, the reason that female heads of state tend to be older is because post-menopausal women are less of a threat to other women. I am not sure how he came to this conclusion (particularly because there is not a single citation for this section), and it also seems to ignore the fact that most male heads of state are also rather old (the two male contenders in this year's presidential election are in their 70s). Surprisingly, the book was published after Jacinda Ardern became Prime Minister of New Zealand, but I imagine including her would not have fit his narrative.Overall, I got the impression that this book should have just been a long read on a news site. The chapters blurred into one, and de Waal grew repetitive. When a non-fiction book becomes meandering, it probably means the author should have made it shorter. And in all honesty, I think reading the blurb of this book is enough."
72,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,5,"This is definitely my current frontrunner for science book of the year and possibly overall book of the year.De Waal gives us a generous mix of true biology-based social psychology and much more, with discussions on things like selfhood veering into philosophy, even.I won't do a long review, with so many others here, but just a summary of his top points:Rejects ethology as being based on old behaviorist black box ideas. Says still too prevalent in America.Differentiates between emotion (more a Humean type “passion” in his view) and feeling, as emotion sieved through filters of consciousness and updated perception.Animal emotions and feelings both largely parallel humans. Can be complex.Animals, on feelings and reactions to them, have self-control like people.Seems to believe in something like what I would call “evolutionary psychology done right,” or “the evolutionary basis of human social psychology,” versus what is called evolutionary psychology and is generally a pseudoscientific pile of crap. At one point, he totally totally skewers Steve Pinker for claiming primitives are warlike and need to learn from moderns, re his book about the decrease of violence. Also says Hobbes et al got it wrong.Related? Notes that “warfare” on anything close to what we know it as today didn’t arise until the beginning of civilization, which of course ties to the beginnings of private property and other things.Also, without being explicit, like me, seems to tie degree of emotional expressiveness ability to degree of intelligence.Rejects much of traditional ideas of ""instinct,"" at least in animals we could call sentient."
73,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7125076-rachel,5,"Amazing book! I very much liked the author's previous book Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? I liked this one even better. It is easier to read and well organized, and it makes his points effectively. The main point is yes, animals do have emotions, which appear in many cases to be similar to ours. He makes a distinction between emotions and feelings; feelings are physical sensations that are associated with emotions. Many animals, especially mammals and birds, but also ones that we think of as lesser, appear to have both. He also gives compelling evidence that animals not only have emotions, they think, plan, have motivations, and weigh choices to make decisions, all in similar ways to humans. We are animals, after all, and closely related to the primates who are prominent in the book. We do great injustices when we assume we are better than, and matter more than, other animals (and other people whom we consider inferior, but I digress).The book is arranged by the type of emotion: happiness, empathy, guilt, the drive to power, etc. Each chapter has observations of animal behavior, and studies, and theories, and history that includes theories that were once established ""wisdom"" but are now disproved. (De Waal has done, and is doing here, his part in disproving those.) The final chapters, ""Emotional Intelligence"" and ""Sentience,"" come to conclusions and ask more questions. I hope both the scientific community and the human culture come around to de Waal's point of view on the subject and start showing more concern for the well-being of animals. I look forward to seeing further advances in this field."
74,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260945-anna,3,"Mama’s Last Hug is an exploration of animal emotion by one of the world’s most recognized and experienced primatologists. While I don’t really consider myself to be an animal (read: pet) person, I started this book in the spirit of being open minded to what the author’s experience and insight could teach me about organisms incorrectly considered to be less sentient or expressive than ourselves. The book is a fitting introduction to the topic and discusses multiple kinds of primates and other species, though perhaps the author’s gentle and common sense approach to his arguments neutralizes some of the impact. In other words, while I will continue to reduce meat consumption and buy sustainable, cruelty-free products where possible, I won’t be immediately be going vegan due to a sudden hyper-empathy with other species. Still, it provides encouragement to empathize with others and promote a kinder world for those organisms with whom we can not yet directly communicate yet share precious resources and experiences.(Physical Distancing Read #6)"
75,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1915261-scott-lupo,5,"A captivating and enthralling book about the emotional lives of animals. Frans de Waal has spent nearly his entire life with chimpanzees and other great apes. His previous works have mostly focused on intelligence. This book is about emotions in animals and whether they exist and if/how they compare to the human experience of emotions. Drawing on his own experience, studies, thoughtful experiments, logic, and philosophy, de Waal brings the reader a comprehensive argument in favor of animals (mostly mammals) having emotions and possibly sentience/consciousness. Several times throughout the book he makes it clear the difference between emotions and feelings. Emotions are displays while feelings are internal. Emotions are the manifestations of feelings. In his view, it would be impossible to know for sure what an animal is feeling but we can measure their emotions and make inferences based on our own experience of those emotions. Behaviorists would balk at the notion of including emotions when studying animals, believing they are basically all automatons that act based on instincts and behavior only. De Waal does an excellent job of disabusing this notion and is persuasive in his argument that being an automaton would keep the animal from adapting to its environment and die. Yet, we know species have existed for millennia. Instead, life can only exist with emotions. It is a natural part of who we and the animal kingdom are; it is hard coded into our existence. So why study animals as if they don't have emotions? Luckily, much of the science is changing and today's scientists are much more open to the concept of animal emotions. Of course, if you are a pet owner you already know this through anecdotal experience. Now science is catching up and solidifying the notion of animal emotions. "
76,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117548223-katrien,4,"Frans de Waal is for sure an extremely enthousiast primatologue - you can almost feel his love and Passion for these close primates of ours; Which makes the book an extremely pleasant and interesting reading. According to Frans de Waal, there would be no reason at all to believe humans emotion are that much greater and richer as the ones of chimpanzees or other animals - an idea still many scientists hold on to. The lives in the animal kingdom would be as complex and thrilling as the lives of any of us. I did not agree with all the points he made - and to my mind his arguments are not always that elaborated.Nevertheless, Mama's Last Hug is a must read for anyone interested in emotions. It gives the reader an insight and an understanding of animal emotions - from jealousy to compassion. I can promise you will not look at your cat ever the same way again."
77,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/746637-sally,4,"An important book, though I got bogged down in the middle and took a long time to finish it, a problem I didn't have with the two earlier books in this ""series."" Perhaps moral behavior/selflessness and intelligence are easier to demonstrate with scientific experiments than are emotions so he felt the need to be especially thorough in his presentation, emotion by emotion. Perhaps this area is one more of his scientific colleagues are unwilling to acknowledge as shared with animals. Perhaps acknowledging that animals experience emotions as humans do would be more likely to force a reexamination of the ways we treat animals that economic players and scientific researchers, among others, would find inconvenient. 3-1/2 stars."
78,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1882501-ginny,5,"As a child, we went to the zoo often. Being one of 7 kids in our family, we could run around and act like monkeys and not get into trouble. From early on, all of us loved going to the ape and chimpanzee house where we were fascinated at how similar they were to us and would stand and watch then forever. This beautiful book explains and confirms that what we thought as children actually is true- animals are more like us than we think. Through extensive research the author tells us that we don’t have a single organ that other animals don’t have and the same is true for emotions. The book begins with the death of Mama, a chimp matriarch who formed a bond with biologist Jan van Hooff. When they meet for the last time it was captured on film. Read this book and google and watch their last hug. Loved them both."

Frans de Waal takes the narrative of themes like morality and instinct and draws very distinct lines yet articulates very straight-forward convergences between man and ape, and even man to other mammals. Whether it's discovering the intricacies of why we shake hands, why we reconcile, why men puff up their chests and even why criminals behave in ways they do, de Waal expertly gives example after example of mammalian instincts that exist in us which we still have ingrained in our psychologies from millennia-old reflexes and mechanisms.

I should have liked this book more than I did - a mix of animal facts, memoir-ish anecdotes from the author's career, and even quite a bit of moral philosophy. These things are all really up my alley but for some reason the writing was hard to get into. I found my brain drifting off fairly often even though the content was quite interesting. I can't put my finger on it. It really felt like a slog to finish. I would possibly try one of De Waal's other books to see if maybe it was just an editing issue, or if that's just his usual writing. When the library opens again, that is."

Here his focus is on primates and provides substantial evidence that they have feelings and emotions akin to our own. A powerful recognition of empathic behavior in many other animals as well. Proving once more that if humans could dial down our ego, we could see the world as ever more fascinating than previously thought."

From why we, humas, wave our hand as a greeting to how animals are actually aware of the future. I took my time reading it enjoying every last page and will definitely go back to re-read.Frans de Waal captures fussy readers. I don't enjoy books that are filled with theory and dry numbers and thankfully this book is not that at all. He shares description of studies and experiments in a very approachable language. He even added his own drawings to make it easier to imagine.The chapter on animal sentinence was the highlight of the book. There is a silence surrounding animal emotions and motivation of animal behavior in the scientific world and the reasons are shocking yet very in line with the nature of humans.5/5, incredible read"

The anecdotes and relative research were endearing, but I was turned off by the oversimplification of human behavior/emotions regarding sex and gender. I found the chapters on discomforts (4) and politics (5) particularly interesting. These chapters saved my review from being only 3 stars."

This book is a wake up call for anyone who still believes that animals have more differences than similarities with us humans. Chapter by chapter, de Waal dismisses the myths and the set backs that that science community has had in admitting to animal's capacity to emote. "

Some of it was over my head and a bit dry but at the same time I think it is very readable for a lay person. There are some really sad and horrific stories so the sensitive reader beware. I have always felt that animals have emotions so this was preaching to the choir.What I did not appreciate was the specter of Trump appearing in chapter 5, it's about politics. yuck "
87,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94750490-charlotte,2,"When de Waal sticks to what he knows as a primatologist and psychologist he has some excellent insights on animal emotions and how even today humans try to deny their existence in animals. The chapter on sentience in particular is eye opening. However, when de Waal ventures into sociology and other fields he is way off the mark. He makes some odd, and frankly, sexist comments about women and treats them as if they are facts rather than opinions. If you can get past this, it's worth a read."

The author delivers a wonderful and convincing document revealing the rich emotional life of animals, especially in the primates he has studied closely for over thirty years. He makes poignantly the point that for too long, it has been declared that animals do not have emotions: they do not experience pain, fear, disgust, joy etc. Now, fortunately, research into the emotions of animals is ongoing and expanding. He gives a voice to animals that makes it extremely difficult for any human to deny that they experience emotions, noting that it may perhaps only be the fact that they cannot speak for themselves that has enabled this denial for so long. Highly recommended. "

I've been around too many animals to not believe that animals think, experience pain, and have emotions. My current dog, Leo is the most empathetic creative I have ever encountered - if I'm sad or upset, he gets right in my face with a look in his face that seems to be asking ""What is wrong? Are you ok, Mom?"" Sure my statement is not scientific but my dog is thinking and responding with emotion to me when he does that. My other dog Annie uses her charms and has a ""smile"" that she uses to get what she wants. Sure it is not a smile in the way a human smiles, but she knows that expression gets her what she wants and she uses it. She also gets scared and hides if there is yelling in the house - she picks up on the tension and wants to get away from it. Annie also plans and thinks ahead to get the things she wants - she has learned from experience she can get what she wants from Leo if she waits for the perfect moment. She watches him from a distance and then swoops in to grab it when he looks away for a moment. She then has her ""hiding spot"" and leaves a bewildered Leo behind. She has perfected this move down to a science so I know she is using past experience to know when to grab and knows the best hiding place in the house to stay out of reach of the humans. Leo is also 11 years old and going blind so he can't really chase her! I could go on for hours about my dogs' thinking, and feelings for a longI think I would have enjoyed being an animal researcher but it wasn't the path I followed. It was fun to read about Frans De Waal's experiences in the lab and zoos around the world. I don't really know much about bonobos but I think they are now my favorite primates - peaceful and social creatures! I like Waal's comment that humans on our bad days are as violent as chimps but on our good days are as nice and sensitive as bonobos. Pretty true!I found the grape and cucumber experiment with capuchin monkey's interesting. They were happy receiving cucumbers and didn't complain until one was given grapes. Suddenly, the other one refused to eat the cucumber which was fine just a minute ago. I see this parallel to humans - we always want what others have and become dissatisfied with what we loved until we saw something else we perceive as better. Also, his comments about working for a social aspect keeps us in check sometimes from climbing ahead too in life - we will ""share"" to keep social peace.Interesting read but only 4 stars because it was ""dry"" at time.

At one point, he totally totally skewers Steve Pinker for claiming primitives are warlike and need to learn from moderns, re his book about the decrease of violence. Also says Hobbes et al got it wrong.Related? Notes that “warfare” on anything close to what we know it as today didn’t arise until the beginning of civilization, which of course ties to the beginnings of private property and other things.Also, without being explicit, like me, seems to tie degree of emotional expressiveness ability to degree of intelligence.Rejects much of traditional ideas of ""instinct,"" at least in animals we could call sentient."

I liked this one even better. It is easier to read and well organized, and it makes his points effectively. The main point is yes, animals do have emotions, which appear in many cases to be similar to ours. He makes a distinction between emotions and feelings; feelings are physical sensations that are associated with emotions. Many animals, especially mammals and birds, but also ones that we think of as lesser, appear to have both. He also gives compelling evidence that animals not only have emotions, they think, plan, have motivations, and weigh choices to make decisions, all in similar ways to humans. We are animals, after all, and closely related to the primates who are prominent in the book. We do great injustices when we assume we are better than, and matter more than, other animals (and other people whom we consider inferior, but I digress).The book is arranged by the type of emotion: happiness, empathy, guilt, the drive to power, etc. Each chapter has observations of animal behavior, and studies, and theories, and history that includes theories that were once established ""wisdom"" but are now disproved. (De Waal has done, and is doing here, his part in disproving those.) The final chapters, ""Emotional Intelligence"" and ""Sentience,"" come to conclusions and ask more questions. I hope both the scientific community and the human culture come around to de Waal's point of view on the subject and start showing more concern for the well-being of animals. I look forward to seeing further advances in this field."

While I don’t really consider myself to be an animal (read: pet) person, I started this book in the spirit of being open minded to what the author’s experience and insight could teach me about organisms incorrectly considered to be less sentient or expressive than ourselves. The book is a fitting introduction to the topic and discusses multiple kinds of primates and other species, though perhaps the author’s gentle and common sense approach to his arguments neutralizes some of the impact. In other words, while I will continue to reduce meat consumption and buy sustainable, cruelty-free products where possible, I won’t be immediately be going vegan due to a sudden hyper-empathy with other species. Still, it provides encouragement to empathize with others and promote a kinder world for those organisms with whom we can not yet directly communicate yet share precious resources and experiences.(Physical Distancing Read #6)"
105,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1915261-scott-lupo,5,"A captivating and enthralling book about the emotional lives of animals. Frans de Waal has spent nearly his entire life with chimpanzees and other great apes. His previous works have mostly focused on intelligence. This book is about emotions in animals and whether they exist and if/how they compare to the human experience of emotions. Drawing on his own experience, studies, thoughtful experiments, logic, and philosophy, de Waal brings the reader a comprehensive argument in favor of animals (mostly mammals) having emotions and possibly sentience/consciousness. Several times throughout the book he makes it clear the difference between emotions and feelings. Emotions are displays while feelings are internal. Emotions are the manifestations of feelings. In his view, it would be impossible to know for sure what an animal is feeling but we can measure their emotions and make inferences based on our own experience of those emotions. Behaviorists would balk at the notion of including emotions when studying animals, believing they are basically all automatons that act based on instincts and behavior only. De Waal does an excellent job of disabusing this notion and is persuasive in his argument that being an automaton would keep the animal from adapting to its environment and die. Yet, we know species have existed for millennia. Instead, life can only exist with emotions. It is a natural part of who we and the animal kingdom are; it is hard coded into our existence. So why study animals as if they don't have emotions? Luckily, much of the science is changing and today's scientists are much more open to the concept of animal emotions. Of course, if you are a pet owner you already know this through anecdotal experience. Now science is catching up and solidifying the notion of animal emotions. "
106,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117548223-katrien,4,"Frans de Waal is for sure an extremely enthousiast primatologue - you can almost feel his love and Passion for these close primates of ours; Which makes the book an extremely pleasant and interesting reading. According to Frans de Waal, there would be no reason at all to believe humans emotion are that much greater and richer as the ones of chimpanzees or other animals - an idea still many scientists hold on to. The lives in the animal kingdom would be as complex and thrilling as the lives of any of us. I did not agree with all the points he made - and to my mind his arguments are not always that elaborated.Nevertheless, Mama's Last Hug is a must read for anyone interested in emotions. It gives the reader an insight and an understanding of animal emotions - from jealousy to compassion. I can promise you will not look at your cat ever the same way again."
107,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/746637-sally,4,"An important book, though I got bogged down in the middle and took a long time to finish it, a problem I didn't have with the two earlier books in this ""series."" Perhaps moral behavior/selflessness and intelligence are easier to demonstrate with scientific experiments than are emotions so he felt the need to be especially thorough in his presentation, emotion by emotion. Perhaps this area is one more of his scientific colleagues are unwilling to acknowledge as shared with animals. Perhaps acknowledging that animals experience emotions as humans do would be more likely to force a reexamination of the ways we treat animals that economic players and scientific researchers, among others, would find inconvenient. 3-1/2 stars."

Being one of 7 kids in our family, we could run around and act like monkeys and not get into trouble. From early on, all of us loved going to the ape and chimpanzee house where we were fascinated at how similar they were to us and would stand and watch then forever. This beautiful book explains and confirms that what we thought as children actually is true- animals are more like us than we think. Through extensive research the author tells us that we don’t have a single organ that other animals don’t have and the same is true for emotions. The book begins with the death of Mama, a chimp matriarch who formed a bond with biologist Jan van Hooff. When they meet for the last time it was captured on film. Read this book and google and watch their last hug. Loved them both."

Frans de Waal takes the narrative of themes like morality and instinct and draws very distinct lines yet articulates very straight-forward convergences between man and ape, and even man to other mammals. Whether it's discovering the intricacies of why we shake hands, why we reconcile, why men puff up their chests and even why criminals behave in ways they do, de Waal expertly gives example after example of mammalian instincts that exist in us which we still have ingrained in our psychologies from millennia-old reflexes and mechanisms.

I should have liked this book more than I did - a mix of animal facts, memoir-ish anecdotes from the author's career, and even quite a bit of moral philosophy. These things are all really up my alley but for some reason the writing was hard to get into. I found my brain drifting off fairly often even though the content was quite interesting. I can't put my finger on it. It really felt like a slog to finish. I would possibly try one of De Waal's other books to see if maybe it was just an editing issue, or if that's just his usual writing. When the library opens again, that is."

From why we, humas, wave our hand as a greeting to how animals are actually aware of the future. I took my time reading it enjoying every last page and will definitely go back to re-read.Frans de Waal captures fussy readers. I don't enjoy books that are filled with theory and dry numbers and thankfully this book is not that at all. He shares description of studies and experiments in a very approachable language. He even added his own drawings to make it easier to imagine.The chapter on animal sentinence was the highlight of the book. There is a silence surrounding animal emotions and motivation of animal behavior in the scientific world and the reasons are shocking yet very in line with the nature of humans.5/5, incredible read"

This book is a wake up call for anyone who still believes that animals have more differences than similarities with us humans. Chapter by chapter, de Waal dismisses the myths and the set backs that that science community has had in admitting to animal's capacity to emote. "

Some of it was over my head and a bit dry but at the same time I think it is very readable for a lay person. There are some really sad and horrific stories so the sensitive reader beware. I have always felt that animals have emotions so this was preaching to the choir.What I did not appreciate was the specter of Trump appearing in chapter 5, it's about politics. yuck "
117,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94750490-charlotte,2,"When de Waal sticks to what he knows as a primatologist and psychologist he has some excellent insights on animal emotions and how even today humans try to deny their existence in animals. The chapter on sentience in particular is eye opening. However, when de Waal ventures into sociology and other fields he is way off the mark. He makes some odd, and frankly, sexist comments about women and treats them as if they are facts rather than opinions. If you can get past this, it's worth a read."

The author delivers a wonderful and convincing document revealing the rich emotional life of animals, especially in the primates he has studied closely for over thirty years. He makes poignantly the point that for too long, it has been declared that animals do not have emotions: they do not experience pain, fear, disgust, joy etc. Now, fortunately, research into the emotions of animals is ongoing and expanding. He gives a voice to animals that makes it extremely difficult for any human to deny that they experience emotions, noting that it may perhaps only be the fact that they cannot speak for themselves that has enabled this denial for so long. Highly recommended. "

A little bittersweet, because it felt like a summing up of a career and possible good-bye from an amazing scientist who has contributed so much to our understanding and appreciation of the creatures we share the planet with.

I've been around too many animals to not believe that animals think, experience pain, and have emotions. My current dog, Leo is the most empathetic creative I have ever encountered - if I'm sad or upset, he gets right in my face with a look in his face that seems to be asking ""What is wrong? Are you ok, Mom?"" Sure my statement is not scientific but my dog is thinking and responding with emotion to me when he does that. My other dog Annie uses her charms and has a ""smile"" that she uses to get what she wants. Sure it is not a smile in the way a human smiles, but she knows that expression gets her what she wants and she uses it. She also gets scared and hides if there is yelling in the house - she picks up on the tension and wants to get away from it. Annie also plans and thinks ahead to get the things she wants - she has learned from experience she can get what she wants from Leo if she waits for the perfect moment. She watches him from a distance and then swoops in to grab it when he looks away for a moment. She then has her ""hiding spot"" and leaves a bewildered Leo behind. She has perfected this move down to a science so I know she is using past experience to know when to grab and knows the best hiding place in the house to stay out of reach of the humans. Leo is also 11 years old and going blind so he can't really chase her! I could go on for hours about my dogs' thinking, and feelings for a longI think I would have enjoyed being an animal researcher but it wasn't the path I followed. It was fun to read about Frans De Waal's experiences in the lab and zoos around the world. I don't really know much about bonobos but I think they are now my favorite primates - peaceful and social creatures! I like Waal's comment that humans on our bad days are as violent as chimps but on our good days are as nice and sensitive as bonobos. Pretty true!I found the grape and cucumber experiment with capuchin monkey's interesting. They were happy receiving cucumbers and didn't complain until one was given grapes. Suddenly, the other one refused to eat the cucumber which was fine just a minute ago. I see this parallel to humans - we always want what others have and become dissatisfied with what we loved until we saw something else we perceive as better. Also, his comments about working for a social aspect keeps us in check sometimes from climbing ahead too in life - we will ""share"" to keep social peace.Interesting read but only 4 stars because it was ""dry"" at time. However, this is supposed to be a scholarly book and not necessarily meant for entertainment."
129,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30202842-paul-spence,5,"We humans like to think we are something special, that we have qualities no other animal possesses. Many people believe that our emotions are among the things that make us human. Primatologist Frans De Waal used to go along with this prevailing belief, but he has spent many years studying our closest relatives, and he says “More and more I believe that all the emotions we are familiar with can be found one way or another in all mammals, and that the variation is only in the details, elaborations, applications, and intensity.” In Mama’s Last Hug he makes his case for this position, and the result is both fascinating and convincing.De Waal says that modern emotion research puts too much stress on language, and that is part of the problem. We humans don’t use language to recognize and respond to emotions of other humans in our daily lives; we observe; and DeWaal uses observation as his scientific tool to argue engagingly, but also convincingly, in favor of a rich emotional life for animals other than humans.He won me over in Chapter 1 with a description of a moving reunion between Mama, a 59-year-old chimpanzee who was on her deathbed, and 80-year-old Jan van Hooff, who had been De Waal’s dissertation advisor and who had worked with Mama for many years. If you are skeptical of De Waal’s description, the reunion video is available on YouTube, and to me there is no doubt about Mama’s genuine joy at seeing her old friend.If DeWaal’s wonderful anecdotes do not convince you, consider his credentials. How often do you read a book by an IgNobel Prize winner? For those of you not familiar with the Ig Nobel prizes, they have been awarded annually since 1991 (on the Harvard campus but not by Harvard) to ""honor achievements that first make people laugh, and then make them think."" The paper that won the Ig Nobel for De Waal was called “Faces and Behinds”, and it was a study in which his team learned that apes have a “whole-body” image of familiar individuals and could even pick out individuals they knew from pictures of that ape’s derriere. My first reaction, of course, was to laugh, but then I had to recognize that this was clever work that tells me something rather impressive about apes.I had more laughs, some more sad moments, and a lot of thoughtful moments throughout the book. Do read it; I am confident that you will come away with a greater feeling of kinship with all the creatures, great and small."
130,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"The title of this latest work on primate-human emotion and cognition comes from the final act of a matriarchal chimpanzee whom the author, Frans de Waal, had studied at great length. This initial image which was also captured in viral social media videos is a deft distillation of many of this book's main points.For much of the 20th century it was taboo among primatologists, evolutionary biologists, and psychologists to speak of, ""animal emotion,"" given that they were viewed as not capable of producing anything recognizable as such. However, as studies became more rigorous, methods became more advanced, and data was accumulated; the notion that there is some sort of barrier between what we recognize as our own cognitive function and emotional actions/representations and those of the animal kingdom began to break down, perhaps most potently in the study of our closest evolutionary cousins: chimpanzees and bonobos. The discussion here has great implication for a number of issues including that of free will, sentience, the importance or non-importance of language in emotional development, updating our notion of instinct, and most interestingly for me the genuine origins of consciousness (again, a word thrown around as if it were uniquely human by the very same people who cannot tell you in any specific sense what it is). There are some missteps here including a dismissal of the work of Paul Bloom that doesn't seem to have been based on the substance of his actual argument in the work discussed, a vast reductionist take on some work of Pinker that again doesn't actually address his point or his data, and an unnecessary but thankfully brief discussion of Rawls' Theory of Justice.This is a book with big concepts, a bold commitment to updating our understanding of previously taboo ideas, and a big heart for the primates with whom Frans de Waal has worked all his life. Beautiful reading across a variety of subjects based on a wealth of data, great stuff! "
131,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76073867-amy-clarke,2,"A surprisingly polemical book about animal emotions and how they relate to human emotions. It is clear from the beginning that Frans de Waal has a bone to pick: he wants us to understand that emotions are not unique to humans, but something shared across the animal kingdom. Whilst I agree with this argument, I grew tired of de Waal's tone towards other scientists in his field. It's very clear he is frustrated at scientists who disagree with this, and he did little to hide it.Moreover, I could really have done without him extrapolating behaviour seen in female chimps to humans. Apparently de Waal's experience observing Bonobo chimps has qualified him to come to the conclusion that Sarah Palin's attractiveness served as a disadvantage to her during the vice presidential campaign, because of the jealousy she would have aroused in women. Moreover, the reason that female heads of state tend to be older is because post-menopausal women are less of a threat to other women. I am not sure how he came to this conclusion (particularly because there is not a single citation for this section), and it also seems to ignore the fact that most male heads of state are also rather old (the two male contenders in this year's presidential election are in their 70s). Surprisingly, the book was published after Jacinda Ardern became Prime Minister of New Zealand, but I imagine including her would not have fit his narrative.Overall, I got the impression that this book should have just been a long read on a news site. The chapters blurred into one, and de Waal grew repetitive. When a non-fiction book becomes meandering, it probably means the author should have made it shorter. And in all honesty, I think reading the blurb of this book is enough."

Frans de Waal has spent nearly his entire life with chimpanzees and other great apes. His previous works have mostly focused on intelligence. This book is about emotions in animals and whether they exist and if/how they compare to the human experience of emotions. Drawing on his own experience, studies, thoughtful experiments, logic, and philosophy, de Waal brings the reader a comprehensive argument in favor of animals (mostly mammals) having emotions and possibly sentience/consciousness. Several times throughout the book he makes it clear the difference between emotions and feelings. Emotions are displays while feelings are internal. Emotions are the manifestations of feelings. In his view, it would be impossible to know for sure what an animal is feeling but we can measure their emotions and make inferences based on our own experience of those emotions. Behaviorists would balk at the notion of including emotions when studying animals, believing they are basically all automatons that act based on instincts and behavior only. De Waal does an excellent job of disabusing this notion and is persuasive in his argument that being an automaton would keep the animal from adapting to its environment and die. Yet, we know species have existed for millennia. Instead, life can only exist with emotions. It is a natural part of who we and the animal kingdom are; it is hard coded into our existence. So why study animals as if they don't have emotions? Luckily, much of the science is changing and today's scientists are much more open to the concept of animal emotions. Of course, if you are a pet owner you already know this through anecdotal experience. Now science is catching up and solidifying the notion of animal emotions. "

According to Frans de Waal, there would be no reason at all to believe humans emotion are that much greater and richer as the ones of chimpanzees or other animals - an idea still many scientists hold on to. The lives in the animal kingdom would be as complex and thrilling as the lives of any of us. I did not agree with all the points he made - and to my mind his arguments are not always that elaborated.Nevertheless, Mama's Last Hug is a must read for anyone interested in emotions.

Perhaps this area is one more of his scientific colleagues are unwilling to acknowledge as shared with animals.

From why we, humas, wave our hand as a greeting to how animals are actually aware of the future. I took my time reading it enjoying every last page and will definitely go back to re-read.Frans de Waal captures fussy readers. I don't enjoy books that are filled with theory and dry numbers and thankfully this book is not that at all. He shares description of studies and experiments in a very approachable language. He even added his own drawings to make it easier to imagine.The chapter on animal sentinence was the highlight of the book. There is a silence surrounding animal emotions and motivation of animal behavior in the scientific world and the reasons are shocking yet very in line with the nature of humans.5/5, incredible read"

Some of it was over my head and a bit dry but at the same time I think it is very readable for a lay person. There are some really sad and horrific stories so the sensitive reader beware.

The chapter on sentience in particular is eye opening. However, when de Waal ventures into sociology and other fields he is way off the mark. He makes some odd, and frankly, sexist comments about women and treats them as if they are facts rather than opinions. If you can get past this, it's worth a read."

The author delivers a wonderful and convincing document revealing the rich emotional life of animals, especially in the primates he has studied closely for over thirty years. He makes poignantly the point that for too long, it has been declared that animals do not have emotions: they do not experience pain, fear, disgust, joy etc. Now, fortunately, research into the emotions of animals is ongoing and expanding. He gives a voice to animals that makes it extremely difficult for any human to deny that they experience emotions, noting that it may perhaps only be the fact that they cannot speak for themselves that has enabled this denial for so long. Highly recommended. "

A little bittersweet, because it felt like a summing up of a career and possible good-bye from an amazing scientist who has contributed so much to our understanding and appreciation of the creatures we share the planet with.

158,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/932702-jodi,4,"I am an animal lover so of course when I heard about this book, I wanted to read it. I've been around too many animals to not believe that animals think, experience pain, and have emotions. My current dog, Leo is the most empathetic creative I have ever encountered - if I'm sad or upset, he gets right in my face with a look in his face that seems to be asking ""What is wrong? Are you ok, Mom?"" Sure my statement is not scientific but my dog is thinking and responding with emotion to me when he does that. My other dog Annie uses her charms and has a ""smile"" that she uses to get what she wants. Sure it is not a smile in the way a human smiles, but she knows that expression gets her what she wants and she uses it. She also gets scared and hides if there is yelling in the house - she picks up on the tension and wants to get away from it. Annie also plans and thinks ahead to get the things she wants - she has learned from experience she can get what she wants from Leo if she waits for the perfect moment. She watches him from a distance and then swoops in to grab it when he looks away for a moment. She then has her ""hiding spot"" and leaves a bewildered Leo behind. She has perfected this move down to a science so I know she is using past experience to know when to grab and knows the best hiding place in the house to stay out of reach of the humans. Leo is also 11 years old and going blind so he can't really chase her! I could go on for hours about my dogs' thinking, and feelings for a longI think I would have enjoyed being an animal researcher but it wasn't the path I followed. It was fun to read about Frans De Waal's experiences in the lab and zoos around the world. I don't really know much about bonobos but I think they are now my favorite primates - peaceful and social creatures! I like Waal's comment that humans on our bad days are as violent as chimps but on our good days are as nice and sensitive as bonobos. Pretty true!I found the grape and cucumber experiment with capuchin monkey's interesting. They were happy receiving cucumbers and didn't complain until one was given grapes. Suddenly, the other one refused to eat the cucumber which was fine just a minute ago. I see this parallel to humans - we always want what others have and become dissatisfied with what we loved until we saw something else we perceive as better. Also, his comments about working for a social aspect keeps us in check sometimes from climbing ahead too in life - we will ""share"" to keep social peace.Interesting read but only 4 stars because it was ""dry"" at time. However, this is supposed to be a scholarly book and not necessarily meant for entertainment."
159,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30202842-paul-spence,5,"We humans like to think we are something special, that we have qualities no other animal possesses. Many people believe that our emotions are among the things that make us human. Primatologist Frans De Waal used to go along with this prevailing belief, but he has spent many years studying our closest relatives, and he says “More and more I believe that all the emotions we are familiar with can be found one way or another in all mammals, and that the variation is only in the details, elaborations, applications, and intensity.” In Mama’s Last Hug he makes his case for this position, and the result is both fascinating and convincing.De Waal says that modern emotion research puts too much stress on language, and that is part of the problem. We humans don’t use language to recognize and respond to emotions of other humans in our daily lives; we observe; and DeWaal uses observation as his scientific tool to argue engagingly, but also convincingly, in favor of a rich emotional life for animals other than humans.He won me over in Chapter 1 with a description of a moving reunion between Mama, a 59-year-old chimpanzee who was on her deathbed, and 80-year-old Jan van Hooff, who had been De Waal’s dissertation advisor and who had worked with Mama for many years. If you are skeptical of De Waal’s description, the reunion video is available on YouTube, and to me there is no doubt about Mama’s genuine joy at seeing her old friend.If DeWaal’s wonderful anecdotes do not convince you, consider his credentials. How often do you read a book by an IgNobel Prize winner? For those of you not familiar with the Ig Nobel prizes, they have been awarded annually since 1991 (on the Harvard campus but not by Harvard) to ""honor achievements that first make people laugh, and then make them think."" The paper that won the Ig Nobel for De Waal was called “Faces and Behinds”, and it was a study in which his team learned that apes have a “whole-body” image of familiar individuals and could even pick out individuals they knew from pictures of that ape’s derriere. My first reaction, of course, was to laugh, but then I had to recognize that this was clever work that tells me something rather impressive about apes.I had more laughs, some more sad moments, and a lot of thoughtful moments throughout the book. Do read it; I am confident that you will come away with a greater feeling of kinship with all the creatures, great and small."
160,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"The title of this latest work on primate-human emotion and cognition comes from the final act of a matriarchal chimpanzee whom the author, Frans de Waal, had studied at great length. This initial image which was also captured in viral social media videos is a deft distillation of many of this book's main points.For much of the 20th century it was taboo among primatologists, evolutionary biologists, and psychologists to speak of, ""animal emotion,"" given that they were viewed as not capable of producing anything recognizable as such. However, as studies became more rigorous, methods became more advanced, and data was accumulated; the notion that there is some sort of barrier between what we recognize as our own cognitive function and emotional actions/representations and those of the animal kingdom began to break down, perhaps most potently in the study of our closest evolutionary cousins: chimpanzees and bonobos. The discussion here has great implication for a number of issues including that of free will, sentience, the importance or non-importance of language in emotional development, updating our notion of instinct, and most interestingly for me the genuine origins of consciousness (again, a word thrown around as if it were uniquely human by the very same people who cannot tell you in any specific sense what it is). There are some missteps here including a dismissal of the work of Paul Bloom that doesn't seem to have been based on the substance of his actual argument in the work discussed, a vast reductionist take on some work of Pinker that again doesn't actually address his point or his data, and an unnecessary but thankfully brief discussion of Rawls' Theory of Justice.This is a book with big concepts, a bold commitment to updating our understanding of previously taboo ideas, and a big heart for the primates with whom Frans de Waal has worked all his life. Beautiful reading across a variety of subjects based on a wealth of data, great stuff! "
161,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76073867-amy-clarke,2,"A surprisingly polemical book about animal emotions and how they relate to human emotions. It is clear from the beginning that Frans de Waal has a bone to pick: he wants us to understand that emotions are not unique to humans, but something shared across the animal kingdom. Whilst I agree with this argument, I grew tired of de Waal's tone towards other scientists in his field. It's very clear he is frustrated at scientists who disagree with this, and he did little to hide it.Moreover, I could really have done without him extrapolating behaviour seen in female chimps to humans. Apparently de Waal's experience observing Bonobo chimps has qualified him to come to the conclusion that Sarah Palin's attractiveness served as a disadvantage to her during the vice presidential campaign, because of the jealousy she would have aroused in women. Moreover, the reason that female heads of state tend to be older is because post-menopausal women are less of a threat to other women. I am not sure how he came to this conclusion (particularly because there is not a single citation for this section), and it also seems to ignore the fact that most male heads of state are also rather old (the two male contenders in this year's presidential election are in their 70s). Surprisingly, the book was published after Jacinda Ardern became Prime Minister of New Zealand, but I imagine including her would not have fit his narrative.Overall, I got the impression that this book should have just been a long read on a news site. The chapters blurred into one, and de Waal grew repetitive. When a non-fiction book becomes meandering, it probably means the author should have made it shorter. And in all honesty, I think reading the blurb of this book is enough."
162,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,5,"This is definitely my current frontrunner for science book of the year and possibly overall book of the year.De Waal gives us a generous mix of true biology-based social psychology and much more, with discussions on things like selfhood veering into philosophy, even.I won't do a long review, with so many others here, but just a summary of his top points:Rejects ethology as being based on old behaviorist black box ideas. Says still too prevalent in America.Differentiates between emotion (more a Humean type “passion” in his view) and feeling, as emotion sieved through filters of consciousness and updated perception.Animal emotions and feelings both largely parallel humans. Can be complex.Animals, on feelings and reactions to them, have self-control like people.Seems to believe in something like what I would call “evolutionary psychology done right,” or “the evolutionary basis of human social psychology,” versus what is called evolutionary psychology and is generally a pseudoscientific pile of crap. At one point, he totally totally skewers Steve Pinker for claiming primitives are warlike and need to learn from moderns, re his book about the decrease of violence. Also says Hobbes et al got it wrong.Related? Notes that “warfare” on anything close to what we know it as today didn’t arise until the beginning of civilization, which of course ties to the beginnings of private property and other things.Also, without being explicit, like me, seems to tie degree of emotional expressiveness ability to degree of intelligence.Rejects much of traditional ideas of ""instinct,"" at least in animals we could call sentient."
163,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7125076-rachel,5,"Amazing book! I very much liked the author's previous book Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? I liked this one even better. It is easier to read and well organized, and it makes his points effectively. The main point is yes, animals do have emotions, which appear in many cases to be similar to ours. He makes a distinction between emotions and feelings; feelings are physical sensations that are associated with emotions. Many animals, especially mammals and birds, but also ones that we think of as lesser, appear to have both. He also gives compelling evidence that animals not only have emotions, they think, plan, have motivations, and weigh choices to make decisions, all in similar ways to humans. We are animals, after all, and closely related to the primates who are prominent in the book. We do great injustices when we assume we are better than, and matter more than, other animals (and other people whom we consider inferior, but I digress).The book is arranged by the type of emotion: happiness, empathy, guilt, the drive to power, etc. Each chapter has observations of animal behavior, and studies, and theories, and history that includes theories that were once established ""wisdom"" but are now disproved. (De Waal has done, and is doing here, his part in disproving those.) The final chapters, ""Emotional Intelligence"" and ""Sentience,"" come to conclusions and ask more questions. I hope both the scientific community and the human culture come around to de Waal's point of view on the subject and start showing more concern for the well-being of animals. I look forward to seeing further advances in this field."
164,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260945-anna,3,"Mama’s Last Hug is an exploration of animal emotion by one of the world’s most recognized and experienced primatologists. While I don’t really consider myself to be an animal (read: pet) person, I started this book in the spirit of being open minded to what the author’s experience and insight could teach me about organisms incorrectly considered to be less sentient or expressive than ourselves. The book is a fitting introduction to the topic and discusses multiple kinds of primates and other species, though perhaps the author’s gentle and common sense approach to his arguments neutralizes some of the impact. In other words, while I will continue to reduce meat consumption and buy sustainable, cruelty-free products where possible, I won’t be immediately be going vegan due to a sudden hyper-empathy with other species. Still, it provides encouragement to empathize with others and promote a kinder world for those organisms with whom we can not yet directly communicate yet share precious resources and experiences.(Physical Distancing Read #6)"

Frans de Waal has spent nearly his entire life with chimpanzees and other great apes. His previous works have mostly focused on intelligence. This book is about emotions in animals and whether they exist and if/how they compare to the human experience of emotions. Drawing on his own experience, studies, thoughtful experiments, logic, and philosophy, de Waal brings the reader a comprehensive argument in favor of animals (mostly mammals) having emotions and possibly sentience/consciousness. Several times throughout the book he makes it clear the difference between emotions and feelings. Emotions are displays while feelings are internal. Emotions are the manifestations of feelings. In his view, it would be impossible to know for sure what an animal is feeling but we can measure their emotions and make inferences based on our own experience of those emotions. Behaviorists would balk at the notion of including emotions when studying animals, believing they are basically all automatons that act based on instincts and behavior only. De Waal does an excellent job of disabusing this notion and is persuasive in his argument that being an automaton would keep the animal from adapting to its environment and die. Yet, we know species have existed for millennia. Instead, life can only exist with emotions. It is a natural part of who we and the animal kingdom are; it is hard coded into our existence.

I don't enjoy books that are filled with theory and dry numbers and thankfully this book is not that at all. He shares description of studies and experiments in a very approachable language. He even added his own drawings to make it easier to imagine.The chapter on animal sentinence was the highlight of the book.

The author delivers a wonderful and convincing document revealing the rich emotional life of animals, especially in the primates he has studied closely for over thirty years. He makes poignantly the point that for too long, it has been declared that animals do not have emotions: they do not experience pain, fear, disgust, joy etc. Now, fortunately, research into the emotions of animals is ongoing and expanding. He gives a voice to animals that makes it extremely difficult for any human to deny that they experience emotions, noting that it may perhaps only be the fact that they cannot speak for themselves that has enabled this denial for so long. Highly recommended. "

A little bittersweet, because it felt like a summing up of a career and possible good-bye from an amazing scientist who has contributed so much to our understanding and appreciation of the creatures we share the planet with.

188,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/932702-jodi,4,"I am an animal lover so of course when I heard about this book, I wanted to read it. I've been around too many animals to not believe that animals think, experience pain, and have emotions. My current dog, Leo is the most empathetic creative I have ever encountered - if I'm sad or upset, he gets right in my face with a look in his face that seems to be asking ""What is wrong? Are you ok, Mom?"" Sure my statement is not scientific but my dog is thinking and responding with emotion to me when he does that. My other dog Annie uses her charms and has a ""smile"" that she uses to get what she wants. Sure it is not a smile in the way a human smiles, but she knows that expression gets her what she wants and she uses it. She also gets scared and hides if there is yelling in the house - she picks up on the tension and wants to get away from it. Annie also plans and thinks ahead to get the things she wants - she has learned from experience she can get what she wants from Leo if she waits for the perfect moment. She watches him from a distance and then swoops in to grab it when he looks away for a moment. She then has her ""hiding spot"" and leaves a bewildered Leo behind. She has perfected this move down to a science so I know she is using past experience to know when to grab and knows the best hiding place in the house to stay out of reach of the humans. Leo is also 11 years old and going blind so he can't really chase her! I could go on for hours about my dogs' thinking, and feelings for a longI think I would have enjoyed being an animal researcher but it wasn't the path I followed. It was fun to read about Frans De Waal's experiences in the lab and zoos around the world. I don't really know much about bonobos but I think they are now my favorite primates - peaceful and social creatures! I like Waal's comment that humans on our bad days are as violent as chimps but on our good days are as nice and sensitive as bonobos. Pretty true!I found the grape and cucumber experiment with capuchin monkey's interesting. They were happy receiving cucumbers and didn't complain until one was given grapes. Suddenly, the other one refused to eat the cucumber which was fine just a minute ago. I see this parallel to humans - we always want what others have and become dissatisfied with what we loved until we saw something else we perceive as better. Also, his comments about working for a social aspect keeps us in check sometimes from climbing ahead too in life - we will ""share"" to keep social peace.Interesting read but only 4 stars because it was ""dry"" at time. However, this is supposed to be a scholarly book and not necessarily meant for entertainment."
189,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30202842-paul-spence,5,"We humans like to think we are something special, that we have qualities no other animal possesses. Many people believe that our emotions are among the things that make us human. Primatologist Frans De Waal used to go along with this prevailing belief, but he has spent many years studying our closest relatives, and he says “More and more I believe that all the emotions we are familiar with can be found one way or another in all mammals, and that the variation is only in the details, elaborations, applications, and intensity.” In Mama’s Last Hug he makes his case for this position, and the result is both fascinating and convincing.De Waal says that modern emotion research puts too much stress on language, and that is part of the problem. We humans don’t use language to recognize and respond to emotions of other humans in our daily lives; we observe; and DeWaal uses observation as his scientific tool to argue engagingly, but also convincingly, in favor of a rich emotional life for animals other than humans.He won me over in Chapter 1 with a description of a moving reunion between Mama, a 59-year-old chimpanzee who was on her deathbed, and 80-year-old Jan van Hooff, who had been De Waal’s dissertation advisor and who had worked with Mama for many years. If you are skeptical of De Waal’s description, the reunion video is available on YouTube, and to me there is no doubt about Mama’s genuine joy at seeing her old friend.If DeWaal’s wonderful anecdotes do not convince you, consider his credentials. How often do you read a book by an IgNobel Prize winner? For those of you not familiar with the Ig Nobel prizes, they have been awarded annually since 1991 (on the Harvard campus but not by Harvard) to ""honor achievements that first make people laugh, and then make them think."" The paper that won the Ig Nobel for De Waal was called “Faces and Behinds”, and it was a study in which his team learned that apes have a “whole-body” image of familiar individuals and could even pick out individuals they knew from pictures of that ape’s derriere. My first reaction, of course, was to laugh, but then I had to recognize that this was clever work that tells me something rather impressive about apes.I had more laughs, some more sad moments, and a lot of thoughtful moments throughout the book. Do read it; I am confident that you will come away with a greater feeling of kinship with all the creatures, great and small."
190,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"The title of this latest work on primate-human emotion and cognition comes from the final act of a matriarchal chimpanzee whom the author, Frans de Waal, had studied at great length. This initial image which was also captured in viral social media videos is a deft distillation of many of this book's main points.For much of the 20th century it was taboo among primatologists, evolutionary biologists, and psychologists to speak of, ""animal emotion,"" given that they were viewed as not capable of producing anything recognizable as such. However, as studies became more rigorous, methods became more advanced, and data was accumulated; the notion that there is some sort of barrier between what we recognize as our own cognitive function and emotional actions/representations and those of the animal kingdom began to break down, perhaps most potently in the study of our closest evolutionary cousins: chimpanzees and bonobos. The discussion here has great implication for a number of issues including that of free will, sentience, the importance or non-importance of language in emotional development, updating our notion of instinct, and most interestingly for me the genuine origins of consciousness (again, a word thrown around as if it were uniquely human by the very same people who cannot tell you in any specific sense what it is). There are some missteps here including a dismissal of the work of Paul Bloom that doesn't seem to have been based on the substance of his actual argument in the work discussed, a vast reductionist take on some work of Pinker that again doesn't actually address his point or his data, and an unnecessary but thankfully brief discussion of Rawls' Theory of Justice.This is a book with big concepts, a bold commitment to updating our understanding of previously taboo ideas, and a big heart for the primates with whom Frans de Waal has worked all his life. Beautiful reading across a variety of subjects based on a wealth of data, great stuff! "
191,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76073867-amy-clarke,2,"A surprisingly polemical book about animal emotions and how they relate to human emotions. It is clear from the beginning that Frans de Waal has a bone to pick: he wants us to understand that emotions are not unique to humans, but something shared across the animal kingdom. Whilst I agree with this argument, I grew tired of de Waal's tone towards other scientists in his field. It's very clear he is frustrated at scientists who disagree with this, and he did little to hide it.Moreover, I could really have done without him extrapolating behaviour seen in female chimps to humans. Apparently de Waal's experience observing Bonobo chimps has qualified him to come to the conclusion that Sarah Palin's attractiveness served as a disadvantage to her during the vice presidential campaign, because of the jealousy she would have aroused in women. Moreover, the reason that female heads of state tend to be older is because post-menopausal women are less of a threat to other women. I am not sure how he came to this conclusion (particularly because there is not a single citation for this section), and it also seems to ignore the fact that most male heads of state are also rather old (the two male contenders in this year's presidential election are in their 70s). Surprisingly, the book was published after Jacinda Ardern became Prime Minister of New Zealand, but I imagine including her would not have fit his narrative.Overall, I got the impression that this book should have just been a long read on a news site. The chapters blurred into one, and de Waal grew repetitive. When a non-fiction book becomes meandering, it probably means the author should have made it shorter. And in all honesty, I think reading the blurb of this book is enough."
192,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,5,"This is definitely my current frontrunner for science book of the year and possibly overall book of the year.De Waal gives us a generous mix of true biology-based social psychology and much more, with discussions on things like selfhood veering into philosophy, even.I won't do a long review, with so many others here, but just a summary of his top points:Rejects ethology as being based on old behaviorist black box ideas. Says still too prevalent in America.Differentiates between emotion (more a Humean type “passion” in his view) and feeling, as emotion sieved through filters of consciousness and updated perception.Animal emotions and feelings both largely parallel humans. Can be complex.Animals, on feelings and reactions to them, have self-control like people.Seems to believe in something like what I would call “evolutionary psychology done right,” or “the evolutionary basis of human social psychology,” versus what is called evolutionary psychology and is generally a pseudoscientific pile of crap. At one point, he totally totally skewers Steve Pinker for claiming primitives are warlike and need to learn from moderns, re his book about the decrease of violence. Also says Hobbes et al got it wrong.Related? Notes that “warfare” on anything close to what we know it as today didn’t arise until the beginning of civilization, which of course ties to the beginnings of private property and other things.Also, without being explicit, like me, seems to tie degree of emotional expressiveness ability to degree of intelligence.Rejects much of traditional ideas of ""instinct,"" at least in animals we could call sentient."
193,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7125076-rachel,5,"Amazing book! I very much liked the author's previous book Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? I liked this one even better. It is easier to read and well organized, and it makes his points effectively. The main point is yes, animals do have emotions, which appear in many cases to be similar to ours. He makes a distinction between emotions and feelings; feelings are physical sensations that are associated with emotions. Many animals, especially mammals and birds, but also ones that we think of as lesser, appear to have both. He also gives compelling evidence that animals not only have emotions, they think, plan, have motivations, and weigh choices to make decisions, all in similar ways to humans. We are animals, after all, and closely related to the primates who are prominent in the book. We do great injustices when we assume we are better than, and matter more than, other animals (and other people whom we consider inferior, but I digress).The book is arranged by the type of emotion: happiness, empathy, guilt, the drive to power, etc. Each chapter has observations of animal behavior, and studies, and theories, and history that includes theories that were once established ""wisdom"" but are now disproved. (De Waal has done, and is doing here, his part in disproving those.) The final chapters, ""Emotional Intelligence"" and ""Sentience,"" come to conclusions and ask more questions. I hope both the scientific community and the human culture come around to de Waal's point of view on the subject and start showing more concern for the well-being of animals. I look forward to seeing further advances in this field."
194,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260945-anna,3,"Mama’s Last Hug is an exploration of animal emotion by one of the world’s most recognized and experienced primatologists. While I don’t really consider myself to be an animal (read: pet) person, I started this book in the spirit of being open minded to what the author’s experience and insight could teach me about organisms incorrectly considered to be less sentient or expressive than ourselves. The book is a fitting introduction to the topic and discusses multiple kinds of primates and other species, though perhaps the author’s gentle and common sense approach to his arguments neutralizes some of the impact. In other words, while I will continue to reduce meat consumption and buy sustainable, cruelty-free products where possible, I won’t be immediately be going vegan due to a sudden hyper-empathy with other species. Still, it provides encouragement to empathize with others and promote a kinder world for those organisms with whom we can not yet directly communicate yet share precious resources and experiences.(Physical Distancing Read #6)"
195,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1915261-scott-lupo,5,"A captivating and enthralling book about the emotional lives of animals. Frans de Waal has spent nearly his entire life with chimpanzees and other great apes. His previous works have mostly focused on intelligence. This book is about emotions in animals and whether they exist and if/how they compare to the human experience of emotions. Drawing on his own experience, studies, thoughtful experiments, logic, and philosophy, de Waal brings the reader a comprehensive argument in favor of animals (mostly mammals) having emotions and possibly sentience/consciousness. Several times throughout the book he makes it clear the difference between emotions and feelings. Emotions are displays while feelings are internal. Emotions are the manifestations of feelings. In his view, it would be impossible to know for sure what an animal is feeling but we can measure their emotions and make inferences based on our own experience of those emotions. Behaviorists would balk at the notion of including emotions when studying animals, believing they are basically all automatons that act based on instincts and behavior only. De Waal does an excellent job of disabusing this notion and is persuasive in his argument that being an automaton would keep the animal from adapting to its environment and die. Yet, we know species have existed for millennia. Instead, life can only exist with emotions. It is a natural part of who we and the animal kingdom are; it is hard coded into our existence. So why study animals as if they don't have emotions? Luckily, much of the science is changing and today's scientists are much more open to the concept of animal emotions. Of course, if you are a pet owner you already know this through anecdotal experience. Now science is catching up and solidifying the notion of animal emotions. "
196,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117548223-katrien,4,"Frans de Waal is for sure an extremely enthousiast primatologue - you can almost feel his love and Passion for these close primates of ours; Which makes the book an extremely pleasant and interesting reading. According to Frans de Waal, there would be no reason at all to believe humans emotion are that much greater and richer as the ones of chimpanzees or other animals - an idea still many scientists hold on to. The lives in the animal kingdom would be as complex and thrilling as the lives of any of us. I did not agree with all the points he made - and to my mind his arguments are not always that elaborated.Nevertheless, Mama's Last Hug is a must read for anyone interested in emotions. It gives the reader an insight and an understanding of animal emotions - from jealousy to compassion. I can promise you will not look at your cat ever the same way again."

Perhaps moral behavior/selflessness and intelligence are easier to demonstrate with scientific experiments than are emotions so he felt the need to be especially thorough in his presentation, emotion by emotion. Perhaps this area is one more of his scientific colleagues are unwilling to acknowledge as shared with animals. Perhaps acknowledging that animals experience emotions as humans do would be more likely to force a reexamination of the ways we treat animals that economic players and scientific researchers, among others, would find inconvenient. 3-1/2 stars."

Being one of 7 kids in our family, we could run around and act like monkeys and not get into trouble. From early on, all of us loved going to the ape and chimpanzee house where we were fascinated at how similar they were to us and would stand and watch then forever. This beautiful book explains and confirms that what we thought as children actually is true- animals are more like us than we think. Through extensive research the author tells us that we don’t have a single organ that other animals don’t have and the same is true for emotions. The book begins with the death of Mama, a chimp matriarch who formed a bond with biologist Jan van Hooff. When they meet for the last time it was captured on film.

Frans de Waal takes the narrative of themes like morality and instinct and draws very distinct lines yet articulates very straight-forward convergences between man and ape, and even man to other mammals. Whether it's discovering the intricacies of why we shake hands, why we reconcile, why men puff up their chests and even why criminals behave in ways they do, de Waal expertly gives example after example of mammalian instincts that exist in us which we still have ingrained in our psychologies from millennia-old reflexes and mechanisms.

These things are all really up my alley but for some reason the writing was hard to get into. I found my brain drifting off fairly often even though the content was quite interesting. I can't put my finger on it. It really felt like a slog to finish. I would possibly try one of De Waal's other books to see if maybe it was just an editing issue, or if that's just his usual writing.

213,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15417878-kirsten-cutler,5,"Fascinating and informative. The author delivers a wonderful and convincing document revealing the rich emotional life of animals, especially in the primates he has studied closely for over thirty years. He makes poignantly the point that for too long, it has been declared that animals do not have emotions: they do not experience pain, fear, disgust, joy etc. Now, fortunately, research into the emotions of animals is ongoing and expanding. He gives a voice to animals that makes it extremely difficult for any human to deny that they experience emotions, noting that it may perhaps only be the fact that they cannot speak for themselves that has enabled this denial for so long. Highly recommended. "

A little bittersweet, because it felt like a summing up of a career and possible good-bye from an amazing scientist who has contributed so much to our understanding and appreciation of the creatures we share the planet with. Refreshing to see how the understanding of animal behavior has evolved from the simplistic models I was taught in the 1970s."

218,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/932702-jodi,4,"I am an animal lover so of course when I heard about this book, I wanted to read it. I've been around too many animals to not believe that animals think, experience pain, and have emotions. My current dog, Leo is the most empathetic creative I have ever encountered - if I'm sad or upset, he gets right in my face with a look in his face that seems to be asking ""What is wrong? Are you ok, Mom?"" Sure my statement is not scientific but my dog is thinking and responding with emotion to me when he does that. My other dog Annie uses her charms and has a ""smile"" that she uses to get what she wants. Sure it is not a smile in the way a human smiles, but she knows that expression gets her what she wants and she uses it. She also gets scared and hides if there is yelling in the house - she picks up on the tension and wants to get away from it. Annie also plans and thinks ahead to get the things she wants - she has learned from experience she can get what she wants from Leo if she waits for the perfect moment. She watches him from a distance and then swoops in to grab it when he looks away for a moment. She then has her ""hiding spot"" and leaves a bewildered Leo behind. She has perfected this move down to a science so I know she is using past experience to know when to grab and knows the best hiding place in the house to stay out of reach of the humans. Leo is also 11 years old and going blind so he can't really chase her! I could go on for hours about my dogs' thinking, and feelings for a longI think I would have enjoyed being an animal researcher but it wasn't the path I followed. It was fun to read about Frans De Waal's experiences in the lab and zoos around the world. I don't really know much about bonobos but I think they are now my favorite primates - peaceful and social creatures! I like Waal's comment that humans on our bad days are as violent as chimps but on our good days are as nice and sensitive as bonobos. Pretty true!I found the grape and cucumber experiment with capuchin monkey's interesting. They were happy receiving cucumbers and didn't complain until one was given grapes. Suddenly, the other one refused to eat the cucumber which was fine just a minute ago. I see this parallel to humans - we always want what others have and become dissatisfied with what we loved until we saw something else we perceive as better. Also, his comments about working for a social aspect keeps us in check sometimes from climbing ahead too in life - we will ""share"" to keep social peace.Interesting read but only 4 stars because it was ""dry"" at time. However, this is supposed to be a scholarly book and not necessarily meant for entertainment."
219,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30202842-paul-spence,5,"We humans like to think we are something special, that we have qualities no other animal possesses. Many people believe that our emotions are among the things that make us human. Primatologist Frans De Waal used to go along with this prevailing belief, but he has spent many years studying our closest relatives, and he says “More and more I believe that all the emotions we are familiar with can be found one way or another in all mammals, and that the variation is only in the details, elaborations, applications, and intensity.” In Mama’s Last Hug he makes his case for this position, and the result is both fascinating and convincing.De Waal says that modern emotion research puts too much stress on language, and that is part of the problem. We humans don’t use language to recognize and respond to emotions of other humans in our daily lives; we observe; and DeWaal uses observation as his scientific tool to argue engagingly, but also convincingly, in favor of a rich emotional life for animals other than humans.He won me over in Chapter 1 with a description of a moving reunion between Mama, a 59-year-old chimpanzee who was on her deathbed, and 80-year-old Jan van Hooff, who had been De Waal’s dissertation advisor and who had worked with Mama for many years. If you are skeptical of De Waal’s description, the reunion video is available on YouTube, and to me there is no doubt about Mama’s genuine joy at seeing her old friend.If DeWaal’s wonderful anecdotes do not convince you, consider his credentials. How often do you read a book by an IgNobel Prize winner? For those of you not familiar with the Ig Nobel prizes, they have been awarded annually since 1991 (on the Harvard campus but not by Harvard) to ""honor achievements that first make people laugh, and then make them think."" The paper that won the Ig Nobel for De Waal was called “Faces and Behinds”, and it was a study in which his team learned that apes have a “whole-body” image of familiar individuals and could even pick out individuals they knew from pictures of that ape’s derriere. My first reaction, of course, was to laugh, but then I had to recognize that this was clever work that tells me something rather impressive about apes.I had more laughs, some more sad moments, and a lot of thoughtful moments throughout the book. Do read it; I am confident that you will come away with a greater feeling of kinship with all the creatures, great and small."
220,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"The title of this latest work on primate-human emotion and cognition comes from the final act of a matriarchal chimpanzee whom the author, Frans de Waal, had studied at great length. This initial image which was also captured in viral social media videos is a deft distillation of many of this book's main points.For much of the 20th century it was taboo among primatologists, evolutionary biologists, and psychologists to speak of, ""animal emotion,"" given that they were viewed as not capable of producing anything recognizable as such. However, as studies became more rigorous, methods became more advanced, and data was accumulated; the notion that there is some sort of barrier between what we recognize as our own cognitive function and emotional actions/representations and those of the animal kingdom began to break down, perhaps most potently in the study of our closest evolutionary cousins: chimpanzees and bonobos. The discussion here has great implication for a number of issues including that of free will, sentience, the importance or non-importance of language in emotional development, updating our notion of instinct, and most interestingly for me the genuine origins of consciousness (again, a word thrown around as if it were uniquely human by the very same people who cannot tell you in any specific sense what it is). There are some missteps here including a dismissal of the work of Paul Bloom that doesn't seem to have been based on the substance of his actual argument in the work discussed, a vast reductionist take on some work of Pinker that again doesn't actually address his point or his data, and an unnecessary but thankfully brief discussion of Rawls' Theory of Justice.This is a book with big concepts, a bold commitment to updating our understanding of previously taboo ideas, and a big heart for the primates with whom Frans de Waal has worked all his life. Beautiful reading across a variety of subjects based on a wealth of data, great stuff! "
221,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76073867-amy-clarke,2,"A surprisingly polemical book about animal emotions and how they relate to human emotions. It is clear from the beginning that Frans de Waal has a bone to pick: he wants us to understand that emotions are not unique to humans, but something shared across the animal kingdom. Whilst I agree with this argument, I grew tired of de Waal's tone towards other scientists in his field. It's very clear he is frustrated at scientists who disagree with this, and he did little to hide it.Moreover, I could really have done without him extrapolating behaviour seen in female chimps to humans. Apparently de Waal's experience observing Bonobo chimps has qualified him to come to the conclusion that Sarah Palin's attractiveness served as a disadvantage to her during the vice presidential campaign, because of the jealousy she would have aroused in women. Moreover, the reason that female heads of state tend to be older is because post-menopausal women are less of a threat to other women. I am not sure how he came to this conclusion (particularly because there is not a single citation for this section), and it also seems to ignore the fact that most male heads of state are also rather old (the two male contenders in this year's presidential election are in their 70s). Surprisingly, the book was published after Jacinda Ardern became Prime Minister of New Zealand, but I imagine including her would not have fit his narrative.Overall, I got the impression that this book should have just been a long read on a news site. The chapters blurred into one, and de Waal grew repetitive. When a non-fiction book becomes meandering, it probably means the author should have made it shorter. And in all honesty, I think reading the blurb of this book is enough."
222,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,5,"This is definitely my current frontrunner for science book of the year and possibly overall book of the year.De Waal gives us a generous mix of true biology-based social psychology and much more, with discussions on things like selfhood veering into philosophy, even.I won't do a long review, with so many others here, but just a summary of his top points:Rejects ethology as being based on old behaviorist black box ideas. Says still too prevalent in America.Differentiates between emotion (more a Humean type “passion” in his view) and feeling, as emotion sieved through filters of consciousness and updated perception.Animal emotions and feelings both largely parallel humans. Can be complex.Animals, on feelings and reactions to them, have self-control like people.Seems to believe in something like what I would call “evolutionary psychology done right,” or “the evolutionary basis of human social psychology,” versus what is called evolutionary psychology and is generally a pseudoscientific pile of crap. At one point, he totally totally skewers Steve Pinker for claiming primitives are warlike and need to learn from moderns, re his book about the decrease of violence. Also says Hobbes et al got it wrong.Related? Notes that “warfare” on anything close to what we know it as today didn’t arise until the beginning of civilization, which of course ties to the beginnings of private property and other things.Also, without being explicit, like me, seems to tie degree of emotional expressiveness ability to degree of intelligence.Rejects much of traditional ideas of ""instinct,"" at least in animals we could call sentient."
223,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7125076-rachel,5,"Amazing book! I very much liked the author's previous book Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? I liked this one even better. It is easier to read and well organized, and it makes his points effectively. The main point is yes, animals do have emotions, which appear in many cases to be similar to ours. He makes a distinction between emotions and feelings; feelings are physical sensations that are associated with emotions. Many animals, especially mammals and birds, but also ones that we think of as lesser, appear to have both. He also gives compelling evidence that animals not only have emotions, they think, plan, have motivations, and weigh choices to make decisions, all in similar ways to humans. We are animals, after all, and closely related to the primates who are prominent in the book. We do great injustices when we assume we are better than, and matter more than, other animals (and other people whom we consider inferior, but I digress).The book is arranged by the type of emotion: happiness, empathy, guilt, the drive to power, etc. Each chapter has observations of animal behavior, and studies, and theories, and history that includes theories that were once established ""wisdom"" but are now disproved. (De Waal has done, and is doing here, his part in disproving those.) The final chapters, ""Emotional Intelligence"" and ""Sentience,"" come to conclusions and ask more questions. I hope both the scientific community and the human culture come around to de Waal's point of view on the subject and start showing more concern for the well-being of animals. I look forward to seeing further advances in this field."
224,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260945-anna,3,"Mama’s Last Hug is an exploration of animal emotion by one of the world’s most recognized and experienced primatologists. While I don’t really consider myself to be an animal (read: pet) person, I started this book in the spirit of being open minded to what the author’s experience and insight could teach me about organisms incorrectly considered to be less sentient or expressive than ourselves. The book is a fitting introduction to the topic and discusses multiple kinds of primates and other species, though perhaps the author’s gentle and common sense approach to his arguments neutralizes some of the impact. In other words, while I will continue to reduce meat consumption and buy sustainable, cruelty-free products where possible, I won’t be immediately be going vegan due to a sudden hyper-empathy with other species. Still, it provides encouragement to empathize with others and promote a kinder world for those organisms with whom we can not yet directly communicate yet share precious resources and experiences.(Physical Distancing Read #6)"
225,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1915261-scott-lupo,5,"A captivating and enthralling book about the emotional lives of animals. Frans de Waal has spent nearly his entire life with chimpanzees and other great apes. His previous works have mostly focused on intelligence. This book is about emotions in animals and whether they exist and if/how they compare to the human experience of emotions. Drawing on his own experience, studies, thoughtful experiments, logic, and philosophy, de Waal brings the reader a comprehensive argument in favor of animals (mostly mammals) having emotions and possibly sentience/consciousness. Several times throughout the book he makes it clear the difference between emotions and feelings. Emotions are displays while feelings are internal. Emotions are the manifestations of feelings. In his view, it would be impossible to know for sure what an animal is feeling but we can measure their emotions and make inferences based on our own experience of those emotions. Behaviorists would balk at the notion of including emotions when studying animals, believing they are basically all automatons that act based on instincts and behavior only. De Waal does an excellent job of disabusing this notion and is persuasive in his argument that being an automaton would keep the animal from adapting to its environment and die. Yet, we know species have existed for millennia. Instead, life can only exist with emotions. It is a natural part of who we and the animal kingdom are; it is hard coded into our existence. So why study animals as if they don't have emotions? Luckily, much of the science is changing and today's scientists are much more open to the concept of animal emotions. Of course, if you are a pet owner you already know this through anecdotal experience. Now science is catching up and solidifying the notion of animal emotions. "
226,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117548223-katrien,4,"Frans de Waal is for sure an extremely enthousiast primatologue - you can almost feel his love and Passion for these close primates of ours; Which makes the book an extremely pleasant and interesting reading. According to Frans de Waal, there would be no reason at all to believe humans emotion are that much greater and richer as the ones of chimpanzees or other animals - an idea still many scientists hold on to. The lives in the animal kingdom would be as complex and thrilling as the lives of any of us. I did not agree with all the points he made - and to my mind his arguments are not always that elaborated.Nevertheless, Mama's Last Hug is a must read for anyone interested in emotions. It gives the reader an insight and an understanding of animal emotions - from jealousy to compassion. I can promise you will not look at your cat ever the same way again."
227,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/746637-sally,4,"An important book, though I got bogged down in the middle and took a long time to finish it, a problem I didn't have with the two earlier books in this ""series."" Perhaps moral behavior/selflessness and intelligence are easier to demonstrate with scientific experiments than are emotions so he felt the need to be especially thorough in his presentation, emotion by emotion. Perhaps this area is one more of his scientific colleagues are unwilling to acknowledge as shared with animals. Perhaps acknowledging that animals experience emotions as humans do would be more likely to force a reexamination of the ways we treat animals that economic players and scientific researchers, among others, would find inconvenient. 3-1/2 stars."
228,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1882501-ginny,5,"As a child, we went to the zoo often. Being one of 7 kids in our family, we could run around and act like monkeys and not get into trouble. From early on, all of us loved going to the ape and chimpanzee house where we were fascinated at how similar they were to us and would stand and watch then forever. This beautiful book explains and confirms that what we thought as children actually is true- animals are more like us than we think. Through extensive research the author tells us that we don’t have a single organ that other animals don’t have and the same is true for emotions. The book begins with the death of Mama, a chimp matriarch who formed a bond with biologist Jan van Hooff. When they meet for the last time it was captured on film. Read this book and google and watch their last hug. Loved them both."
229,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87165204-david-solis,5,"WHAT A READ. I've always been fascinated on the primal instincts that still exist in humans. Frans de Waal takes the narrative of themes like morality and instinct and draws very distinct lines yet articulates very straight-forward convergences between man and ape, and even man to other mammals. Whether it's discovering the intricacies of why we shake hands, why we reconcile, why men puff up their chests and even why criminals behave in ways they do, de Waal expertly gives example after example of mammalian instincts that exist in us which we still have ingrained in our psychologies from millennia-old reflexes and mechanisms.

I should have liked this book more than I did - a mix of animal facts, memoir-ish anecdotes from the author's career, and even quite a bit of moral philosophy. These things are all really up my alley but for some reason the writing was hard to get into. I found my brain drifting off fairly often even though the content was quite interesting. I can't put my finger on it. It really felt like a slog to finish. I would possibly try one of De Waal's other books to see if maybe it was just an editing issue, or if that's just his usual writing. When the library opens again, that is."

Here his focus is on primates and provides substantial evidence that they have feelings and emotions akin to our own. A powerful recognition of empathic behavior in many other animals as well. Proving once more that if humans could dial down our ego, we could see the world as ever more fascinating than previously thought."

From why we, humas, wave our hand as a greeting to how animals are actually aware of the future. I took my time reading it enjoying every last page and will definitely go back to re-read.Frans de Waal captures fussy readers. I don't enjoy books that are filled with theory and dry numbers and thankfully this book is not that at all. He shares description of studies and experiments in a very approachable language. He even added his own drawings to make it easier to imagine.The chapter on animal sentinence was the highlight of the book. There is a silence surrounding animal emotions and motivation of animal behavior in the scientific world and the reasons are shocking yet very in line with the nature of humans.5/5, incredible read"

Separating ""emotions"" from ""feelings"", he uses research, observation, and humor to talk about not only animal emotions, but how science has changed over the ears in how it views animals.Essential."

Some of it was over my head and a bit dry but at the same time I think it is very readable for a lay person. There are some really sad and horrific stories so the sensitive reader beware. I have always felt that animals have emotions so this was preaching to the choir.What I did not appreciate was the specter of Trump appearing in chapter 5, it's about politics. yuck "
237,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94750490-charlotte,2,"When de Waal sticks to what he knows as a primatologist and psychologist he has some excellent insights on animal emotions and how even today humans try to deny their existence in animals. The chapter on sentience in particular is eye opening. However, when de Waal ventures into sociology and other fields he is way off the mark. He makes some odd, and frankly, sexist comments about women and treats them as if they are facts rather than opinions. If you can get past this, it's worth a read."

Pretty true!I found the grape and cucumber experiment with capuchin monkey's interesting. They were happy receiving cucumbers and didn't complain until one was given grapes. Suddenly, the other one refused to eat the cucumber which was fine just a minute ago. I see this parallel to humans - we always want what others have and become dissatisfied with what we loved until we saw something else we perceive as better. Also, his comments about working for a social aspect keeps us in check sometimes from climbing ahead too in life - we will ""share"" to keep social peace.Interesting read but only 4 stars because it was ""dry"" at time. However, this is supposed to be a scholarly book and not necessarily meant for entertainment."

Many people believe that our emotions are among the things that make us human. Primatologist Frans De Waal used to go along with this prevailing belief, but he has spent many years studying our closest relatives, and he says “More and more I believe that all the emotions we are familiar with can be found one way or another in all mammals, and that the variation is only in the details, elaborations, applications, and intensity.” In Mama’s Last Hug he makes his case for this position, and the result is both fascinating and convincing.De Waal says that modern emotion research puts too much stress on language, and that is part of the problem. We humans don’t use language to recognize and respond to emotions of other humans in our daily lives; we observe; and DeWaal uses observation as his scientific tool to argue engagingly, but also convincingly, in favor of a rich emotional life for animals other than humans.He won me over in Chapter 1 with a description of a moving reunion between Mama, a 59-year-old chimpanzee who was on her deathbed, and 80-year-old Jan van Hooff, who had been De Waal’s dissertation advisor and who had worked with Mama for many years. If you are skeptical of De Waal’s description, the reunion video is available on YouTube, and to me there is no doubt about Mama’s genuine joy at seeing her old friend.If DeWaal’s wonderful anecdotes do not convince you, consider his credentials. How often do you read a book by an IgNobel Prize winner? For those of you not familiar with the Ig Nobel prizes, they have been awarded annually since 1991 (on the Harvard campus but not by Harvard) to ""honor achievements that first make people laugh, and then make them think."" The paper that won the Ig Nobel for De Waal was called “Faces and Behinds”, and it was a study in which his team learned that apes have a “whole-body” image of familiar individuals and could even pick out individuals they knew from pictures of that ape’s derriere. My first reaction, of course, was to laugh, but then I had to recognize that this was clever work that tells me something rather impressive about apes.I had more laughs, some more sad moments, and a lot of thoughtful moments throughout the book. Do read it; I am confident that you will come away with a greater feeling of kinship with all the creatures, great and small."
250,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"The title of this latest work on primate-human emotion and cognition comes from the final act of a matriarchal chimpanzee whom the author, Frans de Waal, had studied at great length. This initial image which was also captured in viral social media videos is a deft distillation of many of this book's main points.For much of the 20th century it was taboo among primatologists, evolutionary biologists, and psychologists to speak of, ""animal emotion,"" given that they were viewed as not capable of producing anything recognizable as such. However, as studies became more rigorous, methods became more advanced, and data was accumulated; the notion that there is some sort of barrier between what we recognize as our own cognitive function and emotional actions/representations and those of the animal kingdom began to break down, perhaps most potently in the study of our closest evolutionary cousins: chimpanzees and bonobos. The discussion here has great implication for a number of issues including that of free will, sentience, the importance or non-importance of language in emotional development, updating our notion of instinct, and most interestingly for me the genuine origins of consciousness (again, a word thrown around as if it were uniquely human by the very same people who cannot tell you in any specific sense what it is). There are some missteps here including a dismissal of the work of Paul Bloom that doesn't seem to have been based on the substance of his actual argument in the work discussed, a vast reductionist take on some work of Pinker that again doesn't actually address his point or his data, and an unnecessary but thankfully brief discussion of Rawls' Theory of Justice.This is a book with big concepts, a bold commitment to updating our understanding of previously taboo ideas, and a big heart for the primates with whom Frans de Waal has worked all his life. Beautiful reading across a variety of subjects based on a wealth of data, great stuff! "
251,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76073867-amy-clarke,2,"A surprisingly polemical book about animal emotions and how they relate to human emotions. It is clear from the beginning that Frans de Waal has a bone to pick: he wants us to understand that emotions are not unique to humans, but something shared across the animal kingdom. Whilst I agree with this argument, I grew tired of de Waal's tone towards other scientists in his field. It's very clear he is frustrated at scientists who disagree with this, and he did little to hide it.Moreover, I could really have done without him extrapolating behaviour seen in female chimps to humans. Apparently de Waal's experience observing Bonobo chimps has qualified him to come to the conclusion that Sarah Palin's attractiveness served as a disadvantage to her during the vice presidential campaign, because of the jealousy she would have aroused in women. Moreover, the reason that female heads of state tend to be older is because post-menopausal women are less of a threat to other women. I am not sure how he came to this conclusion (particularly because there is not a single citation for this section), and it also seems to ignore the fact that most male heads of state are also rather old (the two male contenders in this year's presidential election are in their 70s). Surprisingly, the book was published after Jacinda Ardern became Prime Minister of New Zealand, but I imagine including her would not have fit his narrative.Overall, I got the impression that this book should have just been a long read on a news site. The chapters blurred into one, and de Waal grew repetitive. When a non-fiction book becomes meandering, it probably means the author should have made it shorter. And in all honesty, I think reading the blurb of this book is enough."
252,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,5,"This is definitely my current frontrunner for science book of the year and possibly overall book of the year.De Waal gives us a generous mix of true biology-based social psychology and much more, with discussions on things like selfhood veering into philosophy, even.I won't do a long review, with so many others here, but just a summary of his top points:Rejects ethology as being based on old behaviorist black box ideas. Says still too prevalent in America.Differentiates between emotion (more a Humean type “passion” in his view) and feeling, as emotion sieved through filters of consciousness and updated perception.Animal emotions and feelings both largely parallel humans. Can be complex.Animals, on feelings and reactions to them, have self-control like people.Seems to believe in something like what I would call “evolutionary psychology done right,” or “the evolutionary basis of human social psychology,” versus what is called evolutionary psychology and is generally a pseudoscientific pile of crap. At one point, he totally totally skewers Steve Pinker for claiming primitives are warlike and need to learn from moderns, re his book about the decrease of violence. Also says Hobbes et al got it wrong.Related? Notes that “warfare” on anything close to what we know it as today didn’t arise until the beginning of civilization, which of course ties to the beginnings of private property and other things.Also, without being explicit, like me, seems to tie degree of emotional expressiveness ability to degree of intelligence.Rejects much of traditional ideas of ""instinct,"" at least in animals we could call sentient."
253,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7125076-rachel,5,"Amazing book! I very much liked the author's previous book Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? I liked this one even better. It is easier to read and well organized, and it makes his points effectively. The main point is yes, animals do have emotions, which appear in many cases to be similar to ours. He makes a distinction between emotions and feelings; feelings are physical sensations that are associated with emotions. Many animals, especially mammals and birds, but also ones that we think of as lesser, appear to have both. He also gives compelling evidence that animals not only have emotions, they think, plan, have motivations, and weigh choices to make decisions, all in similar ways to humans. We are animals, after all, and closely related to the primates who are prominent in the book. We do great injustices when we assume we are better than, and matter more than, other animals (and other people whom we consider inferior, but I digress).The book is arranged by the type of emotion: happiness, empathy, guilt, the drive to power, etc. Each chapter has observations of animal behavior, and studies, and theories, and history that includes theories that were once established ""wisdom"" but are now disproved. (De Waal has done, and is doing here, his part in disproving those.) The final chapters, ""Emotional Intelligence"" and ""Sentience,"" come to conclusions and ask more questions. I hope both the scientific community and the human culture come around to de Waal's point of view on the subject and start showing more concern for the well-being of animals. I look forward to seeing further advances in this field."
254,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260945-anna,3,"Mama’s Last Hug is an exploration of animal emotion by one of the world’s most recognized and experienced primatologists. While I don’t really consider myself to be an animal (read: pet) person, I started this book in the spirit of being open minded to what the author’s experience and insight could teach me about organisms incorrectly considered to be less sentient or expressive than ourselves. The book is a fitting introduction to the topic and discusses multiple kinds of primates and other species, though perhaps the author’s gentle and common sense approach to his arguments neutralizes some of the impact. In other words, while I will continue to reduce meat consumption and buy sustainable, cruelty-free products where possible, I won’t be immediately be going vegan due to a sudden hyper-empathy with other species. Still, it provides encouragement to empathize with others and promote a kinder world for those organisms with whom we can not yet directly communicate yet share precious resources and experiences.(Physical Distancing Read #6)"
255,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1915261-scott-lupo,5,"A captivating and enthralling book about the emotional lives of animals. Frans de Waal has spent nearly his entire life with chimpanzees and other great apes. His previous works have mostly focused on intelligence. This book is about emotions in animals and whether they exist and if/how they compare to the human experience of emotions. Drawing on his own experience, studies, thoughtful experiments, logic, and philosophy, de Waal brings the reader a comprehensive argument in favor of animals (mostly mammals) having emotions and possibly sentience/consciousness. Several times throughout the book he makes it clear the difference between emotions and feelings. Emotions are displays while feelings are internal. Emotions are the manifestations of feelings. In his view, it would be impossible to know for sure what an animal is feeling but we can measure their emotions and make inferences based on our own experience of those emotions. Behaviorists would balk at the notion of including emotions when studying animals, believing they are basically all automatons that act based on instincts and behavior only. De Waal does an excellent job of disabusing this notion and is persuasive in his argument that being an automaton would keep the animal from adapting to its environment and die. Yet, we know species have existed for millennia. Instead, life can only exist with emotions. It is a natural part of who we and the animal kingdom are; it is hard coded into our existence. So why study animals as if they don't have emotions? Luckily, much of the science is changing and today's scientists are much more open to the concept of animal emotions. Of course, if you are a pet owner you already know this through anecdotal experience. Now science is catching up and solidifying the notion of animal emotions. "
256,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117548223-katrien,4,"Frans de Waal is for sure an extremely enthousiast primatologue - you can almost feel his love and Passion for these close primates of ours; Which makes the book an extremely pleasant and interesting reading. According to Frans de Waal, there would be no reason at all to believe humans emotion are that much greater and richer as the ones of chimpanzees or other animals - an idea still many scientists hold on to. The lives in the animal kingdom would be as complex and thrilling as the lives of any of us. I did not agree with all the points he made - and to my mind his arguments are not always that elaborated.Nevertheless, Mama's Last Hug is a must read for anyone interested in emotions. It gives the reader an insight and an understanding of animal emotions - from jealousy to compassion. I can promise you will not look at your cat ever the same way again."
257,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/746637-sally,4,"An important book, though I got bogged down in the middle and took a long time to finish it, a problem I didn't have with the two earlier books in this ""series."" Perhaps moral behavior/selflessness and intelligence are easier to demonstrate with scientific experiments than are emotions so he felt the need to be especially thorough in his presentation, emotion by emotion. Perhaps this area is one more of his scientific colleagues are unwilling to acknowledge as shared with animals. Perhaps acknowledging that animals experience emotions as humans do would be more likely to force a reexamination of the ways we treat animals that economic players and scientific researchers, among others, would find inconvenient. 3-1/2 stars."
258,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1882501-ginny,5,"As a child, we went to the zoo often. Being one of 7 kids in our family, we could run around and act like monkeys and not get into trouble. From early on, all of us loved going to the ape and chimpanzee house where we were fascinated at how similar they were to us and would stand and watch then forever. This beautiful book explains and confirms that what we thought as children actually is true- animals are more like us than we think. Through extensive research the author tells us that we don’t have a single organ that other animals don’t have and the same is true for emotions. The book begins with the death of Mama, a chimp matriarch who formed a bond with biologist Jan van Hooff. When they meet for the last time it was captured on film. Read this book and google and watch their last hug. Loved them both."

Frans de Waal takes the narrative of themes like morality and instinct and draws very distinct lines yet articulates very straight-forward convergences between man and ape, and even man to other mammals. Whether it's discovering the intricacies of why we shake hands, why we reconcile, why men puff up their chests and even why criminals behave in ways they do, de Waal expertly gives example after example of mammalian instincts that exist in us which we still have ingrained in our psychologies from millennia-old reflexes and mechanisms.

I should have liked this book more than I did - a mix of animal facts, memoir-ish anecdotes from the author's career, and even quite a bit of moral philosophy. These things are all really up my alley but for some reason the writing was hard to get into. I found my brain drifting off fairly often even though the content was quite interesting. I can't put my finger on it. It really felt like a slog to finish. I would possibly try one of De Waal's other books to see if maybe it was just an editing issue, or if that's just his usual writing. When the library opens again, that is."

Here his focus is on primates and provides substantial evidence that they have feelings and emotions akin to our own. A powerful recognition of empathic behavior in many other animals as well. Proving once more that if humans could dial down our ego, we could see the world as ever more fascinating than previously thought."

From why we, humas, wave our hand as a greeting to how animals are actually aware of the future. I took my time reading it enjoying every last page and will definitely go back to re-read.Frans de Waal captures fussy readers. I don't enjoy books that are filled with theory and dry numbers and thankfully this book is not that at all. He shares description of studies and experiments in a very approachable language. He even added his own drawings to make it easier to imagine.The chapter on animal sentinence was the highlight of the book. There is a silence surrounding animal emotions and motivation of animal behavior in the scientific world and the reasons are shocking yet very in line with the nature of humans.5/5, incredible read"

Separating ""emotions"" from ""feelings"", he uses research, observation, and humor to talk about not only animal emotions, but how science has changed over the ears in how it views animals.Essential."

Some of it was over my head and a bit dry but at the same time I think it is very readable for a lay person. There are some really sad and horrific stories so the sensitive reader beware.

The chapter on sentience in particular is eye opening. However, when de Waal ventures into sociology and other fields he is way off the mark. He makes some odd, and frankly, sexist comments about women and treats them as if they are facts rather than opinions. If you can get past this, it's worth a read."

The author delivers a wonderful and convincing document revealing the rich emotional life of animals, especially in the primates he has studied closely for over thirty years. He makes poignantly the point that for too long, it has been declared that animals do not have emotions: they do not experience pain, fear, disgust, joy etc. Now, fortunately, research into the emotions of animals is ongoing and expanding. He gives a voice to animals that makes it extremely difficult for any human to deny that they experience emotions, noting that it may perhaps only be the fact that they cannot speak for themselves that has enabled this denial for so long. Highly recommended. "

I've been around too many animals to not believe that animals think, experience pain, and have emotions. My current dog, Leo is the most empathetic creative I have ever encountered - if I'm sad or upset, he gets right in my face with a look in his face that seems to be asking ""What is wrong? Are you ok, Mom?"" Sure my statement is not scientific but my dog is thinking and responding with emotion to me when he does that. My other dog Annie uses her charms and has a ""smile"" that she uses to get what she wants. Sure it is not a smile in the way a human smiles, but she knows that expression gets her what she wants and she uses it. She also gets scared and hides if there is yelling in the house - she picks up on the tension and wants to get away from it. Annie also plans and thinks ahead to get the things she wants - she has learned from experience she can get what she wants from Leo if she waits for the perfect moment. She watches him from a distance and then swoops in to grab it when he looks away for a moment. She then has her ""hiding spot"" and leaves a bewildered Leo behind. She has perfected this move down to a science so I know she is using past experience to know when to grab and knows the best hiding place in the house to stay out of reach of the humans. Leo is also 11 years old and going blind so he can't really chase her! I could go on for hours about my dogs' thinking, and feelings for a longI think I would have enjoyed being an animal researcher but it wasn't the path I followed. It was fun to read about Frans De Waal's experiences in the lab and zoos around the world. I don't really know much about bonobos but I think they are now my favorite primates - peaceful and social creatures! I like Waal's comment that humans on our bad days are as violent as chimps but on our good days are as nice and sensitive as bonobos. Pretty true!I found the grape and cucumber experiment with capuchin monkey's interesting. They were happy receiving cucumbers and didn't complain until one was given grapes. Suddenly, the other one refused to eat the cucumber which was fine just a minute ago. I see this parallel to humans - we always want what others have and become dissatisfied with what we loved until we saw something else we perceive as better. Also, his comments about working for a social aspect keeps us in check sometimes from climbing ahead too in life - we will ""share"" to keep social peace.Interesting read but only 4 stars because it was ""dry"" at time.

Apparently de Waal's experience observing Bonobo chimps has qualified him to come to the conclusion that Sarah Palin's attractiveness served as a disadvantage to her during the vice presidential campaign, because of the jealousy she would have aroused in women. Moreover, the reason that female heads of state tend to be older is because post-menopausal women are less of a threat to other women. I am not sure how he came to this conclusion (particularly because there is not a single citation for this section), and it also seems to ignore the fact that most male heads of state are also rather old (the two male contenders in this year's presidential election are in their 70s). Surprisingly, the book was published after Jacinda Ardern became Prime Minister of New Zealand, but I imagine including her would not have fit his narrative.Overall, I got the impression that this book should have just been a long read on a news site. The chapters blurred into one, and de Waal grew repetitive. When a non-fiction book becomes meandering, it probably means the author should have made it shorter. And in all honesty, I think reading the blurb of this book is enough."
282,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,5,"This is definitely my current frontrunner for science book of the year and possibly overall book of the year.De Waal gives us a generous mix of true biology-based social psychology and much more, with discussions on things like selfhood veering into philosophy, even.I won't do a long review, with so many others here, but just a summary of his top points:Rejects ethology as being based on old behaviorist black box ideas. Says still too prevalent in America.Differentiates between emotion (more a Humean type “passion” in his view) and feeling, as emotion sieved through filters of consciousness and updated perception.Animal emotions and feelings both largely parallel humans. Can be complex.Animals, on feelings and reactions to them, have self-control like people.Seems to believe in something like what I would call “evolutionary psychology done right,” or “the evolutionary basis of human social psychology,” versus what is called evolutionary psychology and is generally a pseudoscientific pile of crap. At one point, he totally totally skewers Steve Pinker for claiming primitives are warlike and need to learn from moderns, re his book about the decrease of violence. Also says Hobbes et al got it wrong.Related? Notes that “warfare” on anything close to what we know it as today didn’t arise until the beginning of civilization, which of course ties to the beginnings of private property and other things.Also, without being explicit, like me, seems to tie degree of emotional expressiveness ability to degree of intelligence.Rejects much of traditional ideas of ""instinct,"" at least in animals we could call sentient."
283,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7125076-rachel,5,"Amazing book! I very much liked the author's previous book Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? I liked this one even better. It is easier to read and well organized, and it makes his points effectively. The main point is yes, animals do have emotions, which appear in many cases to be similar to ours. He makes a distinction between emotions and feelings; feelings are physical sensations that are associated with emotions. Many animals, especially mammals and birds, but also ones that we think of as lesser, appear to have both. He also gives compelling evidence that animals not only have emotions, they think, plan, have motivations, and weigh choices to make decisions, all in similar ways to humans. We are animals, after all, and closely related to the primates who are prominent in the book. We do great injustices when we assume we are better than, and matter more than, other animals (and other people whom we consider inferior, but I digress).The book is arranged by the type of emotion: happiness, empathy, guilt, the drive to power, etc. Each chapter has observations of animal behavior, and studies, and theories, and history that includes theories that were once established ""wisdom"" but are now disproved. (De Waal has done, and is doing here, his part in disproving those.) The final chapters, ""Emotional Intelligence"" and ""Sentience,"" come to conclusions and ask more questions. I hope both the scientific community and the human culture come around to de Waal's point of view on the subject and start showing more concern for the well-being of animals. I look forward to seeing further advances in this field."
284,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260945-anna,3,"Mama’s Last Hug is an exploration of animal emotion by one of the world’s most recognized and experienced primatologists. While I don’t really consider myself to be an animal (read: pet) person, I started this book in the spirit of being open minded to what the author’s experience and insight could teach me about organisms incorrectly considered to be less sentient or expressive than ourselves. The book is a fitting introduction to the topic and discusses multiple kinds of primates and other species, though perhaps the author’s gentle and common sense approach to his arguments neutralizes some of the impact. In other words, while I will continue to reduce meat consumption and buy sustainable, cruelty-free products where possible, I won’t be immediately be going vegan due to a sudden hyper-empathy with other species. Still, it provides encouragement to empathize with others and promote a kinder world for those organisms with whom we can not yet directly communicate yet share precious resources and experiences.(Physical Distancing Read #6)"
285,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1915261-scott-lupo,5,"A captivating and enthralling book about the emotional lives of animals. Frans de Waal has spent nearly his entire life with chimpanzees and other great apes. His previous works have mostly focused on intelligence. This book is about emotions in animals and whether they exist and if/how they compare to the human experience of emotions. Drawing on his own experience, studies, thoughtful experiments, logic, and philosophy, de Waal brings the reader a comprehensive argument in favor of animals (mostly mammals) having emotions and possibly sentience/consciousness. Several times throughout the book he makes it clear the difference between emotions and feelings. Emotions are displays while feelings are internal. Emotions are the manifestations of feelings. In his view, it would be impossible to know for sure what an animal is feeling but we can measure their emotions and make inferences based on our own experience of those emotions. Behaviorists would balk at the notion of including emotions when studying animals, believing they are basically all automatons that act based on instincts and behavior only. De Waal does an excellent job of disabusing this notion and is persuasive in his argument that being an automaton would keep the animal from adapting to its environment and die. Yet, we know species have existed for millennia. Instead, life can only exist with emotions. It is a natural part of who we and the animal kingdom are; it is hard coded into our existence. So why study animals as if they don't have emotions? Luckily, much of the science is changing and today's scientists are much more open to the concept of animal emotions. Of course, if you are a pet owner you already know this through anecdotal experience. Now science is catching up and solidifying the notion of animal emotions. "
286,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117548223-katrien,4,"Frans de Waal is for sure an extremely enthousiast primatologue - you can almost feel his love and Passion for these close primates of ours; Which makes the book an extremely pleasant and interesting reading. According to Frans de Waal, there would be no reason at all to believe humans emotion are that much greater and richer as the ones of chimpanzees or other animals - an idea still many scientists hold on to. The lives in the animal kingdom would be as complex and thrilling as the lives of any of us. I did not agree with all the points he made - and to my mind his arguments are not always that elaborated.Nevertheless, Mama's Last Hug is a must read for anyone interested in emotions. It gives the reader an insight and an understanding of animal emotions - from jealousy to compassion. I can promise you will not look at your cat ever the same way again."
287,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/746637-sally,4,"An important book, though I got bogged down in the middle and took a long time to finish it, a problem I didn't have with the two earlier books in this ""series."" Perhaps moral behavior/selflessness and intelligence are easier to demonstrate with scientific experiments than are emotions so he felt the need to be especially thorough in his presentation, emotion by emotion. Perhaps this area is one more of his scientific colleagues are unwilling to acknowledge as shared with animals. Perhaps acknowledging that animals experience emotions as humans do would be more likely to force a reexamination of the ways we treat animals that economic players and scientific researchers, among others, would find inconvenient. 3-1/2 stars."
288,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1882501-ginny,5,"As a child, we went to the zoo often. Being one of 7 kids in our family, we could run around and act like monkeys and not get into trouble. From early on, all of us loved going to the ape and chimpanzee house where we were fascinated at how similar they were to us and would stand and watch then forever. This beautiful book explains and confirms that what we thought as children actually is true- animals are more like us than we think. Through extensive research the author tells us that we don’t have a single organ that other animals don’t have and the same is true for emotions. The book begins with the death of Mama, a chimp matriarch who formed a bond with biologist Jan van Hooff. When they meet for the last time it was captured on film. Read this book and google and watch their last hug. Loved them both."
289,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87165204-david-solis,5,"WHAT A READ. I've always been fascinated on the primal instincts that still exist in humans. Frans de Waal takes the narrative of themes like morality and instinct and draws very distinct lines yet articulates very straight-forward convergences between man and ape, and even man to other mammals. Whether it's discovering the intricacies of why we shake hands, why we reconcile, why men puff up their chests and even why criminals behave in ways they do, de Waal expertly gives example after example of mammalian instincts that exist in us which we still have ingrained in our psychologies from millennia-old reflexes and mechanisms. "
290,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63362342-robyn,3,"I am pretty surprised that I'm ending up giving this only a 3 since it has such a high community rating. I should have liked this book more than I did - a mix of animal facts, memoir-ish anecdotes from the author's career, and even quite a bit of moral philosophy. These things are all really up my alley but for some reason the writing was hard to get into. I found my brain drifting off fairly often even though the content was quite interesting. I can't put my finger on it. It really felt like a slog to finish. I would possibly try one of De Waal's other books to see if maybe it was just an editing issue, or if that's just his usual writing. When the library opens again, that is."
291,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2277142-marion,3,"3.5 stars Though very interesting, this is a much dryer read than the more compelling Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? Here his focus is on primates and provides substantial evidence that they have feelings and emotions akin to our own. A powerful recognition of empathic behavior in many other animals as well. Proving once more that if humans could dial down our ego, we could see the world as ever more fascinating than previously thought."
292,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85126900-annette,5,"Without a doubt this book will go as one of my Top 3 on a broad topic of animal welfare. I learnt so much from this book. From why we, humas, wave our hand as a greeting to how animals are actually aware of the future. I took my time reading it enjoying every last page and will definitely go back to re-read.Frans de Waal captures fussy readers. I don't enjoy books that are filled with theory and dry numbers and thankfully this book is not that at all. He shares description of studies and experiments in a very approachable language. He even added his own drawings to make it easier to imagine.The chapter on animal sentinence was the highlight of the book. There is a silence surrounding animal emotions and motivation of animal behavior in the scientific world and the reasons are shocking yet very in line with the nature of humans.5/5, incredible read"
293,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1058994-ryan-mishap,4,"Another excellent outing from de Waal wherein he shows how similar animal emotions are to each other and maybe how humans ain't so special after all. Separating ""emotions"" from ""feelings"", he uses research, observation, and humor to talk about not only animal emotions, but how science has changed over the ears in how it views animals.Essential."
294,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67949523-danielle-enlow,4,"An important read for anyone who doubts that animals have emotions, but a little drawn out. The anecdotes and relative research were endearing, but I was turned off by the oversimplification of human behavior/emotions regarding sex and gender. I found the chapters on discomforts (4) and politics (5) particularly interesting. These chapters saved my review from being only 3 stars."
295,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76466548-daniel-zaltsman,5,"Really enjoyed this read after having a chance to attend a talk by de Waal at Pioneer Works in Brooklyn. This book is a wake up call for anyone who still believes that animals have more differences than similarities with us humans. Chapter by chapter, de Waal dismisses the myths and the set backs that that science community has had in admitting to animal's capacity to emote. "
296,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18280931-cindyslowreader-maskitorcasket,3,"I should know better than to attempt a scientific book like this. Some of it was over my head and a bit dry but at the same time I think it is very readable for a lay person. There are some really sad and horrific stories so the sensitive reader beware. I have always felt that animals have emotions so this was preaching to the choir.What I did not appreciate was the specter of Trump appearing in chapter 5, it's about politics. yuck "
297,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94750490-charlotte,2,"When de Waal sticks to what he knows as a primatologist and psychologist he has some excellent insights on animal emotions and how even today humans try to deny their existence in animals. The chapter on sentience in particular is eye opening. However, when de Waal ventures into sociology and other fields he is way off the mark. He makes some odd, and frankly, sexist comments about women and treats them as if they are facts rather than opinions. If you can get past this, it's worth a read."
298,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3350146-courtney-smith-atkins,4,"The last chapter gets a little wonky but overall, I like the writing style, I like hearing about the anthropological perspective and the work with animals. I watched the youtube video of the actual last hug. It is heart breaking. I don't know if I would have said that if I had not read the book and just watched it. Having read the book, I feel like I think of it a little deeper. "
299,039335783X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29011739-nargiz-ahmadova,5,"A great enlightening book. In spite of the difficulty of academic language it keeps you reading. I recommend it who are interested with topics of consciousness, evolution, what we have in common with animals, what makes emotions universal, does free will exist etc.The author clearly explains every aspects of animal emotions that it definitely changed the way I have been thinking about them.
